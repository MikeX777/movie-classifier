1
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,793
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,509
Hoping to meet with your approval,
Lux film has decided to save you,

3
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,519
just for a change, the boring
reading of the film's credits.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,037
You want to start right away?
No! A brief presentation...

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,119
of the actors is essential.
It's vital! It's necessary.

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,637
This is Totò, in other words, me.

7
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,675
This is the lovely Sonia
played by Yvonne Sanson.

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,635
Here we have Marisa Merlini in
the role of Baroness von Krapfen.

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,275
Alda Mangini, a Brazilian
todo fuego.

10
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,675
Laura Gore playing my wife.

11
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,280
Mario Castellani, my loyal
travelling companion.

12
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,993
Nerio Bernardi, Galeazzo Benti.

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,793
Pina Gallini as my mother-in-law...

14
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,513
...with young Lino Robi,
my brother-in-law.

15
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,314
Stop! If you're interested in the
rest, you can read them at the end.

16
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,796
Oh, how foolish! I was forgetting
the most important thing.

17
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,872
The title of the film. You already
know it? "Emperor of Capri".

18
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,195
Sorry!

19
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,830
The Emperor.

20
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,031
Hail, Tiberius, Emperor of Capri.

21
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,355
Hail.

22
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,672
Welcome to the isle of love.

23
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,712
- Hail, Tiberius, valorous Emperor.
- Hail.

24
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,990
Here are the slaves
for your orgies in Capri.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,709
- What? They're not black?
- Did you want black ones, Emperor?

26
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,797
- Of course. I'm in mourning.
- In mourning, Emperor?

27
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,753
Didn't you know?
I had my wife killed this morning.

28
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,876
From now on, only black slaves.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,833
- What a gentle touch!
- For now, I'll make do with these.

30
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,035
- Where does she come from?
- Greece.

31
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,675
- Ancient?
- Yes, from Ancient Greece.

32
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,553
No, you've misunderstood me.
I said "ancient" because the girl

33
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,718
looks weary to me. I prefer
my women plump and full of life.

34
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,274
Understood? You must eat more,
my girl.

35
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,712
- Where does she come from?
- She's Helen's sister.

36
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,270
- Who is this Helen?
- Helen of Troy.

37
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:40,110
Troy? Troy?
That name sounds familiar.

38
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,790
I knew it! Auf Wiedersehen.

39
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,794
These two look alike.
Who are they?

40
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,072
They're twins. They come from
Siam. They're Siamese

41
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,396
Siamese?

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,753
If they're Siamese,
something's not quite right.

43
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,873
How silly I am! Excuse me.

44
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,832
- What are you doing?
- I'm joining them.

45
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,037
And this girl here... who is she?

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,310
- This is the Slav.
- The Slav?

47
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,798
By Jove... and by Jupiter.
What's your name,

48
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,551
little girl?

49
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,511
- Sonia.
- Sonia?

50
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,472
- I'm the girl of your dreams,
- And she... Sure!

51
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,559
Come with me.
I'll show you the splendors

52
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,990
of this enchanting island,
the isle of dreams, Capri.

53
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,112
Leave me alone with her.
Out of here, all of you!

54
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,879
Come with me.
I'll show her around.

55
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,275
You see, Sonia? We're in Capri.
The isle of dreams and love.

56
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:08,348
See that down there? The Fariglioni
On that side is the Blue Grotto.

57
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,756
And there's no one around.

58
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,234
You've taken the words
out of my mouth.

59
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,635
Kiss me!

60
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,397
How lovely it is here!

61
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,318
Listen, Tiberius, can't you feel
something?

62
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,999
Yes, I can. A mosquito.
Now it's gone.

63
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,631
No, Tiberius. Listen to
the sirens' voices.

64
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,990
- I am listening to them, but...
- Listen to the sirens' voices.

65
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,076
- I can hear them, but...
- Listen to the sirens.

66
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,358
- I can hear them, but...
- Can't you hear the sirens?

67
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,352
- Yes, I can but I'd like to...
- Can't you hear the sirens?

68
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,153
- Yes, I can but I'd like to...
- It's 8 o'clock.

69
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,715
- Can't you hear the sirens?
- Yes, but let me give you a hug.

70
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:51,197
Let me embrace you.
Let me kiss you, you temptress!

71
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,994
What are you saying? What's gotten
into you? It's 8 o' clock.

72
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,154
- What time is it?
- 8 o'clock.

73
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,270
What a disappointment!

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,195
I dreamt I was in Capri.

75
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,754
- You're depraved.
- Why? What have I done?

76
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,514
Mom, don't keep picking on Antonio.

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,073
- He dreamt Capri. The Underworld!
- It's no Underworld. It's Paradise!

78
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,671
The paradise of the depraved,
of rakes, of sinners like you.

79
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,555
- Get up and go to Confession.
- I haven't committed any sins.

80
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,795
You had a lustful dream.
You ate meat on a Friday.

81
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,149
- That's not true.
- You were seen.

82
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,312
You were in a café
eating a ham sandwich.

83
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,352
- Then you had me followed.
- No one followed you.

84
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,073
- Word got back to us. Get up!
- No.

85
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,469
- Get up!
- No!

86
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,318
I'm telling you nicely. Get up.

87
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,196
All right. Using a nice manner,
one can get one's own way.

88
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,879
I'm getting up.

89
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,593
- He went to bed dressed again.
- Shame on you!

90
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,631
Time is money. What's the point...

91
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,989
...of undressing at night if you
have to dress again in the morning?

92
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,998
Come on, Lucia. This sinner's
presence saddens me.

93
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,031
Imagine how much yours
cheers me up.

94
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,198
- Hi, brother-in-law!
- Hello, mini-brother-in-law.

95
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,591
Was the ham sandwich tasty?

96
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,598
- So it was you! You rotten kid!
- Stop it, Antonio!

97
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,995
I didn't even touch him, I swear.

98
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,993
You rascal! I'll wait for you
and give you a swollen face.

99
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,911
- Stupid...
- Stop picking on this innocent boy.

100
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,556
- Innocent? Innocent? He's a spy.
- I'm not a spy.

101
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,678
- I'm watching over your soul.
- Basilio is right.

102
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,473
- Your soul is in danger.
- It isn't my soul that's in danger.

103
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,273
It's my milk. Is that clear?

104
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,118
Can we never have a moment's
peace in this house?

105
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,754
It's all your fault for having
married a waiter.

106
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,749
Even if I'm a waiter, I feel more
a gentleman than those I wait on.

107
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,993
- Goodbye.
- Don't take offense, Antonio.

108
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,869
- Bye.
- Mom! Mom! Antonio kissed Lucia.

109
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,436
- Can't I kiss my wife?
- No, because she's doing a penance.

110
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,716
A penance? What penance?

111
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,876
Do you remember when Basilio
fell ill?

112
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,876
I do! And he didn't die.

113
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,753
So he'd get better, I swore not
to kiss you for a month.

114
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,109
Really? Really?

115
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,753
It's all your fault.
Very well, I'll go to Confession.

116
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,993
I'll admit everything.
That I ate ham on a Friday,

117
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,032
that I dreamt of Capri,
that I kissed my wife...

118
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,878
...and also that I threw jam in
my brother-in-law's face.

119
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,435
- When?
- Now!

120
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,151
Mom!!

121
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,271
Sonia?

122
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,311
We're finally going to
strike it rich.

123
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,519
I'm fed up of your follies.

124
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,879
- I'm tired of keeping you.
- Don't say such silly things.

125
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,473
I've set up the biggest deal
of your life.

126
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,519
The Bey Kahn of Agapur
will be here shortly.

127
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,358
He's an Indian prince and
the richest man in the world.

128
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,392
Imagine, each year he receives
his own weight in diamonds.

129
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,874
- I don't know him
- But he knows you.

130
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,755
He met you at the Rowing Club ball.
He has fallen in love with you.

131
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,749
Besides, honey, you won't have
to marry him.

132
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,190
A very brief engagement will do.
You break it off...

133
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,756
...and he'll pay you damages. Then
we'll leave for the French Riviera.

134
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,716
- I assure you that this time...
- There won't be a this time!

135
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,799
Listen to her!
You're not a material girl.

136
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,674
Do you want to become rich or not?

137
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,870
No, I don't.

138
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,471
- Look at me, doll.
- I don't want to look at you.

139
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,557
Look at me, I tell you!
- No!

140
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,836
Like that! There we are!

141
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,999
Now, you'll obey me.

142
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,279
Listen! A dark-haired, fascinating,
thin young man will arrive shortly.

143
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,190
He'll be wearing
a large amethyst ring.

144
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:47,554
Thin, dark-haired... Amethyst.

145
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,512
You'll tell him you've always
wanted to me him,

146
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,154
despite the great distance
keeping you apart.

147
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,193
You'll say to him: Kiss me
with your burning lips.

148
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,995
Kiss me with your burning lips.

149
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,792
You'll invite him to Capri
telling him...

150
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,992
Come in. To be or not to be,
that is the question.

151
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,634
Are you sure this is that's
the question?

152
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,672
- It is, according to Shakespeare.
- I think the burning question is

153
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,759
how you'll pay your bill, otherwise
the hotel will throw you out.

154
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,634
That's true. And to think that if
I didn't have a lisp, I'd be...

155
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,433
- the greatest actor of the century.
- What do you have?

156
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,436
- A lisp.
- What's a lisp?

157
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,436
- I can't pronounce "S" properly.

158
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,552
In theatrical circles,
it's a real problem.

159
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,070
And with this lisp,
you're an actor?

160
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,076
- Change jobs! Take my advice.
- You may well joke!

161
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,998
I'm a very classy actor.

162
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,875
Look, this is my wardrobe.

163
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,198
I'm unemployed right now so
I'll have to sell these suits...

164
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,674
...or rent them to a novice actor
with no decent clothes.

165
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,995
- And no lisp!
- Right!

166
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,709
- There's more. Look at my shoes.
- My goodness! What a lot...

167
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,594
...you've had thrown at you!
- Don't make fun of me.

168
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,232
- I've everything... even these.
- Jewels!

169
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:30,035
You've a real treasure chest!
And you say you're penniless!

170
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,515
How lovely! Very classy!

171
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,356
- I wonder how much it's worth?
- It's worth 10 liras.

172
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,311
I wear in "The Cardinal" when
I say: "An anathema be on you!"

173
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,271
On me? What have I done to you?

174
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,279
It's a line spoken by the cardinal.
I say it waving my hand about.

175
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,194
You should see how it shines.
It looks real, doesn't it?

176
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,276
Yes, it does,

177
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,993
- Well, I'll be off, now.
- What about the ring?

178
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,799
- I'll keep it as a tip.
- Very well.

179
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,308
- Without a lisp.

180
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,154
Someone's knocked.
Go and let them in.

181
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,596
Come in!

182
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,238
Dark-haired, fascinating,

183
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,159
with an amethyst ring. It's him!

184
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,195
- I love you.
- Me?

185
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:20,554
I've always dreamt of being yours,
despite the distance between us.

186
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,390
Madam, if it's a question of
distance, I can shorten it.

187
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,232
- I love and desire you.
- Do you think I don't?

188
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,637
Kiss me with your burning lips.

189
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,839
- Aren't you going to kiss me?
- But of course.

190
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,713
Every client's wish is an order.
May I?

191
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,557
- Are you satisfied, Madam?
- Your kisses excite me.

192
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,114
- I know! I know!
- I want you!

193
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,835
- Don't be shy. Help yourself.
- No! Not here.

194
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,758
- Let's go into the bedroom.
- No, not here. In Capri.

195
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,155
- I can't do it here.
- Capri?

196
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,557
Yes, Capri.
It's the only place I can forget

197
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,798
what you are and what you do.
There, you can be truly mine.

198
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,795
Excuse me, but is this trip
to Capri really necessary?

199
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,037
- It is.
- Lf it's necessary, so be it.

200
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,991
- Will you come?
- Of course!

201
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,999
Thank you! See you this evening
in Capri, at the hotel Quisisana.

202
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,838
- Quisisana.
- Get ready and leave immediately.

203
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,989
- But I'd like to...
- Go!

204
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,749
Your Excellency, what's happened?

205
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,594
What kind of a hotel is this?
This is a disgrace!

206
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,599
What have you done now,
you troublemaker? You're fired.

207
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:50,356
The timing of this dismissal
is perfect.

208
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,991
- Hello?
- Who's speaking?

209
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,998
- It's me, Antonio.
- Did you go to Confession?

210
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,113
Yes, I went to Confession.
I must say 3 Our Fathers,

211
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,000
2 Hail Marys and 4 De Profundis,
but only 2 out loud.

212
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,993
- Go and call your sister.
- What do you want from her?

213
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,476
- I have to tell her I'm leaving.
- You are? Where are you going?

214
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:26,117
To Salerno. What's it to you?

215
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,118
What are you going to do
in Salerno?

216
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,711
I'm going to replace a colleague
of mine who's dying.

217
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,228
- It's not true. It's a lie.
- Go to hell!

218
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:40,637
You'll go to hell. I'll go
to heaven and from up there...

219
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,989
...I'll spit on your head.

220
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,157
Really? Really? In that case,

221
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,998
- I've something to say to you.
- What?

222
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,270
- Listen!

223
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,589
You'll pay for this. And woe betide
you if you've told a lie.

224
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,553
- Mom, I'm going out for a moment.
- Run along, honey.

225
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,475
My clothes being worn by a waiter!
To what depths have I sunk!

226
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,993
Don't cross your legs.
You'll make the knees go baggy.

227
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,634
- You need to calm down.
- What are you doing?

228
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,399
Don't blow your nose on the
handkerchief given me by Benassi.

229
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,352
Did I or did I not pay
your hotel tab in exchange...

230
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,550
...for the loan of these clothes?
- Meaning?

231
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,593
You must get out, understood?
I'll see you when I get back.

232
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,070
Who'd look after my clothes?
I'm coming to Capri with you.

233
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,998
- You're a fool.
- I'm no fool.

234
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,595
- Of one of us is a fool, it's you.
- Me?

235
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,710
- Yes.
- Why?

236
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,514
You'll be paying our expenses
in Capri with your severance pay.

237
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,991
Mamma! Lucia! If you knew
where Antonio has gone!

238
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,190
What's Antonio up to now?
Where's he gone?

239
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,435
Guess where he's gone.

240
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,311
- Where?
- To Capri.

241
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,278
- Is this the one for Capri?
- Yes, it's going to Capri.

242
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,990
- You can't go on board.
- Why?

243
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,076
- Because there's a strike.
- A strike?

244
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,590
I'm not on strike. I'm in the
free workers' union. Excuse me.

245
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,031
No way! No one's leaving till
the strike ends, is that clear?

246
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,834
What a nuisance!
Who prompted this strike?

247
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,631
- Scab!
- You're calling me a scab? Bully!

248
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,148
There's nothing we can do, Antonio.
Stay calm! Desist!

249
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,077
I won't stay calm. I insist!

250
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,634
I forbid you to fight.
You're wearing my clothes.

251
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,871
What a hunk of a man!

252
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,197
- Let's go, Antonio.
- I didn't hit him. I felt sorry.

253
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,279
You rude oaf! You caveman!
Is that how you boost tourism?

254
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,472
Poor me! What a nuisance
that strike is!

255
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,151
I must be in Capri this evening
even if I have to swim there.

256
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,395
- I won't allow you to swim there.
- Why not?

257
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,795
You'll get my clothes wet.

258
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,310
Where are you going?

259
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,116
- Look at the sign.
- What about it?

260
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,879
- Supposing we rented a motorboat?
- Do as you wish.

261
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,831
- You're paying.
- Let's take this one.

262
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,634
You're nuts! Let's take this one.
Look! It's more chic.

263
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,075
It's classier.
That one's shabby.

264
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,078
- Is it third class?
- Can't you see it's all dirty?

265
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,270
This one's nicer and more elegant.

266
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,153
The other one's shabby.
It's falling to pieces.

267
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,668
- Let's take this one. Anyway...
- I'm paying.

268
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,197
There's no one here.
Sailor? Boatswain?

269
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,595
Sound the horn.
Someone will come.

270
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,079
Oh, Lord! I've switched it on!

271
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,550
- Stop it!
- How? It's moving on its own.

272
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,672
- Pull the other one.
- Call the firefighters!

273
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,711
- Isn't that...
- That's our motorboat!

274
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,672
- Call them back!
- Stop them! Stop them!

275
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,514
Find another launch! Hurry!

276
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,512
- There they are!
- It's scandalous!

277
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,239
The Divine Omir!
They've stolen the Divine Omir.

278
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,636
- What, Your Excellency?
- The sacred snake of the Ganges.

279
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,553
Get rid of this noise.
It's deafening.

280
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,591
It won't stop.

281
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,995
- This is a hard boat to steer.
- Slow down!

282
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,838
Believe me! I'm a cyclist.

283
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,513
Help! Every man for himself!

284
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,599
- Ouch!
- What a mess!

285
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,156
My head! Why are you brushing?
Can't you see I hurt myself?

286
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,194
Ah! Land ahead!

287
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,629
Good Lord! We're in America!

288
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,036
- America my eye!
- Aren't they the Canary Islands?

289
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,355
That's Capri, the isle of dreams.

290
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,393
Capri? The isle of dreams?
Sonia! Sonia!

291
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,320
Sonia, I'll be seeing you soon,
my love.

292
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,993
- How will we land?
- Stay calm! Don't worry!

293
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,429
- Didn't I tell you I'm a cyclist?
- Yes, you did.

294
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,839
- Sonia! Capri!
- Who is that madman?

295
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,037
He must be the Bey Kahn of
Agapur. That's his motorboat.

296
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,550
I can't stop it. Let's go around
the island. The fuel'll run out.

297
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,350
Sound the horn!

298
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,995
Have we gotten through?

299
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,033
- Are we in heaven or hell?
- Neither! We're in the Small Bay.

300
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,117
It's amazing how some people
drive, Emanuela, but that's Bubi.

301
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,993
No, it's Dodo with Pupetto.

302
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,155
He's wearing a turban.
It's the Bey Kahn of Agapur.

303
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,636
The richest man in the world
is arriving. My heart is aflutter!

304
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,909
- What a fascinating man!
- He's waving to us.

305
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,997
- Hello!
- Out of the way! Out of the way!

306
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,553
Move over! Go to the right!

307
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,830
- I think he's calling us. Let's go.
- Yes.

308
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,230
Help!

309
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,153
Hurry! I'm going to drown.

310
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,358
At last! A bit of quiet!

311
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,109
- Fine but what'll we do now?
- We'll find something, you'll see.

312
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,991
- Easier said than done!

313
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,269
Is there no one here?
Is it a desert island?

314
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:37,636
Anyone around?
Island dwellers! Inhabitants!

315
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,990
Locals!

316
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,958
Come on! Spill the beans!

317
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,679
We are expecting him, but so far
he hasn't arrived.

318
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,274
- Porter. Hs the Bey arrived?
- No!

319
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,392
He's such a strange man.
I wonder where he's gotten to?

320
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,639
Let's stop here. We must find

321
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,194
- someone who'll go get our baggage.
- OK, let's stop here.

322
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,758
- I have something to tell you.
- What is it?

323
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,311
This will be my first affair
with a classy dame.

324
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,352
- What's the problem?
- I don't know how to behave.

325
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,391
- It's obvious.

326
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,991
- What?
- It's obvious.

327
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,793
- No, no, it's a woman.
- It's just an expression.

328
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,071
She may well be just a woman,
but she's a woman. What a dame!

329
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,997
- She's a Slave, isn't she?
- Yes.

330
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:50,511
They're women to be treated with
a whip in one hand...

331
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,995
...and a rose in the other.

332
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,190
With both hands occupied,
how will I manage?

333
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,631
I mean you must be brutal
and romantic at the same time.

334
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,871
Like this. Look!

335
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,677
I'm you, you're her. Got it?

336
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,757
- Yes.
- I, as you, am arriving.

337
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,075
You, as her, are waiting.

338
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,554
- Like this?
- Perfect! I arrive.

339
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,634
Oh, my dear!

340
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,597
- I'd been waiting for you so long.
- Lf only you knew how many hours...

341
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,832
...I'd been waiting for you.
- I get it.

342
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,389
Now, let's start the scene over,
but you're you and I'm her.

343
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,670
- I'm you and you're her?
- No, you're you.

344
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,393
- I'm me.
- I'm her.

345
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:42,039
- Is that you, honey?
- Oh, you're here, at last!

346
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,389
If you knew how much
I've dreamt of you!

347
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,396
Why are you lisping?

348
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,274
- You told me to talk like you.
- You have to talk normally.

349
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,358
- But you have a lisp.
- So what? I do but you don't.

350
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,550
- Speak normally.
- What do I do now?

351
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:01,152
Now, you kiss me on my neck,
on my lips, on my tapered hands.

352
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,751
- Wherever you like, darling.
- Cut it out! Shame on you!

353
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,678
You've misunderstood. You're not
kissing me, you're kissing her.

354
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,269
- Earlier, you said I was her.
- Yes, earlier. But now I'm her.

355
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,436
- So, who am I?
- You're the devil.

356
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,313
- What?
- I recognized you from your...

357
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,999
slothful ways. You're the devil.
You have a tail.

358
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,235
No, I don't.

359
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,714
- I can't see one. Can you?
- No. Who is this man?

360
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,957
He must be the Count of Monte
Cristo. What do I know? Let's go.

361
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,560
No! Only over my dead body.

362
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,795
No, my friend. It'd smell too much.
Out of the way!

363
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:37,197
No, you'll never reach Capri,
the modern-day Sodom and Gomorrah.

364
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,073
- Who is he?
- A madman. Comply with his wishes.

365
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,236
- One must do that with mad people.
- You're right.

366
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,352
The time has come.

367
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,756
- Yes, sir. The time has come.
- You sinners, repent!

368
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,633
Repent Bey Kahn of Agapur.

369
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,478
- Yes, sir. What's the time?
- It must be one o'clock.

370
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:58,035
At 2.30 I'll go and repent.
Don't worry, Count, I'll repent.

371
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,311
- My greetings to the island.
- The Day of Judgment is at hand!

372
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,518
- Sinners!
- Maestro, may I take your photo?

373
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,233
Certainly. Like this?

374
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,275
- Thank you, Maestro.
- You, prince of rakes,

375
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,437
will pay for your sins
burning in hell.

376
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,870
- Who is this madman?
- He thinks he's the prophet...

377
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,070
...Jeremiah. He says he was born
3,000 years ago.

378
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,759
He looks good for a 3,000 year old.
May I?

379
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,919
- Shall we take a photo, Grandpa?
- Yes. Like this?

380
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,438
No, take a step back.

381
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,793
Another step. One more.

382
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,309
(GEREMIA URLA)

383
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,991
What have you done?

384
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,270
He said he's 3,000 years old.
He needed a bath.

385
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,392
Help! Come and save me!

386
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,995
There he is! It's him.

387
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,999
- Welcome, Your Excellency.
- We were expecting you.

388
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,153
Excuse me, Your Excellency, I'm
the manager of the hotel.

389
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,196
- What language is he speaking?
- The Capri dialect. Can't you tell?

390
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,312
You're very witty. I didn't know
your Italian was so good.

391
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,591
You know how it is. I get by.

392
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,153
- This way, Your Highness.
- Thank you.

393
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,395
- Give the porter a tip.
- Right!

394
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,990
- Here, my good man. Take this.
- Thank you, Your Excellency.

395
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,871
You're welcome.
Let's go.

396
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,196
Did you see that? He gave him
a diamond as big as a walnut.

397
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,755
- Welcome to our hotel.
- Thank you. I'm welcome.

398
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:40,431
I'd like a room for myself and
Asdrubale, my secretary.

399
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,630
Certainly, sir.
The royal suite is available.

400
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,148
- Oh! Not doing much business, eh?
- Excuse me?

401
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,430
Don't worry. I understood.
They're in crisis.

402
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,995
- Just a room.
- Just a room?

403
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:53,555
- Maybe wants to remain incognito.
- Would you please sign in?

404
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,679
Antonio De Fazio. Fine!
Welcome, Mr. De Fazio.

405
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,030
Accompany to room 62
Mr. Antonio De Fazio.

406
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,753
Listen, Mr. De Fazio, I mean
Mr. Whatever,

407
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,635
has Miss Sonia Bulgarov arrived?

408
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,872
Yes, sir, and she's awaiting you.

409
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,560
- She's awaiting me?
- In the room next to yours.

410
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,479
- Really? She's upstairs?
- Lf you'd care to go on up, sir.

411
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,670
Thank you. Goodbye.

412
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,473
- Mr. De Fazio.
- Mr De Fazio.

413
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,353
- Mr. De Fazio.
- Mr De Fazio.

414
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,716
Mr. De Fazio.

415
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,834
- There's a snake inside!
- How cute!

416
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,440
- I wonder what its name is?
- Close that case immediately!

417
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,514
Listen, can you see the bump?

418
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,150
No, you can't see anything.

419
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,994
Come in.

420
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,870
- Where are you going?
- To her.

421
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,070
- Like that?
- You're right! How silly of me!

422
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,793
Bring me a suit immediately.
I'm burning with desire.

423
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,991
I can already feel the Capri air.
Capri!

424
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,229
- He's here.
- Who?

425
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,477
The man I love.
The Bey Kahn of Agapur.

426
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,471
Let me see.

427
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,556
- The man opposite?
- Yes, that's him.

428
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,718
What have you been up to?
I know the Bey. That's not him.

429
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,194
But he's the one who came into
my room that day.

430
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,999
- He's the one I was awaiting.
- You wretch!

431
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,315
Enough! Look at me.

432
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,997
Remember the tactics to use
with this kind of woman.

433
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,235
- Leave it up to me.
- A rose in one hand,

434
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,431
- a whip in the other.
- In which hand the whip?

435
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,631
It doesn't matter.
- Left or right,

436
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,911
- it's all the same.
- Really? The rose and the whip.

437
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,952
As soon as he comes in,
you'll kick him out like a dog.

438
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,629
Got that?
Like this! Like this! Like this!

439
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,717
Stand up.

440
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,994
I'll kick him out like a dog.

441
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,279
Now, don't forget, the rose in one
hand and the whip in the other.

442
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,911
Leave it to me.

443
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,111
Come in.

444
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,038
No! What are you doing?

445
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,240
Help! Someone, help!

446
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,835
I don't understand.

447
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:14,231
Didn't you go in with the whip in
one hand and the rose in the other?

448
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:19,400
Yes, but the problem is that
she had a whip too.

449
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,910
Ouch! Ouch!

450
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,868
But you told me she was
wild about you.

451
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,798
She's wild alright,
like a wild animal.

452
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,477
Ouch! A wild animal!
A fury!

453
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,994
- Is this your first trip to Capri?
- Why do you ask?

454
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,759
You've already come down with
blue fever.

455
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,268
Blue fever? Is there an epidemic?
I'll have to get vaccinated.

456
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,993
No! "Blue fever", Capri air,

457
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,235
is also called "Capri folly".

458
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,716
It's an illusion. The senses get
over-stimulated by air and the sun.

459
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:56,317
For example, it make you see Sonia
with a whip in her hand.

460
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,477
It made me see?
It made me feel.

461
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,990
It doesn't matter. Take a shower,
refresh your brain...

462
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,996
...and it'll pass.
- Really?

463
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,679
- Then give me some almond soap.
- What'll you do with it?

464
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,995
- You just need to freshen up.
- Seeing that I'm going to wash...

465
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,191
I usually take a bath at Easter,

466
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,273
but as I said, seeing that
I'm going to wash...

467
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,637
- Where's the soap?
- In the crocodile case.

468
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:32,278
Just a thought! Listen Asdrubale,
I could just take a foot bath.

469
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:36,189
- Do as you please.
- Very well. I shall.

470
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:40,869
- There's no soap in here.
- Here's the soap.

471
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,036
Which case did you open?

472
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,593
Blue fever. I wonder!

473
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,513
How beautiful and poetic everything
is here, Antonio.

474
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:01,077
If I had to choose a place to die,
I'd choose this island.

475
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,438
Then hurry up so you can leave
me your clothes.

476
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,552
You hurry up and refresh
your brain.

477
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:13,111
That woman really did have a whip.

478
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,517
Is there no water?

479
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,515
It's a snake! Help!

480
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,279
There's a snake in there.
It's disgusting.

481
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,197
A snake?
Don't talk nonsense.

482
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,391
No, really! I saw it. I touched it.
I picked it up. It was slimy.

483
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,159
There's no snake! It must have
been the shower hose.

484
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,997
- It wasn't the shower hose.
- You have blue fever!

485
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,191
- No, I touched it.
- There's no snake in there.

486
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,993
Of course. I threw it over there.

487
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,715
How disgusting!

488
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,393
There's nothing here either.
Take my word for it.

489
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,829
- It was there earlier.
- Listen, do you want my advice?

490
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,155
Order a cognac and one for me too.

491
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,589
- Will it do me good?
- Most certainly.

492
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,108
Do I need it? What a fright!

493
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:06,079
Hello? Hello? Operator?

494
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,668
The snake! The snake was there!

495
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,356
- What's the matter?
- The snake was on the telephone,

496
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,472
- Blue fever.
- I threw it out the window.

497
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,991
Come and see.
There it is. Look at it.

498
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:28,470
I don't see it. If you'd thrown it
down, it would be there.

499
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,593
- But I did throw it down there.
- Let's go out for a nice walks.

500
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,797
- Give me 300 lire.
- Do they charge for taking a walk?

501
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,990
No, but for cigarettes they do.

502
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,039
We'll meet up at the small marina.

503
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,868
- Do you keep your money in a hat?
- Well, I'm a man of the world.

504
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,231
- I was in the army at Cuneo.
- What odd ideas you have!

505
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,994
- Good morning.
- Have a nice day, Mr. De Fazio.

506
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,994
Good morning, Mr. De Fazio.

507
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,195
Hello! What's it called?

508
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,117
- What?
- What you have on your head.

509
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,991
- This?
- Yes.

510
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,996
- It's a Borsellino.
- Very funny!

511
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,235
I see you're quick-witted.
My congratulations.

512
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,989
Stop playing the wiseacre and
go and take your hen for a walk.

513
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,589
One wisecrack after another!
I'm Dodo della Baggina,

514
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,313
the snob of Capri
and, naturally, Anacapri.

515
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:06,116
How do you do? Antonio De Fazio,
son of Pietro. Christian Democrat.

516
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,914
No good trying to act tough.
Class will out, Mr. De Fazio.

517
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,996
Mr. De Fazio?

518
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,676
Mr. De Fazio?

519
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:01,430
- It's a lovely spot, isn't it?
- Yes, but it's full of ma people.

520
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,870
Imagine, just now I met a man
carrying a hen under his arm.

521
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,113
It's as if I were to carry a snake
on my head.

522
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,469
- Guys! Listen up! Guys!

523
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,713
- What's up, Dodo?
- Just look at him!

524
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,796
- Who?
- The Bey, alias De Fazio.

525
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,718
I met him just now with a snake
wound around his hat.

526
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,149
- Could it be poisonous?
- No, it's tame...

527
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,475
...and wiggles its tail.
- Divine!

528
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,750
As soon as he arrived,
he started a new fashion.

529
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,997
Antonio, you must get rid
of that snake.

530
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,508
- I'd already forgotten about it.
- You still have it on your noggin.

531
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,279
- I assure you I've gotten over it.
- Take off your hat.

532
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,711
- Blue fever!
- Take off your hat!

533
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,752
Go and take a shower.
Better still, have a cognac.

534
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,995
- Take off your hat.
- What's the problem?

535
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,793
The snake! Help!

536
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,159
- Your money's in the hat.
- My money? St. Gennaro!

537
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,157
What's he doing?

538
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,319
What fun swimming with
your clothes on!

539
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:11,879
Help! Help! I can't swim!
Aiutami!

540
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,552
- Shall we copy them?
- It's the latest fad!

541
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,875
I must tell the baroness about it.

542
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,435
- Come on, guys!
- Hurry and get dressed!

543
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,839
- Did you see that, Baroness?
- What?

544
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,758
Look! The Bey is swimming with
his clothes on.

545
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,195
Look at the Bey!

546
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,273
Carramba! How I like that Asian!

547
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,160
Wait for me!

548
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,115
Hurry! My handbag!

549
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:24,434
I like that Asian. He has such
a strong sense of the macabre.

550
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,829
It puts everything else
in the shade.

551
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,039
I want him tonight. I'll make
a sacrifice on the altar of love.

552
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,594
Are you coming, Bubi?
We can't be left out.

553
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,717
- Just a moment.
- The Baroness is expecting us.

554
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,990
I'm nearly ready.
I'll be out in a minute.

555
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,076
She's one of the most beautiful
women in Capri.

556
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,680
She's a little eccentric
but beautiful.

557
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,309
It'll be a memorable evening.

558
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,351
Here I am!

559
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,759
Why are you dressed like that?
What on earth are you wearing?

560
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:10,989
- What's that thing on your head?
- I'm dressed Capri-style,

561
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,077
like all the carefree young men.

562
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,399
Don't tell me you're coming
dressed like that.

563
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,716
- You'll show me up.
- I can't dress up like that.

564
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,672
- I'm a serious actor.
- That's why you're flat broke.

565
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:30,635
Nowadays, to leave your mark,
you have to be eccentric, futile.

566
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,875
- You must "futilize" yourself.
- I can't.

567
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,309
- Take my advice. Futilize yourself.
- I can't.

568
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,193
I'll "futilize" you.
Come on! Let yourself be futilized.

569
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,630
Stop! This must be the place.

570
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:50,192
- But this is the cemetery.
- No, this is her house.

571
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,073
- Are you sure? Go on ahead.
- Why?

572
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:59,275
- I'm scared.
- Scared of what, silly?

573
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,315
Did you hear that?
The toll of the death knell.

574
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,191
Look!

575
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,800
They've opened the door.
Go on! Enter!

576
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,479
- Come in with me.
- All right.

577
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,678
- Come in with me.
- I'm right behind you.

578
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,636
I told you we'd come to the wrong
place. This is a family tomb.

579
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,752
- No it's not.
- Help! Oh, Lord, what a fright!

580
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:34,837
This is Baroness von Krapfen's
villa.

581
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,599
- Sure it is! Who are you?
- I'm the butler.

582
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:41,189
- I took you for a ghost.
- May I? Your cap.

583
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,197
- Your bag.
- My bag? Here!

584
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:51,996
- It's a little dark here, isn't it?
- You want more light? Right away.

585
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,990
I've an idea. Let's leave now.
We'll come back tomorrow.

586
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,713
- Right! Tomorrow!
- No, gentlemen, you can't.

587
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,354
The Baroness is expecting you now.

588
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,197
- Yes, sir.
- Unfortunately.

589
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,879
Unfortunately.

590
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,557
After you.

591
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,640
- He's left us alone.
- Darn it!

592
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,989
- He's closed us in.
- We're buried alive.

593
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:38,596
Do you remember how he opened the
door? Let's try the same method.

594
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,518
Help!
That skull is looking at me.

595
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:47,553
- Oh, Lord! It scares me.
- Proceed without fear.

596
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,834
Death is sweet and the hereafter
is lovely. Proceed!

597
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,997
Did you hear that?
He told us to proceed.

598
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,395
- Shall we?
- They say never contract spirits.

599
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,590
- Never!
- Let's proceed.

600
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,231
Stay there!

601
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:14,277
Down there! Look! We're free!

602
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,353
That was a tomb,
this is a mortuary.

603
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,193
Look! The door's closing!

604
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,399
- We're closed in again.
- Let's try that one.

605
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,270
There's another one.

606
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,279
Who's this? Salome.

607
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,992
She moves!

608
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:01,000
Welcome to the villa of
the death of love.

609
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,793
- Good morning, madam.
- I designed and built it myself.

610
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,834
My condolences, I mean
congratulations.

611
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:13,156
- Do you like it?
- Quite a lot.

612
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,272
It's cheerful, but it's also
a little out of the way.

613
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,880
Right! It's the last house
in Capri.

614
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:23,072
I chose it on purpose. I wanted it
to be a last resting place.

615
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,389
Why didn't you come alone?

616
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,556
He asked me to come with him.

617
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:32,434
As it's a last resting place,
one must be accompanied.

618
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,597
But I see I'm no longer needed
so I'll be off.

619
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,995
- Thank you.
- Don't leave me here alone.

620
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,389
Remember me in your prayers.

621
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,234
- Make yourself comfortable.
- Where? In the cemetery?

622
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:47,431
- No! There.
- I see. Thank you.

623
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,274
I see you like my dinner set.

624
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,550
It would be suitable for
after a funeral.

625
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,797
At all times, even those devoted
to pleasure,

626
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,832
I like to remember that death
is always present.

627
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,709
It's the only way for me
to understand and enjoy life.

628
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,558
Is he a waiter or an X-ray of one?

629
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,989
- Dinner is served, sir.
- It's just one course...

630
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,679
...which I prepared personally.
I hope you like it.

631
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,910
What is it, a boiled corpse?

632
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,713
Roast owl with a side dish of
cypress berries.

633
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:38,389
No thanks! I don't want to eat owl.
I really don't fancy it.

634
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,874
I suggest we move over to
the other side.

635
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:43,718
With pleasure! Come over there.

636
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:54,513
- Do come in, dear.
- It's more cheerful in here.

637
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,790
It's like a young girl's funeral.

638
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,990
- We'll love each other here.
- Really?

639
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,508
We'll love each other to death
and beyond.

640
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,755
- Let's not overdo it!
- I'm leaving.

641
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,712
- Where are you going?
- To prepare for the sacrifice.

642
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,830
The sacrifice will be all mine.

643
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,838
In there you'll find everything you
need for the night.

644
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,196
Pray for us.

645
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,992
Oh, Lord! The good death!

646
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,833
That woman will never be yours.

647
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,474
- That woman is mine. I love her.
- Help!

648
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,671
My condolences, I mean
congratulations.

649
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:08,393
- Leave!
- How do I get out?

650
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,476
- Through the window.

651
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,353
- Hurry, before it's too late.

652
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,311
- All right!
- Jump!

653
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,590
- It's a long way down.
- That doesn't matter.

654
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,790
- I'll get killed.
- That's just what I want.

655
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,354
- Turn around.
- No! Yes.

656
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,756
- I'll blow your brains out.
- Help!

657
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,552
Jump!

658
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,151
What a scare I got!

659
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,511
There, in the pampas,

660
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:42,472
where the sun scorches the earth,

661
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,678
Like a flame,

662
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,871
love burns my heart.

663
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,840
In my veins,

664
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:55,236
blood flows like hot like the sun,

665
00:49:55,360 --> 00:50:00,832
You can satisfy the love I feel
for you only with your kissed.

666
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:05,553
I wait for you in vain at twilight,

667
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,512
among a thousand smoldering fires.

668
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:12,997
I don't hear the sound of
your horse's hoofs,

669
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,551
There, in the pampas,

670
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,558
when the moon shines in the sky,

671
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:25,799
there is no star that can
lead you to me.

672
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:30,112
There, in the pampas,

673
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:33,197
when the moon shines in the sky,

674
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:36,437
there is no star

675
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:40,075
that can lead you to me.

676
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,995
- I knew you'd come.
- Really? I didn't.

677
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:49,476
- Then it's true.
- What's true?

678
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:53,593
That you'd go to any lengths
to win over a woman you like.

679
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:57,110
- Well, you know...
- So, you like me?

680
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,000
Yes, I do.

681
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:05,679
Tell me something.
Do you, by any chance, love death?

682
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:09,793
No, I love life. And how!

683
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:22,391
You're right.
Things are beginning to look up.

684
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:25,352
Unfortunately, my husband
has a different mentality.

685
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,993
- Your husband?
- He's Portuguese.

686
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,190
- He's what?
- Portuguese.

687
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:33,595
- Then don't tell him anything.
- He's very jealous.

688
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,995
Emanuela, where are you?

689
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:38,793
- Hear that? It's him.
- Her master's voice!

690
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:42,674
- He never leaves me alone.
- Really! But I've done nothing.

691
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,996
If he found us together,
he'd be capable of killing you.

692
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,270
- Goodness, gracious me!
- I couldn't care less.

693
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,709
But I could.
This is a serious matter.

694
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,797
Listen, I'll come to you tonight,
in your hotel.

695
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:56,673
- Tonight?
- I'll come to you, in your hotel.

696
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,553
- Is that all right?
- Tonight? In my hotel?

697
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,478
Fine. Are we men or corporals?
Siamo uomini o caporali?

698
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,636
Well said! Go, now. Bye bye.

699
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,796
What a night!

700
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,748
- Hey! Young man! Wake up.
What's happening?

701
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,714
Wake up! You must leave.

702
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,639
- Why?
- Because a woman's coming over.

703
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:39,116
- The Baroness?
- No, Manuelita!

704
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:42,118
A woman with fire in her veins who
appears to be thin but is actually

705
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,391
well-endowed. She has a Portuguese
husband. I haven't met him.

706
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,159
Now, you must lend me
your best dressing gown.

707
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,997
- I'm not lending you anything.
- What do you mean?

708
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,429
I'm returning to Naples tomorrow
morning on the first ferry.

709
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,996
- I've understood everything.
- I've understood nothing.

710
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,998
Do know why they all treat us
so courteously?

711
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,474
Do you know whey everyone
winks at you?

712
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,791
Because I'm handsome.

713
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:09,231
What a fool you are. Do you know
why women chase after you?

714
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,758
They like me. I'm full of charm.

715
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,360
That's not it.

716
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,995
They've taken you for the son
of the great Bey Kahn of Agapur.

717
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,998
- Really?
- Yes.

718
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,031
- I couldn't care less.
- Oh, really?

719
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:26,350
- See this case?
- It's not mine.

720
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,678
It belongs to the Bey. We stole
his motorboat and his suitcase.

721
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,398
Do you know where we'll end up
because of this business?

722
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:38,395
- In Emanuela's arms.
- No, in jail.

723
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:42,513
Listen, in the morning,
I'm returning to Naples, got that?

724
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,880
- What language is that?
- It's Indian. I'm practicing.

725
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,832
Guess what I've found out.
He is the real Bey.

726
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,633
The whole Capri is vying to invite
him. What a blunder I've made.

727
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,993
But I don't love him any more.
I hate him.

728
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,554
No, you don't hate him.
You love him.

729
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,394
- Is it true that you love him?
- Yes, I love him.

730
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,314
Will you do everything you can
to win him back?

731
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:16,636
- Yes, I'll do everything I can.
- This very night.

732
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,636
This very night.

733
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:21,990
You'll enter his room
and you'll seduce him.

734
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:23,996
Very well.

735
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:01,552
- You weren't expecting me, right?
- Actually, I wasn't.

736
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,478
- I didn't want to come here.
- I know, you picked the wrong door.

737
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:08,593
- Down the hallway, on the right.
- I didn't want to come here...

738
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:13,118
...but I had a celestial vision
that said to me: "Go!"

739
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,919
That's what I say too. What are you
waiting for? What do you want?

740
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:19,350
I've come for the case for the last
time, Prince Bey Kahn of Agapur.

741
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:22,273
- For the last time.
- Thank goodness it's the last.

742
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:26,359
- Repent!
- I haven't done anything yet.

743
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,989
- I'm going to settle here.
- No!

744
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:33,828
And I'll stay with you till dawn
and help you fight her...

745
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:37,396
- the triumphant beast.
- Triumphant beast, my eye!

746
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,398
- She's a woman who full of life!
- She's the devil.

747
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:43,557
- I'm not moving from here.
- No, you're leaving right away.

748
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:47,558
It's her, the triumphant beast.

749
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:51,000
- Leave her alone with me.
- Fine. Do you want to see her?

750
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:54,191
- Yes.
- I'll show you the enemy.

751
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,270
What a night!

752
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,788
- At last, you're in.
- Help!

753
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:28,635
- Come here immediately.
- I'm not nuts, you know?

754
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:32,154
- Come here.
- Help!

755
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:35,351
- You're handsome dressed like that.
- Keep your hands still!

756
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,868
- Why are you avoiding me?
- After what happened today.

757
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,718
- What happened today?
- You don't know?

758
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:43,911
- I can't remember anything.
- I remember everything.

759
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,594
My mind has gone blank.

760
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:51,430
I can imagine. You are slightly
schizophrenic.

761
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:54,836
In a word, do you know what
that means? That you're crazy.

762
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,269
- Yes, I'm crazy about you.
- Help! Help!

763
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:00,039
Keep away from me,

764
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,275
otherwise I'll call the madhouse.

765
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,991
Is that the madhouse?

766
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,998
- Who is it?
- Everyone's popping in tonight.

767
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,554
It may be Bartali. It may be Coppi.
It may be her.

768
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,591
- Who?
- Emanuela.

769
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,471
Emanuela?

770
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:19,277
A woman? Goodness, what am I
to do? He didn't tell me anything.

771
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:21,993
He didn't tell you anything?
I'll tell you. Come with me.

772
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,838
I'll show you the triumphant beast.
Do you want to see it?

773
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,189
Come here. Stay calm!

774
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:30,118
If I show you the triumphant beast
will you stay calm?

775
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,151
Yes, I will.

776
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,191
- Do you promise?
- Yes.

777
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:37,880
Stay nice and calm!

778
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,831
What a night!

779
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:03,358
- Who are you?
- Where is she?

780
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,391
- Who?
- Don't feign ignorance.

781
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,431
I'm not feigning.

782
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,074
- Hasn't she arrived yet?
- No, she hasn't arrived yet.

783
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:12,111
- So, you were expecting her!
- You're the Portuguese!

784
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,995
As soon as she arrives,
I'll kill you.

785
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,071
- It's her! She's arrived.

786
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:25,477
- I've just had an idea.
- I see.

787
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:30,389
I'll hide in this wardrobe. You'll
receive her as if I weren't here.

788
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:32,431
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

789
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,636
I want to see how far that woman
will go in cheating on me.

790
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,993
- Remember to act natural.
- Sure!

791
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,077
Very natural!

792
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,714
Woe betide you if I let on that
I'm in here.

793
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:48,113
- Open the door or I'll shot.
- Right!

794
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,631
Smile!

795
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,552
What a night!

796
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:08,871
- My darling!
- Who are you? What do you want?

797
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:11,229
I'm looking for love, my darling.

798
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:14,033
It's so hot in here. I've half
a mind to take off my dress.

799
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:17,152
No, don't do that.
You'd catch a chill.

800
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,873
Can't you feel how cold it is?
Besides, there's a draught.

801
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:23,317
How oddly you're behaving.
Today you were all fuego.

802
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:26,318
This evening you're like ice and I
wonder what you'll be like tonight?

803
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:29,158
Tonight I'll be full of holes.

804
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,998
- Stop talking and kiss me.
- I can't.

805
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:34,270
Don't behave like that idiot
husband of mind.

806
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:37,153
I won't allow you to offend your
husband in my presence.

807
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:40,237
Your husband is a very decent man.
He's gallant, gentlemanly,

808
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:43,511
and even handsome.

809
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:47,235
He understand certain situations.

810
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,874
- But you don't know him.
- That doesn't matter.

811
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:53,196
I can feel his presence. I'm very
sensitive. I'm hyper-sensitive.

812
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,391
What's going on?

813
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,436
What's the matter?
You keep looking at the wardrobe.

814
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:02,278
- It's not true.
- You're hiding something from me.

815
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:05,198
- I know! You're hiding a woman.
- I'm not hiding a woman, I swear.

816
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:08,118
- Open the wardrobe or I'll shoot.
- I can't.

817
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,390
Everybody's ready to shoot around
here. It's getting dangerous.

818
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:13,193
- I'll open it myself.
- Oh, heavens!

819
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,513
- Excuse me, madam.
- Who are you?

820
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:21,279
I'm a man overcome with jealousy.
I was expecting to find...

821
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:24,596
...Baroness von Krafpen...
...with whom I'm madly in love,

822
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,631
but I've unwittingly spoiled
your tryst.

823
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:29,558
- He isn't your husband?
- No.

824
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,556
Then who is this man?

825
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:39,072
- Don't you recognize me?
- Oh, of course!

826
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:42,271
You're the happy death confrere.
The baroness's butler.

827
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,276
Correct, Your Highness.

828
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:47,153
My apologies, madam.
Your Highness.

829
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,191
Actually, I'm quite short.

830
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:51,716
Excuse me.

831
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:54,078
Well...

832
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,993
You wretch! I knew you'd come here.

833
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:02,508
Silence, you unscrupulous servant!

834
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,591
Have a little dignity!

835
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:15,911
There's a lady here and the clients
of the hotel are sleeping.

836
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:35,790
- I've found you at last.
- My husband! Let me explain.

837
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:38,274
There's nothing to explain.

838
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,436
That man's Portuguese.
He's fiery-tempered. Explosive!

839
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:16,509
Scoundrel! Good-for-nothing!

840
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:32,354
What's happening?

841
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:42,313
What am I to do?

842
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,158
It's the end of the world.

843
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:55,988
Excuse me but where do you think
you are? Stop it! This is indecent!

844
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,590
Repent, you sinners.

845
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,996
Your time has come.

846
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:29,117
What a night!

847
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:59,833
- What are they looking at?
- What do you think they're looking?

848
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:02,110
They think you're the richest man
in the world.

849
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,991
Me? Really?

850
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:09,473
Did you see how he greets people?
He continually launches new trends.

851
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:15,276
- How fascinating he is!
- Why don't we elect him, tonight?

852
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:17,151
As Mr. Capri? Why not?

853
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:20,272
- So you're getting engaged to Sonia
- Why should I get engaged?

854
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:23,593
- Because you're already married.
- This evening I'll get engaged...

855
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:25,710
...and tomorrow, disengaged.
- A brilliant idea!

856
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:28,479
So you'll have to pay damages.
For breach of contract.

857
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:31,830
For your information, I do damage
I don't pay for it.

858
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:35,596
- Anyhow, it's my business.
- Suppose your wife were to turn up?

859
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:38,279
How could she? There's a sea
between us and she can't swim.

860
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:41,710
- She can take a ferry.
- Have you forgotten the strike?

861
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,591
- Right!
- Indeed.

862
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:48,556
I must confide something. I have a
secret agreement with Di Vittorio.

863
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:02,236
Your Highness, do you remember me?
Dodo della Baggina.

864
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:04,396
- Of course!
- May I introduce Enrichetta Giusi.

865
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:08,873
We want to include you among the
candidates for tonight's election.

866
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:12,317
- As a Member of Parliament?
- This is a really witty statement.

867
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:16,478
I'm have it printed in "L'Europeo".
It's a contest to elect Mr. Capri.

868
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:19,637
- I see.
- I am Pupetto Turacciolo.

869
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:24,151
Turacciolo? Turacciolo?
This name isn't new to me.

870
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,119
If it pleases you, I accept
the invitation.

871
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:30,596
Wonderful. I'll immediately inform
the island brotherhood.

872
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:34,679
While you're at it, do me the favor
of informing also the sisterhood.

873
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:37,632
- What a wit!
- The more the merrier!

874
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:41,999
- You're divine!
- Really divine! After you.

875
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:46,791
This evening's party will be truly
memorable. Unforgettable!

876
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,117
Maestro, please!

877
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,270
I have an important announcement
to make.

878
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:22,199
Ladies and gentlemen, island
brother and sisterhood, welcome.

879
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:26,518
We'll now proceed with the election
of the best among us,

880
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:28,869
the precursor of our endless class,

881
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:31,150
the representative of
the Caprense gang,

882
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:34,749
the new Tiberius.
In other words, Mr. Capri.

883
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,993
Contestant number 1,
Count Bubi di Primaporta.

884
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:52,629
Excuse me?

885
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:57,835
Is Antonio De Fazio
staying in this hotel?

886
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,472
Yes, he's here.

887
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,669
- He's here.
- Are you sure?

888
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,597
We've been traipsing around
Capri all day.

889
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:06,915
- I can't take any more.
- Just ask him.

890
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:09,394
Is Antonio De Fazio staying here?

891
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:13,513
Yes, madam. Mr. Antonio De Fazio
is here now. Who should I announce?

892
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:17,400
5 seconds applause.

893
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:23,311
Contestant number 2.
Pupetto Turacciolo.

894
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:26,033
The most fantastic guy!

895
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:30,796
He brought back to Capri
the ancient cult of the god Mitra.

896
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:35,069
Go! One, two, three...

897
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,993
- Sign up for it. You're the best.
- Yes, I know but - -

898
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:45,828
- Why don't you?
- Take part with the others.

899
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:48,997
And now, contestant number 3.

900
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:53,589
- Go on! Don't be shy.
- You're the most likely to win!

901
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:59,831
His Highness Omar Bey,
heir to the throne of Agapur,

902
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:05,239
who, after breaking the hearts of
the most beautiful women in Capri,

903
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:08,750
- including our Sonia Bulgarov,
- Very good!

904
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:12,110
Invented the swim with your clothes
on, the fashion for a snake on...

905
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:15,596
your head, the greetings with your
tongue out and other amusing tricks

906
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:38,432
- Speech!
- Speech!

907
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:41,518
- Please say something.
- Say a few words.

908
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:46,799
Island brotherhood,

909
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:53,831
bay sisterhood, rather I should say
busty sisterhood,

910
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:01,393
the management of the club requests
that guests do not break glasses...

911
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:05,149
...or mock the waiters while they're
performing their difficult job...

912
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:08,670
...of serving this difficult
clientele.

913
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:13,191
We couldn't care less about
the management.

914
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:19,870
And as for the waiters, I repeat,
as for the waiters,

915
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:22,718
not only will we make fun of them,

916
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:26,878
but also treat them as slaves.
Watch!

917
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:37,230
In honor of the winner, we're about
to hear the Agapur national anthem.

918
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,594
Keep an eye on him, idiot!

919
01:10:56,920 --> 01:11:01,471
- Bey? Bey? Mr. De Fazio.
- Where's he gone?

920
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:04,996
- What are you doing here?
- Me?

921
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:07,270
- Yes, you.
- What am I doing here?

922
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,476
I'm working as a waiter.
It's obvious.

923
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:11,556
But weren't you supposed to go
to work in Salerno?

924
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:15,149
If I'd told you I was coming to
Capri, you'd have been worried.

925
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:18,153
- This is a den of iniquity.
- Bey? Bey?

926
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:20,760
I'm coming.
You heard? They're calling me.

927
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:23,360
- But did they call you Bey?
- You misunderstood.

928
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:27,075
They called me "boy"
that's like "waiter".

929
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:28,992
- What's going on out there?
- A party.

930
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,996
- Can we go and see?
- Absolutely no.

931
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:33,190
- Why ever not?
- It's an orgy. Degenerate antics!

932
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:37,358
- How disgraceful!
- The people are in evening dress.

933
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:43,597
They're wearing evening dress
but underneath, they're naked.

934
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:47,670
Don't leave this table. I'll be
right back with something to drink.

935
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:51,355
What a cute kid!

936
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:54,995
Is that the way to carry a tray?
A tray should be carried like this.

937
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:01,159
Guys, look at him!
I wonder what he's up to now?

938
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:07,112
Attention please.
Let the orgy begin!

939
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:10,999
He's fantastic! Just fantastic!

940
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:13,634
Give me that tray.
Hand it over!

941
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,389
They're breaking glasses!

942
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:24,318
- I'm in trouble!
- Why?

943
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:27,079
- My mother-in-law has turned up.
- Really? Then I'm out of here.

944
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:29,395
- I'm coming with you.
- Shall we dance, honey?

945
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,078
- What?
- Let's dance. Come on!

946
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:34,157
You can't get out of it now.

947
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,880
You're nervous this evening.
What's on your mind?

948
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:44,151
- My family.
- Your father, Bey Khan of Agapur.

949
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:47,630
- He's always on my mind.
- So, you have 40 wives?

950
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:50,558
- 40 wives? Not on your life!
- What?

951
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:54,634
- I don't have 40 wives. Only 39.
- So few?

952
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:57,399
- One of them is worth 100.

953
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:07,430
What's he up to now?

954
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:13,759
Here we are. Drink this.
It will do you a power of good.

955
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:16,998
A power of good.
Don't leave this table.

956
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:20,998
Drink this. It's really delicious,
wonderful!

957
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:23,873
- Thanks!
- Don't move from here.

958
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:36,160
- Do you like this samba?
- Indeed I do.

959
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,998
What are you doing here?
Do you want to get me fired?

960
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:03,157
- Go inside! Back to your table!
- Excuse us, Antonio.

961
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:13,115
Look over there. Can you see him?

962
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:26,350
What are you saying, silly boy?

963
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:36,671
What are you going to do now?

964
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:40,633
Are we going to get our cake?
We've been waiting half an hour.

965
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:44,989
What fun! We'll give you some more!

966
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,835
We're ruined.
The Bey has arrived.

967
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:00,316
- Thank goodness. He can marry her.
- He'll have us arrested.

968
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:02,032
- No!
- Look at him.

969
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:05,231
- Hide!
- Where?

970
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:07,874
- Under the table.
- All right.

971
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:16,995
- Did they see us?
- No. Let's get out of here.

972
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:19,509
- From where?
- From the side room. Hurry!

973
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:23,155
I can't.
My wife's in the side room.

974
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:25,630
Let's leave like this.

975
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:29,916
Hello! Listen, Marinella, would
you like to go to the bar?

976
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:33,509
- It's so crowded in here.
- No, honey. Let's wait for Bubi.

977
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:36,120
You're right.
That's a marvellous idea.

978
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:03,469
Keep an eye on the exits. You must
expose him without any scandal.

979
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:10,634
Ready?
What are you waiting for?

980
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:17,880
You go ahead and I'll follow.

981
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,150
- Who fired those shot?
- I did.

982
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:38,397
- Why did you shoot?
- Two tables were moving.

983
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:41,113
I saw that too.
Some tables were moving.

984
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:43,628
- I saw them as well.
- Take the cloths off the tables.

985
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:54,870
My goodness! What a sight!

986
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:02,396
She looks familiar. Who is she?

987
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:07,038
- She's your wife, dummy!
- My wife?

988
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:11,792
Evidently the air in Capri
makes people look better.

989
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,592
- Is that him?
- Yes.

990
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:51,389
There he is. Go on!

991
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,719
Stop it, all of you!
The ire of the gods be upon you.

992
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:07,673
You, Bey Kahn of Agapur will pay
for your sins with your life.

993
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:10,996
One moment! There's been a
misunderstanding.

994
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:13,235
I'm not the real Bey. He is.

995
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:15,999
Oh, no! I not be Bey. He be Bey.

996
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:19,555
- No, he be Bey, I be me.
- Which is the real Bey?

997
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:22,990
It must be the one in the turban.
Go! And don't let him get away.

998
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:25,474
- That's enough!
- That's enough!

999
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:29,638
You've made fun of me for long,
but you won't trick me any more.

1000
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:42,909
Mr. De Fazio,
taking my place in this hotel,

1001
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:45,554
you saved my precious life.

1002
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,989
Well...
- It's only right that I give you

1003
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:50,270
- a small reward.
- Thank you.

1004
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:52,675
Would you kindly step onto
this scale?

1005
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:55,792
- What for?
- According to the Indian tradition,

1006
01:19:55,840 --> 01:20:00,152
I'll measure you your weight in
diamonds in the other scale-pan.

1007
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:05,069
That's an excellent idea!
May I add my wife's 50 kilos?

1008
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:09,432
No reward is large enough
for saving a life.

1009
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:13,075
That's what I say.
Sit next to me, my 50-kilo wife.

1010
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:15,638
The more the merrier!

1011
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:19,153
- They're cute, aren't they?
- Yes.

1012
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:21,995
- Just an appetizer!
- How lovely!

1013
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:24,998
Dear wife, do you see my trip to
Capri hasn't been a waste of time?

1014
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:27,508
Guys, don't cheat with the weight.

1015
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:33,198
Now that I think of it,
I forgot to tell you something.

1016
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:37,511
Sonia, Emanuela,

1017
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:40,993
Baroness von Cemiterium,

1018
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:45,838
Osvaldo, Asdrubale, Dodo!

1019
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:49,109
Are you all here?

1020
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:53,792
I wanted to tell you Capri
is not bad,

1021
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,390
but Sonia is a sight for sore eyes.

1022
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:01,638
Now tell me, friends,
are we men or corporals?
