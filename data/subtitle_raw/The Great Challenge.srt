2
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,979
Dad.

3
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,659
My daughter.
Mae, I'm glad you are here

4
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,330
Your presence will certainly
brighten up this evening.

5
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,290
Don't pay attention.
Someday he'll accept you.

6
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,491
This is mr. Wong
- Who?

7
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,691
He's the one giving this reception

8
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,690
He is a businessman
and he's leading a powerful triad

9
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,658
Please, sit down

10
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,971
How elegant
- Mr Wong is very generous and very powerful

11
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,889
He is very distinguished.
- Totally.

12
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,177
I wonder how much he's worth?

13
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,498
Quickly.

14
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,818
There are 2 intruders in your office.

15
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,090
Block all the exits.

16
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,133
Who could that have been?

17
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,293
The question is not who it was,
but who gave the order.

18
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,653
Don't do it

19
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,732
Do you have him?
- We must go.

20
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:36,494
Bring the dragon to safety
We let them run for a while.

21
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,650
See you at the meeting

22
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,614
Our lifes will change, Tsu.

23
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,529
Thank you for coming.

24
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,612
We know each other from stories of others.

25
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:13,808
Everybody does his thing.
We can make our sport public together.

26
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:24,335
You want to do a game
so we can get to know eachother? I am Leo.

27
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,378
Hi, I am Logan
- Kenjee.

28
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,850
We make two teams.

29
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:36,776
Do you see that roof there?
The team that puts the ball there, wins.

30
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,293
The ball.

31
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,689
Yes, I have the ball.

32
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,533
Your turn.

33
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,613
Come on.

34
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,853
Here. Here.

35
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,410
The ball. Give me the ball.

36
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,218
Give me the ball.

37
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,850
I got it. I got it.

38
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,133
Yaguy.
- No.

39
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,013
Stupid.

40
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,533
Come on, here.

41
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,050
One point.
- It's not over yet.

42
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,576
He's got the ball
He got it.

43
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,212
Nice game.

44
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:44,569
New York?
That's tight as hell.

45
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,130
Where do you live?
- Africa. Kinshasa.

46
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:53,130
Bangkok, nothing beats that.
- Asia. Why not?

47
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,813
What is this about?

48
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,813
A gym for young people of the street.
come on.

49
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:03,054
Sorry. My little son is waiting for me
- I'm down for whatever, I love adventure.

50
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,814
I'll help. It's on the way.

51
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:10,610
Let's posse up and do this together.

52
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,334
Study long, study wrong, let's do it.

53
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,093
Come.

54
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,731
This is cool, Leo

55
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:02,169
When does the training start?
- We should do something like that over here.

56
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,780
This is gonna be great, guys.

57
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,372
It's magical

58
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,612
You have a paradise here
You really feel at home.

59
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,615
I became worried

60
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,409
Do you have it? Show me
- I dont have it.

61
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:06,211
I left it where it belongs
We're sorry we wasted your time.

62
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,977
Hire someone else.

63
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,973
No wait, she is still young.

64
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,657
Don't listen, master.
Let us show you our loyalty

65
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,493
By crawling for him?

66
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,776
We beg you to accept our apologies.

67
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:52,770
This theft should humiliate Mr. Wong
for the final strike.

68
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:58,333
Then this city is mine.
Don't fuck up again.

69
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,290
Kitano, you know the rules

70
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,770
Our members dont marry outsiders

71
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:22,092
I know.
Because I love a chinese.

72
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:27,616
I will be punished and chased away...

73
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,254
like a stray dog.

74
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:37,850
But I swear, Misawa,
that I will return as a master.

75
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,854
I give my family their lost honour back.

76
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:45,979
If you fail, you will lose a lot more.

77
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,739
You will lose your life.
And above all, your wife.

78
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,936
I can also succeed.

79
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:00,336
The greater the risk, the greater the reward.

80
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:05,290
I am his son in law.
If he likes it or not.

81
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,774
Watch out for Kien and Tsu.

82
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:15,058
They can betray you.
They are chinese themselves.

83
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,530
It wouldn't take a lot of effort for them.

84
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:23,769
They are hungry.
They're in it to win.

85
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,888
Yeah, holmes. I want chicken

86
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,659
I dont want your wiener!

87
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:01,091
No, the entire chicken
the chicken that I see there. boc boc boc.

88
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,932
For me and my peeps...

89
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,298
What the fuck is that?
I want the chicken, man!

90
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,293
<i>Rice, chicken.
That chicken there.</i>

91
00:15:12,397 --> 00:15:15,856
Oooh, ok, ok..
The chicken..

92
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:21,155
Greetings...
How can I help you today?

93
00:15:23,054 --> 00:15:25,859
Oh here you go, I've been waiting for you all day.

94
00:15:28,665 --> 00:15:33,666
Grandma needed dentures, 
but I'd rather not have this chicken shoved up my ass.

95
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,539
Be cool...

96
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:43,128
Chill out man.
- Be cool...

97
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,175
You see this motherfucker?
- Chillax man...

98
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,659
If I watch, I'm an accessory
- Control yourself.

99
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:53,206
Hey man, chill out!
My insurance won't cover this shit!

100
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:58,410
Hey, no need to get worked up.
You guys want some wieners?

101
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,813
Come on man.

102
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,373
Very good.
- That was amazing.

103
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,857
I know someone that will be happy

104
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:43,774
Come on, guys. Dont be afraid

105
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,537
There, no need to hide.

106
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:21,977
I hear you are going to your grandfather
- Yeah, I intended to go.

107
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:26,338
Has it been long since you saw him?
- I dont know him.

108
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,775
Perhaps that's why I'm a bit scared

109
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:33,730
He will be happy to see you.
- I hope so.

110
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:07,578
Our mixed blood will always be a problem.
Only the yakuza offer us a future.

111
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:12,291
Why you want to destroy everything
so close to the target?

112
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:18,216
We've made a mistake, Kien.
From the beginning.

113
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:24,698
My little sister that knows
and understands everything.

114
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:29,058
Someday the triads will kill us
for what we have done.

115
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,974
And if they dont do it, Kitano will.

116
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,576
You are wrong.
He needs us.

117
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:43,974
She didn't make sacrifices
to let us become criminals.

118
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:53,778
Because of her blood
the triads have banned us.

119
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,454
as outcasts.

120
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,934
Tell me what she has left us...

121
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:06,530
other than the curse of her blood.

122
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:22,338
She's dead, Kien.
She didn't abandon us, she's dead.

123
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,094
I will always be there for you.

124
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,135
Anyone wants to excersize?

125
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,130
This shit is wobbly!
- Let's try it.

126
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,699
OK, lets roll!

127
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,213
Look out!

128
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,213
Oh, they are trippin...

129
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,135
That ass is mine now.

130
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:11,053
Hey fools
You didn't get the message the first time?

131
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,858
Leo, do you know them?

132
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,013
Triangle

133
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:23,411
To understand your violent behaviour...

134
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:29,132
You must always put yourself in the
place of the person you are going to hit.

135
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,453
Let's get the fuck out of here.

136
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:41,379
Hey boys, pass on this message:
Bangkok is a battlefield.

137
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,770
It's not a playground.

138
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,813
Come.

139
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:16,418
Thanks for your help.
- You are here on his territory.

140
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:20,539
Why? we didn't want to fight.
We just wanted to excersize.

141
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,179
excersize?

142
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,608
He can't see us together.

143
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:36,416
Go away, or he'll kill you all.

144
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:57,459
You should have warned us.
- I didn't expect this.

145
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:03,377
When I came there they wanted to scare me off.
I wasn't raised a coward.

146
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:09,052
I thought I was done with it.
- Which is not the case.

147
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:34,295
We have played with our lives.
- Sorry, but I'm not going to give up my gym.

148
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:49,772
The day when your agression
will dominate you...

149
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:53,489
it will be too late.

150
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:26,696
What are you going to do?
- Put my thoughts in order.

151
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:30,978
If you want to stay, you are welcome.
- thank you.

152
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,738
I've to go too.

153
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,290
And you?
- I'm going home. I've been gone too long.

154
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:42,215
Let's spend the night here.
Tomorrow we take a morning flight.

155
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,852
Come, we should find a hotel.

156
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,978
Is it far?

157
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,379
Are you counting?

158
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:44,978
No. They're the names of dead comerades.
I try to keep their memories alive.

159
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,859
What are you talking about?

160
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:52,332
The war in my village.
I'd rather not talk about it.

161
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:25,857
It's me. Is he there?
- Yes he is. Do you want to speak to him?

162
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,375
You want to talk with him.
- Put him on the phone

163
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,893
take it easy.

164
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:34,576
I'm far away, but I love you
and think about you a lot.

165
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:38,614
Really?
- You shouldn't doubt that.

166
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:42,335
Do you still have my necklace?
- I will never take it off.

167
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:47,660
Daddy, I miss you
- I love you and your mother a lot.

168
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:50,613
Mommy, daddy has to tell you something.

169
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,339
Hello, yes?

170
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:56,100
Everything ok with you?
- I'm good.

171
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:01,613
Tell me...
What do you want me to say?

172
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,608
Bye.
- Bye. Take care of yourself.

173
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:10,132
See you soon.
- Right, yeah. See you soon

174
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:32,130
Divorced?
- No, just far from eachother.

175
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,453
And you?
- I didn't find the right one yet.

176
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,815
Different than others.

177
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,453
Kien?

178
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,338
Come on in.

179
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:35,100
You got a plan?

180
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:40,015
I dont travel thousands of kilometers
just to fight in Bangkok.

181
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:43,530
That's not for me anymore.

182
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,613
I should have asked her.
- who? the small asian?

183
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:52,410
She's on the wrong side.
- I dont want to judge her so soon.

184
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:57,813
Have you already forgotten what happened?
- I know

185
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:02,815
She only brings troubles. Forget about her.

186
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:13,332
Kenjee, dont ruin your life.
He's not worth it.

187
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:19,900
No!
Cut it out, Kenjee. No!

188
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,809
What are you doing here?

189
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,414
Relax, it's cool.

190
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:40,455
Leave me alone.
- Can't we talk?

191
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:01,695
What are you afraid of?
You came looking for me.

192
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:14,293
Go away. Please.

193
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,538
Daddy.
- My boy.

194
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:42,616
I'm glad to receive you
here with me in my house.

195
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:46,136
I'm only here to make
my daughter happy.

196
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:52,057
It is good to reconcile our families
and cultures with each other.

197
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:58,614
Our ways are too different.
You will never understand that.

198
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:05,500
An old rule of our triad says
I will never be able to trust you.

199
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:13,490
Kitano.
- I'm sorry. I've to go.

200
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,452
Thank you for this second chance.

201
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:39,019
Wong has been waiting a while for
someone to follow him up.

202
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:43,856
This kidnapping will break his heart.
- I will not disappoint you again.

203
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,772
I'll be right back.
- Are you crazy?

204
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:09,857
Not today, guys.
Come back tomorrow.

205
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:20,890
They got away good.
- Do you want to trump them?

206
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,654
It is tempting.
- What?

207
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:27,089
I wont be part of it.

208
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,898
Yaguy, Come for a second

209
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,488
He is right, he's a father.

210
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:41,575
But I'm in.
Otherwise I can forget about my gym

211
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:45,619
We take him to the airport
and tackle them.

212
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,930
Alright, but quickly.

213
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:35,172
Take me with you...

214
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,659
There she is.
There.

215
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,890
Tsu, Kien wants to talk to you.

216
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:00,450
Tell him he solves it by himself
- Do it yourself.

217
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:03,453
That idiot still doesn't understand.

218
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,050
Mind your own business.

219
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,213
Hurry.

220
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,012
This way.

221
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,333
Come with me

222
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,173
Trust me.

223
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:41,577
Your grandfather knew that you would come

224
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:47,292
He has told me so much about you
that I know you better than yourself.

225
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:13,688
You have come a long way.
- Thank you for seeing me.

226
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:20,129
Your grandfather would have been proud if
he knew you would be amongst his people.

227
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:23,736
I should have come much sooner.

228
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:29,452
He's still here, you know.
His spirit still waits for you.

229
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:33,295
This temple is his residence
He has not left it.

230
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:36,452
He's here and there. Everywhere at once

231
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:42,092
He's in the trees.
He's in the wind. He's in you

232
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:06,218
They will never find us here.
- I want an explanation

233
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:11,613
What do you want with my life story?
- Maybe I want to stay then

234
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:16,216
You wont understand anyway
- We shall see.

235
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:23,091
He took care for me when I was small.
Without him I would be dead.

236
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:26,537
I can't just abandon him.

237
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:29,851
What is he to you?

238
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,853
My brother.

239
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:45,856
Let me help you then.

240
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:59,256
<i>Wong has been waiting long for
someone to follow him up.</i>

241
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:02,537
<i>This kidnapping will break his heart.</i>

242
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:21,210
Kitano was very serious.

243
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:25,457
We can also do it without her.

244
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:30,455
But what did she do with him?
Can't she see that he is dangerous?

245
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:34,215
You always think too much
It is time for action.

246
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:37,019
Thinking ahead prevent mistakes.

247
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:41,890
Tell that to your sister.
It's her fault that it came this far.

248
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:46,531
After the kidnapping Kitano
will take us into his group.

249
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:49,168
It will be a massacre.

250
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:53,652
Kitano will give us the chance
to make up for our mistake.

251
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:58,331
This is our last chance.
this time we wont let him down.

252
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:06,415
This is not the moment to be weak.

253
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:17,893
Why aren't you there?
- We must talk.

254
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:23,259
You want to talk? About what?

255
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:25,854
About Wong's son?
- Dont do it.

256
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:29,900
There is another solution.

257
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:31,857
Logan will help us.

258
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:36,853
You do it your way,
I do it mine.

259
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:42,213
Everything that will happen
will be your fault.

260
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:44,412
Kien.

261
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:50,849
I must stop him.
I must warn someone.

262
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:53,375
Think about what I've said.

263
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,899
Wait for me.

264
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:01,571
I will come back to you.

265
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:04,253
Trust me.

266
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:27,132
This is there hiding place.
After the first altercation, I followed them.

267
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:34,297
They wont stop until it's settled.

268
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:48,369
Hey pussy, do you remember us?

269
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:53,899
We'll get them later.
We dont have time now.

270
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:19,773
Shit!

271
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:31,974
You only had to block the road.
- Yeah, I went a bit too far.

272
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:39,733
Oh Fuck!

273
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:00,459
Did you have to blow up their shit?

274
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:06,012
It's time to roll.
- Let's go seperate. We'll see each other upstairs.

275
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:11,457
This way.

276
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,456
You wont get me.

277
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,938
What are you doing here?

278
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:53,570
You started it
We just hit back.

279
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:57,817
It was a big mistake to come here.

280
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:01,533
This will cost you.

281
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,292
You talk too much.

282
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:07,618
If you really wanted to kill me,
you would have done it already.

283
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:45,213
We Outi Byatchez!

284
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:18,337
We should never have trusted you.
You are no better than your sister.

285
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:23,738
The Yakuza and the triads will take
a bet on who is going to kill us first.

286
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:28,934
From now on it's each on his own.
We have no alternative.

287
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:49,735
The sister of Kien is here.

288
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:53,449
Kitano had ordered her
to steal your family seal...

289
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:57,056
and kidnap your son tonight.

290
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:06,611
With this you will not
erase the insult towards me.

291
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:10,534
But perhaps it will save
your life and the live of your son.

292
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:15,694
Do you think we are that weak?
- In a war no one is safe.

293
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:20,490
Even you.
I dont want to see you in this city anymore.

294
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:24,653
But before you disappear
you have to do something for me.

295
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:30,772
Mae, I put someone on.

296
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:34,091
She's going to tell you
something about your husband.

297
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,053
Yes.

298
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:19,653
Still nothing?
- Still nothing.

299
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:24,810
Mae just left.

300
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:26,857
I dont know where to.

301
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:32,652
I'm sorry...

302
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:34,773
my friend.

303
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:38,011
You can go.

304
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:42,215
What happens next...

305
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:46,330
only concerns me.

306
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:11,175
Kien and Tsu have betrayed us.

307
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:15,697
They've conspired to prevent the kidnapping.

308
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:27,053
Dammit.

309
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:40,452
I cannot abandon him.

310
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:42,773
Kien?

311
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:28,015
Did you deal with your ghosts?
- We have to leave here.

312
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:30,455
You have found her.

313
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:52,855
Where are they coming from?

314
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:53,533
Logan.

315
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:07,891
Our new master wants me to let you live.
For now.

316
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:13,013
No.

317
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:58,296
He appreciates your worthy help.

318
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:02,612
But the Yakuza tolerate no traitors.

319
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:04,812
Go and see if everything is ready.

320
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:14,018
I'm sorry. My friends are in danger.
I've to go.

321
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:18,298
The road to them brings you
closer to your grandfather.

322
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:22,419
You are always welcome here,
Son of the Wind.

323
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:23,737
Why did you follow us that evening?

324
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:30,458
What did you do to my friend?

325
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:35,092
Why do you care?
- It's your fault.

326
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:38,377
You owe me an explanation.

327
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:44,450
Dont say that.
- Are you going to hit me, like your brother?

328
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:53,495
He only wanted to help you
and now he's dead.

329
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:17,450
Master, it's him.

330
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:24,933
Your sister and her friend are impatient.
And we killed one of the french.

331
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:30,254
Where and when?
- Twelve o'clock at the industrial grounds.

332
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:37,369
If the door opens I'll kill you.

333
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:13,412
Where are you going?

334
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:19,778
If you leave from the wind,
you will leave from the life.

335
01:08:19,940 --> 01:08:24,377
Dont be afraid.
Let the wind take you to us.

336
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:34,613
It's not time yet.

337
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:39,492
How are you feeling?

338
01:08:46,860 --> 01:08:50,375
What happened?
- Logan, where is Kenjee?

339
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:12,133
That's not what he came for

340
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:20,134
It's true.
Now we are even.

341
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:30,213
They have my sister and your friend.

342
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:32,940
Who is he talking about?
- The Yakuza

343
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:37,059
By attacking us you have
destroyed their plan.

344
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:41,259
Now they want your life and mine.

345
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:47,979
Do what you want, but I'm going with him

346
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:52,099
Not all of us will not return alive.

347
01:09:53,180 --> 01:09:56,411
So dont feel obligated to come.

348
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:03,330
We are in this together.

349
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:19,289
They are in the west wing.

350
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:22,418
And you?
- I have a meeting.

351
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:34,619
Where is she?
- Safe.

352
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:36,133
For now.

353
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:39,051
What did you expect?

354
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:06,611
Where is the other?

355
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:28,856
You are brave. But your sister will be dead.
- No. We have other plans.

356
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:36,257
Kenjee, everything okay?

357
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:40,253
No.

358
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:44,053
What's wrong?

359
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:51,333
He's happy to see you.

360
01:13:03,940 --> 01:13:05,737
You've betrayed the
love of my daughter...

361
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:12,733
Now you must face the consequences.

362
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:16,335
I'm glad you are here.

363
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:19,936
You have insulted us and you will pay.

364
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:25,933
We have come here to defend our honour.

365
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:31,175
If you kill him,
you will become one of us, Kien

366
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:34,015
That's what you wanted, isn't it?

367
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:36,171
Here's the exit.

368
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:41,254
Wait a second.
We're not going to leave her brother.

369
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:27,737
Dont do it or you will become like them.

370
01:14:48,740 --> 01:14:54,212
Master.
- It's over. There are too many of them.

371
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:58,931
My death will do.
I hope they will spare you.

372
01:15:00,340 --> 01:15:03,332
Tell my wife I love her.

373
01:15:25,940 --> 01:15:28,534
In a few minutes the police will come.

374
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:34,491
That's enough time for you to
follow your master in shame and blood.

375
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:40,498
Our master showed us the road.

376
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:46,098
If we sacrifice our blood in battle,
we wipe his honour clean.

377
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:53,492
Prepare for battle.

378
01:16:00,380 --> 01:16:03,372
Do we Fight or run?
- Fight.

379
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:16,378
Over the roofs.
- No. Armed men are everywhere there.

380
01:16:26,420 --> 01:16:29,890
you must conquer the
security of your victory

381
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:32,415
without fearing the defeat.

382
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:36,368
As long as you fight with dignity, you win.

383
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:43,177
You dont fight against others,
but against yourself

384
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:48,812
unite both our arts and
control your violent temper.

385
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:53,656
Then the road will open itself for you.

386
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:23,813
No.

387
01:19:30,940 --> 01:19:32,293
Come.

388
01:22:58,020 --> 01:22:59,373
No.

389
01:23:50,660 --> 01:23:54,573
Do you realize what we just did?
Imagine yourself.

390
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:58,779
Yaguy, We were almost dead
Let it sink for a bit.

391
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:06,011
Stay. Do it for me.
- I can't.

392
01:24:10,340 --> 01:24:17,576
Guys, from now on, we stay together
We stay together, èh?

393
01:24:21,740 --> 01:24:25,733
You must live your life
and I will live mine.

394
01:24:28,740 --> 01:24:31,254
You have always said:

395
01:24:32,780 --> 01:24:34,930
We never change.

396
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:59,218
You will never get him.

397
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:14,217
I had a dream.

398
01:25:17,060 --> 01:25:19,699
The wind was floating me to you.

399
01:25:22,340 --> 01:25:23,978
Do you remember?

400
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:03,299
Hey love birds,
What's up with that meeting?

401
01:26:05,420 --> 01:26:08,696
What meeting?
- Be patient.

402
01:26:09,696 --> 01:26:19,696
