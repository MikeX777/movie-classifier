00:10:51,928 --> 00:10:53,122
Oh, sorry.

184
00:10:54,476 --> 00:10:55,518
Crook.
- Robber.

185
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,255
Cheat. Who paid you for this?

186
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,438
You'd better tell.
- Or the police will arrest you.

187
00:10:59,635 --> 00:11:02,043
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
We'll never get anywhere this way.

188
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,907
Say, who are these guys anyway?

189
00:11:04,305 --> 00:11:06,017
These gentlemen are my competitors.

190
00:11:06,219 --> 00:11:08,015
Their drivers have been
betraying them too.

191
00:11:08,115 --> 00:11:10,888
Don't make me laugh. You guys got
nothing on me. Nothing has been stolen.

192
00:11:11,158 --> 00:11:12,259
I've had you watched.

193
00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:15,248
Every time we send you down to the pier
to pick up a shipment of new models.

194
00:11:15,557 --> 00:11:17,940
You parked in an alley so these
crooks could take pictures.

195
00:11:18,338 --> 00:11:19,795
Before the models ever got to us.

196
00:11:19,895 --> 00:11:20,864
You're fired.

197
00:11:21,164 --> 00:11:23,059
Well, so long boys.
- Get out.

198
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:29,818
Hello?

199
00:11:30,714 --> 00:11:31,983
Oh Harry, what is it?

200
00:11:32,215 --> 00:11:33,345
I've just been canned.

201
00:11:34,869 --> 00:11:35,513
Yeah.

202
00:11:36,164 --> 00:11:37,695
And tell the boss I'm all washed up.

203
00:11:41,172 --> 00:11:41,838
Well.

204
00:11:43,031 --> 00:11:43,818
Well what?

205
00:11:44,616 --> 00:11:45,288
Harry.

206
00:11:45,934 --> 00:11:47,047
He's fired.

207
00:11:48,663 --> 00:11:49,324
What?

208
00:11:49,587 --> 00:11:51,089
They've caught up with your racket.

209
00:11:51,913 --> 00:11:53,618
Mister mastermind.

210
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,703
Well .. I'm not much fun with policemen.

211
00:11:59,126 --> 00:12:00,633
So I'm off to Buffalo.

212
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:01,880
Toot-toot.

213
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:06,348
Well, hadn't you better 'toot-toot' too?

214
00:12:06,772 --> 00:12:07,415
Nope.

215
00:12:08,093 --> 00:12:10,018
You should you know.
- Probably.

216
00:12:10,784 --> 00:12:11,943
I could get in trouble.

217
00:12:12,205 --> 00:12:13,429
I'll risk it, Captain.

218
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,286
Oh.

219
00:12:23,717 --> 00:12:24,790
What is it, a ghost?

220
00:12:27,022 --> 00:12:27,751
An idea.

221
00:12:30,348 --> 00:12:31,592
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

222
00:12:31,913 --> 00:12:33,400
Mr Duryea.
- Yes?

223
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,348
I understand you represent
the driver we just discharged.

224
00:12:37,933 --> 00:12:40,367
If you don't mind, I don't
believe I've had the pleasure.

225
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:43,051
Mr Caponelli, Mr Glass, Mr Feldman.

226
00:12:43,438 --> 00:12:44,206
Charmed.

227
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:45,003
Now.

228
00:12:45,185 --> 00:12:46,958
You are the attorney
for our driver, Brent?

229
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:48,175
Well ..

230
00:12:48,387 --> 00:12:49,231
Not exactly.

231
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,178
Well then, who are you?

232
00:12:51,514 --> 00:12:53,142
My name is Sherwood Nash.

233
00:12:53,335 --> 00:12:54,951
And what is your connection with Brent?

234
00:12:55,498 --> 00:12:57,730
He was fired for selling us out.
For taking a bribe.

235
00:12:58,017 --> 00:12:59,454
Oh, I'm the man who bribed him.

236
00:12:59,641 --> 00:13:00,944
You cheap crook.
- Thief.

237
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:01,967
Robber.

238
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:03,315
Of all the crooks.

239
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:05,876
You are a pirate and a parasite
on legitimate business.

240
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,241
We spend thousands and thousands of
dollars to import Paris models yet ..

241
00:13:09,435 --> 00:13:11,191
Ah, now you come to my point.

242
00:13:12,252 --> 00:13:15,491
Gentlemen, why spend those
thousands and thousands of dollars ..

243
00:13:15,967 --> 00:13:19,106
When you can have the identical models
delivered to you direct from Paris ..

244
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:21,504
At a mere fraction
of their present cost.

245
00:13:23,525 --> 00:13:24,916
Nash, what are you driving at?

246
00:13:25,016 --> 00:13:26,517
I am merely trying to point out ..

247
00:13:26,617 --> 00:13:29,583
That I could just as easily be
working for you as against you.

248
00:13:30,562 --> 00:13:33,482
Instead of being the fly in
your coffee, so to speak.

249
00:13:33,762 --> 00:13:36,062
I could be the cream.
That, gentlemen, is why I'm here.

250
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:40,322
I thought if we had a heart-to-heart
talk we might arrive at some ..

251
00:13:40,615 --> 00:13:41,819
Pleasant understanding.

252
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,493
It occurred to me that a
man of my proven ability.

253
00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:47,336
Could be very valuable to you.

254
00:13:48,052 --> 00:13:48,810
In Paris.

255
00:13:50,349 --> 00:13:51,777
Do I make myself clear?

256
00:13:52,016 --> 00:13:53,833
Yes, I think you're a petty,
larcenous crook.

257
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:56,002
You belong behind bars
and I'll put you there.

258
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:57,681
Right. That's it.
- Twenty years.

259
00:13:57,862 --> 00:13:59,720
Now get out and find
yourself a good lawyer.

260
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:01,036
You'll need one.

261
00:14:02,293 --> 00:14:03,079
Very well.

262
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:06,938
If by any chance you wish
to get in touch with me ..

263
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:09,226
I'm at the Park Manor hotel.

264
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:10,866
Gentlemen.

265
00:14:13,429 --> 00:14:14,981
That's what I call 'nerve'.

266
00:14:15,262 --> 00:14:16,610
And a leech on the business.

267
00:14:16,915 --> 00:14:18,375
We've got to protect ourselves.

268
00:14:24,832 --> 00:14:26,068
Good evening.
- Mail?

269
00:14:26,837 --> 00:14:29,176
Three telephone calls for you, Mr Nash.
- Thank you.

270
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:39,616
You mustn't get the idea that I'm asking
you to steal models for me in Paris.

271
00:14:40,223 --> 00:14:43,885
What I want is an idea of
the general style trends.

272
00:14:44,172 --> 00:14:45,463
The materials favored.

273
00:14:46,196 --> 00:14:48,820
The new lines and ..
- Possibly a few sketches?

274
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,738
Well yes. If it can be done discreetly.

275
00:14:52,189 --> 00:14:54,234
Of course, you realize
this is strictly confidential?

276
00:14:54,618 --> 00:14:56,885
Mr Duryea, you can trust me implicitly.

277
00:14:57,674 --> 00:14:59,437
Now, what will it cost me?

278
00:14:59,804 --> 00:15:01,277
That will be two thousand a month.

279
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,224
Hmm.

280
00:15:06,094 --> 00:15:09,479
Naturally, I don't want you
to steal any designs in Paris.

281
00:15:09,986 --> 00:15:11,109
But remember.

282
00:15:11,412 --> 00:15:14,637
Nobody must know about our arrangement.

283
00:15:15,245 --> 00:15:17,924
Señor Caponelli, you
can trust me implicitly.

284
00:15:18,215 --> 00:15:19,006
How much?

285
00:15:19,468 --> 00:15:20,999
That will be three thousand a month.

286
00:15:24,756 --> 00:15:26,426
Understand, Mr Nash.

287
00:15:27,072 --> 00:15:30,143
We don't want you to steal
models for us in Paris.

288
00:15:30,372 --> 00:15:31,720
No. That would be unethical.

289
00:15:32,305 --> 00:15:35,576
I'm telling you what has business
got to do with unethical?

290
00:15:35,676 --> 00:15:36,661
I tell you ..

291
00:15:36,761 --> 00:15:38,530
What you boys need is unique ..

292
00:15:38,883 --> 00:15:40,794
Personal representation in Paris. Right?

293
00:15:42,105 --> 00:15:43,682
That's exactly what I'll give you.

294
00:15:43,782 --> 00:15:45,667
You understand, Mr Nash.
This is confidential.

295
00:15:45,767 --> 00:15:48,831
Sure .. and besides,
not a word to nobody.

296
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:51,370
Gentlemen, you can trust me implicitly.

297
00:15:51,693 --> 00:15:53,023
How much does it set us back?

298
00:15:53,134 --> 00:15:54,836
That will cost you five
thousand a month.

299
00:15:58,563 --> 00:16:00,981
Glad tidings my lad. Come and hear them.

300
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:04,308
Well .. we were just about ready
to come down and bail you out.

301
00:16:04,517 --> 00:16:06,706
You won't have to do any bailing
unless we're shipwrecked.

302
00:16:07,054 --> 00:16:08,545
We sail for Paris tomorrow.

303
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:10,466
Then it worked?
- It worked.

304
00:16:10,615 --> 00:16:12,221
Hey, ain't I in on this party?

305
00:16:13,052 --> 00:16:14,468
Now, what could you do in Paris?

306
00:16:16,261 --> 00:16:18,026
What wouldn't I do in Paris?

307
00:16:18,226 --> 00:16:20,558
We could take him along as chaperone.
You'll probably want one.

308
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,080
Well, I don't want one,
but maybe I'll need one.

309
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,169
Paris .. wine and women. Ha.

310
00:16:46,915 --> 00:16:47,530
Hey.

311
00:16:49,002 --> 00:16:50,103
There you are, Madam.

312
00:16:50,338 --> 00:16:50,953
Sir.

313
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:52,056
Thank you.

314
00:16:57,352 --> 00:16:58,883
Well, believe it or not, we made it.

315
00:16:59,253 --> 00:17:01,327
I think I'll get on speaking
terms with my state room.

316
00:17:01,656 --> 00:17:03,979
I think I'll get on speaking
terms with the bar.

317
00:17:04,218 --> 00:17:06,121
Well I'll go and see you
don't talk it to death.

318
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:10,815
Hello sweetheart.

319
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,576
You know darling, I think
I'm going to love Paris.

320
00:17:15,357 --> 00:17:16,580
Oh you do, huh?

321
00:17:18,618 --> 00:17:19,319
Glenda.

322
00:17:19,715 --> 00:17:23,151
Paris is one of the largest cities in
the world but too small to hold us both.

323
00:17:23,397 --> 00:17:26,679
You can go to Timbuktu for all
I care as long as I get my cut.

324
00:17:27,003 --> 00:17:27,618
Cut?

325
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:28,909
What's the idea?

326
00:17:29,009 --> 00:17:31,687
Oh, just a little dash of that
efficiency you admired so much.

327
00:17:32,355 --> 00:17:33,399
Come on baby, give.

328
00:17:33,499 --> 00:17:35,164
Glenda, you know I don't owe you a cent.

329
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:37,959
No argument. Either you
come across or I go across.

330
00:17:38,643 --> 00:17:40,115
[ Ship's horn. Loud ]

331
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:43,125
How much?

332
00:17:43,606 --> 00:17:44,309
Oh.

333
00:17:45,167 --> 00:17:46,240
Three or four grand.

334
00:17:48,537 --> 00:17:49,480
Don't be silly.

335
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:51,747
Oh.

336
00:17:52,288 --> 00:17:53,577
I beg your pardon.

337
00:17:56,358 --> 00:17:57,099
Glenda.

338
00:17:58,241 --> 00:18:00,071
I'll give you two grand
and that's the limit.

339
00:18:00,171 --> 00:18:01,679
Okay, big heart.

340
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,624
Isn't this clubby.

341
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:04,734
Yes, isn't it.

342
00:18:05,027 --> 00:18:07,234
Glenda came down to see me off.
- Isn't that lovely.

343
00:18:07,533 --> 00:18:08,973
The boat is sailing any minute.

344
00:18:09,073 --> 00:18:11,097
You'd better hurry ashore
unless you want to swim.

345
00:18:11,461 --> 00:18:13,176
A thousand thanks.
- Two thousand.

346
00:18:14,745 --> 00:18:15,672
Hurry, please.

347
00:18:16,426 --> 00:18:17,442
Hurry off, please.

348
00:18:17,601 --> 00:18:18,953
Just a moment, just a moment.

349
00:18:19,268 --> 00:18:20,257
Oh there she is.

350
00:18:20,357 --> 00:18:21,315
So long, Snappy.

351
00:18:21,912 --> 00:18:23,146
Get it?
- You bet I did.

352
00:18:23,246 --> 00:18:25,104
So long, Snappy.
- Hope you land a nice job.

353
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:28,165
Don't worry. Harry and I go in business
where you and the mastermind left off.

354
00:18:28,466 --> 00:18:30,997
Hey .. good luck to you, darling.

355
00:18:31,172 --> 00:18:33,188
No hard feelings.
Come on, give us a little kiss.

356
00:18:33,288 --> 00:18:35,423
Sorry, but you must leave.
- Oh, I must say goodbye.

357
00:18:35,523 --> 00:18:36,440
I'm sorry.

358
00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:37,627
So long, Glenda.

359
00:18:38,162 --> 00:18:39,437
What did you get?
- Guess.

360
00:18:39,537 --> 00:18:40,525
A grand?
- Two.

361
00:18:40,761 --> 00:18:41,784
What a woman.

362
00:18:42,602 --> 00:18:43,389
It's gone.

363
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:44,661
Ha-ha-ha.

364
00:18:45,881 --> 00:18:47,365
Ha-ha-ha.

365
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,054
Boy, have I got something to show you.

366
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:02,985
Yes?

367
00:19:04,126 --> 00:19:06,124
Holy smoke. I've been robbed.

368
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,933
No.
- Yes.

369
00:19:08,597 --> 00:19:10,271
How much was it?
- Two thousand dollars.

370
00:19:10,711 --> 00:19:11,593
Two thousand?

371
00:19:12,386 --> 00:19:13,316
That's right.

372
00:20:37,301 --> 00:20:38,704
Do you like any of them, dear?

373
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:41,164
They are very nice but they're
not exactly what I'm looking for.

374
00:20:41,671 --> 00:20:43,516
Haven't you something
a little more exclusive?

375
00:20:43,616 --> 00:20:45,347
These are our latest creations, Madame.

376
00:20:45,447 --> 00:20:48,521
Oh come now, Madame.
Haven't you something really new?

377
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:50,472
Something that hasn't been shown?

378
00:20:51,273 --> 00:20:52,143
I will see.

379
00:20:52,475 --> 00:20:54,277
Wait, Monsieur.
- Merci, Madame.

380
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,200
Better keep working
on the old girl in black.

381
00:21:06,852 --> 00:21:08,265
She's a pretty tough bird.

382
00:21:08,912 --> 00:21:10,242
Turn on your charm, Sherwood.

383
00:21:10,581 --> 00:21:11,975
No woman can resist you.

384
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,332
Your resistance is still pretty good.

385
00:21:21,736 --> 00:21:22,866
Just a minute, please.

386
00:21:23,186 --> 00:21:24,397
Just a moment, please.

387
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,315
I'd like to see that again.

388
00:21:29,673 --> 00:21:30,690
Once more?

389
00:21:42,639 --> 00:21:44,896
What time do you relaxez-vous?

390
00:21:48,097 --> 00:21:48,884
Hey, Snap.

391
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:52,373
You are right, governor.

392
00:22:07,998 --> 00:22:10,956
This is very special, Monsieur.
It has not yet been shown to the trade.

393
00:22:13,449 --> 00:22:14,236
Very nice.

394
00:22:14,681 --> 00:22:15,345
Hmm.

395
00:22:15,965 --> 00:22:17,943
I'm afraid it is rather extreme for me.

396
00:22:18,258 --> 00:22:21,262
Well you don't have to decide now, dear.
Why don't you think it over?

397
00:22:21,646 --> 00:22:22,576
I think I will.

398
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:23,751
Oh yes.

399
00:22:24,244 --> 00:22:26,776
You've been more than obliging, Madame.
- It was a pleasure, Monsieur.

400
00:22:27,053 --> 00:22:28,898
I hope we haven't put you
to too much trouble.

401
00:22:29,062 --> 00:22:30,643
Au revoir.

402
00:23:04,065 --> 00:23:06,692
What I could do to a
nice juicy hamburger.

403
00:23:07,171 --> 00:23:09,051
One can think better
on an empty stomach.

404
00:23:09,314 --> 00:23:12,229
Yeah? I ought to be able to do
some elegant thinking right now.

405
00:23:12,437 --> 00:23:13,949
Filthy pictures?
- What?

406
00:23:14,179 --> 00:23:15,137
Filthy pictures.

407
00:23:18,489 --> 00:23:20,193
Merci, Monsieur Baroque.

408
00:23:20,491 --> 00:23:21,762
Au revoir, mon ami.

409
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,026
Au revoir.

410
00:23:34,867 --> 00:23:37,275
Pardon Monsieur. Parlez-vous anglais?

411
00:23:37,718 --> 00:23:39,209
Sure.
- Oh, swell.

412
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:40,100
Say.

413
00:23:40,403 --> 00:23:42,095
Was that Baroque, the couturier?

414
00:23:43,249 --> 00:23:45,598
Sure. There is only one Baroque.

415
00:23:46,503 --> 00:23:48,381
Is he a customer of yours?
- Yes.

416
00:23:48,643 --> 00:23:51,445
He buys all these ancient
books on costumes from me.

417
00:23:52,016 --> 00:23:53,230
Sherry.
- Huh?

418
00:23:54,629 --> 00:23:56,016
Does that look familiar to you?

419
00:23:57,245 --> 00:23:58,032
Why, sure.

420
00:23:58,323 --> 00:24:00,771
It's exactly like one of those
models we saw at Baroques.

421
00:24:00,991 --> 00:24:02,119
You see, Monsieur.

422
00:24:02,433 --> 00:24:05,002
The fashion is like .. how you say it?

423
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,039
A cycle.

424
00:24:06,267 --> 00:24:10,236
What is passé now will be the
fashion in maybe fifty years.

425
00:24:10,621 --> 00:24:11,723
Maybe a hundred.

426
00:24:12,071 --> 00:24:14,126
Baroque gets all his ideas
from books like these.

427
00:24:31,894 --> 00:24:34,229
Say, I'll take this. How much is it?

428
00:24:35,047 --> 00:24:36,120
Seventy-five Francs.

429
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:39,717
Hey, Snap.

430
00:24:40,293 --> 00:24:41,709
Would you let me have 25 Francs?

431
00:24:42,386 --> 00:24:43,356
I'm flat.

432
00:24:45,941 --> 00:24:47,574
Thank you.
- I had just 25 left.

433
00:24:48,176 --> 00:24:49,744
Au Revoir, Monsieur.
- Au Revoir.

434
00:24:51,675 --> 00:24:55,128
Hey, we're starving to death and
you buy old books. What's the idea?

435
00:24:56,268 --> 00:24:57,312
I've been thinking.

436
00:24:57,779 --> 00:25:00,339
See here. If Baroque can borrow
from the past, why can't you?

437
00:25:00,615 --> 00:25:01,651
I can easily.

438
00:25:02,225 --> 00:25:03,643
Who wants to buy my sketches?

439
00:25:03,884 --> 00:25:06,583
Ah, but when they reach our New York
clients they won't be <i>your</i> sketches.

440
00:25:06,983 --> 00:25:09,006
A little gentle forgery
will take care of that.

441
00:25:09,495 --> 00:25:11,939
They will then bear the distinguishes
signatures of Baroque ..

442
00:25:12,466 --> 00:25:13,640
Savarin and DeVrille.

443
00:25:14,185 --> 00:25:15,918
Do I make myself clear, Lieutenant?

444
00:25:16,524 --> 00:25:17,841
Very clear, Captain.

445
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,974
Why, Tibby.

446
00:25:35,949 --> 00:25:37,908
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

447
00:25:45,447 --> 00:25:47,548
You may wait, Perkins.
- Shut up, sir.

448
00:25:48,207 --> 00:25:49,743
Is something troubling you, my man?

449
00:25:49,843 --> 00:25:51,802
I'm tired of being dressed
up in this monkey suit.

450
00:25:52,223 --> 00:25:54,030
Don't crab Perkins,
we must keep up a punt.

451
00:25:54,284 --> 00:25:55,553
Besides, I'm hungry.

452
00:25:56,672 --> 00:25:57,908
Don't be crude, Perkins.

453
00:26:01,189 --> 00:26:02,876
Bonjour Monsieur.

454
00:26:03,339 --> 00:26:04,126
Hiya, Kid.

455
00:26:07,748 --> 00:26:09,787
Hey, come here with that key.
What's the idea?

456
00:26:10,992 --> 00:26:12,048
Ah, good morning.

457
00:26:12,925 --> 00:26:13,797
Good morning.

458
00:26:14,457 --> 00:26:16,901
My dear, I only stopped in at
the Ritz bar for a few minutes.

459
00:26:17,447 --> 00:26:18,675
What pried you loose?

460
00:26:19,231 --> 00:26:23,042
Do I detect a slight note, a
mere soupçon of disapproval?

461
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:25,120
Listen Sherry, I'm worried.

462
00:26:25,635 --> 00:26:28,533
Ah. No news from New York, huh?
- No. Not a nickel's worth.

463
00:26:29,859 --> 00:26:31,533
Say, that's pretty good.

464
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,375
Pretty good? I'll have
you know it's very good.

465
00:26:34,763 --> 00:26:36,621
What is it? Savarin or DeVrille?

466
00:26:36,884 --> 00:26:39,753
No, stupid. 24 carat pure Baroque.

467
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,223
Of course.

468
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:45,077
Now look.

469
00:26:50,215 --> 00:26:51,545
Signed by the master himself.

470
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,096
Here is a perfect Savarin.

471
00:26:55,387 --> 00:26:56,236
Savarin.

472
00:26:58,322 --> 00:26:58,994
Voila.

473
00:27:00,266 --> 00:27:00,995
Come in.

474
00:27:02,374 --> 00:27:03,964
Bonjour Monsieur Nash.
- Bonjour.

475
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,182
Merci.

476
00:27:05,539 --> 00:27:06,254
Duryea.

477
00:27:08,088 --> 00:27:08,984
Let us pray.

478
00:27:13,216 --> 00:27:15,834
He is glad to see that our cable
complaining of delay resulted in action.

479
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:18,487
He congratulates you on obtaining
these excellent sketches.

480
00:27:18,633 --> 00:27:20,882
And predicts the models will
be large sellers in New York.

481
00:27:21,188 --> 00:27:22,787
Enclosed, please find our check ..

482
00:27:24,158 --> 00:27:24,830
For ..

483
00:27:25,802 --> 00:27:27,398
Five hundred dollars.

484
00:27:27,864 --> 00:27:29,151
Oh baby, we've made it.

485
00:27:36,663 --> 00:27:38,278
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

486
00:27:38,855 --> 00:27:41,342
I'm not accustomed to having
people holler at me like this.

487
00:27:41,632 --> 00:27:43,538
Besides, I don't know
what you're talking about.

488
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,047
Beat it. Beat it.

489
00:27:49,302 --> 00:27:50,840
Nuts .. nuts .. nuts.

490
00:27:51,328 --> 00:27:51,971
Nuts.

491
00:27:52,427 --> 00:27:54,443
Noisettes. Noisettes.

492
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,980
I demand the courtesy due a foreigner.

493
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:03,917
Well, what seems to be the trouble?

494
00:28:04,017 --> 00:28:06,606
I don't know. This guy grabs the key
and then they both start hollering.

495
00:28:14,381 --> 00:28:15,196
What is it?

496
00:28:15,635 --> 00:28:17,975
Payment on the car. Slightly overdue.

497
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:19,289
How much?

498
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:21,758
Five hundred dollars.

499
00:28:23,275 --> 00:28:25,031
Oh well .. that's a cinch.

500
00:28:26,155 --> 00:28:28,683
Avez-vous la plume de ma mere?

501
00:28:32,076 --> 00:28:33,885
I'll .. just endorse this.

502
00:28:36,931 --> 00:28:37,603
Voila.

503
00:28:37,703 --> 00:28:38,718
La clef, Monsieur.

504
00:28:39,255 --> 00:28:39,927
Merci.

505
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:42,999
Au revoir. Au revoir.

506
00:28:43,602 --> 00:28:45,530
What's it all about?
Are we in the money again?

507
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,917
We were, for a minute.

508
00:28:47,215 --> 00:28:48,717
Yes. Now you see it, and now don't.

509
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,318
What do you mean?
- It's a long story, Perkins.

510
00:28:51,775 --> 00:28:54,036
The Embassy.
- What are we going to use for money?

511
00:28:54,573 --> 00:28:56,132
Don't worry. I'll think of something.

512
00:29:08,604 --> 00:29:09,784
And for you, Monsieur?

513
00:29:10,242 --> 00:29:12,431
Champagne cocktails.
- Champagne cocktails. Oui, Monsieur.

514
00:29:12,814 --> 00:29:13,715
Are you crazy?

515
00:29:14,207 --> 00:29:15,537
Who is going to pay for them?

516
00:29:15,989 --> 00:29:18,159
My dear, they say if you stay
at this bar long enough ..

517
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:19,789
You'll meet everybody in the world.

518
00:29:20,169 --> 00:29:22,452
Do you think I might meet
somebody with a sandwich?

519
00:29:23,225 --> 00:29:26,777
Now don't be a pessimist, my dear.
Why, the world is our oyster.

520
00:29:27,009 --> 00:29:28,784
What did you say? What did you say?

521
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:31,006
I say the world is our oyster.

522
00:29:31,641 --> 00:29:33,241
Oh, oysters ain't in season.

523
00:29:33,768 --> 00:29:35,518
Ah, now don't you be a pessimist.

524
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,966
Cheerio, Mr Ward.

525
00:29:40,776 --> 00:29:41,992
How did you know my name?

526
00:29:42,767 --> 00:29:45,232
Well my dear sir, I happen to
have the gift of second sight.

527
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,279
And you seem to be depressed.
Is something on your mind?

528
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,835
I say, my name is Sherwood Nash.

529
00:29:52,086 --> 00:29:53,739
Hello.
- Maybe I can help you?

530
00:29:54,098 --> 00:29:56,319
Yes. It would be much better
if your name was Houdini.

531
00:29:56,692 --> 00:29:58,223
Hold on, look at this. Look at this.

532
00:30:01,378 --> 00:30:02,680
How about a little sandwich?

533
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:07,531
Here, look at that. Look at that.

534
00:30:08,363 --> 00:30:09,367
A lovely plume.

535
00:30:09,467 --> 00:30:11,259

That will be all, Miss Lynn.

711
00:38:45,033 --> 00:38:46,449
Your Highness, Monsieur Baroque.

712
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:48,061
Allow me to present Senator Ward.

713
00:38:50,004 --> 00:38:52,261
Senator .. the Grand Duchess Alex.

714
00:38:52,586 --> 00:38:53,573
Monsieur Baroque.

715
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,055
In America, the senator is known
as the 'Ostrich-feather king'.

716
00:39:03,891 --> 00:39:05,518
What a dumbbell Sherry is.

717
00:39:05,791 --> 00:39:07,042
But what a showman.

718
00:39:07,142 --> 00:39:09,008
Why does he want to go
into show business ..

719
00:39:09,108 --> 00:39:11,410
Just as our sketches are
catching on in New York.

720
00:39:11,774 --> 00:39:14,259
Oh, that's only chickenfeed
compared to this racket.

721
00:39:15,277 --> 00:39:16,560
Get a load of that Duchess.

722
00:39:16,842 --> 00:39:18,964
Isn't she a honey?
- Yeah, sweet.

723
00:39:19,654 --> 00:39:21,520
Uhuh .. catty, catty.

724
00:39:24,843 --> 00:39:26,461
Why of all people, Savarin?

725
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:28,481
He is no artist. He has no soul.

726
00:39:28,755 --> 00:39:31,151
Well, Senator Ward insists upon Savarin.

727
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:32,450
Don't you, Senator?

728
00:39:35,412 --> 00:39:36,656
I say: don't you, senator?

729
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:39,091
Why don't I what?

730
00:39:39,191 --> 00:39:41,193
The senator is just a
little hard of hearing.

731
00:39:41,987 --> 00:39:44,516
You see Monsieur Baroque, Senator
Ward is my partner in this revue.

732
00:39:44,784 --> 00:39:46,679
And of course, his is
always the last word.

733
00:39:47,146 --> 00:39:47,961
Positively.

734
00:39:48,092 --> 00:39:51,723
I am willing to buy out Senator
Ward's interest in the revue.

735
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:55,101
Well I .. I hardly think the
senator would consider that.

736
00:39:55,466 --> 00:39:59,152
Oh but I would not be happy unless
Mr Baroque designed my costumes.

737
00:40:01,014 --> 00:40:02,371
Would I, Oscar?

738
00:40:02,958 --> 00:40:03,951
Senator Ward.

739
00:40:04,539 --> 00:40:06,437
What would you want for your interest?

740
00:40:07,045 --> 00:40:10,355
Well the senator's interest
amounts to $75,000.

741
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:12,060
Would you sell for that?

742
00:40:13,623 --> 00:40:15,211
What's the matter, you think I'm deaf?

743
00:40:18,987 --> 00:40:20,891
We're in the bag, we're in the bag.

744
00:40:22,661 --> 00:40:24,907
And who will be left holding it?
- What's the matter, honey?

745
00:40:25,044 --> 00:40:27,423
I do wish he'd stick to
one racket at a time.

746
00:40:27,584 --> 00:40:28,880
Or one girl, huh?

747
00:40:31,389 --> 00:40:33,117
To whom shall I make this check pay out?

748
00:40:33,465 --> 00:40:34,704
To cash.

749
00:40:34,922 --> 00:40:35,620
Nash?

750
00:40:36,122 --> 00:40:36,766
Cash.

751
00:40:37,173 --> 00:40:39,192
I handle all the finances
for Senator Ward.

752
00:40:39,712 --> 00:40:40,709
And myself.

753
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:42,231
Voila.

754
00:40:42,626 --> 00:40:43,891
Thank you, Mr Baroque.

755
00:40:44,206 --> 00:40:45,487
On behalf of the senator.

756
00:40:46,071 --> 00:40:48,463
You know, if I may say so, I think
we're all to be congratulated.

757
00:40:48,563 --> 00:40:49,899
Absolutely. Monsieur Nash.

758
00:40:50,064 --> 00:40:53,155
If you will give me the honor of your
charming society at luncheon tomorrow ..

759
00:40:53,255 --> 00:40:56,000
We will discuss the necessary details.
- I shall be delighted.

760
00:40:56,225 --> 00:40:58,675
I'm sure our revue will
have a grand success.

761
00:40:59,406 --> 00:41:02,129
Her Highness's charm and
reputation guarantees that.

762
00:41:03,243 --> 00:41:04,430
Au revoir.
- Au revoir.

763
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,511
A demain.
- Au revoir, Monsieur.

764
00:41:09,983 --> 00:41:11,687
Well, Senator. Didn't I tell you?

765
00:41:12,482 --> 00:41:14,442
We're in the money.
- Yeah, well how about my cut?

766
00:41:15,142 --> 00:41:16,346
Oh my dear Joe.

767
00:41:16,542 --> 00:41:18,844
This money goes right into the show.
- Yeah I know, but ..

768
00:41:19,015 --> 00:41:21,876
You know, this show will cause
such a craze for ostrich feathers ..

769
00:41:21,976 --> 00:41:24,474
That your ostriches will have to
work day and night. Double shifts.

770
00:41:24,674 --> 00:41:27,705
Then I'd better cable California and
buy some more ostrich roosters.

771
00:41:29,631 --> 00:41:31,981
Oh Snap, just take care of the senator.

772
00:41:37,076 --> 00:41:40,184
Congratulations, Sherry.
You're just as smooth as ever.

773
00:41:41,484 --> 00:41:42,070
Oh.

774
00:41:42,783 --> 00:41:44,066
Just as smooth as ever.

775
00:41:52,471 --> 00:41:53,244
Lynn.

776
00:41:56,698 --> 00:41:58,467
Oh .. baby.

777
00:41:58,909 --> 00:41:59,696
It worked.

778
00:42:01,538 --> 00:42:02,451
So I see.

779
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,436
Well, what's the matter, honey?
Aren't you pleased?

780
00:42:06,116 --> 00:42:08,680
We stand to make a fortune out of this.
You can't tell where we'll end.

781
00:42:08,844 --> 00:42:10,117
Oh, I know where we'll end.

782
00:42:10,916 --> 00:42:13,021
I don't see why you
don't have faith in me.

783
00:42:13,293 --> 00:42:14,800
Well, look in the mirror and see.

784
00:42:52,187 --> 00:42:53,836
How about a little relaxez-vous?

785
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,757
Senator. Are you ready
for a still picture?

786
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:44,403
Just a moment, now. Just a moment.

787
00:43:45,004 --> 00:43:45,848
What the ..?

788
00:43:49,616 --> 00:43:50,517
There you are.

789
00:43:50,622 --> 00:43:51,866
Hold it .. still.

790
00:43:52,697 --> 00:43:53,393
Voila.

791
00:43:53,493 --> 00:43:55,070
Fine. Now let's get one with Nash.

792
00:43:56,035 --> 00:43:57,389
That's the second act finale.

793
00:43:57,679 --> 00:43:59,066
I practically wrote it for you.

794
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:01,198
Suppose you say the rest with the music.

795
00:44:01,623 --> 00:44:03,322
Come on. Do a Helen Morgan.

796
00:44:03,758 --> 00:44:04,974
Sit there and inspire me.

797
00:44:05,293 --> 00:44:06,022
Alright.

798
00:44:10,256 --> 00:44:12,194
Oh Mr Nash, I've been looking for you.

799
00:44:12,294 --> 00:44:14,086
Oh yes?
- What do you think of that?

800
00:44:14,702 --> 00:44:15,317
Say.

801
00:44:15,877 --> 00:44:17,611
What do you think of
that for a fan, huh?

802
00:44:17,711 --> 00:44:18,679
A fan?
- Yeah.

803
00:44:19,062 --> 00:44:20,449
Why that is a complete costume.

804
00:44:36,339 --> 00:44:37,755
Snap.
- You're right, governor.

805
00:44:40,033 --> 00:44:40,919
Lynn.

806
00:44:46,948 --> 00:44:49,574
Too bad you don't get along better
with our young American composer.

807
00:44:49,674 --> 00:44:51,632
Oh, Jimmy is a darling.
Don't you like him?

808
00:44:52,133 --> 00:44:53,894
My passion for him
is well under control.

809
00:44:53,994 --> 00:44:55,467
Mr Nash, Peter is looking for you.

810
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:56,783
I'll be right there.

811
00:44:57,896 --> 00:44:59,875
Are you lunching with me today?
- If you like.

812
00:45:05,957 --> 00:45:06,629
Oscar.

813
00:45:07,143 --> 00:45:09,890
Do go and see if my second act
costume is ready for fitting, yes?

814
00:45:10,483 --> 00:45:11,384
Tout de suite.

815
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:16,563
Ah, bonjour Monsieur.
- Bonjour Monsieur.

816
00:45:16,866 --> 00:45:17,772
Your Highness.

817
00:45:18,183 --> 00:45:19,313
I say, that's not bad.

818
00:45:19,442 --> 00:45:21,061
Not bad? C'est magnifique.

819
00:45:23,925 --> 00:45:25,246
Oh Sherry.
- Yes?

820
00:45:25,717 --> 00:45:27,424
The Duchess, she wants help.

821
00:45:27,948 --> 00:45:29,021
Ah .. Your Highness.

822
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:31,044
At your service.

823
00:45:36,741 --> 00:45:37,327
Oh.

824
00:45:38,715 --> 00:45:39,731
I beg your pardon.

825
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:44,821
Say, what is this Lynn
girl to you anyway?

826
00:45:45,514 --> 00:45:48,398
Now don't you start. I'm having
enough trouble explaining you to her.

827
00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:00,093
Oh! You.

828
00:46:00,727 --> 00:46:02,464
Say Lynn, how about
having lunch with me?

829
00:46:02,681 --> 00:46:03,982
No thanks, Jimmy. Not today.

830
00:46:05,075 --> 00:46:06,148
You got other plans?

831
00:46:06,287 --> 00:46:09,556
Oh, I forgot. You're still carrying
a torch for that Nash, aren't you?

832
00:46:10,084 --> 00:46:11,954
Listen, Lynn. I'm crazy about you.

833
00:46:12,389 --> 00:46:14,542
Why don't you forget that worthless ..
- No account.

834
00:46:14,642 --> 00:46:16,044
Double-crossing.
- Two-timing.

835
00:46:16,144 --> 00:46:17,453
Unscrupulous.
- Unfaithful.

836
00:46:17,655 --> 00:46:19,552
Son of a ..
- So and so. It's no use, Jimmy.

837
00:46:20,104 --> 00:46:21,877
I can top every adjective
you can give me.

838
00:46:22,084 --> 00:46:23,555
I see. It's a case of ..

839
00:46:23,785 --> 00:46:26,636
Oh my man, I love him so.
He'll never go.

840
00:46:26,808 --> 00:46:27,782
Oh, stop it.

841
00:47:04,614 --> 00:47:06,360
Quick, quick. My next change.

842
00:47:07,047 --> 00:47:08,736
Oh baby, baby.

843
00:47:09,375 --> 00:47:10,889
Just in time to congratulate you.

844
00:47:10,989 --> 00:47:12,958
No kidding, Sherry. How was I?
Did they like me?

845
00:47:13,058 --> 00:47:16,166
Like you? Listen to them. If you're half
as good in the second act as the first.

846
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,313
Well Duchess, they'll make a Queen.

847
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:48,567
Senator.

848
00:47:59,489 --> 00:48:01,908
You want to make as much
money as possible, do you not?

849
00:48:02,008 --> 00:48:02,988
I certainly do.

850
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:05,917
Now, you and I, Senator, can
rule the ostrich-feather world.

851
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:07,549
No use. I'm tied up with Nash.

852
00:48:07,649 --> 00:48:10,682
What is tied can be untied by a
clever lawyer. I have an attorney.

853
00:48:10,847 --> 00:48:12,754
Yes, but I gave him
an option. He can sue.

854
00:48:12,945 --> 00:48:14,032
A scrap of paper.

855
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:16,719
I can do more for you than this Nash.

856
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:19,299
We will have my lawyer void the option.

857
00:48:19,629 --> 00:48:22,404
At the worst he can only sue us.
What else can he do?

858
00:48:22,845 --> 00:48:23,558
Oscar.

859
00:48:24,812 --> 00:48:25,885
You'll be surprised.

860
00:48:40,579 --> 00:48:43,177
[ Singing: ]

861
00:56:04,568 --> 00:56:05,669
Ladies and gentlemen.

862
00:56:05,991 --> 00:56:08,784
All the charm, all the glamour
you've seen this evening.

863
00:56:09,268 --> 00:56:11,780
Was presented, executed and designed ..

864
00:56:12,095 --> 00:56:15,567
By the energy, the enthusiasm
and the genius of one man.

865
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:18,002
Mr Sherwood Nash.

866
00:56:29,984 --> 00:56:31,085
Ladies and gentlemen.

867
00:56:31,539 --> 00:56:34,633
I've always been told that
when good Americans die ..

868
00:56:35,332 --> 00:56:36,519
They don't go to heaven.

869
00:56:37,174 --> 00:56:38,217
They go to Paris.

870
00:56:40,961 --> 00:56:43,001
Smart Americans don't
wait until they die.

871
00:56:43,329 --> 00:56:44,883
They don't want to take any chances.

872
00:56:46,443 --> 00:56:47,258
My friends.

873
00:56:47,655 --> 00:56:50,600
Tonight you have seen more
than the première of a revue.

874
00:56:51,337 --> 00:56:53,119
You have seen the birth of an idea.

875
00:56:54,017 --> 00:56:55,004
I am not content.

876
00:56:55,298 --> 00:56:57,605
Merely to give you fashion
over the footlights.

877
00:56:58,490 --> 00:57:00,563
I want to bring it to
you into your home.

878
00:57:01,518 --> 00:57:02,982
It is my plan therefore.

879
00:57:03,345 --> 00:57:05,467
To establish here in your great city.

880
00:57:05,872 --> 00:57:10,022
An institution dedicated to
the highest ideals of fashion.

881
00:57:10,539 --> 00:57:12,394
A temple of creative art.

882
00:57:12,871 --> 00:57:14,679
Where I may offer for your approval.

883
00:57:15,064 --> 00:57:18,126
The most advance
conceptions in modern style.

884
00:57:19,639 --> 00:57:21,525
This establishment I shall call ..

885
00:57:21,865 --> 00:57:23,209
Maison Elegance.

886
00:57:23,823 --> 00:57:24,724
Where I trust.

887
00:57:24,951 --> 00:57:27,593
I shall continue to have
the pleasure of catering ..

888
00:57:27,855 --> 00:57:29,966
To your discrimination and taste.

889
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:32,326
It is my further hope.

890
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,298
That Maison Elegance.

891
00:57:34,734 --> 00:57:36,498
Will prove a worthy successor.

892
00:57:36,848 --> 00:57:38,356
To the house of Oscar Baroque.

893
00:57:38,656 --> 00:57:40,551
Your reigning king of fashion.

894
00:57:41,115 --> 00:57:43,776
Who I learn .. is about to abdicate.

895
00:57:45,015 --> 00:57:45,981
I thank you.

896
00:57:58,303 --> 00:57:59,996
Alright?
- Governor, you wowed them.

897
00:58:00,286 --> 00:58:01,963
We'll put that guy on ice.

898
00:58:02,313 --> 00:58:03,041
Sold.

899
00:58:04,436 --> 00:58:06,255
Why, you crook. What does this mean?

900
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:08,583
Oscar, I told you you'd be surprised.

901
00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:10,567
What about your contract with me?

902
00:58:10,845 --> 00:58:12,490
What is tied can be untied.

903
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:13,992
You cannot break this contract.

904
00:58:14,092 --> 00:58:15,644
A contract? A piece of paper.

905
00:58:15,876 --> 00:58:19,068
You cannot bluff me. I am not to be
taken in. I am the king of fashion.

906
00:58:19,491 --> 00:58:20,961
Well for your information, Oscar.

907
00:58:21,251 --> 00:58:23,447
A king can always be taken by an ace.

908
00:58:47,673 --> 00:58:50,794
But they are beautiful. Tell me, does it
hurt the ostrich when they are plucked?

909
00:58:51,417 --> 00:58:54,617
Madame, our patented plucking
process is practically painless.

910
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:04,077
Monsieur Nash, tell me.
I am so interested.

911
00:59:04,377 --> 00:59:06,372
Do you supervise all details of this?

912
00:59:06,798 --> 00:59:08,585
Even to the page girls' costumes?

913
00:59:08,818 --> 00:59:11,194
Oh yes, I take care of everything,
from the bottom up.

914
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:15,305
How do you do.
- Monsieur Nash.

915
00:59:15,493 --> 00:59:17,159
I want you to do my entire trousseau.

916
00:59:17,259 --> 00:59:20,515
Bridal gown, going-away dress, lingerie.
You handle lingerie, don't you?

917
00:59:20,731 --> 00:59:22,805
Oh yes, I take care of that personally.

918
00:59:26,092 --> 00:59:27,075
Ah, thank you.

919
00:59:27,259 --> 00:59:29,485
You serve the most delicious caviar.

920
00:59:30,105 --> 00:59:32,139
Yes, it comes from contented sturgeons.

921
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:35,315
Monsieur Nash.
- Yes?

922
00:59:35,415 --> 00:59:37,895
This is all very beautiful.
But where are the dresses?

923
00:59:38,292 --> 00:59:39,577
Ah, Madame. Have patience.

924
00:59:40,182 --> 00:59:41,654
My creations are like jewels.

925
00:59:42,004 --> 00:59:43,420
They require the proper setting.

926
00:59:53,037 --> 00:59:55,306
Monsieur, Monsieur.
Madame has just arrived.

927
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:09,639
Sherry, it is late. You can't keep
those people waiting here all day.

928
01:00:09,936 --> 01:00:12,064
Don't worry baby. As long
as it is food, they'll wait.

929
01:00:14,209 --> 01:00:15,446
Governor .. here she is.

930
01:00:21,623 --> 01:00:23,334
The Grand Duchess, Alex.

931
01:00:33,098 --> 01:00:34,255
You're late, Duchess.

932
01:00:34,355 --> 01:00:36,658
If Baroque discovers I've been
here, I'll <i>be </i>the late Duchess.

933
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:37,841
How do you do.

934
01:03:19,323 --> 01:03:21,350
I regret we haven't been
able to please you, Madam.

935
01:03:21,606 --> 01:03:24,001
They have nothing. We'll go
over to the Maison Elegance.

936
01:03:31,310 --> 01:03:32,732
Mesdames, Messieurs.

937
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:36,769
We are all suffering at the hands
of this unscrupulous American.

938
01:03:37,833 --> 01:03:39,154
Your showroom, Savarin.

939
01:03:39,515 --> 01:03:40,759
And yours Madame DeVrille.

940
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:42,507
And yours and yours and yours.

941
01:03:42,808 --> 01:03:43,939
Are as empty as mine.

942
01:03:44,433 --> 01:03:46,002
What are we going to do about it?

943
01:03:46,309 --> 01:03:47,124
My friends.

944
01:03:47,558 --> 01:03:49,892
I have here cables from
my agents in New York.

945
01:03:50,397 --> 01:03:52,257
Reports from my detectives in Paris.

946
01:03:53,123 --> 01:03:56,774
Proving that this Nash is selling
forged sketches in New York.

947
01:03:57,079 --> 01:03:57,793
What?

948
01:03:58,003 --> 01:03:59,278
Sketches signed 'Baroque'.

949
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:00,852
Signed 'DeVrille'.

950
01:04:00,952 --> 01:04:01,998
Signed 'Savarin'.

951
01:04:02,098 --> 01:04:04,430
We must protect ourselves.
- Something must be done at once.

952
01:04:04,530 --> 01:04:05,790
Yes.
- Go to the police.

953
01:04:05,890 --> 01:04:07,421
Monsieur Baroque, what shall we do?

954
01:04:07,647 --> 01:04:11,187
I am glad to see that in this crisis
we cease to be competitors.

955
01:04:12,164 --> 01:04:14,748
We must unite to drive this
thief out of our country.

956
01:04:14,979 --> 01:04:15,708
Exactly.

957
01:04:15,808 --> 01:04:18,376
Here is my plan to get rid of Nash.

958
01:04:19,327 --> 01:04:22,397
We must get the feathers through customs
right away. When did the boat dock?

959
01:04:22,632 --> 01:04:24,705
Yesterday morning.
But it seems there's a hitch.

960
01:04:25,186 --> 01:04:27,815
Why don't you drive down to the Customs
House yourself and unhitch them?

961
01:04:27,915 --> 01:04:29,330
We're up to our eyes in orders.

962
01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:31,851
And cable California to step up
production. We're way behind.

963
01:04:32,248 --> 01:04:34,287
I've got 50,000 eggs all ready to hatch.

964
01:04:34,707 --> 01:04:36,652
Well women don't wear eggs.
They wear feathers.

965
01:04:36,887 --> 01:04:38,796
But you can't hurry
mother nature, Mr Nash.

966
01:04:38,896 --> 01:04:39,984
No, I suppose not.

967
01:04:40,183 --> 01:04:41,170
Say, I've got it.

968
01:04:42,455 --> 01:04:44,810
Women buy unborn baby
lamb for furs, don't they?

969
01:04:45,239 --> 01:04:45,856
Yes.

970
01:04:46,348 --> 01:04:48,992
We'll ship the eggs over here and
sell them unborn baby ostrich.

971
01:04:49,227 --> 01:04:50,394
That's great, great.

972
01:04:50,556 --> 01:04:52,859
On your way, Senator.
- Just as soon as I have a drop of luck.

973
01:04:53,915 --> 01:04:56,570
Now, are you going to do it?
Tell me, what time will you be there?

974
01:04:57,362 --> 01:04:58,760
I didn't quite get that, honey.

975
01:04:59,354 --> 01:05:00,611
What time, Cheri?

976
01:05:01,113 --> 01:05:01,757
Snap.

977
01:05:03,712 --> 01:05:04,871
You're right, governor.

978
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:05,704
What?

979
01:05:06,345 --> 01:05:07,389
Something I forgot.

980
01:05:09,319 --> 01:05:12,242
Don't you see, Lynn? You simply have to
make up your mind as I'm going away.

981
01:05:12,602 --> 01:05:14,754
You're leaving the show?
- Yes, I'm going to Berlin.

982
01:05:15,826 --> 01:05:16,985
Won't you come with me?

983
01:05:17,381 --> 01:05:18,707
I'm asking you to marry me.

984
01:05:19,169 --> 01:05:20,242
I don't know, Jimmy.

985
01:05:20,357 --> 01:05:22,717
Don't be such a little fool.
You know Nash will never marry you.

986
01:05:23,055 --> 01:05:24,592
How can you go on believing in him?

987
01:05:24,692 --> 01:05:27,532
He said he'd quit after the show didn't
he? Look at this. He'll never quit.

988
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:30,072
He'll drag you from racket to racket.
- Jimmy. Please stop this.

989
01:05:30,307 --> 01:05:33,632
He's just using you. You do all the work
while he fools around with the Duchess.

990
01:05:34,122 --> 01:05:34,860
I see.

991
01:05:35,589 --> 01:05:36,778
Dirty work, huh?

992
01:05:37,362 --> 01:05:38,811
I must see you alone at once.

993
01:05:39,275 --> 01:05:40,754
Yes, something very important.

994
01:05:41,309 --> 01:05:42,754
Can't you tell me over the phone?

995
01:05:44,997 --> 01:05:45,726
Alright.

996
01:05:45,963 --> 01:05:46,835
I'll be here.

997
01:05:47,576 --> 01:05:48,363
Au revoir.

998
01:05:54,449 --> 01:05:56,096
I love you Lynn. I could make you happy.

999
01:05:57,973 --> 01:05:59,430
Am I interrupting a sale?

1000
01:05:59,602 --> 01:06:01,104
I hope you heard what I was saying.

1001
01:06:01,306 --> 01:06:03,782
The lyrics are charming. You must
let me hear the music sometime.

1002
01:06:03,882 --> 01:06:06,092
I'm trying to persuade Lynn
to forget you and marry me.

1003
01:06:07,724 --> 01:06:09,941
If she's smart, that's probably
what she would do.

1004
01:06:11,117 --> 01:06:12,133
Did you hear that?

1005
01:06:12,384 --> 01:06:13,600
Sherry, do you mean that?

1006
01:06:14,054 --> 01:06:15,785
Do you really want me
to go away with him?

1007
01:06:16,983 --> 01:06:17,970
No baby, I don't.

1008
01:06:19,067 --> 01:06:21,187
But he'd probably make you
much happier than I would.

1009
01:06:31,922 --> 01:06:33,309
Darling, will you come with me?

1010
01:06:33,582 --> 01:06:35,470
Oh Jimmy, I don't know what to do.

1011
01:06:35,758 --> 01:06:38,304
You know when my train is.
Will you try and make up your mind?

1012
01:06:38,596 --> 01:06:39,617
Yes, I'll try.

1013
01:06:56,063 --> 01:06:57,279
Are you in love with him?

1014
01:06:57,475 --> 01:06:59,849
Jimmy is a grand person
and he's the soul of honor.

1015
01:07:00,508 --> 01:07:01,438
And I'm a heel?

1016
01:07:01,575 --> 01:07:03,588
Don't be so funny.
- Baby.

1017
01:07:04,222 --> 01:07:05,451
I'll make you a promise.

1018
01:07:05,551 --> 01:07:07,075
I'm so tired of your promises.

1019
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:08,745
But this one is different, honey.

1020
01:07:09,234 --> 01:07:10,021
I mean it.

1021
01:07:10,497 --> 01:07:11,228
Well ..

1022
01:07:11,526 --> 01:07:13,687
Give me two more weeks
to wind this up and I'll quit.

1023
01:07:13,851 --> 01:07:15,917
I'll cash in and we'll
go back to America.

1024
01:07:16,231 --> 01:07:17,809
What about your titled girlfriend?

1025
01:07:18,372 --> 01:07:20,397
When in the first place,
she isn't my girlfriend.

1026
01:07:20,497 --> 01:07:22,517
And in the second place,
her title is phony.

1027
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:24,678
What do you mean?

1028
01:07:24,778 --> 01:07:28,109
I mean that the Grand Duchess Alex
is plain Mabel McGuire of Hoboken.

1029
01:07:28,386 --> 01:07:30,879
I knew her there eleven
years ago. Oh .. baby.

1030
01:07:31,668 --> 01:07:32,712
Your little finger.

1031
01:07:33,225 --> 01:07:35,701
Means more to me than all the
Mabel McGuires or Grand Duchesses ..

1032
01:07:35,801 --> 01:07:36,957
In all of Europe.

1033
01:07:37,057 --> 01:07:38,273
But you made love to her.

1034
01:07:38,513 --> 01:07:40,232
Well maybe I did.
I had to kid her along.

1035
01:07:40,332 --> 01:07:42,695
But on the level honey, she
doesn't mean a thing to me.

1036
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:45,940
Well, I think you're lying
but you do it so beautifully.

1037
01:07:49,005 --> 01:07:49,591
Oh.

1038
01:07:51,791 --> 01:07:52,603
Oh, hello.

1039
01:07:53,258 --> 01:07:55,532
We were just talking about you.
Don't go, baby.

1040
01:07:56,709 --> 01:07:57,610
Well, Duchess.

1041
01:07:57,970 --> 01:07:59,357
What was it you had to tell me?

1042
01:07:59,678 --> 01:08:00,533
Nothing.

1043
01:08:01,397 --> 01:08:03,449
But over the phone, you said ..

1044
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:06,218
I say now .. nuts.

1045
01:08:18,048 --> 01:08:18,692
Boss.

1046
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:19,889
Yeah?

1047
01:08:19,989 --> 01:08:21,920
There's two mugs out there
that want to see you.

1048
01:08:22,642 --> 01:08:23,543
Let them wait.

1049
01:08:23,649 --> 01:08:26,017
No. They won't wait .. they're Cops.

1050
01:08:27,185 --> 01:08:28,029
Let them in.

1051
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:35,884
Ah, bonjour Monsieur.

1052
01:08:36,470 --> 01:08:37,514
Won't you sit down.

1053
01:08:38,242 --> 01:08:39,125
Have a smoke.

1054
01:08:39,710 --> 01:08:41,183
This is no social visit, Monsieur.

1055
01:08:41,415 --> 01:08:42,937
I am from the Prefect Of Police.

1056
01:08:43,852 --> 01:08:44,502
Well.

1057
01:08:45,499 --> 01:08:47,224
You are charged Monsieur, with forgery.

1058
01:08:47,549 --> 01:08:49,672
Fraud, petty larceny and grand larceny.

1059
01:08:49,872 --> 01:08:54,320
Under paragraph 5, article 17 of the
criminal code of the Republic of France.

1060
01:08:54,935 --> 01:08:56,701
It is my duty to arrest you.

1061
01:08:57,498 --> 01:08:58,717
Who brings these charges?

1062
01:08:59,131 --> 01:09:00,166
As you will see.

1063
01:09:01,856 --> 01:09:03,294
Oscar Baroque. Oh.

1064
01:09:03,969 --> 01:09:08,040
On behalf of the Associated Couturiers
Protective Alliance of Paris. Well.

1065
01:09:08,745 --> 01:09:09,669
That's ducky.

1066
01:09:11,479 --> 01:09:12,152
Oh.

1067
01:09:13,001 --> 01:09:15,526
Monsieur, could I have a few
moments with my secretary?

1068
01:09:16,017 --> 01:09:16,804
Privately.

1069
01:09:17,462 --> 01:09:19,007
Oh, I'll not try to escape.

1070
01:09:19,485 --> 01:09:21,315
If Monsieur will give
me his word of honor.

1071
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:22,819
By all means, Monsieur.

1072
01:09:26,787 --> 01:09:28,117
I told you this would happen.

1073
01:09:29,997 --> 01:09:33,060
You promised me you would quit.
- Baby, it's okay. I'll get out of this.

1074
01:09:33,273 --> 01:09:34,775
I don't care whether you do or not.

1075
01:09:34,875 --> 01:09:35,790
I'm through.

1076
01:09:35,890 --> 01:09:37,320
But honey, it's very simple.

1077
01:09:37,561 --> 01:09:39,416
All I've got to do is find the Duchess.

1078
01:09:39,870 --> 01:09:42,671
Then tell it to the Duchess.
I'm going to Berlin with Jimmy tonight.

1079
01:09:42,984 --> 01:09:44,743
But wait a minute, baby.
You can't do this.

1080
01:09:45,158 --> 01:09:46,578
You love me.
- No, I don't.

1081
01:09:47,399 --> 01:09:48,201
I don't.

1082
01:09:54,352 --> 01:09:55,110
Monsieur.

1083
01:09:55,288 --> 01:09:56,905
If you give me just half an hour ..

1084
01:09:57,005 --> 01:09:59,280
I'm quite sure this little
misunderstanding can be settled.

1085
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:00,539
By all means, Monsieur.

1086
01:10:00,875 --> 01:10:02,839
But we will have to go with
you wherever you go.

1087
01:10:03,204 --> 01:10:04,714
Monsieur, it's a pleasure. Come on.

1088
01:10:07,210 --> 01:10:10,086
I must see you. Just a moment, Mr Nash.
- Some other time, Senator.

1089
01:10:10,276 --> 01:10:12,318
About those feathers.
- We'll get together again.

1090
01:10:12,907 --> 01:10:14,154
But they are all diseased.

1091
01:10:15,633 --> 01:10:16,432
Diseased?

1092
01:10:16,532 --> 01:10:19,083
Yeah. The entire cargo was confiscated
by the French Board of Health.

1093
01:10:19,306 --> 01:10:20,465
They are all condemned.

1094
01:10:21,286 --> 01:10:22,817
When did you hear this?
- Just now.

1095
01:10:23,610 --> 01:10:25,394
You haven't heard a thing. Get me?
- Yeah.

1096
01:10:44,691 --> 01:10:46,844
So nice to see you all. Just lovely.

1097
01:10:47,026 --> 01:10:48,188
All my darlings.

1098
01:10:48,648 --> 01:10:49,552
Monsieur Nash.

1099
01:10:53,952 --> 01:10:56,123
Ah, I see I'm just in time
to congratulate you.

1100
01:10:56,366 --> 01:10:58,983
How dare you come here.
- Oh, I'm leaving in a moment.

1101
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:02,541
Just as soon as you tell this gentleman
that there's been a little mistake.

1102
01:11:02,714 --> 01:11:04,020
There has been <i>no</i> mistake.

1103
01:11:04,253 --> 01:11:06,038
I swore out the complaint myself.

1104
01:11:07,429 --> 01:11:09,618
Don't you think there has been
a little mistake, precious?

1105
01:11:09,718 --> 01:11:12,052
Sir, you will address Her
Highness by her correct title.

1106
01:11:12,512 --> 01:11:14,290
Would you really like me to do that?

1107
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:16,780
Perhaps you have been
a little hasty, darling.

1108
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:18,470
No, I have delayed too long.

1109
01:11:18,676 --> 01:11:19,577
Take him away.

1110
01:11:20,418 --> 01:11:21,701
Just a moment.

1111
01:11:22,327 --> 01:11:25,444
Monsieur Baroque, I have something to
tell you. Something rather personal.

1112
01:11:26,459 --> 01:11:28,419
If you'll take a tip from me,
you'll listen to it.

1113
01:11:29,064 --> 01:11:29,943
In private.

1114
01:11:30,043 --> 01:11:31,122
Monsieur.
- Oscar.

1115
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:42,812
Why did you bring him here?

1116
01:11:43,528 --> 01:11:46,837
He asked if he might drop in for
a moment on his way to jail.

1117
01:11:47,325 --> 01:11:49,595
Sherry .. are you going to
spill the beans about me?

1118
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:51,397
Not if you call your husband off.

1119
01:11:51,497 --> 01:11:53,567
But I can't. He's determined
to put you behind bars.

1120
01:11:53,779 --> 01:11:56,711
But I don't like it behind bars. I'm
sorry Mabel, but it's my only weapon.

1121
01:11:56,913 --> 01:11:57,814
What about me?

1122
01:11:58,212 --> 01:11:59,084
Listen, baby.

1123
01:11:59,613 --> 01:12:02,060
The wedding is over. You've got
him, haven't you? He's hooked.

1124
01:12:02,388 --> 01:12:04,691
What can happen to you?
- He could have the marriage annulled.

1125
01:12:05,087 --> 01:12:06,789
What, and be the
laughing stock of Paris?

1126
01:12:06,889 --> 01:12:07,724
Oh no.

1127
01:12:11,008 --> 01:12:12,360
Well, what have you to say?

1128
01:12:13,921 --> 01:12:14,908
Monsieur Baroque.

1129
01:12:15,401 --> 01:12:18,800
Before they drag me off to the Bastille,
I'd like to tell you a little story.

1130
01:12:19,342 --> 01:12:21,838
And let you decide whether or
not I shall tell it to the press.

1131
01:12:22,098 --> 01:12:25,165
This is a story of someone
very near and dear to you.

1132
01:12:25,581 --> 01:12:26,273
Well?

1133
01:12:26,373 --> 01:12:27,017
Well.

1134
01:12:27,778 --> 01:12:30,755
Years ago, in the lovely
American city of Hoboken.

1135
01:12:31,651 --> 01:12:34,377
There was born to Mr and
Mrs Elmer McGuire ..

1136
01:12:34,635 --> 01:12:36,678
A beautiful, bonny little baby girl.

1137
01:12:37,188 --> 01:12:38,375
Whom they named 'Mabel'.

1138
01:12:38,528 --> 01:12:40,376
This does not mean anything to me.

1139
01:12:40,584 --> 01:12:42,315
Oh, you're not interested
in little Mabel?

1140
01:12:42,511 --> 01:12:43,412
Now let's see.

1141
01:12:45,139 --> 01:12:47,382
Would you by any chance be
interested in birthmarks?

1142
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:48,959
Birthmarks?
- Yes.

1143
01:12:49,267 --> 01:12:51,757
Birthmarks. Mabel had one. Yes indeed.

1144
01:12:52,339 --> 01:12:54,775
She had the cutest
little strawberry mark.

1145
01:12:54,972 --> 01:12:57,722
In the most unusual and
interesting location.

1146
01:13:01,772 --> 01:13:03,587
What proof have you of this?

1147
01:13:03,887 --> 01:13:05,847
Aside from the strawberry mark? Well ..

1148
01:13:06,353 --> 01:13:08,011
There is Elmer McGuire, her father.

1149
01:13:08,493 --> 01:13:11,131
As able and conscientious a
bootlegger as ever faked a gin label.

1150
01:13:11,326 --> 01:13:13,136
I'm sure he'd be able to identify her.

1151
01:13:13,722 --> 01:13:14,775
Is this true?

1152
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:16,037
But darling.

1153
01:13:16,429 --> 01:13:19,245
You swore it was me
you loved. Not my title.

1154
01:13:19,412 --> 01:13:21,873
You've tricked me. You're an imposter.
- Oh, pipe down.

1155
01:13:21,973 --> 01:13:23,828
Quit yelling, you cheap
little dressmaker.

1156
01:13:23,928 --> 01:13:24,888
You are a fraud.

1157
01:13:24,988 --> 01:13:26,879
You tricked me into marriage.
- Tricked you?

1158
01:13:26,979 --> 01:13:29,880
Who wanted this marriage in the first
place? You know, you're no bargain.

1159
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:32,086
You begged and pleaded. Why?

1160
01:13:32,431 --> 01:13:34,992
So I'll bring customers into your shop.
- I'll have you put in prison.

1161
01:13:35,434 --> 01:13:37,285
Maybe we'll get adjoining cells.
- Go ahead.

1162
01:13:37,672 --> 01:13:40,001
Just try to put me in jail.
Just you try.

1163
01:13:40,173 --> 01:13:43,867
Oh boy. I can spill more dirt about you
and some of your pretty little habits ..

1164
01:13:44,095 --> 01:13:45,940
You are shameless.
- Go ahead. I'm all for it.

1165
01:13:46,137 --> 01:13:48,755
They've not had a good laugh in Paris
for years. Let's give them a break.

1166
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:50,211
'Madame Baroque tells all'.

1167
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:52,193
'The love life of a dressmaker'.

1168
01:13:52,293 --> 01:13:54,628
That would ruin me.
- You said a mouthful.

1169
01:13:54,808 --> 01:13:56,977
But Monsieur, no-one need know.

1170
01:13:57,530 --> 01:14:00,830
It was my very good fortune to
meet Her Highness years ago, but ..

1171
01:14:01,498 --> 01:14:02,800
I am the soul of discretion.

1172
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:07,507
Monsieur, I cannot wait any longer.
I must take the defendant.

1173
01:14:08,191 --> 01:14:11,028
Monsieur Baroque, don't you think now
that there has been a little mistake?

1174
01:14:11,535 --> 01:14:13,277
I will withdraw the charges.

1175
01:14:15,462 --> 01:14:16,108
Well?

1176
01:14:16,565 --> 01:14:17,409
That's that.

1177
01:14:18,346 --> 01:14:19,016
Now.

1178
01:14:20,050 --> 01:14:20,990
What is this?

1179
01:14:21,192 --> 01:14:23,512
This is a contract to
purchase Maison Elegance.

1180
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:25,396
The most flourishing business in Paris.

1181
01:14:25,773 --> 01:14:27,428
Send a porter up for my things will you.

1182
01:14:27,623 --> 01:14:28,712
And call a taxi.

1183
01:14:29,327 --> 01:14:30,858
Yes. For the Berlin Express.

1184
01:14:32,643 --> 01:14:33,683
Alright, Tibby.

1185
01:14:34,141 --> 01:14:35,418
Now we're ready to go.

1186
01:14:37,648 --> 01:14:38,421
Voila.

1187
01:14:39,303 --> 01:14:40,330
Merci, Monsieur.

1188
01:14:40,589 --> 01:14:41,805
This includes everything.

1189
01:14:42,079 --> 01:14:44,785
Business, goodwill, fixtures
and of course the feathers.

1190
01:14:44,986 --> 01:14:46,460
Including the last big shipment.

1191
01:14:46,658 --> 01:14:48,678
Oh yes, indeed. <i>All</i> the feathers.

1192
01:14:49,501 --> 01:14:52,893
I .. regret that I can't remain
for your charming reception.

1193
01:14:53,597 --> 01:14:57,216
Monsieur, in America it is the custom
of good friends .. to kiss the bride.

1194
01:15:00,105 --> 01:15:02,469
In France, I understand
they also kiss the groom.

1195
01:15:04,408 --> 01:15:06,253
Au revoir, Monsieur. Your Highness.

1196
01:15:07,946 --> 01:15:08,985
Bon fortune.

1197
01:15:18,759 --> 01:15:21,319
But that's not my bag.
- No, baby. That's mine.

1198
01:15:22,189 --> 01:15:23,614
Why, I thought you were in jail.

1199
01:15:24,224 --> 01:15:26,419
What are you doing here?
- Taking you to the boat.

1200
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:28,805
No you're not. I'm going
to Berlin with Jimmy.

1201
01:15:29,089 --> 01:15:31,117
You're going to American with me.
- Well, I'm not.

1202
01:15:31,327 --> 01:15:33,429
Oh yes you are. Look, baby.

1203
01:15:33,994 --> 01:15:35,153
I've sold the business.

1204
01:15:55,219 --> 01:15:55,920
Sherry.

1205
01:15:56,106 --> 01:15:58,841
Now that you've wriggled out of this,
you've got to make me a promise.

1206
01:15:59,352 --> 01:16:01,308
No more of your crazy schemes.

1207
01:16:01,698 --> 01:16:05,139
Honey, absolutely.
From now on, you're the Captain.

1208
01:16:05,470 --> 01:16:06,302
Mr Nash.

1209
01:16:07,497 --> 01:16:08,946
Mr Nash?
- Yes?

1210
01:16:09,715 --> 01:16:11,274
Would you mind looking into this box?

1211
01:16:15,369 --> 01:16:16,327
What do you see?

1212
01:16:17,434 --> 01:16:19,457
Looks like a lot of worms.
- Exactly.

1213
01:16:19,704 --> 01:16:21,964
Mr Nash, I have the most
wonderful proposition for you.

1214
01:16:22,486 --> 01:16:24,820
For years I have experimented
and at last I have succeeded.

1215
01:16:25,194 --> 01:16:27,998
I have succeeded in crossing
silkworms with glow-worms ..

1216
01:16:28,298 --> 01:16:29,943
To make luminous evening dresses.

1217
01:16:31,039 --> 01:16:33,258
Well .. gee, that's an idea.

1218
01:16:33,437 --> 01:16:36,977
Mr Nash, we can make old fabrics
glow like so many neon lights.

1219
01:16:37,384 --> 01:16:39,440
And you are the only man
in the world, Mr Nash ..

1220
01:16:39,540 --> 01:16:41,299
Who can put over this
marvellous discovery.

1221
01:16:41,798 --> 01:16:43,611
Think of the possibilities, Mr Nash.

1222
01:16:43,814 --> 01:16:45,621
Women's dresses glowing, scintillating.

1223
01:16:45,924 --> 01:16:48,864
Indoors, outdoors,
picnics, parties, balls.

1224
01:16:48,964 --> 01:16:50,408
We don't have to stop at dresses.

1225
01:16:50,826 --> 01:16:51,813
Why that's right.

1226
01:16:51,969 --> 01:16:54,460
We could make lingerie,
pyjamas, night dresses.

1227
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,648
Of course. Are you a
married man, Mr Nash?

1228
01:16:58,105 --> 01:17:00,769
Wouldn't you like to see your
wife glowing in the darkness?

1229
01:17:02,687 --> 01:17:04,429
My worms. My worms!

1230
01:17:05,217 --> 01:17:06,972
My worms. My worms.

1231
01:17:07,324 --> 01:17:08,463
My worms.

1232
01:17:12,286 --> 01:17:12,937
Baby.

1233
01:17:13,692 --> 01:17:16,036
Do you know what you've done?
Do you see what you threw away?

1234
01:17:16,136 --> 01:17:18,724
Yes, I know. A chance to
make a million dollars.

1235
01:17:21,395 --> 01:17:22,511
I get you, Captain.

1236
01:17:30,777 --> 01:17:31,421
Snap.

1237
01:17:31,984 --> 01:17:33,386
Right, governor.

1238
01:17:49,744 --> 01:17:50,661
..s-d..
