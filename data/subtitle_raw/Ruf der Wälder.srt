1
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,700
Awful weather.

2
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,270
Nobody would want to go outside now.

3
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,430
But...

4
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,740
but just the right weather

5
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,530
to tell stories.

6
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,490
Neither poacher stories,

7
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,280
nor hunter's latin.

8
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,610
No, only...

9
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,110
a story...

10
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,600
of a dog.

11
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,880
One often says: "It's a pity that dogs can't speak"

12
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,170
But that isn't always right.

13
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,120
You just have to able to listen carefully...

14
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,630
and be patient.

15
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:08,080
Then everything falls into place.

16
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,770
And you know exactly,

17
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,410
how it was.

18
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:11,990
Yes.

19
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,050
I even know,

20
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,510
where she was found,

21
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,730
the Bella.

22
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,660
Imagine a big factory,

23
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,900
an iron factory.

24
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,900
Bigger than you can imagine.

25
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,460
Thousand of workers...

26
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,830
What am I saying? Many more.

27
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,410
And everybody from the most different countries.

28
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,070
Only I couldn't live there,

29
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,940
without the mountains and the forest.

30
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,280
And just in middle,

31
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,240
a little, stray dog.

32
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,470
Lost, forgotten, gone astray,

33
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,540
How should I know?

34
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,320
It's not that important.

35
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,460
Only among humans, you have to know always,

36
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,870
where somebody is from,

37
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,870
and what's the name.

38
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,140
She didn't even have a name back then,

39
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,640
the puppy.

40
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,220
But she was cheeky,

41
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,180
from early on.

42
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,670
Cheeky and without fear.

43
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,600
Hey...

44
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,900
Bella!

45
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,630
Bella piccolina!

46
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,730
That was her first name.

47
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,470
And she kept it for a long time.

48
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,250
A nice name.

49
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,450
And especially because

50
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,920
it was giving to her without hesitation,

51
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,820
without a thought.

52
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,700
From heart, so to say.

53
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,660
From love at first sight.

54
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,000
Yes it was love at first sight,

55
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:27,940
between the italian foreign worker and the little dog.

56
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,180
Nobody should say that something like this doesn't exist.

57
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,100
This love is often much stronger...

58
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,610
than the one between humans.

59
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,400
Perhaps because

60
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,740
animals can be grateful.

61
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,710
Grateful for every look,

62
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:45,210
a nice word, for a petting,

63
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,910
yes and naturally for the daily milk, too.

64
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,250
And concerning loyalty,

65
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,770
well everybody of us can learn

66
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,730
from such a little thing.

67
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,900
From waking till the end of work,

68
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,720
there's only one thought for a dog:

69
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,690
the master.

70
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,950
Finished.

71
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,040
But among humans, oh dear,

72
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:15,350
who always thinks of the others?

73
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,210
Ciao bella, ciao bella!

74
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,970
Here, Bella, here.

75
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:36,440
Good girl...

76
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:41,240
Ciao bella, ciao, ciao bella.

77
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,200
Here, come here.

78
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,760
Scusa mi bella, fine fine...

79
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:51,000
Fine... Fine...

80
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,160
Well, let me continue telling the story.

81
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,550
There were big chimneys...

82
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,560
and the little dog.

83
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,260
Bella, Bella, come here.

84
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,660
Fine.

85
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,820
No...

86
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,820
No... no...

87
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,680
For our little four legged friend,

88
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,670
life could have continued this way.

89
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,110
Until dog-eternity.

90
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,120
But that's not life.

91
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,600
Nor dog-life.

92
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,920
You don't stay a little dog.

93
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,800
With every bottle of milk you grow a little

94
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,470
and a little.

95
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:23,130
[unintelligible dialog]

96
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,310
[Italian]

97
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,230
Tina, a mi fidanzata.

98
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,210

[Italian]

106
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,380
Mille grazie, Signorina.

107
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:16,610
[Italian]

108
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,000
Prego.

109
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,080
Signorina Tina.

110
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,960
Una lettera per te.

111
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,680
Grazie.

112
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,670
[Italian]

113
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:51,830
Ciao.

114
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,130
Bella, ciao bella...

115
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,590
Come stai, bella bella?

116
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,810
[Italian]

117
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,970
Bloody mutt.

118
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:01,820
How say?

119
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,230
I said bloody mutt.

120
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,320
Nothing, bloody mutt.

121
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,650
Creatures are not allowed here.

122
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,340
Learn german, then you can read it.

123
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,640
She does nothing, nobody.

124
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,070
Out with the mutt.

125
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:12,070
Attention Mister.

126
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:12,850
Out!

127
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,900
Youuu...

128
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,250
Ow!

129
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,800
My dog... my dog...

130
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,590
you kicked her.

131
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:30,170
Nothing or nobody may dare.

132
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:33,560
I break you... I break you.

133
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,130
We deliver the steal beams exactly on time.

134
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,650
I just ask myself, if you're ready then.

135
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,990
That depends on the weather, but even more on the workers.

136
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,910
Telephone, Mr. engineer, telephone.

137
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,170
Engineer Witte.

138
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,630
What?

139
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,910
Well, do you have to come to me for everything?

140
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,270
Who?

141
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,920
I see, Scalzi again.

142
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,520
Bring him here.

143
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,760
Always the foreign workers.

144
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,990
Trouble?

145
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,030
Scalzi is a brilliant locksmith.

146
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,590
But again and again we have problems with him.

147
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:14,660
Women affairs?

148
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,310
No, brawls.

149
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,200
As far as I'm concerned, you can have him.

150
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,420
Consider him.

151
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,310
What's going on with you again?

152
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,840
This guy always has got this mutt,

153
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,040
that's forbidden.

154
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,950
And he sets it on people.

155
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,910
Why did he set the dog on you?

156
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,470
I just said, it's forbidden.

157
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,590
And after all, it's a vicious creature.

158
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,620
No way. Come here.

159
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,420
What's its name?

160
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,850
Bella, Mister.

161
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,520
[Italian]

162
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,680
Nice dog.

163
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,580
You're a fine dog.

164
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,810
Would you like to come with me?

165
00:11:58,810 --> 00:11:59,930
Come? With you?

166
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,390
I need a good locksmith and you need another environment.

167
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,570
Environment?

168
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,100
We build a cable railway.

169
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,620
Into the glaciers.

170
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,430
A spoiled dog.

171
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,540
Sorry.

172
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,210
Why don't you train your dog better?

173
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,330
That's a purebred animal, a hunting dog.

174
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,790
It has to be trained.

175
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,330
I understand something about dogs.

176
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:28,890
Bella, come!

177
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,120
So, red wins,

178
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,460
black loses.

179
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:42,790
Here.

180
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,820
This one!

181
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:44,850
Trick.

182
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,620
But why?

183
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,000
You just have to pay more attention.

184
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You have got damn bad eyes for a hunter.

185
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,580
Don't bully me all the time.

186
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,310
Another one?

187
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,260
Yes, sure.

188
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,040
There,

189
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,150
once again.

190
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,770
Red wins,

191
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,350
black loses.

192
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,520
Thank you, Mr. engineer.

193
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,430
You're welcome.

194
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,840
Well look here.

195
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,050
Our Mr. Engineer plays the elegant gentleman.

196
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,900
Kubesch, come here!

197
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,920
It's a pity.

198
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,730
I had a lucky streak.

199
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,460
Now I would've won for sure.

200
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,850
Yes, sure, sure.

201
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,270
Here.

202
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,110
Well, thanks.

203
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,490
So many love letters?

204
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:11,380
Ah, thanks.

205
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,950
Well, it's not surprising.

206
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,040
What do I have to do, to write such a letter, too?

207
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,470
That's not so difficult.

208
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,830
Please tell me.

209
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,190
Visit me sometime.

210
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,620
It'd be my pleasure.

211
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,660
Hauptplatz 14.

212
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,160
May I see you soon.

213
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:25,980
See you soon.

214
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,180
The new assistant forester?

215
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:29,790
Yes.

216
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:30,800
Let's go.

217
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,300
There you go.

218
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,220
Mr. engineer?

219
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,650
Transport these things to the material warehouse and give this man a lift.

220
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,300
What? That Macaroni there?

221
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,020
And show him his quarters.

222
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,270
Am I a tourist guide?

223
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,960
Kubesch, you drank again.

224
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,040
That's right Mr. engineer.

225
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,720
But only mineral water.

226
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,660
That's alright.

227
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,140
The private chauffeur is on the spot.

228
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,310
Thanks, but I can't accept that.

229
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,230
Hey,

230
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,540
slowly Macaroni.

231
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,930
Only people, humans drive with me

232
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:11,680
in the front,

233
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,410
capisce?

234
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,250
Foreign workers and dogs belong in the back.

235
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,900
[Italian]

236
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:21,850
[Italian]

237
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,840
Tell me, my dear...

238
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:32,990
Pepi, please.

239
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,180
Name's Pepi.

240
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,840
Josef really, but...

241
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,270
Pepi's shorter.

242
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,490
Why? Joseph has got only 2 syllables, too?

243
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:40,460
Right,

244
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,230
but it depends on how you say it.

245
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,280
JOSEF!

246
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:45,870
or...

247
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:46,430
Pepi.

248
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,150
Well then, my dear Josef..

249
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:49,860
Pepi.

250
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,360
Pepi, you're a local, aren't you?

251
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,840
Yes, well, a local as I am,

252
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,090
you'll not never ever nowhere find again.

253
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:01,000
Well great, but then you surely know the house at Hauptplatz number 14.

254
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,410
Well you bet I know that.

255
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,450
That's the Raiffeisen bank.

256
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,640
Thanks, good bye,

257
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,910
bye.

258
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,440
Kissing your hand.

259
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,440
My adoration,

260
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:21,140
Ms. Angelika. I'd like to apologize a thousand times,

261
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,240
because I haven't shown my face in a long time.

262
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,900
I have been over to Rosenheim.

263
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,740
How was business Mr. Zingerl?

264
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,900
Wonderful.

265
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,930
And that makes you sad?

266
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:33,510
Yes, because it makes not sense, that I make that much money,

267
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:36,590
Ms. Angelika. Couldn't you change your mind and...

268
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,500
Don't start with that again.

269
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,870
No.

270
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:40,740
I'm just here...

271
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,750
I wanted to deposit something and...

272
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:43,620
Well that...

273
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,010
you can do easily.

274
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,250
The counters are open. Especially for depositors.

275
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,600
But you know exactly Ms. Angelika,

276
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,120
I only do that at yours.

277
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,100
Thanks. Let's go.

278
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,020
Yes, let's go.

279
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:54,730
Please.

280
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:55,980
Oh, dear.

281
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,900
That's a hard nut to crack.

282
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,850
She is purportedly a reputable person.

283
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,960
What's that now? Reputable...

284
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:06,780
That there's nothing on her,

285
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:08,870
which is not reputable.

286
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,620
Nothing at all.

287
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:11,960
Nonsense.

288
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:15,040
How's the fair womanhood in the forester's house?

289
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:18,210
Well, there's just Katja.

290
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,100
How old?

291
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,520
Past 17.

292
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,070
Oh!?

293
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,220
No Katja, you stay at home today.

294
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,830
That's going to be a long stalk today.

295
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:36,010
I'll probe the Mr. assistant forster a bit.

296
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,110
Perhaps he leave on his own then.

297
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,840
We don't need anybody there, do we Katja?

298
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,610
So, here I am.

299
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,730
Good day. I'm the new ...

300
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,710
Well I can guess that.

301
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,330
Pepi is not stupid enough to bring the wrong one.

302
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:10,970
Well...

303
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,130
Had a good trip?

304
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,150
Thanks, very good.

305
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,630
Great. Then we can start with a little stalk.

306
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,240
Fine. Then I get to know everything.

307
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,450
Everything? That can't be done before tomorrow evening.

308
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:20,710
Oh. Tomorrow evening?

309
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,720
Sure. But if you feel too tired...

310
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,560
No, not at all.

311
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,470
In the meantime, you'll handle the salt...

312
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:25,920
Yes.

313
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,460
and about Katja, she has to be bathed again.

314
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,110
Yeah yeah.

315
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,740
But don't take her to bed with you again. You know I can't stand that.

316
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,600
She likes it just so much.

317
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,630
Why do you scowl like a courting capercaillie cock?

318
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:36,410
Nothing...

319
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,320
nothing at all.

320
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:41,520
What was I going to tell?

321
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,910
About Bella..

322
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,130
that is...

323
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,210
Picco Bella, to be exact,

324
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,800
the way she was called that time.

325
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,620
What she got to know here

326
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,060
was something completely new for her:

327
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:56,600
Nature.

328
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:25,900
Bella

329
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:50,870
Bella

330
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:13,490
What's up?

331
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:14,670
Outrageous!

332
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,300
Sorry.

333
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,610
Bad dog. Porta, bring!

334
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,310
What did you do?

335
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,320
[Italian]

336
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,290
Bruto.

337
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,060
Hm, ok.

338
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,410
Now hurry up!

339
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,930
Away with the dog!

340
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,150
She always rides along.

341
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,720
I don't care what it always did.

342
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,200
It doesn't drive with me.

343
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,250
She's harmless.

344
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,110
Shut up Macaroni and don't dictate me.

345
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,150
Or I'll make paste schuta out of you.

346
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,080
Ha, pasta schuti with macaroni,

347
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,300
bon appetito.

348
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,830
Where's the bitch now?

349
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,050
Get in, Marcello.

350
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,910
Away!

351
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:17,570
Away?

352
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:18,870
Good fortune.

353
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,240
Now,

354
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,530
off you go!

355
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:37,850
When you come back down, you'll have a unpleasant surprise.

356
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,500
Well, he had it coming.

357
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,080
They had to bring in Macaroni.

358
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,130
Disgusting.

359
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,260
If you don't like macaroni, eat dirt.

360
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,520
Ah, who talks about food.

361
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,420
I mean the italian foreign workers.

362
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,740
I tell you, it comes to...

363
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,770
Stay here when I talk to you.

364
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,210
Ow!

365
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,310
No trouble!

366
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,630
The boss doesn't like that at all.

367
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:22,520
Your boss,

368
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:25,530
Your boss lives off my money, which I pay here for the schnapps.

369
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,810
Well Mr. Zingerl, what's eating you?

370
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,060
Me? No Luzie, my heart.

371
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,790
Come on. You've got heartaches.

372
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,490
A man with such a hard padded heart.

373
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,560
Nothing but printed paper.

374
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,600
That's no protection for a heart.

375
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,550
But the best medicine to heal weak hearts.

376
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,840
It will come to that, I tell you.

377
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:46,610
The Macaroni will snatch away our girls.

378
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,270
You don't have to be afraid for Luzie.

379
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,150
Luzie, it's not about Luzie.

380
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,980
It's a matter of principle.

381
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:54,750
In principle, the Macaroni will snatch away our girls.

382
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,330
I understand. You want to set up a savings account.

383
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,970
Si, si savings account.

384
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:01,760
Then, you just need to...

385
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,290
fill this out.

386
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,010
Please,

387
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,150
prego,

388
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,140
Signorina you help me.

389
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,280
I beg you.

390
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,060
Okay then. What's our name?

391
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:22,250
My name is Marcello Scalzi.

392
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,500
And yours?

393
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,040
Mine? Why mine?

394
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,970
You say what's "our" name.

395
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,770
"our" is "I", "you".

396
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,200
You're a trickster.

397
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,210
You speak german perfectly.

398
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:33,870
No no no.

399
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,480
I can nothing.

400
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,480
No none nothing german.

401
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,780
Bruta Bestia.

402
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,450
Sorry.

403
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,560
Ah, it's stupid of me to be scared of a dog.

404
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,350
Good dog, good dog.

405
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,640
I show you how good.

406
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,050
Yes yes, I believe you.

407
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,240
Please, you have to let me show.

408
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:54,010
Bella,

409
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:54,400
Yes.

410
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,630
good,

411
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,040
fine dog.

412
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,910
Well, well.

413
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,920
Nobody should say,

414
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,920
that a dog doesn't feel it,

415
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,610
if it loses a bit of its master's love.

416
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:09,160
A animal can be just as jealous

417
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,690
as a human.

418
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,100
Bella! [Italian]

419
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,110
[Italian]

420
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,680
Come here. Very bad dog.

421
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,700
She doesn't like me, only because I am afraid of dogs.

422
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,500
Why?

423
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:25,650
When I was a little child, I was bitten by a dog.

424
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:26,850
What is...

425
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,560
"little child"?

426
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,400
Bambino.

427
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,690
Ah no bambino, bambina.

428
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,450
Big difference

429
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,330
and very good difference.

430
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,290
Bella!

431
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,220
[Italian]

432
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,270
[Italian]

433
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,810
Oh...

434
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,370
Fine...

435
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,270
Fear not,

436
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:53,590
amore, every day [Italian]

437
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,150
Today po da amore, tomorrow po da amore

438
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:02,040
and tomorrow, tomorrow

439
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,880
grande amore.

440
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,290
Please put your dog on a leash.

441
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,990
We're just going for a walk.

442
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,050
It's forbidden.

443
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:17,230
Forbidden in the elevator, forbidden in the house, forbidden in the forest.

444
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:19,000
Always forbidden, forbidden, forbidden.

445
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,780
If you don't it the way it is here, go back to where you came from.

446
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,790
Calm down.

447
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:24,690
That's alright, isn't it?

448
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,310
Good day, Angelika!

449
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,150
Good day.

450
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,660
Marcello Scalzi, this is Wegrainer Gustl.

451
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,650
Good day.

452
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,570
I'd wish for a grandfather like him.

453
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,700
Perhaps I am.

454
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,060
If your grandmother was as pretty as you,

455
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,160
why not?

456
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:50,100
A lovely doggy.

457
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,720
Well why do you stand there like a stag on the shooting range.

458
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,750
Come in, the lady doesn't bite.

459
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:25,000
Well the new assistant forester you wrote me about.

460
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,960
Only good things, I hope.

461
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:29,110
To be honest, no. My brother ranted and raved about you.

462
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,480
Yes I know. I'm a thorn in his side.

463
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,660
Nonsense. I would have operated out a thorn long ago.

464
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:34,640
He's not that bad.

465
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,310
Thanks.

466
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:37,390
But I still can't do anything.

467
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,730
I might have studied the theory from textbooks.

468
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:42,610
But in the forest, you stand there like a young rabid at new moon.

469
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,620
You become meaner every year.

470
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,100
He doesn't mean that.

471
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,730
I'm afraid he does.

472
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,730
Luggage is in the room, madam.

473
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,640
Thanks, Pepi.

474
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,540
And you, don't give him a hard time.

475
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,590
I hope there something better for dinner today.

476
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,130
Oh yes...

477
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,480
Well, thank god.

478
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:58,340
Well,

479
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,540
you like our young lady, don't you?

480
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,060
Yes and how I like her.

481
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,340
I like her more than...

482
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,610
Than who? Than who?

483
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,570
Well, more than everyone I've seen before.

484
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,280
Well, then take care,

485
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,620
that you don't get your fingers burned.

486
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:36,100
I'm afraid, that's not the right place.

487
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,930
Well, at first you talk big about going out and the like.

488
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,990
And then you back down.

489
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:40,690
That's not how it is.

490
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,530
I just wanted to spare you the event and

491
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,060
all its consequences.

492
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,390
What consequences?

493
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,240
That's no social gathering for noble daughters.

494
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,920
You think I'm a noble daughter?

495
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,310
Here you express your feelings without any formality.

496
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,460
Do you mean to say by this, that you have feelings?

497
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:54,770
And how!

498
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,820
Interesting.

499
00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:00,390
And this exhausts your frank utterance of emotions.

500
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:03,070
Absolutely not. One talks with each other, too.

501
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,160
For example?

502
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,350
"I like you.", or "I'm crazy for you."

503
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:10,110
And how do I react?

504
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,930
Oh, you know that, certainly.

505
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,820
But you act surprised and ask: "Since when?"

506
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:16,080
Since when?

507
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,880
Since the first moment.

508
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,980
I was even jealous of your brother.

509
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,150
Why?

510
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,980
He held you in his arms and kissed you.

511
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,300
Brothers are allowed to.

512
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:26,490
Only brothers?

513
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:27,620
It depends.

514
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,020
Yes,

515
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,360
it depends.

516
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,450
Yes with love,

517
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:34,480
it's its own thing.

518
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,820
One falls in love because of defiance

519
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:39,780
or at least thinks, has fallen in love.

520
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,070
And others,

521
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:43,780
they don't realize they love each other already.

522
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:46,330
Every day by poco amore,

523
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,170
today by poco,

524
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,580
and tomorrow by poco,

525
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,080
and tomorrow-tomorrow...

526
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:52,840
great amore.

527
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,940
I like coming here.

528
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:00,970
Strange, isn't it?

529
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:01,810
yeah,

530
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,330
it's so nice to live.

531
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,840
Why visit the dead?

532
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,570
A graveyard is full of stories.

533
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,490
Over there lies a girl and the tombstone reads:

534
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,610
"Engaged with Andreas Weiz"

535
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:16,420
And this Andreas?

536
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,290
His name is on the war memorial.

537
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,650
Half a year after he fell, she died too.

538
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,360
The people here say: "because of a broken heart".

539
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,750
It's not good, die for love.

540
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,670
It's good, live for love.

541
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,690
I believe you can't choose that.

542
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:32,630
Come no.

543
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,070
Madonna says:

544
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:37,830
"love...

545
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,140
the whole world".

546
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:40,670
But...

547
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,500
because the whole world

548
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,750
is to big for a single person,

549
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:48,230
one has to...

550
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:51,830
choose another person

551
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,650
and love him.

552
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,050
For the whole world.

553
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:30,780
Well I was looking forward to finally see something pretty again.

554
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:33,100
I wouldn't have to be a herd of monarchs.

555
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:35,820
A herd of monarchs.

556
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,020
Well, these only exist in Heimatfilms. In the past,

557
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,130
we had our hands full, shooting the game.

558
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,770
Today, we are happy if we get to see anything.

559
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:43,120
And who's fault is that, Mathias?

560
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,960
Who's at fault when nature perishes? The human.

561
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,470
You mean, it was shot to much?

562
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,450
No, the blessing of the much praised technology. That's it.

563
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:52,950
The water reservoir for example. It drove off most of the game population.

564
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:55,520
Different climatic and vegetative conditions.

565
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,780
Sounds of machines, noise of people.

566
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:10,030
And what did I tell you yesterday?

567
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:11,430
Look there!

568
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:28,050
There look, the dog!

569
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,800
These Italians are terribly people, especially if they are in love.

570
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:36,760
Bella [Italian]

571
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,780
We eat together.

572
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:45,660
What's wrong?

573
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,660
I don't like the look of it.

574
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,780
Listen, I am sorry, but even over at the Törl, there's no trace of chamois.

575
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:56,600
They must be have changed over to the Kar.

576
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,860
Well, what did I tell you Petra? No game far and wide.

577
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,180
There you go.

578
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,520
Thanks.

579
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:25,820
Well, what do your textbooks tell you about the wind?

580
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,830
Well south wind. This means change of weather.

581
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,060
Taking half hourly barometer readings...

582
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,750
Well, do you by chance carry a barometer?

583
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,860
Naturally not.

584
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:35,160
Well now that's stupid. Were do we take the readings?

585
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,780
Perhaps from the sky? Look up sometime.

586
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,970
What do you think is going on

587
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:42,260
Well, that means...

588
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,680
That means, we have to return home quickly.

589
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,090
Sooner or later, there will be a great snowstorm.

590
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:57,770
What was that?

591
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:00,370
As a hunter you should know how a gunshot sounds.

592
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,870
Yes, but that could only be a poacher.

593
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,460
Yes, with all logical foresight, there's only this possibility.

594
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,290
Mathias, you're just hostile to him.

595
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:10,430
I can't stand those vain theorists.

596
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:11,620
But he isn't one.

597
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:14,730
Oh, I see. You already concerned yourself with this Mister?

598
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:15,910
And what if it would be so?

599
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:17,530
I'm old enough actually.

600
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:18,160
What for?

601
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:20,160
To form my own opinion.

602
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,090
There's more about Bernd than you think.

603
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:23,570
Well he has to show that first.

604
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:24,980
Give me.

605
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:29,940
Stop! Freeze!

606
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,730
I said, freeze!

607
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:47,220
I am standing here the whole time.

608
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,370
Where's your rifle?

609
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:49,830
What rifle?

610
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,750
Don't play-act. You shot just now.

611
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,420
Oh, somebody shot?

612
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,390
Well, who could that be?

613
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:56,680
You accurately will be told that.

614
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,950
You are under arrest.

615
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,200
I!?

616
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,480
Arrested?

617
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:01,660
Well,

618
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,360
can't do anything about it.

619
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:05,130
Watch out, falling rocks!

620
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,870
Come out. It's of no use.

621
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:29,240
Well that's typical of that old crook.

622
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,040
Yes and I am the disgraced.

623
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,980
Don't worry, Bernd.

624
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:35,680
No forester ever could stand up to Gustl Wegrainer.

625
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,510
Ah, I was right then. He does poach.

626
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,070
Since he's able to hold a rifle.

627
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:41,350
You know that and don't do anything against it?

628
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:43,940
Correct. But he's only shooting with blanks.

629
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,550
Dirty trick.

630
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,610
Well now that doesn't suit you, too.

631
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:51,070
The Wegrainer Gustl is in principle a much better hunter than most.

632
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:53,320
He doesn't have to shoot at all costs, like those, who don't care...

633
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,650
and who shoot too, if the game is starved in the winter.

634
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,470
What's the real hunter's passion?

635
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:00,160
It's the stalking.

636
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:03,050
And if you get a good look on the buck you're after.

637
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,330
And you are sure to place a good shot.

638
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:06,450
then you pull the trigger.

639
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,820
What's happening then...

640
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,080
has more in common with butchery...

641
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,770
than with the art of hunting.

642
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:14,120
Yes, Gustl always takes the best of the hunt.

643
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:16,250
And he will be grateful for ever,

644
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:19,510
that you just gave him the feeling today, to be a poacher.

645
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,400
Are there still actual poachers?

646
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,330
Oh yes.

647
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:23,450
I don't understand that.

648
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:27,110
Today it's much easier to buy game in a venison store.

649
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:29,060
Today's poachers are the lords of the hunting grounds,

650
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,940
who shoot the bucks who weren't approved by their own hunters.

651
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:37,960
M hm,

652
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,350
it's starting now.

653
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,380
What?

654
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,860
You cannot do that!

655
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,450
Hello! Hello!

656
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,610
What's up?

657
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,660
You cannot ride the material elevator.

658
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,060
The storm is too strong.

659
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:49,940
Not ride?

660
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,190
That doesn't work, else broken.

661
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,490
Better feel cold here, then break your neck.

662
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:54,770
I have to get down.

663
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:55,850
That's not going to work, Marcello.

664
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:57,420
If not going, I go.

665
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,670
Bella!

666
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,630
Man, you're crazy. You can't see your hand in front of your face.

667
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,500
I have to get down. Addio.

668
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,560
Let go of your rendezvous then.

669
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,120
Bella.

670
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:15,890
If you misstep in the wall, you'll fall to your death.

671
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,740
Awful weather,

672
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:18,190
it's snowing on the top.

673
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,460
At this season.

674
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,670
This only happens once in a blue moon.

675
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,290
Well look around.

676
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:27,310
It's a crime how badly this bank is secured against burglary.

677
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,210
Why?

678
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:29,950
No bars.

679
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:33,340
The safe is sardine can for nitro blowtorches.

680
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:34,090
You think?

681
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:36,370
One really ponders,

682
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:37,960
to bring your money here.

683
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,310
Tell me about it.

684
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:44,870
Good day, you still know me. Kubesch is my name. Ferdinand Kubesch.

685
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,610
I'd like some information.

686
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:47,110
Sure.

687
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:49,580
Concerning an account for me.

688
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:50,970
A checking account.

689
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:54,040
Well I don't know the nicknames of these things.

690
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,680
I think of an account, where I get more

691
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,270
money back then I

692
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:58,990
payed in.

693
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:00,060
A savings account.

694
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,210
Yes, I think that's it.

695
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,120
Bella.

696
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:10,380
For heavens sake.

697
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:13,120
Marcello's rosary.

698
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,740
Something must have happened.

699
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,720
Mr. Burger, please cover for me at the counter.

700
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,480
Of course.

701
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,170
Come, well come,

702
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,050
Mr. engineer.

703
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:30,540
Yes.

704
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,550
Something must have happened, to Marcello.

705
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,760
Nothing happened.

706
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,250
He had to stay at mid-station with the other workers.

707
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,510
We couldn't risk using the material elevator.

708
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:41,220
But look at the dog.

709
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,690
Something has happened.

710
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:45,390
It brought this. Marcello's rosary.

711
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,390
He wouldn't be that crazy...

712
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,800
Calm yourself down.

713
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,070
We talk to the mid-station.

714
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,450
He's there for sure.

715
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:23,070
Hm, the line is torn.

716
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,880
We call the mountain rescue service.

717
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,340
Police Department Kaprun.

718
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:46,080
Ok, I'll go fetch the people.

719
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:49,710
Soo.

720
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:56,450
Telephone.

721
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:57,250
Well and?

722
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:58,260
Well.

723
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:04,970
Hello?

724
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:06,520
Forest administration.

725
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:10,750
Someone's stuck in the rock face.

726
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,150
Just a moment.

727
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:13,890
Gimme!

728
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:14,970
Yes. ...

729
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,090
the climbing iron rope.

730
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:21,090


731
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:21,950
My things too.

732
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:23,470
We will fetch the dog shortly.

733
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,020
You stay here, it's difficult enough to get one person out of the wall.

734
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,350
I bring to your attention, that I am obliged

735
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:29,960
to participate in every rescue operation.

736
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:30,970
Well then...

737
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:41,430
We notify you, as soon as we find him.

738
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:42,380
Thanks, gentlemen.

739
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,510
Well then.

740
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:53,020
Look, your rope unfastened. I tuck it in there.

741
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,510
They are coming already.

742
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:55,420
Thank God!

743
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,800
I can't stand this rain.

744
00:39:58,970 --> 00:39:59,780
Come!

745
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:00,710
Awful weather.

746
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:02,260
Let's march.

747
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,240
No, thanks.

748
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,050
Drink.

749
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:38,400
You don't help anybody, if you torture yourself.

750
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:42,490
Stupid of me.

751
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:44,160
Strange.

752
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:46,820
What?

753
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,820
I planed to talk with you.

754
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,120
And now, we sit together and it doesn't work again.

755
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,410
It doesn't work?

756
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:54,880
Well,

757
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:57,390
I can guess already.

758
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,170
Let's leave it.

759
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:59,880
It doesn't suit some people in the village.

760
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,480
It's not meant this way.

761
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:03,630
That's nobody's business.

762
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:06,210
Is an italian a worse person?

763
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:08,930
These things doesn't have anything to do with nationality.

764
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:11,500
Then what you're saying is, that Marcello is bad person.

765
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,460
Not that either.

766
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:15,690
But I want to save you from disappointment.

767
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:19,780
Love is something different than living your life together.

768
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,200
Only if you are very lucky,

769
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,390
both things come together.

770
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:26,620
I know, in the beginning you always think,

771
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,020
you belong together because you love.

772
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:32,250
You only think that because you want it to be.

773
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:35,040
But why shouldn't we belong together?

774
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,230
I never knew,

775
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,260
a man could be this tender.

776
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,780
This touching and funny.

777
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,060
Do you understand that?

778
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:47,390
I do, but in every person there are different things, too.

779
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,140
Marcello for example is hot-tempered beyond measure.

780
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:53,080
I met him as he nearly killed a person.

781
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:55,020
It's no use to talk him down.

782
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,220
I don't want to.

783
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,030
I just wanted to make clear,

784
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:00,450
that fitting together is not as easy

785
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,020
as one would like it to be.

786
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,500
You should have seen that.

787
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:07,460
She became completely pale as the dog came in through the door.

788
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:08,520
White as the wall.

789
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,020
And why? Because the fears for her dirty Macaroni.

790
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:13,270
That's a disgrace.

791
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,840
These, these foreigners take away our poshest girls.

792
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,070
Do we need that?

793
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,660
Yes, hear, hear!

794
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:21,310
Well, if she was yours. Please, whatever.

795
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:23,710
But Ms. Raiffeisen bank executive,

796
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,130
that's entirely different.

797
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:26,670
Schnucki, another one.

798
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:28,330
Another one? That's already the forth.

799
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:30,180
So what? I do pay.

800
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,860
It's just because of the driving.

801
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,830
After the 8th double, I drive best.

802
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:37,520
You really have to think about

803
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:40,200
depositing your money in this bank.

804
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,890
You don't have anything to pay in.

805
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:43,240
Good one.

806
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,100
That's not funny,

807
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,790
suddenly you money is gone.

808
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:48,130
Don't talk nonsense.

809
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:50,710
Ms. Hirt embezzling. That's outrageous.

810
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:52,200
Not her. But the foreign workers.

811
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,090
There are enough crooks among them.

812
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,950
I wouldn't be surprised,

813
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:59,010
if he just came on to her,

814
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:01,320
to access the bank more easily.

815
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:03,690
In the night.

816
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,500
Here I am,

817
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,020
here!

818
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,490
He's hanging below there.

819
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:04,450
You can't do anything now.

820
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:05,800
The wind will blow you out of the wall.

821
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:07,400
We have to wait until the storm calms down.

822
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,670
Hopefully, he can hold on that long.

823
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:10,090
Help!

824
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:11,290
I go get him.

825
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:12,590
Don't try a bravura performance.

826
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,280
Let's go.

827
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,110
I can't bear it.

828
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:25,900
We cannot do anything at all.

829
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:28,780
I go meet him.

830
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:31,600
Just part of the way.

831
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,710
I'll come along.

832
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:11,890
Marcello!

833
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:19,680
Marcello.

834
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:21,860
I didn't happen much.

835
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,090
He sprained his ankle

836
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:24,950
and he's a bit frozen.

837
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:26,620
Bring him in to me.

838
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:28,130
I call the doctor.

839
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:30,270
Yes, then everything's fine.

840
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:42,900
Good bye.

841
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:49,160
Marcello, don't talk.

842
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,310
He takes her home every night.

843
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:44,780
But he only leaves in the morning.

844
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:46,900
Gossip, nothing else but gossip

845
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,210
Well, ask Kubesch.

846
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,850
He saw it with his own eyes.

847
00:47:50,850 --> 00:47:51,730
Alright, Mr. Kubesch?

848
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:52,390
What's up?

849
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:54,130
Ms. executive with the Macaroni.

850
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:56,240
Luzie, don't defame.

851
00:47:56,410 --> 00:47:58,890
Perhaps they only drink coffee at night.

852
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:01,710
Italians are said to have a thing for drinking coffee.

853
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,030
I put it behind the counter.

854
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:05,380
I'll come to pick it up later.

855
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:06,700
What's inside?

856
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:09,840
You better take an interest in your guests, Schnucki.

857
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:10,820
Charming as always.

858
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:11,380
A schnapps.

859
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:12,850
I don't drink today. Beat it!

860
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:16,550
Strange,

861
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:18,510
I have to get it sometime.

862
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,050
Got everything?

863
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:21,400
Don't yell!

864
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:23,710
Everything's okay.

865
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,420
You really believe today?

866
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:27,630
Yes. All funds are in the safe.

867
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:28,220
I don't know.

868
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:29,090
But I do.

869
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:30,170
Let's still wait.

870
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:31,100
For what?

871
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:34,360
Until the love of the Macaroni is gone?

872
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:44,580
Wait.

873
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:46,350
That's how you do it.

874
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,300
You always have to know when

875
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:55,930
and where.

876
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:00,710
Yes,

877
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:02,340
back then,

878
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,110
there still was game up here.

879
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:06,050
For the love of --

880
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,880
everything...

881
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:08,980
has changed now

882
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,110
because of...

883
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:11,510
the water reservoir.

884
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:16,110
I think you don't listen to me at all, do you?

885
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:18,790
Oh, yes, we do, certainly.

886
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:19,720
Isn't that right, Marcello?

887
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:21,120
Yes.

888
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,810
Then what did I just tell?

889
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:24,960
About the monarch stag at Schmiedinger Kees.

890
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,070
That was exactly half an hour ago.

891
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:31,380
Oh, it's that late,

892
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:32,210
I have to get home.

893
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:33,100
I take you.

894
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,300
No, with this foot?

895
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:35,640
Yes.

896
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:36,840
Because...

897
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:39,100
if I walk that way,

898
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:40,860
it takes longer...

899
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:42,570
and I stay longer with you.

900
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:45,760
He knows an answer to everything.

901
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:46,940
Good night, Gustl.

902
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:47,960
Good night.

903
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:49,680
And thank you very much.

904
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:53,990
A wouldn't know what for.

905
00:49:56,350 --> 00:49:58,550
And if an alarm system is build in after all?

906
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,710
I can tell you, there isn't one in the basement.

907
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:02,030
Go on.

908
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,520
Don't bustle around that long, start already.

909
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,380
Yeah yeah.

910
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,350
And you really believe we can frame him?

911
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:30,720
Don't bother.

912
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:33,270
The people know already that he creeps about at night.

913
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:34,890
And if she says, that he was with her?

914
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:36,990
She won't say that. No woman admits such a thing.

915
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:38,100
Go on already.

916
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:42,780
No, Marcello.

917
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:44,830
The people talk already.

918
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:46,570
Please go home.

919
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:48,320
People talk. What's difference?

920
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:49,510
It,

921
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:51,250
it makes a difference.

922
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:52,240
What?

923
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:56,420
I tell you that tomorrow. It's too late today.

924
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,430
Good night.

925
00:50:57,530 --> 00:50:59,070
Good night, Angelina.

926
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:04,730
[Italian]

927
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:10,690
What a mess.

928
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,310
The Macaroni's bloody mutt.

929
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:17,010
The beast will wake the whole neighborhood.

930
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:18,910
Come!

931
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:21,410
Bloody, miserable dog.

932
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:31,810
Bella.

933
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:41,780
My dog! [Italian]

934
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:44,060
[Italian]

935
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:46,340
[Italian]

936
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:49,720
[Italian]

937
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:11,150
Somebody broke a window.

938
00:52:11,350 --> 00:52:12,540
What is going on there?

939
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:31,080
What happened here?

940
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:34,240
Ah, inspector.

941
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,140
It happened this way,

942
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:40,280
Rappold Felix and I came along here

943
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:42,440
and heard something suspicious.

944
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:43,380
And?

945
00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:47,370
And we then saw, how the guy tinkered with the bars.

946
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:48,450
That's not true.

947
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:50,180
He jumps him..

948
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:53,270
and then "this" happened.

949
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:55,310
I have to arrest you.

950
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:57,920
The man is dead.

951
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:06,210
Come along.

952
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:08,320
Back you beast.

953
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:13,760
Ready.

954
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:26,450
He was charged with manslaughter.

955
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:29,100
In his trial.

956
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:32,680
The court retires for deliberation.

957
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:35,660
Thank God!

958
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:38,560
Okay, let's go inside...

959
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,780
Two or three years.

960
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:40,880
You never know.

961
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,890
Good question.

962
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:57,030
Don't be afraid, he is going to get what he deserves.

963
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:58,320
It won't take long.

964
00:54:58,910 --> 00:55:00,380
A completely clear case.

965
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:01,420
I don't know.

966
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:03,100
It could have been an accident.

967
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:04,090
An accident.

968
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:05,900
At two o'clock in the night at the bank.

969
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,490
What was the Macaroni doing there?

970
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:09,700
You could say the same about Rappold.

971
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:10,770
Precisely not.

972
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,730
Rappold wasn't the boyfriend...

973
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:15,030
of Ms. bank executive.

974
00:55:15,970 --> 00:55:17,090
I don't understand at all,

975
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:19,760
why the court didn't go into the break-in attempt.

976
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,090
That's a mean lie. He didn't break in.

977
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:23,350
You say that.

978
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:25,960
You would have said that too, if the break in succeeded.

979
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:27,900
Perhaps you would have given him an alibi, too.

980
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,690
That he was with you at the time of the offense.

981
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,060
The Mister Heart-breaker.

982
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:35,940
Ugh.

983
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:38,070
A cigarette?

984
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:40,000
Thanks.

985
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:48,880
Please enter. The hearing continues.

986
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,640
Ah, now the Macaroni gets what he deserves.

987
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,750
Come, so we don't miss anything.

988
00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:18,050
The defendant Marcello Scalzi

989
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:21,020
is hereby convicted of the crime of manslaughter

990
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:23,960
according to §140 criminal law...

991
00:56:24,470 --> 00:56:25,800
and will be ...

992
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:30,840
according to §142 criminal law...

993
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:35,530
Bella!

994
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:36,920
What's going on here?

995
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,610
Now we also have mutts in the courtroom.

996
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:40,160
That's not the dogs fault.

997
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:42,160
Bella.

998
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:44,020
How did it come in here?

999
00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:47,610
Bella. Bella.

1000
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:51,210
May I?

1001
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:52,820
[Italian]

1002
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,310
Addio Bella.

1003
00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:06,550
Addio Bella.

1004
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:11,490
Quiet Bella.

1005
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:13,080
Nice and quit.

1006
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:15,210
Yes.

1007
00:57:15,210 --> 00:57:16,790
Everything is going to be alright.

1008
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:17,710
Yes.

1009
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:19,160
Stay quiet.

1010
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:30,380
Background: The defendant Marcello Scalzi...

1011
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:32,880
is hereby convicted of the crime of manslaughter...

1012
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,920
according to §140 criminal law...

1013
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:39,790
and will be according to §142 criminal law...

1014
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:44,710
with the use of §265a code of criminal procedure...

1015
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:48,610
sentenced to two years in prison.

1016
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,890
In life

1017
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,240
things never turn out the way

1018
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,790
you wish.

1019
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:56,260
Not ever.

1020
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:57,800
And different

1021
00:57:58,020 --> 00:57:59,200
for everybody.

1022
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:01,940
That's difficult for a man

1023
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,560
who loves freedom.

1024
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:06,400
The sun, the independence.

1025
00:58:07,890 --> 00:58:10,640
Angelika moved to Vienna,

1026
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,030
to the head office.

1027
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:14,290
She immersed,

1028
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:16,520
a colorless particle

1029
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:18,800
in the office machinery.

1030
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:26,890
And for Bella,

1031
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:29,610
a new life started too.

1032
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:31,570
Bella!

1033
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:33,370
Bella! Come here!

1034
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:37,760
You can't just go hunting.

1035
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:39,190
You're not allowed.

1036
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:40,040
No!

1037
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,420
Bad, that's very bad.

1038
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:43,370
Give that to me.

1039
00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:45,970
Don't you want to become a good hunting dog?

1040
00:58:45,970 --> 00:58:47,360
You still have much to learn.

1041
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:10,060
Our Bella traced the poor animal.

1042
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:11,750
Otherwise it would have perished.

1043
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:13,510
I tell you, Ms. Petra,

1044
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:15,540
she's going to be the best hunting dog,

1045
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:16,890
we ever had.

1046
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,480
Many things have changed here in general.

1047
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:19,320
Yes,

1048
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:21,320
yes the assistant forester, too.

1049
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:22,500
He, too.

1050
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:23,830
He's so hardworking.

1051
00:59:23,970 --> 00:59:25,950
We didn't expect that of him.

1052
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:27,400
I and Mr. Forester.

1053
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,480
Never!

1054
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,230
Petra,

1055
00:59:32,330 --> 00:59:33,630
you disloyal thing.

1056
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:36,790
Why did you let us down on Christmas?

1057
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:40,860
I was invited, you know.

1058
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:42,840
Ah, doesn't matter. The main thing is that you're here now.

1059
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:43,720
How long do you stay?

1060
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:44,970
I have to leave very soon.

1061
00:59:44,970 --> 00:59:46,690
I'm going to go on a skiing vacation in Kitzbühel.

1062
00:59:46,690 --> 00:59:47,910
And now I thought you stay a little.

1063
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:48,810
Ah no. Rather not.

1064
00:59:48,810 --> 00:59:50,480
If not because of me, then because of Bernd.

1065
00:59:50,610 --> 00:59:52,290
I thought you don't think much of him?

1066
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:53,600
One's allowed to mistaken once in a while.

1067
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,660
No, no! He's a great guy.

1068
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,830
I thought he cares about you.

1069
00:59:57,930 --> 00:59:58,980
Yes, that's what I thought, too.

1070
00:59:58,980 --> 00:59:59,800
What does that mean?

1071
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:03,610
That means, your observation skills are miserable for a hunter.

1072
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:05,630
He cares about someone completely different.

1073
01:00:05,730 --> 01:00:08,890
Nonsense. You stay at least until he comes back.

1074
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:09,840
No.

1075
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:10,960
Where is he?

1076
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:12,000
He is in Vienna.

1077
01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:22,970
Yes.

1078
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:24,440
You have a visitor.

1079
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:25,490
I do?

1080
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:27,780
Bella!

1081
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:31,690
To me!

1082
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:33,930
Good girl.

1083
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,910
It's not allowed to come to me at all?

1084
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,480
It's now.

1085
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:39,210
Go.

1086
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:40,830
Bella!

1087
01:00:41,770 --> 01:00:42,400
Bella!

1088
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,290
How happy she is.

1089
01:00:43,290 --> 01:00:44,040
And you,

1090
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,190
are you happy, too?

1091
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,360
Yes,

1092
01:00:49,170 --> 01:00:50,150
I am happy.

1093
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:51,780
And that makes me happy.

1094
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:55,160
Please, take a seat.

1095
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:55,930
Thanks.

1096
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:57,720
How I must look...

1097
01:00:58,090 --> 01:00:59,510
Pale and sad.

1098
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:01,120
But that's hardly surprising.

1099
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:03,080
You don't belong here.

1100
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,020
There's much you have to tell me.

1101
01:01:05,410 --> 01:01:07,030
What's new in Kaprun.

1102
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:08,870
I want to know everything,

1103
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:10,360
even the gossip.

1104
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:11,120
No,

1105
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:12,660
there's no gossip about you anymore.

1106
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:13,790
On the contrary,

1107
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:16,560
the people start to feel bad because you're gone.

1108
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:21,950
[Italian]

1109
01:01:21,950 --> 01:01:22,780
Grazie.

1110
01:01:22,810 --> 01:01:23,810
[Italian]

1111
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:31,450
[Italian]

1112
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:36,550
Recipient unknown.

1113
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:40,710
[Italian]

1114
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,120

1115

[Italian]

1116
01:01:48,310 --> 01:01:49,220
Tell her

1117
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:50,810
he is in prison

1118
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:52,360
because he murdered someone.

1119
01:01:53,090 --> 01:01:54,430
Marcello [Italian]

1120
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:58,060
[Italian]

1121
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,140
Cut it short, Dimitri!

1122
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:01,690
Murdered. Done.

1123
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:05,420
[Italian]

1124
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:07,100

01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:09,620
Now, tell her how it was, the thing,

1126
01:02:10,050 --> 01:02:10,750
with his...

1127
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:11,190
dolce.

1128
01:02:13,210 --> 01:02:14,130
Talk already.

1129
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:15,680
Amore,

1130
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:17,290
grande amore,

1131
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:18,590
with Signorina.

1132
01:02:18,910 --> 01:02:20,530
bella Signorina.

1133
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:21,560
Capisce?

1134
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:28,300
A visitor.

1135
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:29,620
So early?

1136
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:32,610
It's not... like always...

1137
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:37,370
Signorina Hirt?

1138
01:02:37,370 --> 01:02:38,290
Yes?

1139
01:02:41,650 --> 01:02:43,270
Signorina [Italian]

1140
01:02:43,370 --> 01:02:44,540
[Italian]

1141
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:48,900
[Italian]

1142
01:02:49,490 --> 01:02:50,490
Marcello?

1143
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:51,970
[Italian]

1144
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:54,510
[Italian]

1145
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:55,960
Marcello Scalzi.

1146
01:02:56,030 --> 01:02:56,970
Who are you?

1147
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:59,120
[Italian]

1148
01:02:59,270 --> 01:03:01,670
[Italian]

1149
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:03,160
[Italian]

1150
01:03:03,310 --> 01:03:04,640
[Italian]

1151
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:12,400
[Italian]

1152
01:03:12,650 --> 01:03:13,870
[Italian]

1153
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:16,540
[Italian]

1154
01:03:16,810 --> 01:03:20,850
[Italian]

1155
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:29,350
Marcello's...

1156
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:31,950
I don't even know.

1157
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,740
Leave me alone with her.

1158
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:36,310
I'll handle it.

1159
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:43,640
Just calm down.

1160
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:47,830
Per favore si tranquila.

1161
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:50,850
[Italian]

1162
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:55,230
It's very embarrassing for me,

1163
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:57,780
but I have to point out very clearly,

1164
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:00,350
that it's not allowed to keep dogs in my apartment.

1165
01:04:00,350 --> 01:04:02,070
I don't keep it. It's just for the visit.

1166
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:04,050
But again and again. That's the fifth time now.

1167
01:04:04,050 --> 01:04:05,130
Sorry,

1168
01:04:05,130 --> 01:04:06,200
but it doesn't do anything.

1169
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,730
The carpets suffer.

1170
01:04:07,870 --> 01:04:10,250
And concerning the rest of the foreign traffic in your room...

1171
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:12,520
Please don't get worked up unnecessarily. I quit.

1172
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:13,500
That's just...

1173
01:04:16,110 --> 01:04:17,960
She is Marcello's fiancee.

1174
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,740
But I told her, that you didn't know that...

1175
01:04:21,350 --> 01:04:22,370
What's wrong?

1176
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:24,190
I just canceled my room.

1177
01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:25,910
Well done!

1178
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:27,300
You don't need it anymore.

1179
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,580
I have to give you the pleasant news,

1180
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:33,090
that Kaprun wants to have its Raiffeisen bank executive back.

1181
01:05:42,050 --> 01:05:45,430
... that you're here again.

1182
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:14,890
Attention. Detonation!

1183
01:06:14,890 --> 01:06:16,380
Full cover!

1184
01:06:19,470 --> 01:06:20,520
[unintelligible dialogue]

1185
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:23,490
Full cover!

1186
01:07:56,810 --> 01:07:58,240
Miss Angelika.

1187
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:00,510
Miss Angelika!

1188
01:08:00,510 --> 01:08:01,280
Yes?

1189
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:04,120
Please let me tell you again privately

1190
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:07,550
how glad I am, that you returned.

1191
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:09,870
Thank you, Mr. Zingerl,

1192
01:08:09,950 --> 01:08:12,130
but you told me that yesterday already.

1193
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:13,960
Yes, this was for the general public.

1194
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:15,330
Oh, sorry.

1195
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:17,050
But today,

1196
01:08:17,050 --> 01:08:19,650
Miss Angelika I would like to tell you as...

1197
01:08:19,650 --> 01:08:20,800
regular customer...

1198
01:08:20,970 --> 01:08:22,190
Yes, too.

1199
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:24,800
But mainly as private person.

1200
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,000
And as that,

1201
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:27,590
I mean as such,

1202
01:08:27,710 --> 01:08:30,010
I would like to repeat my offer.

1203
01:08:30,010 --> 01:08:30,990
Mr. Zingerl,

1204
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,990
please excuse me for a moment.

1205
01:08:36,870 --> 01:08:38,420
What can I do for you?

1206
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:40,570
It's about...

1207
01:08:41,090 --> 01:08:43,200
I want to set up a family savings account.

1208
01:08:45,050 --> 01:08:46,060
You want to marry?

1209
01:08:46,070 --> 01:08:46,700
Yes.

1210
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,850
Then fill out this here please.

1211
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:57,260
First your Name and then your wife's name.

1212
01:08:58,120 --> 01:08:59,100
Bernd

1213
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:01,350
Helwig,

1214
01:09:01,870 --> 01:09:04,120
Angelika...

1215
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:05,340
Bernd!

1216
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:08,720
It's not that easy.

1217
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:14,170
I didn't mean it this way.

1218
01:09:14,930 --> 01:09:16,420
Don't you want to give me some time?

1219
01:09:17,890 --> 01:09:18,700
Yes I do.

1220
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,070
Then keep it.

1221
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:21,560
As long as you want.

1222
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:23,200
Until that's true,

1223
01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:24,670
what's already written in there.

1224
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:26,910
Bernd and Angelika Helwig.

1225
01:10:15,270 --> 01:10:16,720
The Macaroni!

1226
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,190
Let! Let!

1227
01:10:20,190 --> 01:10:22,460
I'll take you to the police myself.

1228
01:10:22,470 --> 01:10:23,780
Let go of me!

1229
01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:34,980
Mr. assistant forster. Did you read already

1230
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:38,130
that the italian Marcello Scalzi escaped from prison?

1231
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:45,150
Sit there!

1232
01:11:45,410 --> 01:11:46,490
And eat!

1233
01:11:46,570 --> 01:11:47,540
Not eat.

1234
01:11:47,620 --> 01:11:48,600
Angelika.

1235
01:11:48,740 --> 01:11:50,560
Don't you have other problems now, you...

1236
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:51,860
you stupid guy.

1237
01:11:51,860 --> 01:11:53,450
Angelika. Please bring Angelika.

1238
01:11:53,450 --> 01:11:56,960
You better think of yourself now.

1239
01:11:57,250 --> 01:11:58,150
Please.

1240
01:11:58,270 --> 01:11:59,530
Angelika.

1241
01:11:59,890 --> 01:12:02,570
All right then, I bring her here, you fool, (you).

1242
01:12:43,210 --> 01:12:44,810
Attention.

1243
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:46,910
The Linz Police Department reports

1244
01:12:46,910 --> 01:12:50,510
that the italian foreign worker Marcello Scalzi escaped.

1245
01:12:50,730 --> 01:12:52,150
It's suspected

1246
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:54,930
that he proceeds toward Kaprun, his last whereabouts.

1247
01:12:55,050 --> 01:12:55,970
Over and out.

1248
01:13:06,910 --> 01:13:07,760
Angelina.

1249
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,330
You shouldn't have done that.

1250
01:13:09,570 --> 01:13:10,600
Not allowed.

1251
01:13:10,730 --> 01:13:12,250
Forbidden. Always not allowed.

1252
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:13,620
That makes everything worse.

1253
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:15,620
Och, not worse than locked up.

1254
01:13:15,770 --> 01:13:17,080
Always only your letters.

1255
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:18,470
Paper, paper!

1256
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:20,530
You come with me.

1257
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:21,070
Now.

1258
01:13:21,070 --> 01:13:23,070
How do you imagine that, Marcello?

1259
01:13:23,150 --> 01:13:24,420
Imagine later.

1260
01:13:24,550 --> 01:13:25,570
Come now.

1261
01:13:25,820 --> 01:13:27,360
You and I belong together.

1262
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:28,150
No.

1263
01:13:28,420 --> 01:13:31,460
You only think that, if you love one another, because you want it to be.

1264
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:33,340
Oh, I understand.

1265
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:34,960
You think of me as a murderer.

1266
01:13:35,030 --> 01:13:36,550
No, that's not it.

1267
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,550
Please try to understand me.

1268
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:39,740
Love...

1269
01:13:40,030 --> 01:13:42,290
is something different than living your life together.

1270
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:44,490
I don't understand. You come with me. Now!

1271
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:46,010
No!

1272
01:13:46,990 --> 01:13:48,070
Marcello!

1273
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:49,360
Understand me!

1274
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:50,940
I cannot understand.

1275
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:55,270
Marcello, we didn't know enough about each other.

1276
01:13:55,270 --> 01:13:57,470
Why didn't you tell me back then about Tina?

1277
01:13:58,160 --> 01:13:59,120
Tina?

1278
01:13:59,660 --> 01:14:01,860
We both dreamt a beautiful dream.

1279
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:05,220
A romantic fortune. Somewhere on an island.

1280
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:07,940
But this island for two people alone doesn't exist.

1281
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:09,870
You can't live dreams.

1282
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,100
You must live reality.

1283
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:15,610
And my reality is here. And yours, Tina.

1284
01:14:18,790 --> 01:14:20,730
Visitors, Gustl?

1285
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:22,450
If a had visitors,

1286
01:14:22,740 --> 01:14:24,890
I wouldn't sit out here alone.

1287
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:26,930
But the dog smells something.

1288
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:29,550
Well then ask the dog,

1289
01:14:29,690 --> 01:14:31,460
if you believe it more then me.

1290
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:32,760
You must go.

1291
01:14:32,950 --> 01:14:35,030
Try to get through to Italy.

1292
01:14:35,130 --> 01:14:36,090
Home.

1293
01:14:36,260 --> 01:14:38,320
[Italian]

1294
01:14:38,570 --> 01:14:39,440
Quick.

1295
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:40,430
[Italian]

1296
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:43,080
We may come in for a schnapps, may we not?

1297
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:45,640
What are you looking for anyway?

1298
01:14:45,890 --> 01:14:48,640
Perhaps the ram you never hit.

1299
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:49,940
Possible.

1300
01:14:49,940 --> 01:14:52,610
And what happens if I won't let you in?

1301
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:54,950
Then we enter without the landlords admission.

1302
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:01,250
Bella.

1303
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:03,090
You?

1304
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:04,880
He sensed me and gave me away.

1305
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:07,230
But that was not very gallant of you.

1306
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:13,460
Visitors after all?

1307
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:17,550
You're still allowed to make fun of a hunter, aren't you?

1308
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:18,940
And furthermore,

1309
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:21,460
a gentleman has to...

1310
01:15:21,570 --> 01:15:22,940
keep his mouth shut.

1311
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:25,800
Well then,

1312
01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:27,150
because you are here already,

1313
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:29,160
let's have...

1314
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:30,800
a schnapps, eh?

1315
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:53,170
He must have been here.

1316
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:54,670
Yes and has got a weapon now.

1317
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:56,070
Yes, but...

1318
01:15:56,580 --> 01:15:58,020
only blanks.

1319
01:16:12,630 --> 01:16:13,580
Come Bella.

1320
01:16:21,770 --> 01:16:22,720
Bernd?

1321
01:16:22,770 --> 01:16:23,330
Where to?

1322
01:16:23,330 --> 01:16:25,070
The trace is still fresh. The dog is going to find him.

1323
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,860
That's not our business, and yours even less.

1324
01:16:26,910 --> 01:16:27,990
An escaped prisoner...

1325
01:16:27,990 --> 01:16:30,630
Is this about a prisoner or late revenge?

1326
01:16:31,690 --> 01:16:33,470
Come, let's notify the police.

1327
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:39,650
Tow men to the bridge and you with me.

1328
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:22,530
He must have come over the mountains.

1329
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:26,200
In my opinion, he tries to escape across the italian border.

1330
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:28,800
We stay alert, naturally.

1331
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:31,490
But I recommend to close off the passes in the south.

1332
01:17:32,530 --> 01:17:34,120
He certainly isn't here anymore.

1333
01:17:37,530 --> 01:17:38,600
You were right.

1334
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,760
Now I'm almost glad he succeeded.

1335
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:43,600
It's better for everybody. For you, for him and for Angelika.

1336
01:18:24,570 --> 01:18:25,420
You!

1337
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:27,170
What the dog smells isn't game.

1338
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:31,350
Marcello.

1339
01:18:31,650 --> 01:18:32,870
Be reasonable, Scalzi.

1340
01:18:32,870 --> 01:18:34,560
Attention. He is got a weapon.

1341
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,910
Away! Away!

1342
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:38,750
Go away.

1343
01:18:38,970 --> 01:18:39,980
AWAY!

1344
01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:41,810
I shoot you!

1345
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:43,500
Bella!

1346
01:19:43,660 --> 01:19:45,000
Bella, come!

1347
01:19:48,090 --> 01:19:49,420
Bella, here!

1348
01:19:56,050 --> 01:19:57,140
Bella, come!

1349
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:11,690
The dog could tell that,

1350
01:20:11,690 --> 01:20:12,810
if he talked.

1351
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:14,340
But the tale

1352
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:16,370
is not finished yet.

1353
01:20:20,490 --> 01:20:21,490
Yes...

1354
01:20:21,730 --> 01:20:23,300
Each bad weather...

1355
01:20:23,380 --> 01:20:24,620
clears up sometime.

1356
01:20:24,990 --> 01:20:26,910
And then the sun comes out.

1357
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:28,660
Yes, Bella.

1358
01:20:29,150 --> 01:20:30,750
Bella Piccolina.

1359
01:20:32,020 --> 01:20:35,620
We still have unfinished business, Bella.

1360
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:37,090
Come.

1361
01:20:51,530 --> 01:20:52,700
There, go.

1362
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:56,250
There she is,

1363
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,050
Bella.
