1
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,812
<i>COUMBITE</i>
(Cooperative labor)

2
00:01:32,376 --> 00:01:36,073
"THE FLOWER BEGINS,
IT JOINS OUR HANDS.

3
00:01:36,193 --> 00:01:39,918
MANUEL IS THE CANAL
THROUGH WHICH WATER FLOWS.

4
00:01:40,038 --> 00:01:43,570
THE WIND BLOWS
THE SAILS OF THE <i>COUMBITE</i>.

5
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:48,016
MANUEL IS THE PATH
THAT WILL QUENCH OUR THIRST."

6
00:02:16,602 --> 00:02:18,191
Hey, it's up ahead.

7
00:02:18,311 --> 00:02:20,963
- There, there.
- Stop up ahead there.

8
00:02:22,873 --> 00:02:24,529
You can stop now.

9
00:02:26,315 --> 00:02:29,659
Wait, I need to take down
a bag for him. Wait.

10
00:02:30,423 --> 00:02:32,722
- Thanks.
- Okay, let's go.

11
00:03:50,255 --> 00:03:52,630
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

12
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,839
- Are you from here?
- By the grace of God.

13
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,993
I am too.

14
00:03:58,679 --> 00:04:00,823
I've been away for 15 years.

15
00:04:00,943 --> 00:04:02,543
I was in Cuba.

16
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:07,955
Before, there wasn't such drought.

17
00:04:23,104 --> 00:04:26,226
- Lady Santelia, good day!
- Good day, Anaisa!

18
00:04:26,346 --> 00:04:30,466
- How's your family, dear?
- Everyone's good. How about you?

19
00:04:30,586 --> 00:04:35,988
- Well, my husband's a little sick.
- It'll pass. - God willing.

20
00:04:39,815 --> 00:04:43,664
- So your name is Anaisa. - Yes.
- My name is Manuel.

21
00:04:45,257 --> 00:04:47,187
This is as far as I go.

22
00:04:48,792 --> 00:04:50,303
Anaisa.

23
00:04:53,511 --> 00:04:56,350
- Thanks for being so friendly.
- It's nothing.

24
00:04:57,019 --> 00:05:00,565
I'm not going very far either.
My home is over there.

25
00:05:00,685 --> 00:05:04,905
- Do you know Bienaimé and Délira?
- Yes. - I'm their son.

26
00:05:37,276 --> 00:05:40,445
Oh, my God!
Have mercy on us!

27
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:45,214
- But the Lord is the creator,
is he not? - He is.

28
00:05:45,292 --> 00:05:47,154
Well, the earth is barren,

29
00:05:47,225 --> 00:05:50,247
so the Lord is the creator of
the earth and barrenness.

30
00:05:50,367 --> 00:05:52,602
Oh, don't torment me, Bienaimé!

31
00:06:02,342 --> 00:06:03,872
Then consider this:

32
00:06:05,108 --> 00:06:07,425
There are so many creatures...

33
00:06:07,763 --> 00:06:09,490
...asking for things...

34
00:06:10,374 --> 00:06:12,514
...that an irritating noise forms,

35
00:06:12,634 --> 00:06:16,014
and God says: "I don't know
who needs or doesn't need water."

36
00:06:16,134 --> 00:06:20,521
You're the one filling the earth
with fussing and bickering.

37
00:06:28,114 --> 00:06:30,483
All you do is argue!

38
00:07:02,657 --> 00:07:04,262
Manuel...

39
00:07:12,283 --> 00:07:13,906
Manuel.

40
00:07:14,632 --> 00:07:16,521
What's that noise?

41
00:07:17,366 --> 00:07:18,538
My goodness!

42
00:07:18,658 --> 00:07:21,393
Boy, get over here
and shake my hand!

43
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:24,767
Honor and respect, Dad.

44
00:07:24,887 --> 00:07:28,006
- Your mother prayed a lot for you.
- You're really back!

45
00:07:28,126 --> 00:07:30,727
You should've told her
you were coming.

46
00:07:32,066 --> 00:07:34,718
The shock of seeing you
almost killed her.

47
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:38,914
- Is it good? - It sure is, Dad.
- Well, we'll see.

48
00:07:45,877 --> 00:07:49,725
- What are you laughing at?
- No, it's nothing, Dad. - Yeah, yeah.

49
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,137
He's gotten like this
over the years.

50
00:07:54,105 --> 00:07:57,824
Don't just stand there.
Come have a drink to settle down.

51
00:08:08,084 --> 00:08:11,699
Where's your respect for the dead?
They're thirsty too.

52
00:08:20,446 --> 00:08:23,385
Okay, I'll go tell everyone
that he's back.

53
00:08:33,323 --> 00:08:36,712
- You'll never leave again,
right, Manuel? - Never.

54
00:08:36,832 --> 00:08:38,717
I came to put down roots.

55
00:08:39,507 --> 00:08:42,715
Although the soil isn't good for
putting down roots now.

56
00:08:42,835 --> 00:08:46,506
It's because there isn't
a drop of rain in the sky, son.

57
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:50,711
- God has abandoned us.
- This isn't the good Lord's doing.

58
00:09:06,021 --> 00:09:09,120
There are earthly things,
and there are heavenly things.

59
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,626
God has abandoned
the black man, Manuel.

60
00:09:11,706 --> 00:09:14,165
No, it's we who have
abandoned the earth.

61
00:09:14,212 --> 00:09:16,202
Hey, don't talk like that.

62
00:09:18,813 --> 00:09:23,144
- I saw that the forest was cut down.
- How else could we live, son?

63
00:09:23,703 --> 00:09:26,708
But without trees,
the land won't absorb rain.

64
00:09:27,226 --> 00:09:30,558
It was Man's axe that did that,
not the good Lord.

65
00:09:31,867 --> 00:09:34,941
<i>I dreamed you were coming, Manuel!</i>

66
00:09:36,591 --> 00:09:38,255
Honor, Delphine.

67
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:42,412
In my dreams, you were
a big, strong man,

68
00:09:42,532 --> 00:09:45,639
but for some reason,
you were much older.

69
00:09:46,869 --> 00:09:49,152
- Laurélien.
- Manuel.

70
00:09:49,272 --> 00:09:53,422
I said to myself, "A stone thrown skyward
returns to the earth."

71
00:09:53,542 --> 00:09:55,565
You're that stone, Manuel.

72
00:09:56,472 --> 00:09:58,890
- How are you?
- I could be worse.

73
00:09:58,947 --> 00:10:00,629
You don't age, Uncle Bombon.

74
00:10:00,676 --> 00:10:03,570
Hey, don't start!
The ladies still love me.

75
00:10:03,651 --> 00:10:06,955
It's because they know:
"An old stick is the best companion."

76
00:10:07,075 --> 00:10:09,463
Simidor, you're such a mess.

77
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,960
Yes, but you make
the best <i>coumbite</i> songs.

78
00:10:12,134 --> 00:10:15,439
- What <i>coumbite</i>? Have you seen the soil?
- Yes, I felt it.

79
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:18,101
Well, without water,
the drums have no life.

80
00:10:18,176 --> 00:10:20,608
- What about Fanchó Springs?
- It dried up.

81
00:10:20,728 --> 00:10:23,485
- And Lorie Springs?
- You're persistent, boy.

82
00:10:23,605 --> 00:10:26,002
Not even a drop.
Only Sobi Swamp is left.

83
00:10:26,122 --> 00:10:28,145
It's a pond for mosquitos!

84
00:10:28,265 --> 00:10:31,524
- Hey, Manuel, did they have water
where you were? - Tons.

85
00:10:31,594 --> 00:10:34,085
And their sugarcane was
tall and plentiful.

86
00:10:34,161 --> 00:10:37,804
- It must be nice to live on
land like that. - Well, not quite.

87
00:10:37,924 --> 00:10:41,514
For a black Haitian cane-cutter,
it isn't so great.

88
00:10:41,634 --> 00:10:43,681
We are like pots...

89
00:10:43,801 --> 00:10:45,957
...which cook the food,
and then...

90
00:10:46,077 --> 00:10:49,455
...can't go to the table because
they'd dirty the tablecloth.

91
00:10:49,575 --> 00:10:51,242
That's exactly right.

92
00:10:56,585 --> 00:10:58,877
I could hardly sleep last night.

93
00:10:58,955 --> 00:11:01,535
It's because you're excited
to see your son.

94
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:04,286
Like hell it is.
It's the damn fleas.

95
00:11:16,128 --> 00:11:18,260
Manuel, why didn't you call me?

96
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,408
When will you stop
treating me like a kid, Mom?

97
00:12:57,386 --> 00:12:58,887
Good morning.

98
00:13:09,753 --> 00:13:12,393
You're the man who
just returned from Cuba?

99
00:13:12,471 --> 00:13:13,976
Yes, that's me.

100
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,760
- You're Bienaimé's son, right?
- Yes, that's me.

101
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,840
<i>Any luck, Manuel?</i>

102
00:14:40,414 --> 00:14:41,875
I tried that once.

103
00:14:41,995 --> 00:14:44,902
I thought there might
be a trickle left.

104
00:14:45,102 --> 00:14:47,905
Either it comes from the sky,
or not at all.

105
00:14:48,025 --> 00:14:49,870
We just have to accept it.

106
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,560
When a man accepts things,
he's left crippled.

107
00:14:53,104 --> 00:14:57,413
Over in Cuba, we didn't accept things.
We staged a strike against the masters.

108
00:14:57,533 --> 00:15:01,520
Maybe men can be reasoned with,
but the heavens can't.

109
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:06,008
If you do earthly things well,
the heavens don't matter.

110
00:15:06,254 --> 00:15:10,641
- What has your machete gotten you, man?
- This is just the beginning.

111
00:15:12,269 --> 00:15:14,438
Laurélien, I'm going to find water.

112
00:15:14,558 --> 00:15:17,055
If they see you over there,
they'll call you crazy.

113
00:15:17,085 --> 00:15:19,904
- So don't tell them anything.
- Okay, man.

114
00:15:20,357 --> 00:15:21,862
Come on.

115
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:26,426
If I need you after I find water,
can I count on you?

116
00:15:26,546 --> 00:15:28,390
You bet, man.

117
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:21,299
My cousin is grown up now
and anyone can see her beauty.

118
00:16:21,594 --> 00:16:23,202
Even wicked men.

119
00:16:23,898 --> 00:16:27,217
- Are you talking about yourself,
nephew? - No.

120
00:16:31,901 --> 00:16:34,219
I'm talking about someone else.

121
00:16:45,562 --> 00:16:49,122
There's always something new
on your mother's head.

122
00:16:55,421 --> 00:16:57,861
I've sent for Madame Joseph.

123
00:16:57,981 --> 00:17:00,786
- Madame Joseph?
- Yes, the <i>mambo</i>.

124
00:17:00,906 --> 00:17:03,853
- She'll get here tomorrow,
God willing. - Ah.

125
00:17:04,915 --> 00:17:06,270
<i>What a pain!</i>

126
00:17:06,494 --> 00:17:08,660
The saints demand so much,

127
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:12,121
all so they'll grant us water
and end this misfortune.

128
00:17:12,382 --> 00:17:14,268
Are you going to help me?

129
00:17:15,515 --> 00:17:17,600
I have a lot to do, Manuel.

130
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,463
I'll help you, Mom.

131
00:17:46,974 --> 00:17:49,880
Tomorrow I'd like you
to find the white calf for me.

132
00:17:50,178 --> 00:17:54,492
- Why not wait until it's older?
- What'll we live on, then?

133
00:17:55,677 --> 00:17:58,911
There'll always be time to
eat our teeth down to the gums!

134
00:17:59,031 --> 00:18:00,838
It's in God's hands.

135
00:18:12,575 --> 00:18:15,304
Manuel, you don't seem
like yourself.

136
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:20,059
I was wondering why a man spat
as I went to greet him the other day.

137
00:18:20,564 --> 00:18:22,067
What was he like?

138
00:18:22,187 --> 00:18:24,326
He was a large man
with evil eyes.

139
00:18:24,446 --> 00:18:25,872
- Evil eyes?
- Yes.

140
00:18:25,992 --> 00:18:28,762
- Red like <i>annatto</i>?
- Yes.

141
00:18:29,454 --> 00:18:32,148
Gervilen!
That damn stray dog!

142
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:35,405
When I came here,
I was walking with a girl.

143
00:18:35,504 --> 00:18:38,680
When she found out who I was,
she turned her back on me.

144
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,800
- Who was she?
- Her name was Anaisa.

145
00:18:42,938 --> 00:18:44,438
Oh.

146
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,510
Rosana's daughter.

147
00:18:47,589 --> 00:18:49,496
Why are we enemies, Dad?

148
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:54,557
Blood was spilled.

149
00:19:04,486 --> 00:19:07,138
It was over a piece of land.

150
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:12,073
A piece that ultimately dried up,
like all the others.

151
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:18,001
Dorisca, Gervilen's father...

152
00:19:19,829 --> 00:19:21,875
...wanted it all for himself.

153
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,851
Salvador, my brother,
had a right to it as well.

154
00:19:24,971 --> 00:19:27,520
Then came the arguing,
and the <i>clairin</i>.

155
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:31,779
- Dorisca used to badmouth everyone.
- Yeah, and drink all the time.

156
00:19:33,157 --> 00:19:35,655
He insulted my brother
in front of the men.

157
00:19:35,745 --> 00:19:38,790
So my brother decked him,
and it killed him.

158
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:41,076
I took my share, too.

159
00:19:43,591 --> 00:19:46,372
Then my brother Salvador
died in prison.

160
00:19:49,326 --> 00:19:53,372
- The water hadn't run out by then?
- It was starting to.

161
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:57,179
- But the <i>coumbites</i> ended, right?
- Yes, for good.

162
00:20:00,674 --> 00:20:03,771
So we started to die
before the water ran out.

163
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:08,152
- What are you saying, Manuel?
- No, nothing. Nothing, Dad.

164
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:31,217
- Good morning, Anaisa.
- Get out of my way.

165
00:21:31,337 --> 00:21:33,225
We're going the same way.

166
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:37,200
- I've looked everywhere for you.
- I said move, Manuel.

167
00:21:37,859 --> 00:21:42,018
- You remembered my name.
- God! What are you, deaf?

168
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:45,218
Aren't you tired of
this hatred between us?

169
00:21:45,446 --> 00:21:47,095
So help me, Ana.

170
00:21:49,252 --> 00:21:51,160
They might see us, Manuel.

171
00:21:51,401 --> 00:21:54,565
- Let's meet tomorrow at
<i>Los Lataneros</i> Hill. - I don't know.

172
00:21:54,615 --> 00:21:57,715
- I'll be there in the afternoon.
- I don't know...

173
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,470
<i>Philoget! Philoget!</i>

174
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,524
Come here right now!

175
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,576
- Hey, Manuel.
- What's up?

176
00:23:11,026 --> 00:23:13,761
How about your water, Manuel?
Did you find it?

177
00:23:13,881 --> 00:23:15,610
Not yet, man.

178
00:23:40,271 --> 00:23:42,990
This is as bad as
it's ever been, Manuel.

179
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:45,145
We are cursed men.

180
00:23:45,265 --> 00:23:49,824
Look, we are the earth.
Without us, the earth is nothing.

181
00:23:49,944 --> 00:23:52,222
But we're poor, Manuel.

182
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:57,710
That's because we still don't know
that we're a single... force.

183
00:24:03,718 --> 00:24:07,548
Some day we'll have a great <i>coumbite</i>
to end this misfortune.

184
00:24:08,544 --> 00:24:10,613
Maybe so, man.

185
00:33:38,705 --> 00:33:41,519
Where is that man
who came from Cuba?

186
00:33:46,017 --> 00:33:47,397
I'm here.

187
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,748
I'm here.

188
00:33:49,868 --> 00:33:52,600
- Yes, Dad.
- Yes, Dad.

189
00:33:55,911 --> 00:33:57,800
No, no, no!

190
00:33:58,051 --> 00:34:00,468
- No, Dad.
- No, Dad.

191
00:37:09,513 --> 00:37:11,015
What's up?

192
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:13,962
Get me a <i>clairin</i>.

193
00:37:15,178 --> 00:37:18,915
- You're just playing heavy ones.
- It's all I've got.

194
00:37:19,568 --> 00:37:21,566
You're going to pass to me?

195
00:37:25,101 --> 00:37:27,721
I hear you're talking to
the people here.

196
00:37:27,841 --> 00:37:31,344
You're getting involved in
things that don't concern you.

197
00:37:32,607 --> 00:37:33,983
Fine.

198
00:37:34,103 --> 00:37:37,416
Suit yourself, but don't say
I didn't warn you.

199
00:37:47,963 --> 00:37:49,472
Is that all?

200
00:37:53,332 --> 00:37:55,651
Let's see someone beat this!

201
00:37:59,669 --> 00:38:01,504
What are you, an animal?

202
00:38:01,996 --> 00:38:05,646
Legba, your corn, your bread,
make it rain, Legba.

203
00:38:05,766 --> 00:38:08,859
Legba, your corn, your bread,
make it rain.

204
00:38:09,149 --> 00:38:12,333
Legba, your corn, your bread,
make it rain.

205
00:38:12,453 --> 00:38:14,893
Mom, come on.
There's hardly any corn.

206
00:38:15,856 --> 00:38:17,854
It's for our old Guinean gods.

207
00:38:17,855 --> 00:38:21,918
First it's a goat and now it's corn,
which doesn't even grow now.

208
00:38:22,743 --> 00:38:24,759
Where is your water?

209
00:38:25,394 --> 00:38:27,155
I'm looking for it, Mom.

210
00:38:27,275 --> 00:38:29,267
I swear I'm looking for it.

211
00:38:31,435 --> 00:38:33,924
Legba, your corn, your bread.

212
00:38:34,044 --> 00:38:36,066
Legba, your corn, your bread.

213
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,543
- Hello, Anaisa.
- Hello, Manuel.

214
00:39:42,582 --> 00:39:46,089
- So you came.
- I did, but I didn't plan to.

215
00:39:46,209 --> 00:39:50,124
Earlier, I said I'd go to the market
and now I'm on my way back.

216
00:40:03,922 --> 00:40:05,672
- Manuel...?
- Yes?

217
00:40:06,387 --> 00:40:08,626
I'm a serious woman, okay?

218
00:40:09,132 --> 00:40:11,129
No man has ever touched me.

219
00:40:11,459 --> 00:40:14,180
I came because I knew
you'd respect me.

220
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:17,939
- You said I could help you?
- Yes, Ana. A lot.

221
00:40:18,456 --> 00:40:19,958
Come with me.

222
00:40:26,313 --> 00:40:29,573
Sit down here so your dress
doesn't get dirty.

223
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,640
Do you see the valley?

224
00:40:39,809 --> 00:40:42,307
If this continues,
everything will die.

225
00:40:42,427 --> 00:40:45,614
First the plants,
then the animals...

226
00:40:46,314 --> 00:40:48,010
...and then, perhaps us.

227
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:50,080
And what've we done about it?

228
00:40:50,585 --> 00:40:52,044
Sigh and give up.

229
00:40:52,164 --> 00:40:54,605
We've been selling it all
little by little.

230
00:40:54,667 --> 00:40:58,137
We do ceremonies for the souls,
but that's useless.

231
00:40:59,051 --> 00:41:02,556
So you... don't believe in
the old gods from Guinea?

232
00:41:02,676 --> 00:41:04,274
Not really, Ana.

233
00:41:04,394 --> 00:41:08,178
I don't think a goat's blood will
bring rain to the earth.

234
00:41:16,737 --> 00:41:18,689
What would you say, Anaisa...

235
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:22,930
...if you saw corn down there
that's as tall and full-grown as you?

236
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:34,394
What if Guinea grass covered
all but the cattle's heads?

237
00:41:34,453 --> 00:41:36,143
What would you say?

238
00:41:37,674 --> 00:41:40,182
What if water flowed
through your backyard?

239
00:41:40,302 --> 00:41:42,526
Will that ever be possible, Manuel?

240
00:41:42,646 --> 00:41:45,131
- Yes, Ana. I promise.
- Really, you?

241
00:41:45,251 --> 00:41:47,480
Yes, me... Manuel Juan José.

242
00:41:51,584 --> 00:41:55,100
- And how will you do all that?
- I won't be alone.

243
00:41:55,347 --> 00:41:58,152
Everyone will help
because it'll be a lot of work.

244
00:41:58,272 --> 00:41:59,410
Oh, Manuel!

245
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:04,160
Yesterday's friends are today's enemies.
The blood still isn't dry yet.

246
00:42:04,807 --> 00:42:06,307
I know, Ana.

247
00:42:06,507 --> 00:42:07,717
But you see,

248
00:42:07,837 --> 00:42:11,435
the greatest thing in the world
is that all men are brothers.

249
00:42:12,146 --> 00:42:13,884
You're smart, Manuel.

250
00:42:14,047 --> 00:42:16,253
I know you'll find water.

251
00:42:17,663 --> 00:42:20,526
- So you'll help me?
- I don't know what I can do.

252
00:42:20,646 --> 00:42:23,201
- I'm not as smart as you.
- Yes you are.

253
00:42:23,321 --> 00:42:26,472
To prove it, you'll answer
a question for me.

254
00:42:26,592 --> 00:42:27,989
It's a riddle.

255
00:42:28,109 --> 00:42:29,614
Come with me.

256
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,058
Do you see my home?

257
00:42:35,326 --> 00:42:38,257
Now follow that trail down to
the path on the right.

258
00:42:38,377 --> 00:42:40,097
It'll be next to that.

259
00:42:40,217 --> 00:42:42,003
It's a good spot, isn't it?

260
00:42:42,123 --> 00:42:44,941
One could build a home
with a railing...

261
00:42:45,061 --> 00:42:47,547
...two doors, two windows...

262
00:42:49,055 --> 00:42:51,055
...and plant flowers there.

263
00:42:53,045 --> 00:42:55,017
Whose home will that be?

264
00:42:56,503 --> 00:42:58,944
You haven't answered my question.

265
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:01,212
I have to go now, Manuel.

266
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:19,301
You haven't answered
my question.

267
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:26,907
Yes, Ana?

268
00:43:29,116 --> 00:43:30,626
Yes.

269
00:43:31,022 --> 00:43:33,307
But I have to go, please.

270
00:43:41,549 --> 00:43:43,055
What do you want?

271
00:43:43,104 --> 00:43:46,726
Your heart should tell you that
whenever I'm around.

272
00:43:46,979 --> 00:43:49,073
- Gervilen!
- I'm your cousin...

273
00:43:49,193 --> 00:43:51,266
...and I should be your husband.

274
00:43:51,382 --> 00:43:53,400
- Whore.
- Don't insult me!

275
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,204
I know who you were with.

276
00:43:55,274 --> 00:43:57,770
So what, we're friends
with them now?

277
00:43:57,852 --> 00:44:01,468
Aren't you my cousin,
and aren't I Dorisca's son?

278
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:04,440
Speak!
Answer me!

279
00:44:05,826 --> 00:44:09,641
Then answer me this instead:
Will you be my wife?

280
00:44:10,283 --> 00:44:12,060
You're crazy, Gervilen.

281
00:44:12,397 --> 00:44:16,112
Yeah, I'll show them how crazy I am!
Get out of here! Go!

282
00:44:30,448 --> 00:44:31,804
My goodness!

283
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:35,661
There aren't enough heads in the city
to sell all these hats.

284
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:42,843
As if what's inside them is
so important that it needs decoration.

285
00:44:43,024 --> 00:44:45,195
Less talk and more work.

286
00:44:54,866 --> 00:44:56,236
Good morning.

287
00:44:57,452 --> 00:44:58,719
How are you?

288
00:44:58,839 --> 00:45:00,346
Good morning.

289
00:45:07,485 --> 00:45:09,359
How are you, daughter?

290
00:45:12,344 --> 00:45:14,089
He finally left?

291
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:21,071
He says he can't take it anymore,
and he's leaving now.

292
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:23,951
He's leaving right now.

293
00:45:57,125 --> 00:45:58,631
What do you want?

294
00:46:00,802 --> 00:46:04,306
- Hey, step aside.
- What's a man worth if he runs?

295
00:46:04,426 --> 00:46:05,676
What do you want?

296
00:46:05,796 --> 00:46:09,788
- Haven't you seen how the soil is?
- It's in the dust I breathe.

297
00:46:10,647 --> 00:46:14,950
You think a man can farm here,
and raise a family?

298
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,330
I promise I'll get you water.

299
00:46:19,468 --> 00:46:23,590
- You? What can you do?
- I promise I'll get you water, Pierli.

300
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:25,383
Come on.

301
00:46:50,003 --> 00:46:51,662
Good morning, Manuel.

302
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:01,510
- It's high, but it's
where the pigeons fly. - Yeah, so?

303
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:05,502
They're waterbirds, and they
don't come around here anymore.

304
00:47:07,333 --> 00:47:09,761
- I know.
- Are you tired?

305
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,607
I'll find it.
I have to find it.

306
00:50:25,764 --> 00:50:28,274
- Délira.
- Yes, Bienaimé?

307
00:50:35,104 --> 00:50:37,029
You're a good woman.

308
00:50:40,187 --> 00:50:43,155
But I'm a pain in the neck.

309
00:50:43,964 --> 00:50:46,053
No you're not.

310
00:50:46,303 --> 00:50:50,047
You have your bad days,
but it's because of all this misfortune.

311
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:54,781
- I'm a pain in the neck!
- No, you have a very good heart.

312
00:50:54,901 --> 00:50:59,172
- Who would know better than me?
- You're so argumentative!

313
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:03,425
- Fine, Bienaimé.
- What's fine?

314
00:51:04,157 --> 00:51:07,180
- That you're a pain in the neck.
- Who, me?

315
00:51:07,205 --> 00:51:09,662
- And you're argumentative.
- Me?

316
00:51:09,782 --> 00:51:12,104
Wasn't that what you
wanted me to say?

317
00:51:12,125 --> 00:51:14,843
Go tell the whole world,
why don't you!

318
00:51:15,933 --> 00:51:20,516
<i>He found it! He found it!
He found it!</i>

319
00:51:21,364 --> 00:51:24,120
He found it! He found it!
He found it!

320
00:51:24,986 --> 00:51:27,904
- What the hell did he find?
- The water! Look at him!

321
00:51:28,024 --> 00:51:31,172
Your son said he'd find it,
and he did!

322
00:51:31,757 --> 00:51:34,403
- Is that true, Manuel?
- Yes, I found it.

323
00:51:34,523 --> 00:51:36,040
Son!

324
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:41,694
First, we have to
install a line of posts,

325
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:45,004
to hold the soil in place
and prevent erosion.

326
00:51:45,516 --> 00:51:49,580
Then open a channel
from the hill to the valley.

327
00:51:50,402 --> 00:51:53,786
Each person digs one little channel
to the main channel.

328
00:51:53,906 --> 00:51:57,609
It's a great task, a general <i>coumbite</i>
requiring all of Fonds Rouge.

329
00:51:57,610 --> 00:52:01,326
- Everyone? - Everyone.
- Have you forgotten about Salvador?

330
00:52:01,446 --> 00:52:03,997
A single group can't do it all, Dad.

331
00:52:04,117 --> 00:52:06,120
Besides, it's their water too.

332
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:08,848
But you found it,
and they're our enemies!

333
00:52:08,968 --> 00:52:11,908
- The water is everyone's.
- That's enough!

334
00:52:20,715 --> 00:52:22,525
So what do you think?

335
00:52:30,859 --> 00:52:32,370
Ash.

336
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:37,328
For a while now, Salvador and Dorisca
have been just that: ash.

337
00:52:38,695 --> 00:52:42,991
And yet we keep
burning ourselves in it.

338
00:52:44,932 --> 00:52:48,039
I went into deep mourning
after Salvador died.

339
00:52:48,781 --> 00:52:50,752
He was my brother-in-law.

340
00:52:52,186 --> 00:52:55,338
But in my heart,
there's no place for hatred.

341
00:52:55,699 --> 00:52:59,148
Hatred isn't caused by bloodshed.
It's caused by poverty.

342
00:52:59,268 --> 00:53:01,014
That's exactly right.

343
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:04,698
Hey, boss.
Someone found water.

344
00:53:04,818 --> 00:53:08,136
That guy who came from Cuba,
Bienaimé's son.

345
00:53:08,256 --> 00:53:09,839
That guy named Manuel.

346
00:53:09,959 --> 00:53:13,111
He brought a piece of wood
over there, in his pocket,

347
00:53:13,196 --> 00:53:15,594
a piece of wood
he brought from Cuba.

348
00:53:15,665 --> 00:53:17,112
A magic wand.

349
00:53:17,185 --> 00:53:19,785
He was over there,
but I don't know where.

350
00:53:19,844 --> 00:53:23,598
There was a pile of stones
and he touched it with his wand,

351
00:53:23,718 --> 00:53:27,562
and a hole opened up,
and the hole began to gush water.

352
00:53:27,682 --> 00:53:29,918
But only he knows where it is.

353
00:53:30,038 --> 00:53:34,150
Bienseguro was watching him,
but when he went, he couldn't find it.

354
00:55:57,807 --> 00:56:00,852
Well, we still don't know
if it's true.

355
00:56:06,189 --> 00:56:07,884
We have to be sure.

356
00:56:12,908 --> 00:56:17,235
A lie is like money lent at interest:
it has to yield something.

357
00:56:17,355 --> 00:56:21,260
What interest does Manuel have
in telling this lie? How does he profit?

358
00:56:21,285 --> 00:56:23,596
They'll be able to water their fields.

359
00:56:23,662 --> 00:56:26,770
Yes, and we'll be watching them
and won't get a drop.

360
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:28,600
Those lucky bastards!

361
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:33,189
We have to leave Fonds Rouge,
to avoid seeing them enjoy the water.

362
00:56:33,309 --> 00:56:36,088
It's not a question of
them hoarding it.

363
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:39,601
They want to share it
with us as well.

364
00:56:40,925 --> 00:56:44,000
- Manuel mentioned a general <i>coumbite</i>.
- That's a lie!

365
00:56:44,130 --> 00:56:47,360
At my age... I won't
be called a liar by anyone!

366
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:51,730
- Who said he wants a general <i>coumbite</i>?
- Anaisa came and told me.

367
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:55,600
Ha, Anaisa... she sure is
getting along well with Manuel.

368
00:56:55,730 --> 00:56:59,706
- Watch it, that's my sister!
- Then take better care of her. - Hey!

369
00:56:59,807 --> 00:57:02,439
That's enough!
You, over there.

370
00:57:06,813 --> 00:57:08,422
And you, sit there.

371
00:57:11,628 --> 00:57:15,190
You all know the situation now.
What's your decision?

372
00:57:24,881 --> 00:57:27,363
What are you afraid of?
Are you not men?

373
00:57:27,372 --> 00:57:30,518
- That's out of line!
- Shut up! - You shut up too!

374
00:57:30,638 --> 00:57:32,115
Let the others talk.

375
00:57:32,403 --> 00:57:34,560
We need to think this over.

376
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:37,192
Some men have no pride, like dogs!

377
00:57:40,865 --> 00:57:42,603
Well, there's no rush.

378
00:57:42,723 --> 00:57:45,590
We'll meet tomorrow
and we'll make a decision.

379
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:48,500
Brother Gervilen!

380
00:57:49,963 --> 00:57:52,444
Brother Gervilen,
I want to talk to you.

381
00:57:52,564 --> 00:57:54,181
Save your breath.

382
00:58:02,594 --> 00:58:03,991
Brother Gervilen!

383
00:58:04,111 --> 00:58:05,390
Brother Gervilen!

384
00:58:14,874 --> 00:58:18,909
Dad, I don't think you should go.
You won't have time to return today.

385
00:58:19,029 --> 00:58:20,336
Hyah.

386
00:58:20,525 --> 00:58:22,036
Hyah!

387
00:58:26,819 --> 00:58:28,325
Hyah.

388
00:58:29,918 --> 00:58:34,427
- Délira, I'll be back tomorrow.
- Yeah, all right!

389
00:58:36,186 --> 00:58:39,518
- You'd only be doing your duty.
- Yes, and then some.

390
00:58:39,638 --> 00:58:42,991
You could find that water
before the others do.

391
00:58:43,111 --> 00:58:47,601
Any more time without water
and we'll have them in debt forever.

392
00:58:48,155 --> 00:58:50,976
Just think, that guy is here
to ruin everything!

393
00:58:51,045 --> 00:58:54,475
That Manuel is against the law
and the government.

394
00:58:54,595 --> 00:58:56,101
Well...

395
00:58:57,451 --> 00:58:59,184
I've got no choice.

396
00:58:59,389 --> 00:59:01,421
I'll have to do something.

397
00:59:10,745 --> 00:59:13,120
We have to take the water by force.

398
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:17,390
But why take it by force
if it's for everyone?

399
00:59:17,742 --> 00:59:20,285
Save your strength
for the <i>coumbite</i>.

400
00:59:21,417 --> 00:59:24,120
- Honor, Larivoire.
- Respect, Manuel.

401
00:59:24,344 --> 00:59:27,232
- Good evening, everyone.
- Good evening.

402
00:59:27,352 --> 00:59:30,750
The rumors are true.
I've found a great water source.

403
00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:34,859
We all must come together
and unite to bring the water here.

404
00:59:34,979 --> 00:59:37,960
Blood is forever,
and blood has been spilled.

405
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,659
Blood is death.
Water is life.

406
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:43,150
Dorisca died,
and he was my father.

407
00:59:43,438 --> 00:59:47,288
- Or did you forget that?
- And Salvador died in prison.

408
00:59:47,408 --> 00:59:50,661
- Revenge has been taken.
- Not by my hand.

409
00:59:51,547 --> 00:59:52,889
Brother Gervilen...

410
00:59:53,009 --> 00:59:56,335
Don't call me <i>brother</i>.
There's nothing between us.

411
00:59:59,629 --> 01:00:01,968
- Count me in, Manuel.
- You swine!

412
01:00:02,088 --> 01:00:06,270
Hey, Gervilen! Watch your mouth,
or some day you'll regret it!

413
01:00:06,847 --> 01:00:10,245
Now I see. You've sold your souls
for a drop of water.

414
01:00:10,365 --> 01:00:13,218
For <i>clairin</i>, you'd have
sold yours too.

415
01:00:17,369 --> 01:00:21,121
Out of respect for you,
I won't say all that I think.

416
01:00:21,776 --> 01:00:24,902
You've crossed paths twice
with Gervilen Gervilí,

417
01:00:25,022 --> 01:00:27,397
and that's two times too many.

418
01:00:36,488 --> 01:00:38,480
What do you say, Larivoire?

419
01:00:38,888 --> 01:00:43,564
You've come in good faith, Manuel,
but I must give you my answer tomorrow.

420
01:00:46,278 --> 01:00:49,055
Give him a torch
so he can see the road.

421
01:01:51,149 --> 01:01:52,665
Who's there?

422
01:02:12,948 --> 01:02:14,878
Hey, who's there?

423
01:02:14,998 --> 01:02:17,352
It's your son, Mom.
Come quick!

424
01:02:17,995 --> 01:02:19,500
Manuel!

425
01:02:20,349 --> 01:02:22,138
Oh, son!

426
01:02:23,066 --> 01:02:25,506
What have they done to you, Manuel?

427
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:28,519
What have they done to you, son?

428
01:02:29,233 --> 01:02:31,753
Oh, Manuel! Manuel!

429
01:02:32,761 --> 01:02:35,442
Oh, son!
What have they done to you?

430
01:02:37,274 --> 01:02:39,211
Oh, son!

431
01:02:40,096 --> 01:02:41,960
Oh, son!

432
01:02:46,969 --> 01:02:50,179
Oh, tell me what they've
done to you, Manuel!

433
01:02:56,346 --> 01:02:59,902
Tell me who did it, son.
Tell me!

434
01:03:03,246 --> 01:03:05,321
Oh, son!

435
01:03:08,677 --> 01:03:10,684
Oh, Manuel!

436
01:03:12,244 --> 01:03:15,135
Tell me who it was
so I can tell Hilarión.

437
01:03:15,255 --> 01:03:18,248
- Tell me.
- No, don't tell him.

438
01:03:18,768 --> 01:03:21,546
Oh, God!
But they've hurt you!

439
01:03:22,236 --> 01:03:24,595
They've killed you, Manuel!

440
01:03:24,715 --> 01:03:27,660
If you tell him,
everything will be lost.

441
01:03:28,101 --> 01:03:30,620
There must be no more revenge.

442
01:03:31,864 --> 01:03:33,309
Okay, son. Okay.

443
01:03:49,498 --> 01:03:51,008
Son.

444
01:03:58,748 --> 01:04:00,853
Easy, son. Drink slowly.

445
01:04:05,393 --> 01:04:08,808
- Mom. - Yes.
- Do you hear me? - Yes, son.

446
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:10,942
We must save the water.

447
01:04:12,149 --> 01:04:13,876
It's okay, don't worry.

448
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:17,190
- Ask Anaisa about it.
- Anaisa?

449
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:21,419
Yes, she's the one who
knows the way.

450
01:04:26,241 --> 01:04:28,277
Don't worry, son.

451
01:04:30,229 --> 01:04:31,395
Good morning.

452
01:04:32,512 --> 01:04:33,960
What, is he sick?

453
01:04:34,868 --> 01:04:37,304
Yes, he brought back a bad fever.

454
01:04:37,768 --> 01:04:39,103
What a setback.

455
01:04:39,223 --> 01:04:42,306
- The lieutenant is asking for him.
- Well, look at him.

456
01:04:42,624 --> 01:04:46,627
- When he gets up, tell him
to come by the barracks. - I will.

457
01:05:03,603 --> 01:05:06,212
Do you want me
to help you dress him?

458
01:05:11,615 --> 01:05:13,497
Thank you, but I'll wait.

459
01:05:13,921 --> 01:05:17,249
- Are you waiting for someone?
- I'm just waiting.

460
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:41,028
Come in.

461
01:06:01,436 --> 01:06:05,511
- What have they done to you, Manuel?
- Keep your voice down.

462
01:06:11,006 --> 01:06:14,331
It was his last wish that you
not say anything.

463
01:06:15,976 --> 01:06:17,360
Come with me.

464
01:13:17,899 --> 01:13:19,400
Respect, neighbor.

465
01:13:30,233 --> 01:13:31,840
Gervilen is gone.

466
01:13:32,908 --> 01:13:34,712
Yes, I knew.

467
01:13:34,832 --> 01:13:37,553
But nobody else
must find out about it.

468
01:13:40,168 --> 01:13:43,197
I would've liked it
if Gervilen were here,

469
01:13:43,778 --> 01:13:46,684
so I could repeat
my son's words to him.

470
01:13:49,845 --> 01:13:51,352
He said...

471
01:13:52,518 --> 01:13:55,781
...that we made sacrifices
to the <i>loas</i>...

472
01:13:56,961 --> 01:14:00,290
...that we offered
the blood of our goats...

473
01:14:01,222 --> 01:14:04,941
...and the little corn we have,
to make water come.

474
01:14:06,204 --> 01:14:08,640
But it was all in vain because...

475
01:14:08,923 --> 01:14:11,898
...what really counts is
human sacrifice.

476
01:14:15,052 --> 01:14:18,168
He also asked that,
after his death...

477
01:14:19,129 --> 01:14:21,541
...there be a general <i>coumbite</i>.

478
01:14:23,352 --> 01:14:25,026
In other words...

479
01:14:26,471 --> 01:14:28,913
...a <i>coumbite</i> involving everyone.
