1
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:11,441
Viviana I have to run away.

2
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:13,721
When Franco arrives I'll call you.

3
00:06:15,161 --> 00:06:18,721
- But a kick in the ass!
- Ernesto it's enough!

4
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:21,841
I have to do something important,

5
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,841
can I leave Sharon
here for an hour?

6
00:06:23,881 --> 00:06:27,281
No, Cosimo.
Take her to the taxi stand.

7
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:29,161
All right, thank you.

8
00:06:30,481 --> 00:06:33,601
It's about Anna, Franco's daughter.
Answer.

9
00:06:39,281 --> 00:06:42,441
Ernesto!
You're a pain in the ass with that gun!

10
00:06:42,481 --> 00:06:43,641
Come here, my love.

11
00:06:44,481 --> 00:06:47,801
Go to the window and see if Franco comes.

12
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:50,401
Go.

13
00:06:50,441 --> 00:06:53,081
- Hello, Anna.
- Anna, darling.

14
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,641
Hi Vivi, has the
present for dad arrived?

15
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:58,361
Yes, here it is, look.

16
00:06:58,401 --> 00:07:01,241
Perfect!
Tell him it's from mom too.

17
00:07:01,281 --> 00:07:02,881
Sure, he'll be happy.

18
00:07:02,921 --> 00:07:04,961
I can't wait
to see him in this suit.

19
00:07:05,001 --> 00:07:07,641
How are you, are
you in love with someone?

20
00:07:07,681 --> 00:07:11,441
I don't have time,
I have to study like crazy.

21
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:13,441
But she's
daddy's girl, if she finds

22
00:07:13,481 --> 00:07:15,921
a boyfriend, he'll
have a heart attack.

23
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:19,761
He's been rehearsing
his parting speech for a month now.

24
00:07:19,801 --> 00:07:22,081
"Once upon a time
there was a good policeman, who in

25
00:07:22,121 --> 00:07:25,721
35 years of service he never..."
How is it that he says he?

26
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:28,241
“… shot a
Christian in his lifetime.”

27
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,721
Even Anna knows it.

28
00:07:30,361 --> 00:07:33,721
My dad is really Franco
Amore, in name and in fact.

29
00:07:33,761 --> 00:07:35,081
Here he is, he's coming.

30
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,921
Gabriele, turn off the lamp back there.

31
00:07:37,961 --> 00:07:41,321
We all have to hide.
You get under the table.

32
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:44,641
Don't mess everything up.
Doctor Loria, be careful with your glass.

33
00:07:44,681 --> 00:07:47,041
Fulvio take it here.

34
00:07:47,081 --> 00:07:49,921
- Ernesto?
- Where will I hide?

35
00:07:49,961 --> 00:07:50,961
You...

36
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:54,681
Come here, sit on the armchair...

37
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:57,601
and you hide with your jacket.

38
00:07:58,961 --> 00:08:01,201
Watch out for the bottle.

39
00:08:01,241 --> 00:08:03,681
Ok. Very good.

40
00:08:03,721 --> 00:08:06,321
Wonderful, I will hang it here.

41
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:10,441
You have to stick to
the wall like wallpaper.

42
00:08:10,481 --> 00:08:11,761
Perfect.

43
00:08:21,721 --> 00:08:22,761
My love.

44
00:08:23,641 --> 00:08:25,041
Surprise!

45
00:08:28,081 --> 00:08:29,561
What do you look like?

46
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:33,601
- I had a stroke.
- Poor pensioner.

47
00:08:33,641 --> 00:08:35,441
- Hello.
- Hello.

48
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,321
What a surprise.

49
00:08:37,361 --> 00:08:41,441
I went for a jog.
He how are you?

50
00:08:41,481 --> 00:08:42,481
Well.

51
00:08:43,521 --> 00:08:47,281
Starting tomorrow
you can plan the marathon.

52
00:08:47,321 --> 00:08:49,561
Look over there, how are you?

53
00:08:49,601 --> 00:08:52,201
- Hello.
- Look who's there.

54
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:54,641
Here I am! I'm here too!

55
00:08:54,681 --> 00:08:59,161
What are you doing here?
Don't you have to study for exams?

56
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:04,281
I wouldn't have missed
your party for the world.

57
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,841
I'm sorry I'm not there.

58
00:09:06,881 --> 00:09:10,641
Look at your daughter and your
ex what a sweetie they sent you.

59
00:09:10,681 --> 00:09:14,321
- How beautiful!
- For tonight and for tomorrow's photos.

60
00:09:14,361 --> 00:09:16,161
Yes, for the speech.

61
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:20,401
I'm told you're preparing a
beautiful retirement speech.

62
00:09:20,441 --> 00:09:21,841
You need to pinch them.

63
00:09:22,961 --> 00:09:25,681
No, the speech is beautiful.

64
00:09:25,721 --> 00:09:28,041
Try on the jacket, I want
to see how it fits on you.

65
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:30,601
Let's try it. Sarah, can you hold this?

66
00:09:33,201 --> 00:09:36,281
One and two.

67
00:09:36,321 --> 00:09:38,841
Here you go, what do you say?

68
00:09:38,881 --> 00:09:41,121
From behind it is perfect!

69
00:09:41,161 --> 00:09:44,121
- Really.
- Yes, it's perfect!

70
00:09:44,161 --> 00:09:45,161
Love.

71
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:49,921
- He's getting emotional!
- Drink!

72
00:09:49,961 --> 00:09:52,241
- Sorry...
- A toast!

73
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:55,081
Excuse me.

74
00:09:55,121 --> 00:09:58,521
Surely it's Sarno, he's
already called a couple of times.

75
00:09:58,561 --> 00:10:01,761
In fact it's him, he'll want to wish you a happy birthday.

76
00:10:02,761 --> 00:10:04,321
Doctor, good evening.

77
00:10:06,201 --> 00:10:07,201
Yes.

78
00:10:09,961 --> 00:10:10,961
All right.

79
00:10:12,681 --> 00:10:13,681
All right.

80
00:10:17,681 --> 00:10:21,361
- I have to go, excuse me.
- Now?

81
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:22,841
Tonight too?

82
00:10:22,881 --> 00:10:26,161
You retire tomorrow,
can't someone else go?

83
00:10:28,481 --> 00:10:30,241
I'm sorry my love.

84
00:10:30,281 --> 00:10:33,521
It was Sarno, the usual trouble.

85
00:10:33,561 --> 00:10:36,921
- At this time?
- I'll call you if I need to.

86
00:10:36,961 --> 00:10:38,961
You stay.

87
00:10:39,001 --> 00:10:41,361
Of course, you come and go.

88
00:10:41,401 --> 00:10:43,041
- We'll wait for you here.
- Yes.

89
00:10:43,081 --> 00:10:47,241
- Excuse me.
- We keep the party warm.

90
00:10:47,281 --> 00:10:49,441
Take the sparkling wine, come on!

91
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:13,121
Hi, I'm a colleague.

92
00:11:16,681 --> 00:11:18,281
Let him through.

93
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,041
Thank you.

94
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:15,801
What was Dino doing here?

95
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,394
Do you know something?

96
00:12:19,681 --> 00:12:21,081
I don't know shit, Doc.'

97
00:12:23,881 --> 00:12:25,321
Three bullets to the chest.

98
00:12:26,281 --> 00:12:28,081
One severed the aorta.

99
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:29,961
It was...

100
00:12:30,761 --> 00:12:32,001
a quick death.

101
00:13:06,081 --> 00:13:07,081
Stop!

102
00:13:21,121 --> 00:13:23,761
[TEN DAYS EARLIER]
"The first time I wore a 'uniform".

103
00:13:23,801 --> 00:13:25,401
I was 20.

104
00:13:30,681 --> 00:13:32,561
And today, after 35 years,

105
00:13:32,601 --> 00:13:35,201
I can guarantee that I am even more proud...

106
00:13:38,281 --> 00:13:40,201
even more proud...

107
00:13:41,961 --> 00:13:43,281
more and more.

108
00:13:44,081 --> 00:13:45,081
Always...

109
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,081
prouder of my choice..."

110
00:13:55,081 --> 00:13:57,361
"...of my choice made."

111
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:03,841
Move on!

112
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,761
"More and more proud...

113
00:14:11,761 --> 00:14:12,961
of my choice...

114
00:14:14,001 --> 00:14:15,321
done."

115
00:14:18,961 --> 00:14:21,681
And voilà, paradise.

116
00:14:24,361 --> 00:14:26,961
What you are holding is not

117
00:14:27,001 --> 00:14:28,841
a watch, you are holding time.

118
00:14:28,881 --> 00:14:30,321
Let's be clear.

119
00:14:30,361 --> 00:14:33,601
When you train at Milan, maybe
Ibra doesn't even look at you.

120
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,234
But if he's in the locker room he
sees what you have on her wrist,

121
00:14:38,361 --> 00:14:41,121
then see how he works
hard to make you score!

122
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:44,121
And then it costs shit!

123
00:14:45,281 --> 00:14:47,801
Bro, do you want to take a selfie with Abdu?

124
00:14:47,841 --> 00:14:51,041
- No thank you.  I support Inter.
- Shit, Inter.

125
00:14:51,081 --> 00:14:53,641
Everyone has his cross.

126
00:14:53,681 --> 00:14:55,441
Cosimo, sell ​​a 50,000 euro watch

127
00:14:55,481 --> 00:14:57,641
and drive around in a shit car?

128
00:14:57,681 --> 00:15:00,721
It's a service car.
And a real cop.

129
00:15:00,761 --> 00:15:04,321
He acts as my chauffeur when I
need him and I give him 50 euros.

130
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,361
Be a good boy.

131
00:15:06,801 --> 00:15:07,801
Lady.

132
00:15:08,881 --> 00:15:09,881
Franco.

133
00:15:11,081 --> 00:15:13,001
Have a couple of hours of extra time?

134
00:15:14,601 --> 00:15:17,761
Abdu, at the next goal you tap your

135
00:15:17,801 --> 00:15:20,121
wrist and do Cosimo's C for the camera.

136
00:15:20,161 --> 00:15:22,201
- Promised.
- Be good, understand?

137
00:15:23,361 --> 00:15:24,801
Fuck Abdu!

138
00:15:28,281 --> 00:15:30,881
These fucking Chinese,
someone has to explain it to me.

139
00:15:30,921 --> 00:15:32,441
It would take Piero Angela.

140
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:35,921
What's it about having no hair?

141
00:15:38,481 --> 00:15:40,161
"The new generations...

142
00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:43,641
The younger generations..."

143
00:15:43,681 --> 00:15:45,521
Well, it's the same.

144
00:15:46,961 --> 00:15:51,281
"...they should look at the photos
of our heroes at the police station,

145
00:15:52,081 --> 00:15:54,801
and be inspired by those heroic looks".

146
00:15:56,681 --> 00:15:59,081
"Be inspired by the looks..."

147
00:16:01,681 --> 00:16:02,761
Heroic!

148
00:16:04,081 --> 00:16:05,521
"...to heroic looks..."

149
00:16:12,481 --> 00:16:13,481
Yes?

150
00:16:29,561 --> 00:16:31,041
What the fuck happened?

151
00:16:33,281 --> 00:16:35,361
Help me or we are ruined!

152
00:16:35,401 --> 00:16:37,481
The Chinese boss is dying.

153
00:16:39,761 --> 00:16:42,241
- Did you call the ambulance?
- You called it!

154
00:16:42,281 --> 00:16:43,601
Go down and make the call.

155
00:16:43,641 --> 00:16:46,761
Get the driver, because if he
dies I want a Chinese witness.

156
00:16:46,801 --> 00:16:47,841
Go!

157
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,921
Stronger. These are caresses.

158
00:16:49,961 --> 00:16:52,401
Where the fuck am I going dressed like this?

159
00:16:56,681 --> 00:16:57,681
Hey!

160
00:16:59,161 --> 00:17:00,241
What do you want?

161
00:17:00,281 --> 00:17:02,161
Leave it alone, it doesn't suit you.

162
00:17:02,201 --> 00:17:03,641
These people hurt you.

163
00:17:04,401 --> 00:17:06,081
Thank you.  I'll do it.

164
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,371
Get dressed in the elevator.

165
00:17:36,201 --> 00:17:37,521
Come on, Franco.

166
00:17:37,561 --> 00:17:38,561
I'm in.

167
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:43,641
Can you give me a hand?

168
00:17:43,681 --> 00:17:46,201
Can you press 29?

169
00:17:46,881 --> 00:17:47,921
The last one?

170
00:17:47,961 --> 00:17:50,121
If you don't look down, nothing happens.

171
00:17:51,401 --> 00:17:52,721
Don't worry.

172
00:17:53,761 --> 00:17:55,241
"Don't look down."

173
00:17:55,281 --> 00:17:56,801
I look down.

174
00:17:56,841 --> 00:17:59,001
Finally I can look
at Milan from above.

175
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,761
So it's a whim.

176
00:18:02,801 --> 00:18:04,161
How am I, Franco?

177
00:18:04,201 --> 00:18:05,641
You are an angel.

178
00:18:05,681 --> 00:18:07,601
You always answer me like this.

179
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:11,161
Can't you see that I'm all sweaty because of you?

180
00:18:11,201 --> 00:18:13,041
You made me run.

181
00:18:13,081 --> 00:18:14,641
My feet already hurt.

182
00:18:16,201 --> 00:18:18,481
I like it when you sweat because of me.

183
00:18:20,681 --> 00:18:22,441
Franco!

184
00:18:22,481 --> 00:18:24,121
I'm serious.

185
00:18:24,161 --> 00:18:25,361
How am I?

186
00:18:25,401 --> 00:18:26,561
In my opinion?

187
00:18:26,601 --> 00:18:28,841
No, according to the parish priest of San Demente.

188
00:18:28,881 --> 00:18:30,361
I don't know what he thinks, but to

189
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,721
me you are an angel come down to earth.

190
00:18:32,761 --> 00:18:33,961
All right.

191
00:18:34,001 --> 00:18:36,241
Even the parish priest, if he saw you, would say:

192
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,281
"A miracle!

193
00:18:38,001 --> 00:18:40,441
Angels exist."

194
00:18:40,481 --> 00:18:42,561
- You're a lunatic.
- No!

195
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:45,881
- Watch out!  You make my jacket dirty.
- Excuse me.

196
00:18:54,081 --> 00:18:55,961
- What's up?
- You are pretty.

197
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:57,001
Yes?

198
00:18:57,601 --> 00:18:59,041
Much.

199
00:18:59,081 --> 00:19:00,081
All right.

200
00:19:01,681 --> 00:19:03,361
May we?

201
00:19:03,401 --> 00:19:04,921
Bro, what the fuck.

202
00:19:04,961 --> 00:19:08,641
Do not say anything.
We parked away.

203
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:10,681
No parking suited him.

204
00:19:10,721 --> 00:19:13,321
Why do I have to take the fines?
It annoys me.

205
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:15,081
It annoys you to have them removed.

206
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:17,241
We have to remove this.

207
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,481
Never been arrested for
bribing a public official.

208
00:19:21,121 --> 00:19:22,121
What did you bring?

209
00:19:22,881 --> 00:19:25,361
- Parmigiana.
- You are a genius.

210
00:19:26,241 --> 00:19:27,321
Excuse me.

211
00:19:33,001 --> 00:19:36,241
In my opinion, he doesn't like the provolone.

212
00:19:36,281 --> 00:19:38,601
- What do you mean?
- What did he say?

213
00:19:38,641 --> 00:19:40,241
"You don't like it."

214
00:19:40,281 --> 00:19:41,961
He talks like a chef.

215
00:19:42,001 --> 00:19:44,961
Hello, could he tell Zhang
Zhu that we are here?

216
00:19:45,001 --> 00:19:46,641
Yes, my dad is waiting for you.

217
00:19:46,681 --> 00:19:49,321
- May I?
- No thank you.  I prefer to keep it.

218
00:19:49,361 --> 00:19:51,161
Okay.  I'll tell him you arrived.

219
00:19:51,201 --> 00:19:53,641
I've been frying all morning.

220
00:19:56,681 --> 00:19:59,521
- Cosimo, do you speak Chinese?
- Huh?

221
00:19:59,561 --> 00:20:01,681
- No, I don't know.
- Excuse me.

222
00:20:02,281 --> 00:20:07,041
Zhang Zhu, is a form of respect.
They like it.

223
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,721
Zhang Zhu.

224
00:20:11,281 --> 00:20:12,561
It's ready.  Welcome.

225
00:20:12,601 --> 00:20:13,601
Please.

226
00:20:15,801 --> 00:20:17,601
- Mr. Zhu.
- Allow me.

227
00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:20,561
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

228
00:20:20,601 --> 00:20:22,001
Za Zu Zhang.

229
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,961
Pleasure.
I'm Viviana, Franco's wife.

230
00:20:25,001 --> 00:20:27,881
- Pleasure.
- I made you a parmigiana

231
00:20:27,921 --> 00:20:31,721
to give you some energy in
this complicated juncture of life.

232
00:20:31,761 --> 00:20:33,001
Very kind of you, thanks.

233
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:35,241
Keep it upright as the oil could leak.

234
00:20:35,281 --> 00:20:36,441
Thank you.

235
00:20:36,481 --> 00:20:38,841
It's pretty spicy.

236
00:20:38,881 --> 00:20:39,961
It's good for the heart.

237
00:20:40,001 --> 00:20:43,561
- I like it spicy.
- In Calabria we do it like this.

238
00:20:43,601 --> 00:20:45,641
I figured you liked it too.

239
00:20:45,681 --> 00:20:47,561
It's good for the heart.

240
00:20:47,601 --> 00:20:48,961
' Viviana? - Yes.

241
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:52,681
The wife of the hero
who saved my life.

242
00:20:52,721 --> 00:20:55,681
- Yes.
- I have a nice present too.

243
00:20:56,801 --> 00:20:58,361
You didn't have to.

244
00:20:58,401 --> 00:21:00,641
This is carp fish.

245
00:21:00,681 --> 00:21:03,321
- Beautiful.
- He lives in the Yellow River.

246
00:21:03,361 --> 00:21:07,641
According to legend, every year thousands

247
00:21:07,681 --> 00:21:11,241
of carp fish swim upriver to spawn.

248
00:21:11,281 --> 00:21:14,361
But there is a waterfall,
the Dragon Waterfall,

249
00:21:14,401 --> 00:21:17,961
which is very high,
so they can't climb it.

250
00:21:18,001 --> 00:21:22,921
But there is always a better one who

251
00:21:22,961 --> 00:21:24,841
manages to climb and becomes a dragon.

252
00:21:24,881 --> 00:21:27,081
So, in China, for us,

253
00:21:27,681 --> 00:21:31,721
carp fish is the
symbol of good luck.

254
00:21:31,761 --> 00:21:33,441
Like your husband.

255
00:21:33,481 --> 00:21:35,361
For me it is a carp fish.

256
00:21:35,401 --> 00:21:36,561
- He?
- Yes.

257
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,668
I too always say that he is a fish,
because he always bites everything.

258
00:21:41,761 --> 00:21:42,961
It's good.

259
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:45,041
Anyway, all kidding aside,

260
00:21:45,081 --> 00:21:48,441
Franco is a solid man, Zhu Za Zhang.

261
00:21:48,481 --> 00:21:49,481
Such a cool guy.

262
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:52,081
Indeed.

263
00:21:52,121 --> 00:21:54,161
I fell in love with him

264
00:21:54,201 --> 00:21:56,121
from the first moment.

265
00:21:56,161 --> 00:21:57,281
This big fish!

266
00:21:57,321 --> 00:21:58,441
I understand you.

267
00:21:58,481 --> 00:22:02,241
I was 20 years old, I was very young.
I had just arrived in Milan.

268
00:22:02,281 --> 00:22:04,161
It was love at first sight.

269
00:22:09,881 --> 00:22:12,561
Zhang Zhu wants me
to introduce the family.

270
00:22:12,601 --> 00:22:14,121
Follow me?

271
00:22:14,161 --> 00:22:15,761
- Go.
- I'll be right there.

272
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:18,041
Are you with Olivia?
Anything, ask me.

273
00:22:18,081 --> 00:22:19,841
- Thanks again.
- Please.

274
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:21,761
- Allow me.
- Please.

275
00:22:21,801 --> 00:22:23,321
I finish here and come.

276
00:22:30,241 --> 00:22:32,081
Thank you for coming.

277
00:22:32,121 --> 00:22:34,121
Thank you for the invite.

278
00:22:35,961 --> 00:22:37,361
How are you, Mr. Zhang?

279
00:22:38,081 --> 00:22:41,361
I take all these
medicines, I need to rest

280
00:22:42,401 --> 00:22:44,001
and reflect a bit

281
00:22:44,881 --> 00:22:47,481
about what has been and what will be.

282
00:22:47,521 --> 00:22:49,041
Right.

283
00:22:50,481 --> 00:22:54,601
I heard that
you will retire soon, right?

284
00:22:57,081 --> 00:23:00,201
I too have to reflect on what
has been and what will be.

285
00:23:01,081 --> 00:23:02,881
- Well, well.
- Yes.

286
00:23:03,761 --> 00:23:06,081
When the day comes,

287
00:23:07,081 --> 00:23:09,641
I would like you to come and work for me.

288
00:23:10,881 --> 00:23:12,961
It would be a great honor.

289
00:23:16,761 --> 00:23:17,841
Please.

290
00:23:17,881 --> 00:23:21,121
Mr. Zhang would
like to give you the

291
00:23:21,161 --> 00:23:23,881
opportunity to set up
a security service for us.

292
00:23:25,161 --> 00:23:27,721
Very similar to the one he offers

293
00:23:27,761 --> 00:23:29,641
to Cosimo, but on a larger scale.

294
00:23:29,681 --> 00:23:31,841
You are always so modest.

295
00:23:32,761 --> 00:23:34,321
Franco, that's great.

296
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:36,881
Very big.

297
00:23:40,481 --> 00:23:43,561
Your generosity knows no bounds, Mr. Zhang.

298
00:23:49,081 --> 00:23:51,921
My son-in-law will be running the

299
00:23:51,961 --> 00:23:54,361
business while I'm still recovering.

300
00:23:54,401 --> 00:23:56,841
- Pleasure, and bon appétit.
- Thank you.

301
00:23:56,881 --> 00:24:00,441
I hope you enjoy the
parmigiana I brought you.

302
00:24:09,761 --> 00:24:11,561
Look, it's your suit.

303
00:24:11,601 --> 00:24:13,241
It's fine with you.

304
00:24:15,281 --> 00:24:18,441
I have been in service for 35 years.

305
00:24:18,481 --> 00:24:21,681
There are some rules that I would like to apply.

306
00:24:22,401 --> 00:24:25,641
The same rules I use with Cosimo.

307
00:24:25,681 --> 00:24:26,761
Tell me.

308
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,325
I do not transport

309
00:24:28,348 --> 00:24:31,520
people with a criminal record, armed people,

310
00:24:31,561 --> 00:24:34,961
and I don't do security with
stolen goods and narcotics.

311
00:24:35,001 --> 00:24:36,001
That's all.

312
00:24:37,401 --> 00:24:41,401
Our company has been operating
legally for 20 years in this country.

313
00:24:42,761 --> 00:24:45,161
- Did you take us for criminals?
- No, no

314
00:24:45,201 --> 00:24:47,961
Excuse me, I didn't mean to offend you.
It was to be clear.

315
00:24:48,001 --> 00:24:49,641
In all honesty...

316
00:24:49,681 --> 00:24:52,681
We Chinese are very
good at generating cash,

317
00:24:54,281 --> 00:24:57,361
a bad financial guard makes
life very difficult for us.

318
00:24:58,081 --> 00:25:01,041
For this, we decided to
explore the world of Cosimo.

319
00:25:01,081 --> 00:25:04,241
Because so much cash
can become a small stone.

320
00:25:05,401 --> 00:25:08,361
So, it's me asking you
not to do anything illegal,

321
00:25:08,401 --> 00:25:10,801
- that could get us in trouble.
- We agree.

322
00:25:11,881 --> 00:25:13,241
Very good.

323
00:25:13,281 --> 00:25:15,601
The first shipment will arrive next week.

324
00:25:16,881 --> 00:25:20,081
Mr. Amore will need reliable help.

325
00:25:21,201 --> 00:25:23,961
Franco can bring a colleague, right?

326
00:25:24,001 --> 00:25:25,881
Next week?

327
00:25:26,521 --> 00:25:27,721
Wednesday or Thursday.

328
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:33,361
I thought Mr. Zhang needed

329
00:25:33,401 --> 00:25:35,921
my services after retirement.

330
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:40,241
Mr. Zhang also said
that I now run the business.

331
00:25:40,281 --> 00:25:42,561
So the first shipment
arrives next week.

332
00:25:42,601 --> 00:25:46,361
Two batches for 5,000 euros
in cash could be fine, right?

333
00:25:47,281 --> 00:25:48,721
Yes, they could.

334
00:25:48,761 --> 00:25:49,761
It's just that...

335
00:25:52,281 --> 00:25:54,241
I want to think about it for a moment.

336
00:25:54,281 --> 00:25:57,161
Here, at the slightest bullshit
they take away your pension.

337
00:25:57,201 --> 00:25:58,961
I'm getting there, I'm almost there.

338
00:26:00,681 --> 00:26:03,441
The only shit he could
do before retirement

339
00:26:03,481 --> 00:26:05,481
would be to say no to this contract,

340
00:26:05,521 --> 00:26:07,681
not to take an hour's drive.

341
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:12,001
Good day, gentlemen.
Enjoy the party.

342
00:26:20,481 --> 00:26:22,161
Five thousand euros for one day.

343
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:25,281
You earn them in three months.

344
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,881
And be sophisticated too, Franco.

345
00:26:29,201 --> 00:26:30,481
What the fuck!

346
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:35,161
How many years have I
seen you return home dissatisfied?

347
00:26:35,201 --> 00:26:38,641
Whiny, long-snouted like Calimero?

348
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:40,041
Huh?

349
00:26:40,081 --> 00:26:42,281
Franco, we've waited forever.

350
00:26:42,321 --> 00:26:44,361
You've always remained assistant chief.

351
00:26:44,401 --> 00:26:47,841
Here is your revenge against
all those who wished you badly.

352
00:26:49,481 --> 00:26:51,121
Franco, are you listening to me?

353
00:26:52,401 --> 00:26:53,401
Yes.

354
00:26:54,081 --> 00:26:55,641
Sorry, love, but when

355
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:57,841
do you find an employer

356
00:26:57,881 --> 00:26:59,881
who calls you like Zhang called you?

357
00:27:00,921 --> 00:27:01,921
"My hero."

358
00:27:03,561 --> 00:27:05,841
"My fish brings good luck."  Come on!

359
00:27:08,201 --> 00:27:10,361
There is no better champagne than this.

360
00:27:11,201 --> 00:27:13,961
Let's make a toast that
now Tito is coming too.

361
00:27:14,001 --> 00:27:17,001
- Is Tito there? Where is he?
- He's here. He's coming.

362
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:21,121
Can we make a toast with Tito?

363
00:27:22,481 --> 00:27:24,081
What should we toast to?

364
00:27:25,681 --> 00:27:27,361
To the Chinese, Franco.

365
00:27:27,401 --> 00:27:29,561
We hit the super jackpot.

366
00:27:29,601 --> 00:27:30,601
What the fuck!

367
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:33,121
Leave him alone.

368
00:27:33,161 --> 00:27:34,161
He's stubborn.

369
00:27:35,161 --> 00:27:37,881
Is the job he offered him dangerous?

370
00:27:37,921 --> 00:27:40,761
- Dangerous?  For Franco?
- I'm asking.

371
00:27:40,801 --> 00:27:43,281
He is more pacifist than Gandhi.

372
00:27:44,601 --> 00:27:47,721
He saved Zhang's life.

373
00:27:47,761 --> 00:27:49,241
And he told me:

374
00:27:49,281 --> 00:27:51,361
"How can I thank Franco?"

375
00:27:51,401 --> 00:27:53,681
He was thinking of 600 euros.

376
00:27:54,481 --> 00:27:58,481
I told him, "No, with that's he
will feel  offended. He's a solid man.

377
00:27:58,521 --> 00:28:01,961
Since you have this
gemstone business

378
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,508
from Africa, hire
Franco for security.

379
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:07,401
After 35 years of service,
he sees things we don't...

380
00:28:08,081 --> 00:28:09,441
Understood?

381
00:28:09,481 --> 00:28:11,641
And I told him you're retiring.

382
00:28:12,561 --> 00:28:15,561
I won't be retired yet next week.

383
00:28:15,601 --> 00:28:16,841
- Í know.!'

384
00:28:16,881 --> 00:28:17,881
I know.

385
00:28:21,761 --> 00:28:23,241
And that's the problem?

386
00:28:23,281 --> 00:28:26,041
Cosimo, if I walk around with
you and they stop me, I can

387
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:29,641
tell you're my wife's cousin
and I'm giving you a lift.

388
00:28:29,681 --> 00:28:33,081
If they stop me with the Chinese,
what do I tell them?

389
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:37,481
You are right.

390
00:28:41,361 --> 00:28:42,881
Sorry bro'.

391
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:47,201
In your 35-year honorable career,

392
00:28:47,241 --> 00:28:49,561
in which you've never shot anyone,

393
00:28:49,601 --> 00:28:52,161
when was the last time they stopped you?

394
00:28:52,761 --> 00:28:54,481
When?

395
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,377
Do they have to stop you
now doing this thing for Zhang?

396
00:28:59,561 --> 00:29:00,881
Come on.

397
00:29:00,921 --> 00:29:03,841
Franco, I'm sorry, but he's right.

398
00:29:03,881 --> 00:29:05,561
This is a negative thought.

399
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,841
So what?

400
00:29:07,881 --> 00:29:08,961
Hey.

401
00:29:09,001 --> 00:29:12,161
- Beautiful cousin, how are you?
- Good.

402
00:29:13,201 --> 00:29:15,641
- You look good.
- Stop it!

403
00:29:15,681 --> 00:29:17,361
Before the little one came,

404
00:29:17,401 --> 00:29:21,121
Giorgina cooked as if it were
always the feast of San Rocco.

405
00:29:22,001 --> 00:29:23,281
Now that we're married,

406
00:29:23,881 --> 00:29:25,361
she became vegan.

407
00:29:25,401 --> 00:29:28,241
Tito, she keeps you in shape.

408
00:29:28,281 --> 00:29:30,041
How are you and the baby?

409
00:29:30,081 --> 00:29:34,241
They are fine.
Come and visit us every now and then.

410
00:29:34,281 --> 00:29:37,521
So you also see Cataldo, who
is becoming a handsome boy.

411
00:29:38,281 --> 00:29:40,761
Yes, I would like that too.

412
00:29:40,801 --> 00:29:42,601
Good. Let's make a toast.

413
00:29:43,881 --> 00:29:45,081
Commissioner.

414
00:29:45,761 --> 00:29:48,761
Milan would be safer with
a commissioner like you.

415
00:29:51,281 --> 00:29:52,561
So?

416
00:29:52,601 --> 00:29:54,841
What are we toasting to, Bruce Lee?

417
00:29:55,481 --> 00:29:58,761
'The fucking Chinese bought everything.

418
00:29:58,801 --> 00:30:01,201
What should we call you, Genghis Cazz?

419
00:30:02,361 --> 00:30:04,601
I'll go get some air.  Excuse me.

420
00:30:05,201 --> 00:30:06,481
- Please.
- Please.

421
00:30:13,481 --> 00:30:15,281
But why are you always teasing him?

422
00:30:16,201 --> 00:30:18,041
I only compliment him.

423
00:30:18,081 --> 00:30:20,041
- No.
- I respect that.

424
00:30:20,081 --> 00:30:22,241
He's the one who never greets me.

425
00:30:22,281 --> 00:30:23,281
Vivian...

426
00:30:24,401 --> 00:30:25,921
It's a bit psycho-rigid.

427
00:30:26,561 --> 00:30:30,761
No offense.
He is a lovable man, but psycho-rigid.

428
00:30:30,801 --> 00:30:33,161
It's character.

429
00:30:33,201 --> 00:30:35,961
No. Franco only respects the rules.

430
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:37,081
All right?

431
00:30:37,121 --> 00:30:39,201
I had to beg him to come here.

432
00:30:39,241 --> 00:30:41,441
So, don't start with this puppet.

433
00:30:41,481 --> 00:30:43,881
Why?  We are good people.

434
00:30:43,921 --> 00:30:45,321
So!

435
00:30:45,361 --> 00:30:47,561
If a judge enters here,
he closes the doors

436
00:30:47,601 --> 00:30:51,401
and puts you and  your comrades on trial

437
00:31:02,761 --> 00:31:04,961
One, two and three.

438
00:31:05,801 --> 00:31:07,841
This is a partnership.

439
00:31:07,881 --> 00:31:10,681
- We have to spread out.
- Scatter you two!

440
00:31:38,081 --> 00:31:39,881
Why don't you give it to Ernesto?

441
00:31:41,161 --> 00:31:42,161
Truly?

442
00:31:43,681 --> 00:31:45,561
Don't you want to bring it?

443
00:31:45,601 --> 00:31:48,681
The helmet came off, it needs to be glued.

444
00:31:48,721 --> 00:31:52,001
- He'll be delighted. He loves guns.
- Amore?

445
00:31:52,961 --> 00:31:55,761
I'm ruining you this morning.
For me cappuccino and brioche.

446
00:31:55,801 --> 00:31:58,241
- Stay on a diet!
- He made me run tonight.

447
00:31:58,281 --> 00:31:59,361
I deserved it.

448
00:31:59,401 --> 00:32:01,441
The first 50 meters
it looked like Bolt,

449
00:32:01,481 --> 00:32:03,841
then the bellows
came and he collapsed.

450
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,177
I'll put it here, then I'll take it.

451
00:32:07,681 --> 00:32:10,441
If I don't catch
you, go to the ground.

452
00:32:10,481 --> 00:32:11,521
Stop it.

453
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:18,961
So I can't get the handcuffs off you.

454
00:32:19,001 --> 00:32:20,041
But look at this!

455
00:32:21,001 --> 00:32:23,361
- China is close.
- Do not move.

456
00:32:23,401 --> 00:32:24,641
Hey!

457
00:32:24,681 --> 00:32:27,361
- All ready for the final greeting?
- Yes, sir.

458
00:32:27,401 --> 00:32:30,121
You wrote a speech of four
hours and 40 minutes.

459
00:32:30,161 --> 00:32:33,361
We need to shorten it, but
not the part where you praise me.

460
00:32:33,401 --> 00:32:35,081
- That's important.
- Certainly.

461
00:32:40,201 --> 00:32:42,921
- He has a face like ass.
- A career animal.

462
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,641
Tell us about this bad night.

463
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,462
Filipinos against Chinese in Gothic.

464
00:32:48,561 --> 00:32:51,041
Two Filipinos on the
ground, stab wounds.

465
00:32:51,081 --> 00:32:53,241
We arrived right away.

466
00:32:53,281 --> 00:32:57,361
Then, a third Filipino approaches,
points me to a dark alley and says:

467
00:32:57,401 --> 00:32:59,961
"They hide there. They are armed."

468
00:33:00,001 --> 00:33:03,561
I thought, "The fuck I'm
going down a dark alley."

469
00:33:03,601 --> 00:33:07,561
I was going to tell him, "Take
a gun, shoot whoever you want."

470
00:33:07,601 --> 00:33:11,241
Then, I see this asshole rocketing off.

471
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:13,481
What was I supposed to do?  I followed him.

472
00:33:15,401 --> 00:33:17,081
Anyway, two small fish.

473
00:33:18,001 --> 00:33:21,041
They'd stashed doses of
shaboo nearby for retrieval.

474
00:33:21,081 --> 00:33:23,761
We caught one, who's right there.
He is 17 years old.

475
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:25,321
Chinese? Yes, Paolo Sarpi.

476
00:33:25,361 --> 00:33:26,561
With the fuck talking.

477
00:33:28,561 --> 00:33:30,441
What happened to yours?

478
00:33:30,481 --> 00:33:33,921
Mine, as he ran, said
he would give himself up.

479
00:33:33,961 --> 00:33:36,761
I gave him your name.  He comes
to break you at the end of the shift.

480
00:33:36,801 --> 00:33:38,121
Congratulations!

481
00:33:40,401 --> 00:33:42,361
Good morning, Katia.

482
00:33:42,401 --> 00:33:45,841
Give them what they want, today I pay.

483
00:33:45,881 --> 00:33:47,881
- Hello, Katia.
- Hello.

484
00:33:47,921 --> 00:33:50,241
- For me the usual.
- Me too.

485
00:33:59,921 --> 00:34:00,921
At that time?

486
00:34:02,561 --> 00:34:04,001
The history of Gothic...

487
00:34:05,201 --> 00:34:06,881
it made me think of yours.

488
00:34:09,921 --> 00:34:13,761
Before, you didn't see or
hear these Chinese gangs.

489
00:34:15,281 --> 00:34:16,961
You saw that.

490
00:34:17,001 --> 00:34:18,961
Have you heard?  He is 17 years old.

491
00:34:20,201 --> 00:34:24,121
Gucci T-shirt, 50,000 euro
Rolex, Dolce and Gabbana shoes.

492
00:34:24,881 --> 00:34:26,641
Bao Zhang is the old guard.

493
00:34:26,681 --> 00:34:29,841
The son-in-law, he is younger,
but he seems to me a correct person.

494
00:34:29,881 --> 00:34:30,881
He is reliable.

495
00:34:32,201 --> 00:34:33,641
Will he not be in drugs?

496
00:34:33,681 --> 00:34:34,961
They have to try.

497
00:34:38,881 --> 00:34:40,081
Eight hundred euros.

498
00:34:40,801 --> 00:34:43,361
- Eight hundred shit!
- One hour of work.

499
00:34:45,401 --> 00:34:46,401
Two-thousand.

500
00:34:47,881 --> 00:34:50,201
- 1500.
- 2500.

501
00:34:54,281 --> 00:34:56,321
- Two-thousand.
- You shitty stingy.

502
00:34:58,401 --> 00:35:00,681
- We are late?
- Three minutes early.

503
00:35:00,721 --> 00:35:02,481
I want to hear what Cosimo says.

504
00:35:03,681 --> 00:35:05,641
- Good morning.
- Hi.

505
00:35:05,681 --> 00:35:06,841
Everything OK?

506
00:35:07,881 --> 00:35:09,241
Me too.

507
00:35:16,201 --> 00:35:17,201
Please.

508
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,297
One minute and I'll be there.

509
00:35:30,001 --> 00:35:31,081
- Franco?
- Huh?

510
00:35:31,121 --> 00:35:32,441
What are they doing here?

511
00:35:32,481 --> 00:35:34,721
they are expanding with the Chinese.

512
00:35:34,761 --> 00:35:37,161
- They're renovating.
- I understand.

513
00:35:44,401 --> 00:35:46,641
- It's great!
- Huh?

514
00:35:46,681 --> 00:35:47,881
It's a big stone.

515
00:35:49,401 --> 00:35:50,401
Do not look.

516
00:35:51,881 --> 00:35:54,281
- Mind your own business.
- Shh!

517
00:35:54,881 --> 00:35:57,041
I told him to mind his own business.

518
00:35:59,281 --> 00:36:01,681
Cosimo, we need to get the

519
00:36:01,721 --> 00:36:04,361
cutters and machinery
from Tel Aviv.

520
00:36:04,401 --> 00:36:06,761
The machinery?
I spent a lot of money on this.

521
00:36:07,921 --> 00:36:10,441
The world is full of skamerz.

522
00:36:10,481 --> 00:36:12,761
- What he said?
- Skamerz.

523
00:36:12,801 --> 00:36:14,321
Huh?

524
00:36:14,361 --> 00:36:15,521
Skamerz.

525
00:36:16,681 --> 00:36:18,841
I don't know what it is.  You know it?

526
00:36:18,881 --> 00:36:20,761
I know scamorza.

527
00:36:21,881 --> 00:36:23,361
How stupid!

528
00:36:23,401 --> 00:36:24,561
Come.

529
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:26,361
Bro, Bao Zhang is waiting for you.

530
00:36:28,281 --> 00:36:30,441
- Goodbye.
- See you later.

531
00:36:33,361 --> 00:36:34,561
Please come in.

532
00:36:35,681 --> 00:36:37,361
Come here.

533
00:36:37,401 --> 00:36:39,561
But that big stone, what is it?

534
00:36:39,601 --> 00:36:40,641
Like what is it?

535
00:36:40,681 --> 00:36:42,681
Cugi, that's the future.

536
00:36:45,081 --> 00:36:46,641
You are crazy!

537
00:36:48,601 --> 00:36:49,601
I'm happy.

538
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,554
Goodbye.

539
00:37:00,201 --> 00:37:01,201
At that time?

540
00:37:04,881 --> 00:37:06,441
Where can I take you to dinner?

541
00:37:06,481 --> 00:37:08,161
- What are you saying?
- Why?

542
00:37:08,201 --> 00:37:10,441
Don't start being a spendthrift.

543
00:37:11,601 --> 00:37:13,721
If you really have to, one simple thing.

544
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:15,721
Oysters and champagne.

545
00:37:16,681 --> 00:37:18,961
- Hey!
- See, you make me emotional.

546
00:37:19,001 --> 00:37:20,121
The oysters!

547
00:37:20,161 --> 00:37:21,641
Take this.

548
00:37:21,681 --> 00:37:23,721
The rest, when things are done.

549
00:37:23,761 --> 00:37:25,841
- Even the phone?
- Yes.

550
00:37:25,881 --> 00:37:27,641
Leave yours at home.

551
00:37:27,681 --> 00:37:29,161
Do I need to worry?

552
00:37:29,201 --> 00:37:30,761
No, I do that too.

553
00:37:30,801 --> 00:37:32,001
As a precaution.

554
00:37:32,681 --> 00:37:34,281
They also give us the car.

555
00:37:35,801 --> 00:37:38,441
At eight he lands, at nine we're done.

556
00:37:38,481 --> 00:37:40,841
What do I do while you drive?

557
00:37:40,881 --> 00:37:43,961
Try not to be discouraged,
and keep an eye out.

558
00:37:44,001 --> 00:37:45,681
It's not easy to do it together.

559
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:49,041
In fact, I can't make any
promises about the first one.

560
00:37:49,081 --> 00:37:50,481
Then do as you like.

561
00:37:51,201 --> 00:37:54,841
He doesn't listen, he's stubborn.  Now
I have to argue with the whole building.

562
00:37:54,881 --> 00:37:58,361
Stubborn as a mule,
he is just like his mother.

563
00:37:59,081 --> 00:38:01,241
Does she still ask you about Antonella?

564
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:03,761
Every now and then,
when his friends tell him

565
00:38:03,801 --> 00:38:05,561
something that puts him in trouble.

566
00:38:05,601 --> 00:38:07,321
Anyway, you're a great dad.

567
00:38:07,361 --> 00:38:08,641
He's coming along fine.

568
00:38:08,681 --> 00:38:10,601
- Did you understand?
- What do you have?

569
00:38:10,641 --> 00:38:12,161
- The melon!
- Yes, the melon.

570
00:38:12,201 --> 00:38:14,961
- You said: "A great dad."
- Yes, and I repeat.

571
00:38:15,681 --> 00:38:16,961
You play the stingy.

572
00:38:17,001 --> 00:38:19,041
You know what I do with these?

573
00:38:19,081 --> 00:38:21,841
I take him to Puglia to
meet the rest of the family.

574
00:38:21,881 --> 00:38:24,041
- Do you understand that father?
- Well done!

575
00:38:24,081 --> 00:38:25,361
Ernest!

576
00:38:25,401 --> 00:38:26,481
Break everything.

577
00:38:26,521 --> 00:38:27,961
But leave it be.

578
00:38:28,001 --> 00:38:30,601
- He's not doing anything.
- Destroys the house.

579
00:38:41,961 --> 00:38:43,561
These are tough, listen.

580
00:38:43,601 --> 00:38:44,881
- What are you saying?
- Yes.

581
00:38:45,561 --> 00:38:48,041
She told me she would give them to me ripe.

582
00:38:48,081 --> 00:38:49,361
Who told you that?

583
00:38:49,401 --> 00:38:51,561
The one below, I got them there.

584
00:38:51,601 --> 00:38:54,641
Franco, I can't travel all
over Milan to do the shopping.

585
00:38:54,681 --> 00:38:55,841
Would you like to taste it?

586
00:38:55,881 --> 00:38:57,081
I'm listening.

587
00:38:57,881 --> 00:39:00,801
- No!  Don't eat Franco.
- It's tough, huh?

588
00:39:02,561 --> 00:39:04,681
Tomorrow I'll quarrel about that too.

589
00:39:05,681 --> 00:39:07,721
You are a baron!

590
00:39:07,761 --> 00:39:08,761
Done!

591
00:39:09,361 --> 00:39:10,361
Go!

592
00:39:19,281 --> 00:39:20,961
I wanted to tell you...

593
00:39:21,001 --> 00:39:22,441
What will you tell us?

594
00:39:22,481 --> 00:39:23,641
Wait a moment.

595
00:39:27,081 --> 00:39:29,841
I want to explain
why I retire early.

596
00:39:33,801 --> 00:39:38,081
I am a policeman who has
always given his best for 35 years.

597
00:39:41,041 --> 00:39:43,761
I'm not talking about a career, it doesn't make sense.

598
00:39:48,561 --> 00:39:52,361
Viviana's parents are what they are.

599
00:39:54,081 --> 00:39:56,241
But they used this thing

600
00:39:57,321 --> 00:40:01,721
as an excuse not to
make a career out of it.

601
00:40:01,761 --> 00:40:05,481
I don't tell her anything.
Why would I make her feel bad?

602
00:40:05,521 --> 00:40:08,641
She would suffer unnecessarily.

603
00:40:08,681 --> 00:40:12,761
But even she can't get over it,
she doesn't understand it.  Rightly!

604
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:20,121
If you really want to know, I love...

605
00:40:20,801 --> 00:40:22,601
I have given up.

606
00:40:25,321 --> 00:40:27,321
What a dickhead you are.

607
00:40:27,361 --> 00:40:29,601
Come on!  fuck you!

608
00:40:30,441 --> 00:40:31,441
I'm talking to you.

609
00:40:32,041 --> 00:40:33,641
I am joking.

610
00:40:34,481 --> 00:40:35,881
Seriously speaking,

611
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:41,268
it's interesting when you say that it was
your choice that you took it in the ass.

612
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:44,441
Who, when the fuck did I say that?

613
00:40:44,481 --> 00:40:46,121
"By choice of Love"...

614
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,702
What the fuck does that have to do with it!

615
00:40:50,761 --> 00:40:53,361
- You really are an idiot!
- You like it, huh!

616
00:40:53,401 --> 00:40:55,881
Show if you like it.

617
00:40:59,641 --> 00:41:01,921
- It's them?
- I think so.

618
00:41:03,721 --> 00:41:04,721
Why are there two of them?

619
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:13,761
Hi, I'm Fei Fei.

620
00:41:13,801 --> 00:41:14,921
You?

621
00:41:14,961 --> 00:41:19,121
- Good evening, I'm Franco.
- Dino.

622
00:41:19,161 --> 00:41:21,081
Franco, Dino.

623
00:41:27,561 --> 00:41:29,281
Good evening, Franco.

624
00:41:30,201 --> 00:41:31,921
Is this the car?

625
00:41:32,521 --> 00:41:34,841
- They gave us this.
- Okay.

626
00:41:34,881 --> 00:41:37,961
I need a moment alone in the car.

627
00:41:38,001 --> 00:41:39,761
Let's go later, okay?

628
00:41:40,801 --> 00:41:44,441
Mr. Zhang mentioned
one passenger with a briefcase.

629
00:41:44,481 --> 00:41:46,721
- Who is he?
- My boyfriend.

630
00:41:46,761 --> 00:41:47,841
Chun Ba.

631
00:41:47,881 --> 00:41:48,961
I'm sorry,

632
00:41:49,001 --> 00:41:52,241
but it's better for him to take a
taxi and go to the hotel.

633
00:41:52,281 --> 00:41:54,441
I'm not going without my boyfriend.

634
00:41:55,561 --> 00:41:57,281
Shall I take the taxi too?

635
00:41:58,401 --> 00:41:59,761
Then we search him.

636
00:41:59,801 --> 00:42:03,041
We went through
airport security.

637
00:42:03,081 --> 00:42:05,441
- Still we need to check.
- All right.

638
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,241
Let yourself be searched.

639
00:42:14,801 --> 00:42:15,801
Open your arms.

640
00:42:41,441 --> 00:42:42,441
He's clean.

641
00:42:50,161 --> 00:42:52,601
Boss, let's go!

642
00:43:38,161 --> 00:43:40,001
I'm exhausted.

643
00:43:44,761 --> 00:43:49,281
When it's all over, I
want to go on vacation.

644
00:43:51,601 --> 00:43:53,401
But where?

645
00:43:55,201 --> 00:43:56,601
Las Vegas,

646
00:43:57,561 --> 00:44:00,841
New York, Hong Kong or Hawaii?

647
00:44:03,921 --> 00:44:05,481
Something is wrong.

648
00:44:06,241 --> 00:44:07,521
I don't like it.

649
00:44:11,761 --> 00:44:14,841
What's the problem?
I think you are the problem.

650
00:44:16,401 --> 00:44:18,001
You are too nervous.

651
00:44:19,641 --> 00:44:20,641
Take it easy.

652
00:44:30,481 --> 00:44:32,001
Do you know it all?

653
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,445
Do you want me to change the song?

654
00:44:35,641 --> 00:44:37,881
Whistle for me that of the white Alfa Romeo.

655
00:44:42,321 --> 00:44:44,681
I try to remember it.

656
00:45:24,681 --> 00:45:27,681
Chief, what's going on?

657
00:45:27,721 --> 00:45:30,041
- What happened?
- We have a flat tire.

658
00:45:30,081 --> 00:45:32,841
Rear left, holy shit.

659
00:45:32,881 --> 00:45:35,681
We had a puncture, we have
to stop and change the wheel.

660
00:45:35,721 --> 00:45:37,601
Don't stop.

661
00:45:38,201 --> 00:45:40,961
These guys don't understand shit.

662
00:45:41,001 --> 00:45:42,201
What does this say?

663
00:45:43,761 --> 00:45:46,361
- Go!
- Fuck you scream!

664
00:45:49,281 --> 00:45:52,481
What's wrong?
What the fuck is going on?

665
00:45:52,521 --> 00:45:53,801
They are coming for us.

666
00:45:54,441 --> 00:45:57,321
- Have you seen that bike?
- No.

667
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,342
How many magazines do you have?

668
00:46:02,161 --> 00:46:03,161
One.

669
00:46:04,841 --> 00:46:06,281
And a fart in the barrel.

670
00:46:10,281 --> 00:46:11,281
Ready to fire.

671
00:46:13,761 --> 00:46:18,241
There's a gas station
next time, shall I go out?

672
00:46:18,281 --> 00:46:19,281
Yes.

673
00:46:20,281 --> 00:46:22,001
There will also be cameras.

674
00:46:40,081 --> 00:46:41,681
Let this moron pass!

675
00:46:47,561 --> 00:46:50,121
Let me in, wait.  Don't you see it?

676
00:46:51,401 --> 00:46:54,321
Go, what the fuck are you flashing, go!

677
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,201
Maybe it's just a coincidence.

678
00:47:13,241 --> 00:47:15,721
What? It's not a coincidence!

679
00:47:15,761 --> 00:47:18,041
Miss, I no longer handle the car.

680
00:47:18,081 --> 00:47:22,361
We stop, we change the wheel, I'll take you.

681
00:47:22,401 --> 00:47:25,041
- You explain it to him in English.
- What can I explain to you?

682
00:47:25,081 --> 00:47:27,921
No, if we stop, we're dead.

683
00:47:27,961 --> 00:47:29,601
Did you understand or not?

684
00:47:29,641 --> 00:47:34,241
Fei Fei, don't scream,
you give me a headache!

685
00:47:34,281 --> 00:47:35,841
Let us do our job.

686
00:47:50,521 --> 00:47:52,681
- No, holy shit!
- What's up?

687
00:47:54,561 --> 00:47:57,041
Shut up, let me talk.

688
00:47:57,081 --> 00:47:59,081
Don't talk.

689
00:47:59,681 --> 00:48:01,561
Holy shit.

690
00:48:08,681 --> 00:48:10,081
- Hello.
- Greetings.

691
00:48:10,681 --> 00:48:12,961
She's riding on the rim, you know?

692
00:48:13,001 --> 00:48:16,641
Yes, I'm a colleague, I
stopped to change the tire.

693
00:48:16,681 --> 00:48:18,401
- Greetings!
- Hi.

694
00:48:18,441 --> 00:48:20,361
- Are you on duty?
- Yes.

695
00:48:20,401 --> 00:48:23,241
We bring these two Chinese
tourists to file a complaint.

696
00:48:23,281 --> 00:48:25,961
As soon as they arrived they were robbed.

697
00:48:30,481 --> 00:48:32,201
Can I see the badges?

698
00:48:40,801 --> 00:48:42,281
Thanks, alright.

699
00:48:45,601 --> 00:48:47,721
Do you turn it, please?

700
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,668
Show the photo.

701
00:48:50,121 --> 00:48:51,721
Thanks, alright.

702
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,548
Which police station are you from?

703
00:48:58,401 --> 00:49:00,921
Do you want to know it? Look I'm married.

704
00:49:01,801 --> 00:49:03,321
Does it make me witty?

705
00:49:04,001 --> 00:49:06,161
Answer me, colleague, please?

706
00:49:06,201 --> 00:49:07,201
We are on mobile.

707
00:49:09,881 --> 00:49:10,881
Thank you.

708
00:49:18,001 --> 00:49:20,321
Wait here, don't go away.
I will check.

709
00:49:41,081 --> 00:49:43,521
- You think she believed you?
- Let's go.

710
00:49:45,081 --> 00:49:46,801
We're going now!

711
00:49:46,841 --> 00:49:49,681
Alright, now let's fix it.

712
00:49:49,721 --> 00:49:50,801
Be calm.

713
00:49:50,841 --> 00:49:51,961
Fuck...

714
00:49:52,001 --> 00:49:54,401
You don't tell me right.

715
00:50:09,201 --> 00:50:10,721
She didn't believe it.

716
00:50:39,081 --> 00:50:42,441
I need to see the
occupants' documents, please.

717
00:50:42,481 --> 00:50:44,561
I thought you'd help me change the tire.

718
00:50:44,601 --> 00:50:46,361
Now what are you doing, a check?

719
00:50:46,401 --> 00:50:48,361
Yes exactly, a check.

720
00:50:49,721 --> 00:50:51,481
It's a regular check, mate.

721
00:50:56,201 --> 00:50:59,601
But is it always like this?  We are on duty...

722
00:50:59,641 --> 00:51:01,961
This car is not in service.

723
00:51:02,001 --> 00:51:04,841
- Roll down all the windows.
- They just gave it to us.

724
00:51:04,881 --> 00:51:07,921
We showed you the
badges, let's end it here.

725
00:51:07,961 --> 00:51:08,961
No!

726
00:51:09,801 --> 00:51:12,921
Roll down the windows and
give me the passenger IDs.

727
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:19,161
- Roll down the window.
- Listen for a second.

728
00:51:20,961 --> 00:51:24,521
Stay in your place.
Hands out, thank you.

729
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:26,137
But are you serious?

730
00:51:26,361 --> 00:51:27,921
We are on duty.

731
00:51:27,961 --> 00:51:29,841
We are armed, do you want to make war?

732
00:51:30,881 --> 00:51:33,921
I said hands on the
dashboard, both of you, in sight!

733
00:51:35,281 --> 00:51:36,961
Put your hands on the dashboard.

734
00:51:37,001 --> 00:51:38,361
You are stupid.

735
00:51:38,401 --> 00:51:41,961
You're so stupid you
can't see they aren't cops.

736
00:51:42,001 --> 00:51:43,961
Shut up, Fei Fei. Let us work.

737
00:51:54,201 --> 00:51:55,841
Ask which barracks they are from.

738
00:51:55,881 --> 00:51:59,561
There is a
problem and nobody believes me.

739
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,634
Nureyev is the sister-in-law
of the Moskva lieutenant.

740
00:52:02,681 --> 00:52:04,641
Appointed, which barracks are you from?

741
00:52:04,681 --> 00:52:06,721
What's in the briefcase?

742
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:12,748
You didn't introduce yourself
and you didn't answer me, it's not polite.

743
00:52:12,801 --> 00:52:15,041
We need to check the briefcase.

744
00:52:17,681 --> 00:52:20,241
You have to do something, now!

745
00:52:21,801 --> 00:52:23,321
Can I see the card?

746
00:52:23,361 --> 00:52:27,561
I don't have to show you
anything, I'm in uniform and I'm working.

747
00:52:27,601 --> 00:52:34,361
Let's say I check the briefcase and
then go fuck yourself wherever you want.

748
00:52:35,041 --> 00:52:36,241
Okay?

749
00:52:36,281 --> 00:52:39,761
I told you not to stop the car!

750
00:52:39,801 --> 00:52:41,961
Why don't you do anything?

751
00:52:42,001 --> 00:52:44,561
You are all together!

752
00:52:44,601 --> 00:52:47,041
Help!

753
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:48,081
He is armed!

754
00:53:03,881 --> 00:53:05,481
I`ll kill you!

755
00:53:49,961 --> 00:53:50,961
Take me home.

756
00:53:57,761 --> 00:53:59,081
Take me home.

757
00:54:08,681 --> 00:54:11,361
Help!

758
00:54:15,441 --> 00:54:18,121
Help!

759
00:54:26,561 --> 00:54:29,481
Stay with me!

760
00:54:44,961 --> 00:54:45,961
Hey!

761
00:56:35,681 --> 00:56:37,801
They said you wouldn't shoot.

762
00:56:46,281 --> 00:56:48,401
They said you wouldn't shoot.

763
00:56:51,881 --> 00:56:53,441
Who told you?

764
00:57:08,201 --> 00:57:10,921
As it unlocks, I'll call for help.

765
00:57:10,961 --> 00:57:13,961
Twenty-seven, 10, 13.

766
00:57:15,081 --> 00:57:16,481
The birthday of my son.

767
00:57:32,801 --> 00:57:34,761
Colleagues are coming now.

768
00:58:21,321 --> 00:58:24,041
Go away!

769
00:59:56,761 --> 00:59:58,881
No!

770
01:00:00,881 --> 01:00:02,041
Who is it now?

771
01:00:02,081 --> 01:00:03,281
- Hi!
- Hi.

772
01:00:04,761 --> 01:00:06,161
Hello?

773
01:00:06,201 --> 01:00:08,441
Can you talk?

774
01:00:08,481 --> 01:00:09,561
A moment.

775
01:00:09,601 --> 01:00:11,161
Wait a moment.

776
01:00:11,201 --> 01:00:14,121
Guys, uncork, if you want to relax.

777
01:00:14,161 --> 01:00:15,161
I'm coming

778
01:00:16,681 --> 01:00:17,881
Yes, tell me.

779
01:00:19,481 --> 01:00:23,801
On the road to Malpensa there is a motorway
service station with a large truck park,

780
01:00:23,841 --> 01:00:25,041
come here please.

781
01:00:25,081 --> 01:00:26,081
What happened?

782
01:00:26,761 --> 01:00:29,841
I tell you when I see you.
Go now, please.

783
01:00:29,881 --> 01:00:31,441
- Go now.
- How, now?

784
01:00:31,481 --> 01:00:32,681
Yes now.

785
01:00:33,281 --> 01:00:35,241
It's important, do you understand?

786
01:00:35,281 --> 01:00:38,841
But people are coming for the
surprise party, did you know.

787
01:00:38,881 --> 01:00:39,961
Find an excuse.

788
01:00:40,001 --> 01:00:42,521
Bring bottles of water, soap,

789
01:00:42,561 --> 01:00:44,841
a suit and sneakers.

790
01:00:44,881 --> 01:00:46,561
Wait a moment.

791
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:48,641
Tell me again what I have to bring you.

792
01:00:48,681 --> 01:00:50,841
Bottles of water, soap,

793
01:00:50,881 --> 01:00:53,641
a tracksuit and sneakers.

794
01:00:53,681 --> 01:00:56,281
- All right?
- Yes, don't worry. I'm coming.

795
01:01:07,881 --> 01:01:09,561
What's going on, Franco?

796
01:01:09,601 --> 01:01:10,841
Come here, it's open.

797
01:01:10,881 --> 01:01:12,721
I can't touch anything, you come.

798
01:01:12,761 --> 01:01:14,561
Did you bring soap and water?

799
01:01:14,601 --> 01:01:16,401
- Yes.
- Bring them to me. Come here.

800
01:01:28,481 --> 01:01:30,521
What happened, Franco?

801
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:33,281
Open the bottle.
I can't touch anything.

802
01:01:34,081 --> 01:01:35,281
Give me the soap.

803
01:01:39,641 --> 01:01:41,761
- Put the soap on.
- What did you do?

804
01:01:41,801 --> 01:01:43,841
I didn't do anything.

805
01:01:43,881 --> 01:01:44,881
Put it here.

806
01:01:49,281 --> 01:01:50,401
Where's Dino?

807
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:58,085
Can you tell me where Dino is?

808
01:02:00,361 --> 01:02:01,361
Franco?

809
01:02:08,001 --> 01:02:09,321
Love, Dino is not...

810
01:02:10,281 --> 01:02:11,641
Not what?

811
01:02:49,601 --> 01:02:50,841
They were many.

812
01:02:56,761 --> 01:02:57,761
Get ready.

813
01:03:13,361 --> 01:03:16,161
I should turn myself in and confess everything.

814
01:03:16,201 --> 01:03:19,081
I knew you would say this bullshit.

815
01:03:20,201 --> 01:03:21,641
You would go to jail!

816
01:03:21,681 --> 01:03:23,761
Do you understand that, Franco?

817
01:03:23,801 --> 01:03:25,521
We lose everything.

818
01:03:25,561 --> 01:03:26,841
Think, please.

819
01:03:26,881 --> 01:03:28,801
Me and you. All!

820
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,777
Have you thought about your daughter?

821
01:03:34,361 --> 01:03:37,761
What will Anna do in Brighton
without your pension?

822
01:03:38,881 --> 01:03:40,321
You have to come back here.

823
01:03:40,361 --> 01:03:44,721
She has to leave her
studies, go to work...

824
01:03:54,881 --> 01:04:00,281
We are on the edge of a precipice.

825
01:04:02,481 --> 01:04:05,801
And when one stands on the edge
of a precipice, what does one do?

826
01:04:06,561 --> 01:04:07,761
Does he jump?

827
01:04:09,401 --> 01:04:10,401
No...

828
01:04:12,081 --> 01:04:14,721
What I thought was...

829
01:04:17,281 --> 01:04:19,281
Now who gets the diamonds?

830
01:04:21,401 --> 01:04:22,681
Are you serious, Vivia?

831
01:04:24,881 --> 01:04:27,321
Yes, Franco.  Who gets them?

832
01:04:27,361 --> 01:04:29,441
Vivian, no.

833
01:04:29,481 --> 01:04:31,681
Get this out of your head, please.

834
01:04:31,721 --> 01:04:34,201
We are close to the police station, leave me here.

835
01:04:37,201 --> 01:04:39,081
Here come Bonnie and Clyde...

836
01:04:40,881 --> 01:04:42,561
Pull over the car.

837
01:04:43,481 --> 01:04:44,481
Pull over.

838
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:47,841
Come on.

839
01:04:48,561 --> 01:04:50,881
Will you wait for me, please?

840
01:04:51,801 --> 01:04:55,281
We take them and run away.
Let's go far, Franco.

841
01:04:55,321 --> 01:04:58,561
On a warm island where
no one can find us anymore.

842
01:04:58,601 --> 01:05:00,041
You have to think positive.

843
01:05:00,081 --> 01:05:03,441
You have to visualize this
future on the deserted island...

844
01:05:03,481 --> 01:05:05,281
Viviana, fuck!

845
01:05:05,321 --> 01:05:07,001
You're drilling my brain.

846
01:05:07,961 --> 01:05:11,521
You don't know shit
about how the... works

847
01:05:11,561 --> 01:05:13,361
- What?
- Shit.

848
01:05:15,481 --> 01:05:16,481
Indeed.

849
01:05:21,201 --> 01:05:23,161
You watch too much crap on TV.

850
01:05:23,988 --> 01:05:25,634
What does that have to do with anything?

851
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:28,240
The road has other rules, my love.

852
01:05:28,281 --> 01:05:30,681
In real life, someone who
escapes to a desert island doesn't

853
01:05:30,721 --> 01:05:33,761
have time to lie down on
the towel, they shoot at him.

854
01:05:33,801 --> 01:05:36,721
If I want to do things
right, I have to go to

855
01:05:36,761 --> 01:05:39,041
Bao Zhang, I have to kneel
down and apologize to him.

856
01:05:39,081 --> 01:05:43,161
I have to go to Sarno and
explain what happened.

857
01:05:43,201 --> 01:05:45,961
Then maybe they keep me alive.

858
01:05:47,201 --> 01:05:50,241
A bad trial is better than a
good funeral, remember that.

859
01:05:53,001 --> 01:05:55,441
Who has arrived, Inspector Callaghan?

860
01:05:55,481 --> 01:05:57,641
Am I watching too much bullshit on TV?

861
01:05:57,681 --> 01:05:59,361
But fuck you, Viviana.

862
01:05:59,401 --> 01:06:01,441
No! You go fuck yourself.

863
01:06:16,361 --> 01:06:19,241
Here I am, sorry.
I forgot to buy the vodka.

864
01:06:19,281 --> 01:06:22,041
Hang on for a moment, it's Sarno.

865
01:06:23,481 --> 01:06:24,841
Ready, Commissioner.

866
01:06:25,961 --> 01:06:28,361
Franco left the phone at home.

867
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:30,041
He went for a jog.

868
01:06:30,081 --> 01:06:34,161
We're all here for the
surprise party we threw for him.

869
01:06:34,201 --> 01:06:35,841
Say hello to Franco's boss.

870
01:06:35,881 --> 01:06:37,761
Hello!

871
01:06:37,801 --> 01:06:40,041
Doctor, do you want to join us too?

872
01:06:43,481 --> 01:06:46,321
Sure, when he gets back I'll call.

873
01:06:50,081 --> 01:06:52,721
- Cousins!
- Cosimo!

874
01:06:52,761 --> 01:06:54,561
Meet Sharon.

875
01:06:54,601 --> 01:06:56,761
She is American, but she speaks Italian well.

876
01:06:56,801 --> 01:06:58,601
Nice to meet you.

877
01:06:58,641 --> 01:07:00,841
- Pleasure and welcome.
- Thank you.

878
01:07:00,881 --> 01:07:02,241
Have you heard from your husband?

879
01:07:02,281 --> 01:07:05,281
No, he went for a run. So who knows?

880
01:07:05,321 --> 01:07:07,961
- Do you want to have a heart attack?
- What heart attack?

881
01:07:08,001 --> 01:07:09,481
Exams are okay.

882
01:07:10,801 --> 01:07:12,561
- Excuse me.
- Guys!

883
01:07:12,601 --> 01:07:15,041
Sara, Rita, Lorenzo, can you give me a hand?

884
01:07:15,081 --> 01:07:16,761
I have a lot of things to do.

885
01:07:17,801 --> 01:07:19,561
- Did you cook everything yourself?
- Yes.

886
01:07:19,601 --> 01:07:21,321
You were already with the glass in your hand.

887
01:07:21,361 --> 01:07:23,041
And who else, Sharon?

888
01:07:24,321 --> 01:07:26,961
I usually order take out at parties.

889
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:30,961
I choose the restaurant, one click,
and no headache to go shopping.

890
01:07:38,681 --> 01:07:41,881
- Do you have a dishwasher?
- Sorry, I have to run.

891
01:07:41,921 --> 01:07:43,361
Yes?

892
01:07:43,401 --> 01:07:46,561
Yes. As soon as Franco arrives,
let me call. It's important.

893
01:07:46,601 --> 01:07:49,361
- Everything is fine?
- Yes, everything is fine.

894
01:07:50,881 --> 01:07:54,641
- I'll kick him in...
- Ernesto, enough with that gun.

895
01:07:54,681 --> 01:07:56,761
He's Dino's son, leave him there.

896
01:07:57,801 --> 01:07:59,641
I'm going to do an important service.

897
01:07:59,681 --> 01:08:02,161
Sharon stays here, I'll
pick her up in an hour.

898
01:08:02,201 --> 01:08:04,241
No, Cosimo, don't leave me here for long.

899
01:08:04,281 --> 01:08:06,321
I know you, you show up in four hours.

900
01:08:06,361 --> 01:08:07,921
This evening is not the night.

901
01:08:07,961 --> 01:08:10,241
Do you know what you do?
She takes her to the taxi stand.

902
01:08:10,281 --> 01:08:12,441
There's one near here.

903
01:08:12,481 --> 01:08:15,161
- You are always kind, thank you.
- My pleasure.

904
01:08:15,201 --> 01:08:17,441
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you too.

905
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:19,251
And tonight there are two!

906
01:08:21,561 --> 01:08:24,641
This must be Anna, Franco's daughter.

907
01:08:24,681 --> 01:08:25,681
Answer.

908
01:08:28,281 --> 01:08:31,401
Ernesto, you piss me off with that gun.

909
01:08:48,161 --> 01:08:49,161
Franco!

910
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:54,725
We were waiting for you, what happened?

911
01:08:54,881 --> 01:08:57,681
- Her name is Sharon, she is American.
- Pleasure.

912
01:08:57,721 --> 01:08:59,761
But she understands Italian well.

913
01:08:59,801 --> 01:09:02,241
How was this race with your mates?

914
01:09:02,281 --> 01:09:04,521
They told me there was a mishap.

915
01:09:04,561 --> 01:09:05,841
What happened?

916
01:09:05,881 --> 01:09:09,081
The race went badly, Cosimo.

917
01:09:10,081 --> 01:09:11,961
There was a big trouble.

918
01:09:12,001 --> 01:09:14,201
We were in Rho, near Cerchiate...

919
01:09:15,561 --> 01:09:18,121
and there were five serious injuries.

920
01:09:19,881 --> 01:09:21,881
- Were they hurt?
- A lot, yes.

921
01:09:22,681 --> 01:09:26,241
Three on one side, two on the other.
Also Dino, my colleague.

922
01:09:26,281 --> 01:09:28,321
I know a physiotherapist in the Brera area...

923
01:09:28,361 --> 01:09:29,441
I'm sorry, love.

924
01:09:29,481 --> 01:09:31,441
In Italy, when two

925
01:09:31,481 --> 01:09:33,161
people talk, you don't interrupt.

926
01:09:33,201 --> 01:09:35,321
It's not polite, okay?

927
01:09:37,081 --> 01:09:38,961
Bro, the package you had,

928
01:09:39,561 --> 01:09:40,561
Where?

929
01:09:41,881 --> 01:09:44,001
But do you understand what happened?

930
01:09:46,201 --> 01:09:49,561
The package was taken by
those who injured you, right?

931
01:09:49,601 --> 01:09:52,361
Come down for a moment,
so we can talk better. Please.

932
01:09:52,401 --> 01:09:53,401
Get off.

933
01:09:54,161 --> 01:09:55,161
Come down, Cosimo.

934
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:58,022
What the fuck am I getting off?

935
01:09:58,361 --> 01:10:01,441
Damn you!  But do you
understand what a fucking mess...

936
01:11:21,201 --> 01:11:22,761
Hurray!

937
01:11:24,881 --> 01:11:27,361
Sorry. It must be Sarno.

938
01:11:27,401 --> 01:11:31,241
He's called a couple times already.
He will want to wish you well.

939
01:11:31,281 --> 01:11:32,641
You answer?

940
01:11:32,681 --> 01:11:34,161
Go.

941
01:11:34,201 --> 01:11:35,601
Good evening doctor.

942
01:11:37,161 --> 01:11:38,161
Yes, yes.

943
01:11:54,081 --> 01:11:56,681
Give him a shoe cover and let him pass.

944
01:13:28,241 --> 01:13:29,921
Are you all right, colleague?

945
01:13:32,801 --> 01:13:33,801
Thank you.

946
01:13:35,601 --> 01:13:37,481
Who was the first to arrive here?

947
01:13:38,681 --> 01:13:40,721
I don't know, you should ask the station.

948
01:14:13,561 --> 01:14:14,761
Yes?

949
01:14:14,801 --> 01:14:16,121
What happened?

950
01:14:18,161 --> 01:14:21,081
Who the fuck was that you put in my car?

951
01:14:22,161 --> 01:14:23,721
Where's the goods?

952
01:14:23,761 --> 01:14:25,721
No. I want to talk to your father-in-law.

953
01:14:26,481 --> 01:14:28,041
No, you talk to me.

954
01:14:30,601 --> 01:14:32,281
Where are the goods?

955
01:14:33,281 --> 01:14:35,201
What the fuck do I know! I don't know.

956
01:14:59,801 --> 01:15:00,801
Excuse me.

957
01:15:08,441 --> 01:15:10,201
Excuse me, please.

958
01:15:12,161 --> 01:15:13,761
Excuse me.

959
01:15:15,081 --> 01:15:16,361
Excuse me.

960
01:15:19,201 --> 01:15:21,041
Sorry, excuse me.

961
01:15:23,161 --> 01:15:24,681
Doctor?

962
01:15:26,361 --> 01:15:28,041
Can I talk to you for a moment?

963
01:15:31,761 --> 01:15:33,601
Did you understand what happened?

964
01:15:34,601 --> 01:15:36,401
I don't understand shit.

965
01:15:38,961 --> 01:15:40,761
The gun in Dino's hand...

966
01:15:42,681 --> 01:15:45,561
It's strange that he didn't
have that of ordinance.

967
01:15:47,881 --> 01:15:51,041
We await the forensics.

968
01:15:51,681 --> 01:15:52,761
And we understand.

969
01:15:52,801 --> 01:15:54,921
I, doc...

970
01:15:54,961 --> 01:15:57,441
Doctor, I've worked with Ruggeri

971
01:15:57,481 --> 01:15:59,241
for 20 years, he has a son to raise.

972
01:15:59,281 --> 01:16:01,961
Bullshit like that he would never do.

973
01:16:02,001 --> 01:16:03,801
Franco, you know...

974
01:16:04,681 --> 01:16:07,481
that money,

975
01:16:08,361 --> 01:16:10,281
is the brother of the devil.

976
01:16:11,881 --> 01:16:13,401
This you have to say?

977
01:16:16,201 --> 01:16:18,001
Don't you dare talk to me like that.

978
01:16:18,681 --> 01:16:20,321
Stay where you fucking are.

979
01:16:27,161 --> 01:16:28,961
The prosecutor is coming.

980
01:16:30,161 --> 01:16:32,321
I wish you were here when he arrives.

981
01:16:33,681 --> 01:16:34,681
All right?

982
01:16:35,481 --> 01:16:36,481
All right.

983
01:16:41,561 --> 01:16:44,521
Do you want to tell me
something before talking to them?

984
01:16:46,801 --> 01:16:48,201
I have nothing to say.

985
01:17:03,081 --> 01:17:04,641
Allow me, sorry.

986
01:17:50,081 --> 01:17:51,761
- Franco!
- Viviana.

987
01:17:52,481 --> 01:17:56,041
- A mess here...
- I know, we're all upset.

988
01:17:56,081 --> 01:17:58,361
Fulvio and Nureyev are coming to you.

989
01:18:00,081 --> 01:18:03,161
They put the gun he fired into Dino's hand.

990
01:18:09,801 --> 01:18:12,321
Do you understand what I'm telling you?
Yes or no?

991
01:18:13,801 --> 01:18:15,081
I understand.

992
01:18:17,161 --> 01:18:18,161
Franco...

993
01:18:19,081 --> 01:18:21,441
If Dino was still alive, do you

994
01:18:21,481 --> 01:18:23,121
know what he would tell you?

995
01:18:24,641 --> 01:18:25,641
Huh?

996
01:18:26,681 --> 01:18:29,441
"Wake up, Franco, don't think about me,

997
01:18:29,481 --> 01:18:31,841
he thinks about saving your ass.

998
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:35,988
Finish this last night without
letting anything distract you."

999
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:39,645
Is it true or not, that he would tell you so?

1000
01:18:40,601 --> 01:18:43,001
The thing we talked
about earlier in the car…

1001
01:18:44,161 --> 01:18:47,201
If you think about it, it's our only way out.

1002
01:18:49,481 --> 01:18:51,841
I have all eyes on me.

1003
01:18:51,881 --> 01:18:54,321
Do you want me to come and help you?

1004
01:18:54,361 --> 01:18:57,481
What the fuck are you saying?
What the fuck are you saying?

1005
01:18:57,521 --> 01:18:58,801
Let me do it!

1006
01:19:00,601 --> 01:19:03,081
There are some things I need to understand.

1007
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:06,994
- I have to figure out some things.
- What do you still need to understand?

1008
01:19:07,161 --> 01:19:08,361
I am coming.

1009
01:19:09,561 --> 01:19:10,561
Vivian?

1010
01:19:11,681 --> 01:19:12,681
Vivian?

1011
01:19:16,161 --> 01:19:18,161
- Fuck you!
- Guys!

1012
01:19:18,201 --> 01:19:19,641
Come on, come with me.

1013
01:19:19,681 --> 01:19:21,361
We too. After you.

1014
01:20:07,361 --> 01:20:08,921
Listen to me.

1015
01:20:11,881 --> 01:20:14,081
Too many badges shot and died...

1016
01:20:16,481 --> 01:20:17,681
in this story.

1017
01:20:18,761 --> 01:20:20,761
We'll be the mobile...

1018
01:20:20,801 --> 01:20:23,001
Did you know he did this job?

1019
01:20:25,481 --> 01:20:29,161
We are collecting the reports
for the numerous eyewitnesses...

1020
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:33,201
Do you have relatives in Moscova?

1021
01:20:34,001 --> 01:20:35,001
Yes.

1022
01:20:35,681 --> 01:20:38,481
Franci's brother is marshal.

1023
01:20:41,961 --> 01:20:44,721
Do you know who was
the first to arrive on site?

1024
01:20:49,081 --> 01:20:52,001
...the other victim is
an off-duty police officer.

1025
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:57,481
And the last two victims are
the Carabinieri in uniform...

1026
01:21:55,761 --> 01:21:58,761
Dino Ruggeri is the most
honest cop I've ever met.

1027
01:21:58,801 --> 01:21:59,841
He was honest!

1028
01:21:59,881 --> 01:22:02,641
And Daria what was it? Was she corrupt?

1029
01:22:02,681 --> 01:22:05,641
Do you know Daria? Do you know her?

1030
01:22:05,681 --> 01:22:07,441
You don't know her!

1031
01:22:07,481 --> 01:22:10,441
- She was my sister!
- Discipline, fuck!

1032
01:22:10,481 --> 01:22:13,881
Let's get to work, come on.
Who has to go to the office, go.

1033
01:22:14,681 --> 01:22:15,681
Out of the way.

1034
01:22:16,561 --> 01:22:17,801
Let it pass.

1035
01:22:27,161 --> 01:22:30,161
Can you ask if there is a
white Alfa Romeo in service?

1036
01:22:32,201 --> 01:22:33,561
Yes, we let you know.

1037
01:23:16,201 --> 01:23:17,201
Ready?

1038
01:24:12,081 --> 01:24:13,321
Where's Dad?

1039
01:24:14,881 --> 01:24:16,601
Dad's at work, honey.

1040
01:24:18,681 --> 01:24:19,681
Get in.

1041
01:24:23,561 --> 01:24:24,801
Viviana!

1042
01:24:25,681 --> 01:24:28,121
- Cosimo!
- Beautiful cousin, come here.

1043
01:24:28,161 --> 01:24:30,201
- Tito, what are you doing here?
- Cousin!

1044
01:24:31,761 --> 01:24:34,201
- Are you looking for Franco?
- No.

1045
01:24:35,081 --> 01:24:38,721
We wanted to know how you were.
Do you need help?

1046
01:24:38,761 --> 01:24:40,761
No, what help?

1047
01:24:40,801 --> 01:24:42,961
This mess happened...

1048
01:24:43,001 --> 01:24:44,441
everything at once.

1049
01:24:44,481 --> 01:24:46,801
I can't think about it yet.

1050
01:24:48,281 --> 01:24:50,601
What a fucking mess, Viviana.

1051
01:24:52,281 --> 01:24:55,041
Now we have to get out of this mess,

1052
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:58,120
because we are accountable to the Chinese.

1053
01:24:59,161 --> 01:25:00,721
- To the Chinese?
- Huh.

1054
01:25:00,761 --> 01:25:03,481
The goods are theirs,
and they rightly want it.

1055
01:25:04,401 --> 01:25:06,521
What are you talking about? What goods?

1056
01:25:07,201 --> 01:25:09,281
I have the boy in the car.

1057
01:25:11,161 --> 01:25:15,281
By any chance, did Franco
tell you anything about it?

1058
01:25:16,161 --> 01:25:18,561
About what, sorry?

1059
01:25:19,525 --> 01:25:21,360
Viviana, let's be clear,
if you want to get

1060
01:25:21,401 --> 01:25:25,241
rid of this burden
and this whole mess,

1061
01:25:25,281 --> 01:25:28,361
don't worry, we'll
deliver the goods to them.

1062
01:25:28,401 --> 01:25:30,521
- Still?
- Vivian...

1063
01:25:30,561 --> 01:25:33,241
We solve this problem in the

1064
01:25:33,281 --> 01:25:35,041
family, without all these worries.

1065
01:25:35,081 --> 01:25:37,241
Tito, I thank you, but I don't

1066
01:25:37,281 --> 01:25:39,961
know anything about these things.

1067
01:25:40,001 --> 01:25:41,761
You have to ask Franco.

1068
01:25:41,801 --> 01:25:45,241
- I have the child in the car.
- Wait. Come here.

1069
01:25:45,281 --> 01:25:47,961
I have the child in the car, I
have to take it to my aunt's.

1070
01:25:48,001 --> 01:25:49,921
Why all this hurry?

1071
01:25:49,961 --> 01:25:52,601
Then I'll call you.  Bye thank you.

1072
01:26:08,481 --> 01:26:11,801
Inspector Sarno wants to
speak to you with the prosecutor.

1073
01:26:26,281 --> 01:26:29,041
Love, can you do a favor for Viviana?

1074
01:26:29,081 --> 01:26:30,241
All right.

1075
01:26:30,281 --> 01:26:34,721
Can you see if there's a car following us?

1076
01:26:34,761 --> 01:26:36,641
With the gentlemen I spoke to earlier.

1077
01:26:36,681 --> 01:26:39,561
The big one you used to
shoot at home with the gun.

1078
01:26:39,601 --> 01:26:40,761
Do you remember?

1079
01:26:40,801 --> 01:26:42,721
- Yes.
- Here, that one.

1080
01:26:42,761 --> 01:26:46,361
See if that gentleman is inside a car.

1081
01:27:23,761 --> 01:27:26,041
You have lost a friend, I have lost two.

1082
01:27:26,081 --> 01:27:27,641
Enough bullshit, right?

1083
01:27:30,681 --> 01:27:32,801
Colleague, be careful what you say.

1084
01:27:33,881 --> 01:27:35,201
I'll take you down with me.

1085
01:27:36,601 --> 01:27:38,001
We both drown.

1086
01:27:43,081 --> 01:27:46,281
I'm the chief prosecutor Roberta Botta.

1087
01:27:46,321 --> 01:27:47,641
Pleasure.

1088
01:27:47,681 --> 01:27:49,841
He is the public prosecutor Fresi.

1089
01:27:49,881 --> 01:27:51,921
- Pleasure.
- Amore, my pleasure.

1090
01:27:51,961 --> 01:27:54,441
We'd just like to ask you a
few questions, if you don't mind.

1091
01:27:54,481 --> 01:27:55,801
I'm here, please...

1092
01:27:58,681 --> 01:28:00,961
Milan, 3 June 2022.

1093
01:28:01,001 --> 01:28:03,361
It's 2:07.

1094
01:28:03,401 --> 01:28:06,641
We are on the Carugate
motorway junction of the A51.

1095
01:28:06,681 --> 01:28:11,121
I am the chief prosecutor Roberta
Botta with the public prosecutor Fresi.

1096
01:28:11,161 --> 01:28:13,961
We are hearing from Assistant
Chief Franco Amore about what

1097
01:28:14,001 --> 01:28:17,961
took place on the Segrate exit of the motorway

1098
01:28:18,001 --> 01:28:19,561
where died:

1099
01:28:19,601 --> 01:28:22,641
the agent Dino Ruggeri, the marshal

1100
01:28:22,681 --> 01:28:24,521
Daria Criscito, officer Armando Guerra

1101
01:28:24,561 --> 01:28:26,241
and two Asian nationals, one identified,

1102
01:28:26,281 --> 01:28:30,001
the other still being identified.

1103
01:28:30,961 --> 01:28:33,921
So when was the last time

1104
01:28:33,961 --> 01:28:36,161
you spoke to your colleague Dino Ruggeri?

1105
01:28:36,881 --> 01:28:38,281
This morning.

1106
01:28:39,361 --> 01:28:40,761
I was on duty with him.

1107
01:28:43,561 --> 01:28:46,841
Did you know about Dino's double job?

1108
01:28:49,401 --> 01:28:51,081
He never told me about it.

1109
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:58,274
Did he tell you what
you were going to do tonight?

1110
01:28:58,681 --> 01:28:59,961
He didn't say anything.

1111
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:04,241
We were waiting for him at my
house for a small family party.

1112
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:06,171
Did he ever talk about...

1113
01:29:06,281 --> 01:29:07,801
Financial problems?

1114
01:29:10,081 --> 01:29:11,681
With 1800 euros a month...

1115
01:29:13,161 --> 01:29:14,881
he had a complicated life.

1116
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:18,377
He had holes in his hands.

1117
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,531
he gave everything to his son.

1118
01:29:22,481 --> 01:29:24,161
However, I want to be clear

1119
01:29:27,681 --> 01:29:31,681
never, ever would Dino Ruggeri
have done something illegal.

1120
01:29:33,081 --> 01:29:35,241
He was the most honest police officer that…

1121
01:29:35,281 --> 01:29:37,161
We are not accusing him of anything.

1122
01:29:37,961 --> 01:29:40,561
We just want to try to clarify.

1123
01:29:43,281 --> 01:29:45,361
What did you do tonight,

1124
01:29:45,401 --> 01:29:46,881
between 7 and 9.30 pm?

1125
01:29:52,761 --> 01:29:54,881
Are you just trying to clarify?

1126
01:29:59,161 --> 01:30:00,401
You are pathetic.

1127
01:30:01,161 --> 01:30:03,361
Answer, Franco, please.

1128
01:30:09,361 --> 01:30:10,561
I was running.

1129
01:30:11,881 --> 01:30:13,601
I got home to find my wife had

1130
01:30:13,641 --> 01:30:17,241
thrown me a surprise retirement party.

1131
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:21,388
There I learned of what had happened, from the Doctor.

1132
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:26,171
What time did you arrive at the party?

1133
01:30:26,681 --> 01:30:29,961
Doctor, if you want the
details, call me tomorrow at the

1134
01:30:30,001 --> 01:30:32,481
police station, or wherever
you want, and question me.

1135
01:30:32,521 --> 01:30:34,121
Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to

1136
01:30:34,161 --> 01:30:36,561
say hello to my brother who's down there.

1137
01:30:36,601 --> 01:30:37,841
He doesn't fuck with me.

1138
01:31:09,361 --> 01:31:10,361
Yes?

1139
01:31:11,081 --> 01:31:13,961
I came here to say

1140
01:31:14,001 --> 01:31:19,081
that I still trust the fishman's word.

1141
01:31:22,001 --> 01:31:23,561
I'm going home now,

1142
01:31:23,601 --> 01:31:25,641
and I wait for the delivery.

1143
01:31:28,161 --> 01:31:30,441
I'm so sorry for your friend.

1144
01:31:31,961 --> 01:31:32,961
Thank you.

1145
01:32:24,561 --> 01:32:27,521
Ma'am, you can't pass.
The road is blocked.

1146
01:32:27,561 --> 01:32:28,841
I'm sorry, officer.

1147
01:32:28,881 --> 01:32:30,601
Excuse me, I'm just...

1148
01:32:32,081 --> 01:32:34,441
I'm a relative of agent Dino Ruggeri.

1149
01:32:34,481 --> 01:32:36,401
The boy behind here is his son.

1150
01:32:37,281 --> 01:32:39,721
I learned that he was
injured in an accident.

1151
01:32:39,761 --> 01:32:41,041
We came right away.

1152
01:32:41,081 --> 01:32:43,121
Commissioner Sarno called me, told

1153
01:32:43,161 --> 01:32:45,441
me I was authorized to come here.

1154
01:32:45,481 --> 01:32:47,241
However, I didn't understand much.

1155
01:32:47,281 --> 01:32:49,241
- Let me go and see.
- Wait.

1156
01:32:49,281 --> 01:32:51,041
I'm very worried.

1157
01:32:51,081 --> 01:32:52,161
They are slippers.

1158
01:32:52,201 --> 01:32:54,041
There is a relative of agent Ruggeri, she seems

1159
01:32:54,081 --> 01:32:56,481
to have been called by Commissioner Sarno.

1160
01:32:56,521 --> 01:32:57,761
Do I let her pass?

1161
01:32:57,801 --> 01:32:59,841
Thank you, officer. Very nice.

1162
01:32:59,881 --> 01:33:01,641
Ma'am, you can't pass.

1163
01:33:06,481 --> 01:33:07,481
Hey.

1164
01:33:08,281 --> 01:33:10,281
Did you wake up, baby?

1165
01:33:11,161 --> 01:33:13,841
I want to go home, I want my bed.

1166
01:33:13,881 --> 01:33:15,441
But how?

1167
01:33:15,481 --> 01:33:18,961
Did you know that sleeping
in the car is a crazy adventure?

1168
01:33:19,881 --> 01:33:21,361
Like real superheroes.

1169
01:33:21,401 --> 01:33:23,961
There are no superheroes who sleep in cars.

1170
01:33:24,001 --> 01:33:25,241
So what do you think Batman

1171
01:33:25,281 --> 01:33:28,281
never fell asleep in the Batmobile?

1172
01:33:30,081 --> 01:33:32,721
Ernesto, let's do something.

1173
01:33:32,761 --> 01:33:36,041
You stay here, I'll be there

1174
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:38,040
and back in a flash, like Wonder Woman.

1175
01:33:38,081 --> 01:33:39,081
All right?

1176
01:34:02,281 --> 01:34:03,281
Love?

1177
01:34:04,281 --> 01:34:06,081
Is that Dino's body?

1178
01:34:11,081 --> 01:34:13,281
Turn around, I'm here.

1179
01:34:15,761 --> 01:34:18,921
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- I'm afraid, Franco!

1180
01:34:22,401 --> 01:34:23,401
We...

1181
01:34:24,881 --> 01:34:26,561
we must do something,

1182
01:34:26,601 --> 01:34:28,641
or end up like Dino too.

1183
01:34:45,481 --> 01:34:47,281
Honey, you have to leave it to me.

1184
01:34:47,321 --> 01:34:50,041
They lock us into this sooner or later.
Did you understand?

1185
01:34:50,081 --> 01:34:53,281
Look at me.  What are you doing?
Nobody catches you.

1186
01:34:56,001 --> 01:34:58,401
But how can I do without you?

1187
01:35:08,081 --> 01:35:11,201
You know it's the only way, tell me where I am.

1188
01:35:12,881 --> 01:35:14,081
C'mon honey.

1189
01:35:15,681 --> 01:35:17,441
Do you see at the end of the tunnel?

1190
01:35:17,481 --> 01:35:19,081
There is a bridge.

1191
01:35:21,161 --> 01:35:22,481
Yes, I see.

1192
01:35:26,881 --> 01:35:28,121
Before all?

1193
01:35:28,801 --> 01:35:30,161
I told you.

1194
01:35:34,561 --> 01:35:36,241
What do you want to do?

1195
01:35:36,281 --> 01:35:37,481
What do I have to do?

1196
01:35:40,481 --> 01:35:41,881
Soon they find them.

1197
01:35:43,561 --> 01:35:46,881
It doesn't mean we have
to let everything go like this.

1198
01:35:47,561 --> 01:35:48,561
No.

1199
01:35:49,561 --> 01:35:50,761
No.

1200
01:35:50,801 --> 01:35:51,801
Please.

1201
01:35:54,801 --> 01:35:57,081
Can you give me some hope, my love?

1202
01:36:27,201 --> 01:36:29,001
What a scene!

1203
01:36:37,281 --> 01:36:40,641
In my opinion, a crazy photo comes from this bridge.

1204
01:36:40,681 --> 01:36:41,681
No?

1205
01:36:43,601 --> 01:36:45,761
If they catch you, they'll kick your ass.

1206
01:36:50,361 --> 01:36:53,121
Look, I'll try.

1207
01:36:53,161 --> 01:36:55,481
If the cops come by, will you give me a shout?

1208
01:36:56,601 --> 01:36:58,481
All right. Hurry up.

1209
01:37:11,681 --> 01:37:12,801
Here?

1210
01:37:24,001 --> 01:37:27,561
The first to call was a police station from Porta Ticinese,

1211
01:37:28,401 --> 01:37:32,281
and at the Moscova they have
a service Alfa, a white Giulietta.

1212
01:38:09,681 --> 01:38:13,601
Among the people, there is one in civilian clothes.

1213
01:38:22,881 --> 01:38:25,601
I know him, yes. He's burnt.

1214
01:38:26,481 --> 01:38:29,041
There was one man, they moved him.

1215
01:38:29,081 --> 01:38:30,441
Investigated before the Expo, for

1216
01:38:30,481 --> 01:38:33,361
laundering loot withone of our people.

1217
01:38:33,401 --> 01:38:36,241
They killed ours, not even a scratch on him.

1218
01:38:36,281 --> 01:38:38,441
- What is his name?
- Attili.

1219
01:38:38,481 --> 01:38:39,681
Lieutenant.

1220
01:38:46,281 --> 01:38:47,281
Excuse me.

1221
01:38:55,281 --> 01:38:58,321
- You need to turn off the fucking flashlight.
- What?

1222
01:38:58,361 --> 01:39:00,081
Turn off the fucking flashlight.

1223
01:39:00,121 --> 01:39:02,041
How do I find it without light?

1224
01:39:02,081 --> 01:39:03,641
Franco, there is water.

1225
01:39:03,681 --> 01:39:05,281
Will I come back with mask and tube?

1226
01:39:05,321 --> 01:39:07,521
Come back, we're screwing up.

1227
01:39:07,561 --> 01:39:09,561
No. Franco, listen to me.

1228
01:39:09,601 --> 01:39:11,081
Where did you throw them?

1229
01:39:12,361 --> 01:39:14,081
- In the middle.
- In the middle?

1230
01:39:15,481 --> 01:39:16,481
In the middle of...

1231
01:39:17,481 --> 01:39:18,481
In the middle.

1232
01:39:47,601 --> 01:39:49,041
Was it here?

1233
01:39:49,081 --> 01:39:51,241
I see you, do you see me?

1234
01:39:51,281 --> 01:39:52,281
Get down!

1235
01:39:52,881 --> 01:39:54,761
Is it here? - No, further.

1236
01:39:54,801 --> 01:39:56,041
How much further?

1237
01:39:56,081 --> 01:39:57,961
- A few steps.
- More specific.

1238
01:39:58,001 --> 01:39:59,441
How many meters?

1239
01:39:59,481 --> 01:40:02,361
Four, five, what do I know?

1240
01:40:02,401 --> 01:40:03,601
Four or five?

1241
01:40:05,241 --> 01:40:10,041
One two three four...

1242
01:40:10,081 --> 01:40:11,081
and five.

1243
01:40:12,961 --> 01:40:15,281
- Was he here?
- Get down!

1244
01:40:16,201 --> 01:40:17,441
They should be there.

1245
01:40:20,801 --> 01:40:22,521
- Run away, my love.
- What is it?

1246
01:40:22,561 --> 01:40:24,521
- They're coming for them.
- Who?

1247
01:40:24,561 --> 01:40:25,641
The Chinese. Go away.

1248
01:40:27,201 --> 01:40:28,201
Viviana, go away.

1249
01:40:29,481 --> 01:40:31,081
No. Franco, I'm almost there.

1250
01:40:31,121 --> 01:40:32,561
I beg you, go away.

1251
01:40:32,601 --> 01:40:33,841
Wait!

1252
01:40:33,881 --> 01:40:35,161
There they are.

1253
01:40:36,001 --> 01:40:37,761
They're behind you, hurry up!

1254
01:40:37,801 --> 01:40:40,281
There is something here.  I found them, love!

1255
01:41:37,881 --> 01:41:39,081
He stays with me.

1256
01:41:52,081 --> 01:41:53,721
No!  No!

1257
01:41:57,281 --> 01:42:00,121
- I'm sorry, Franco.
- Let it be. He gets into the car.

1258
01:42:00,161 --> 01:42:03,281
- There are still those waiting for me.
- Don't go home.

1259
01:42:04,881 --> 01:42:07,601
Drive on the ring road and don't stop.
I'll call you.

1260
01:43:11,201 --> 01:43:12,601
Beautiful love...

1261
01:43:15,561 --> 01:43:17,601
Will you tell me what you're thinking?

1262
01:43:21,001 --> 01:43:23,801
That man had dad's shoes.

1263
01:44:40,601 --> 01:44:41,761
Did he fall asleep?

1264
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:45,131
Yes. He cried a lot and
then collapsed like a stone.

1265
01:44:50,681 --> 01:44:52,441
Darling, you'd better leave now.

1266
01:44:52,481 --> 01:44:53,601
Take him to his grandparents.

1267
01:44:53,641 --> 01:44:55,761
- Do you hear? I'm in Puglia.
- Yes where?

1268
01:44:55,801 --> 01:44:57,841
In Spongano, small village in Puglia.

1269
01:44:57,881 --> 01:45:01,161
Dino told me that his
grandmother was a seamstress.

1270
01:45:02,161 --> 01:45:03,721
Everyone knows her.

1271
01:45:05,361 --> 01:45:06,361
These here...

1272
01:45:08,481 --> 01:45:10,161
we must forget them.

1273
01:45:10,201 --> 01:45:11,961
As if they weren't there.

1274
01:45:12,001 --> 01:45:13,561
- Did you understand?
- Yes.

1275
01:45:14,161 --> 01:45:15,281
Relax.

1276
01:45:16,201 --> 01:45:17,201
What's up?

1277
01:45:20,801 --> 01:45:22,161
Nothing.

1278
01:45:22,201 --> 01:45:25,761
One told me I had to finish the
shift as if nothing had happened.

1279
01:45:26,481 --> 01:45:29,161
One watches bullshit on TV.

1280
01:45:29,201 --> 01:45:30,961
You're an idiot!

1281
01:46:02,881 --> 01:46:04,281
I recovered everything.

1282
01:46:07,881 --> 01:46:09,081
I am coming.

1283
01:46:18,081 --> 01:46:20,481
They said you wouldn't shoot.

1284
01:46:22,961 --> 01:46:26,801
In 35 years as a policeman,
he has never shot anyone.

1285
01:46:28,161 --> 01:46:30,441
You don't have to tell anyone.

1286
01:46:30,481 --> 01:46:31,721
Vivian?

1287
01:46:31,761 --> 01:46:33,521
Especially to your family.

1288
01:46:33,561 --> 01:46:36,001
We don't tell him anything.

1289
01:48:09,201 --> 01:48:10,521
Roll down the window.

1290
01:48:15,361 --> 01:48:16,801
He wakes up your partner.

1291
01:48:18,081 --> 01:48:19,881
Franco, please!

1292
01:48:23,561 --> 01:48:26,161
Get the guns and put them on the dashboard.

1293
01:48:28,961 --> 01:48:31,041
Show me your hands!

1294
01:48:34,961 --> 01:48:36,721
Throw the phones behind you.

1295
01:49:00,761 --> 01:49:02,281
Darnit...

1296
01:49:09,281 --> 01:49:10,841
Come up, Cosimo.

1297
01:49:10,881 --> 01:49:12,881
We have a quiet chat.

1298
01:49:15,601 --> 01:49:18,001
Bro, park.
We have a drink inside.

1299
01:49:19,281 --> 01:49:21,441
I want to get some fresh air.

1300
01:49:55,681 --> 01:49:57,961
These cars are full of options.

1301
01:50:11,881 --> 01:50:13,881
We got into a mess, Franco.

1302
01:50:18,881 --> 01:50:19,881
However,

1303
01:50:20,801 --> 01:50:22,681
you must be calm, please.

1304
01:50:23,401 --> 01:50:24,401
Let me talk.

1305
01:50:27,081 --> 01:50:30,561
Because, in my opinion,
you're going a little too crazy.

1306
01:50:37,801 --> 01:50:38,801
Me...

1307
01:50:41,881 --> 01:50:44,481
I am sorry.
But what happened, happened.

1308
01:50:49,481 --> 01:50:51,121
Believe me, I swear.

1309
01:50:52,281 --> 01:50:54,561
I am really very sorry

1310
01:50:55,481 --> 01:50:58,001
about what happened to your colleague.

1311
01:50:59,761 --> 01:51:02,681
But I swear I have nothing to do with it.

1312
01:51:59,481 --> 01:52:00,481
Franco...

1313
01:52:03,601 --> 01:52:06,361
Franco, for God's sake...

1314
01:52:17,201 --> 01:52:18,961
They kill us both.

1315
01:52:20,874 --> 01:52:22,000
Let's go.

1316
01:53:01,681 --> 01:53:02,921
It starts.

1317
01:53:06,561 --> 01:53:08,201
Franco knew nothing.

1318
01:53:11,481 --> 01:53:12,481
On the contrary...

1319
01:53:15,081 --> 01:53:18,241
we chose him because we
were sure he wouldn't react.

1320
01:53:22,001 --> 01:53:23,881
Everyone considers him a weakling.

1321
01:53:28,081 --> 01:53:29,401
One who doesn't shoot.

1322
01:53:30,961 --> 01:53:32,121
There, I said it.

1323
01:53:35,081 --> 01:53:37,801
The carabinieri, my cousin,
Tito Russo, went there.

1324
01:53:40,681 --> 01:53:42,561
With whom he maintains relations.

1325
01:53:45,081 --> 01:53:47,881
And I informed him of the shipment.

1326
01:53:52,601 --> 01:53:53,601
Finish.

1327
01:53:57,601 --> 01:53:59,801
The idea came from his son-in-law.

1328
01:53:59,841 --> 01:54:01,961
Bullshit! I'll fucking kill you!

1329
01:54:02,001 --> 01:54:05,481
What's on your mind?
You don't know what you are doing.

1330
01:54:05,521 --> 01:54:06,561
Take him away!

1331
01:54:06,601 --> 01:54:10,961
But did you hear what he said?
Bullshit! This idiot talks bullshit.

1332
01:54:12,881 --> 01:54:15,561
His son-in-law told us that he was

1333
01:54:15,601 --> 01:54:17,961
dying and that he would take control of Milan.

1334
01:54:18,001 --> 01:54:20,121
And then, I checked with my cousin.

1335
01:54:22,401 --> 01:54:24,721
I only acted as an intermediary, I swear.

1336
01:54:37,281 --> 01:54:38,281
Zhang Zhu...

1337
01:54:42,401 --> 01:54:43,921
Please forgive me.

1338
01:54:43,961 --> 01:54:44,961
Please.

1339
01:54:48,081 --> 01:54:51,481
Franco, tell him something
to calm things down.  Please.

1340
01:54:52,761 --> 01:54:56,481
Here are the names and
numbers of the other two accomplices.

1341
01:54:57,681 --> 01:55:00,361
A corrupt carabiniere
from the Moscova barracks

1342
01:55:00,401 --> 01:55:03,041
and Tito Russo, his cousin, a 'ndragheta.

1343
01:55:03,080 --> 01:55:06,782
If you hurry, you can find them
in front of his jewelry store.

1344
01:55:07,121 --> 01:55:09,641
I'll let you sort out your family problems.

1345
01:55:09,681 --> 01:55:10,681
My diamonds?

1346
01:55:14,081 --> 01:55:16,801
I have the diamonds, Mr. Zhang.

1347
01:55:19,561 --> 01:55:20,801
And I keep them.

1348
01:55:21,481 --> 01:55:24,441
I told you I didn't want
people with guns in the car.

1349
01:55:25,761 --> 01:55:29,681
The shooting was your fucking guard's fault.

1350
01:55:30,801 --> 01:55:32,361
I'm keeping them, Mr. Zhang.

1351
01:55:33,881 --> 01:55:37,241
Anyway, sooner or later
I get caught for this story.

1352
01:55:37,281 --> 01:55:40,561
They take away my pension,
they put me in San Vittore.

1353
01:55:40,601 --> 01:55:44,361
My wife and daughter need to stay calm.

1354
01:55:46,601 --> 01:55:48,921
They also take away my best friend's pension,

1355
01:55:49,881 --> 01:55:52,361
who died tonight.

1356
01:55:53,881 --> 01:55:56,561
I need the diamonds, I
have to take care of his son.

1357
01:55:56,601 --> 01:55:58,361
I have to raise him, he's still small.

1358
01:56:00,681 --> 01:56:02,361
But above all, for once,

1359
01:56:03,681 --> 01:56:07,441
I want the satisfaction of being like Robin Hood.

1360
01:56:08,161 --> 01:56:11,441
I steal from a rich man to
give to a poor bastard who

1361
01:56:11,481 --> 01:56:15,041
has had the ambition to be
an honest person all his life.

1362
01:56:16,481 --> 01:56:19,161
Now, if you don't mind,

1363
01:56:20,161 --> 01:56:22,441
I still have an hour of work left.

1364
01:56:22,481 --> 01:56:23,681
Take care, Cosimo.

1365
01:56:24,481 --> 01:56:25,481
Franco!

1366
01:56:26,401 --> 01:56:29,361
Franco, don't leave me here.
They will kill me!

1367
01:56:29,401 --> 01:56:31,601
How dare you look my cousin in the face?

1368
01:57:16,881 --> 01:57:19,041
32, from the Puma 103.

1369
01:57:20,001 --> 01:57:22,401
I see you, Puma 103.

1370
01:57:23,401 --> 01:57:26,161
All patrols listening from Puma 103.

1371
01:57:26,201 --> 01:57:28,521
I'm the assistant chief Franco Amore.

1372
01:57:28,561 --> 01:57:32,081
I wanted to say hello to all colleagues,

1373
01:57:32,681 --> 01:57:35,801
thank them sincerely,
and tell you that this...

1374
01:57:36,561 --> 01:57:39,561
it is my last radio message,
my last communication.

1375
01:57:41,001 --> 01:57:43,001
In fact, I finish today

1376
01:57:44,481 --> 01:57:48,161
thirty-five years of honorable
service in the state police.

1377
01:57:50,881 --> 01:57:54,241
I even wrote a speech, but I'm saving it.

1378
01:57:54,281 --> 01:57:55,721
It will be for another time.

1379
01:57:57,001 --> 01:58:00,961
Today is a very special day for

1380
01:58:01,001 --> 01:58:02,881
me because, as you all know...

1381
01:58:05,681 --> 01:58:08,361
we have lost our colleague Dino Ruggeri.

1382
01:58:09,201 --> 01:58:11,881
A worthy colleague, an honest man...

1383
01:58:14,081 --> 01:58:16,401
a family man, a friend,

1384
01:58:18,561 --> 01:58:21,361
a civil servant, one of us.

1385
01:58:26,281 --> 01:58:29,561
I wish everyone good luck

1386
01:58:29,601 --> 01:58:31,081
and a bright future.

1387
01:58:33,201 --> 01:58:36,361
From Puma 103, last step and out.

1388
01:58:36,401 --> 01:58:37,401
Thank you all.

1389
01:58:38,601 --> 01:58:43,481
This is Vanessa, Gino and
Carla from the operations center.

1390
01:58:44,401 --> 01:58:48,561
We all wish you the best.
Dino will always remain in our hearts.

1391
01:58:50,081 --> 01:58:51,641
Romans wheel!

1392
01:58:52,561 --> 01:58:57,201
Franco, you have been an
older brother, a guide to all of us.

1393
01:58:58,081 --> 01:59:01,201
Colleagues, let's all turn on the sirens,

1394
01:59:02,001 --> 01:59:03,121
for our Dino.

1395
01:59:04,161 --> 01:59:05,841
A big hug, Franco.

1396
01:59:07,761 --> 01:59:09,841
39, at Puma 103.

1397
01:59:11,961 --> 01:59:14,401
What do you think, that we will miss you?

1398
01:59:16,161 --> 01:59:17,441
I better shut up.

1399
01:59:18,201 --> 01:59:19,921
We say hello from San Siro.

1400
01:59:19,961 --> 01:59:22,641
We are at Ticinese with
the Garibaldi unit.

1401
01:59:22,681 --> 01:59:24,601
An affectionate hug, Franco.
