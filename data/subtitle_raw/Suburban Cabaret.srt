1
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,420
Well, well!

2
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,780
Come out!

3
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,260
Come out!

4
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,420
Come out, we've been caught.

5
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:09,620
Do you not know that according to police regulation 17391 you're not allowed to sleep in public in vienna?

6
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,380
The Grand Hotel wouldn't take us im afraid.

7
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,860
Identification papers.

8
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,060
Here you go.
Identification papers.

9
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,860
Here you go.

10
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,580
My diplomatic passport.

11
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:25,700
This is a military draft notice! I'll take you with me to the barracks.

12
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,020
Then we'll have to pass through Prater.
Piece of cake.

13
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,660
Let's go.

14
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,940
Ah, New Program Mr. Ebeseder!
Is she pretty?

15
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,660
Come on now, let's go, let's go

16
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,140
Good Morning Mr. Ebeseder.

17
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,860
Don't you have to enlist?

18
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:18,860
Mind your own business Mr. (unintelligible). The rehearsal started a while ago. If i was you i wouldn't have come at all

19
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,740
What would you do in my place? I have a sense of obligation.

20
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,380
If you could play the piano as good as you are cheeky,

21
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,900
you'd be the (name unintelligible)

22
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,980
Look, dont hurt yourself.

23
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,500
In the military you're going to be<i> this</i> small again.

24
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,300
So who was the new notes?
My sister Mizzi, now move along.

25
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,580
Good morning Mr.

26
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,180
So where are the new notes, Miss Mizzi?

27
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,180
Yes, I'm getting them Mr. Karl.

28
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,420
Thank you, little one.

29
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,420
You're Welcome.

30
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,140
The most important thing for me is the drum roll Mr. Conductor.

31
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,140
Yeah yeah i know already. (name)

32
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,420
So, and you Ms Mizzi?

33
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,260
What?

34
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,260
What about you?

35
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,460
Nothing.

36
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,820
What, you still haven't decided?

37
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,380
Decided.

38
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,300
I'll be decided alright.

39
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,500
If it was up to me..

40
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,220
But you already know.

41
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,300
Come on! Don't always tempt me like this.

42
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,780
But it's a pity.

43
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,460
A big pity.

44
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,060
God. You with your talent.

45
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,900
You must be very successful.

46
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:01,780
Yeah?

47
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,100
You think so?

48
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,100
Oh now you're starting again.

49
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,500
So, what do you say Mr. Pianist?

50
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,340
Such a sweet, pretty Girl. Not just because she's my sister. 

51
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,220
She could have a baron on each finger,

52
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,260
but no, she's hanging on to a guy who is a nobody and has nothing.

53
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,060
Oh stop it already about Josef.

54
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,580
He's just not like that.

55
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,860
He's a thoroughly decent person.

56
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,380
You understand?

57
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,300
Josef.. yeah.

58
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,940
So only the architectural draftsmen are decent people..

59
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,220
Us artists are not.

60
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,180
There he goes again.

61
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,500
This is how it is,

62
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,460
He loves me and i love him and we're getting married.

63
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,380
So?

64
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,180
So!

65
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,540
And you can say whatever you want, it wont change anything!

66
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,300
You can turn yourself upside down, but it wont change anything either!

67
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,860
Let's go, my solo!

68
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:52,460
Because of an architectural draftsman i'll turn myself upside down.. I'll turn him upside down!

69
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,140
I could choke him!

70
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:00,300
<i>I am a real viennese</i>

71
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,380
<i>from sunny Namur</i>

72
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,620
<i>full of humanity, i am</i>

73
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,100
<i>That's my nature</i>

74
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:45,620
Yes?

75
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,980
Hard at work!

76
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,980
My god, Father!

77
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,220
Did something happen to mother?

78
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,020
What..

79
00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:00,380
Nothing's wrong. I came because i wanna be there when you're accepted!

80
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,580
Sit down, father.
Yes.

81
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:05,860
My god!

82
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,860
When i think back to the time..

83
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,340
when i was called into draft.

84
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:17,140
And how the - whatchamacallit - called out, 'fit for service!'

85
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,460
That was a transcending moment.

86
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,540
How's mother?
Thank you. Good. And she says hello.

87
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,260
Thank you.

88
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,100
She's scared, that poor one.

89
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,340
That they're taking you to the military.

90
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,020
Theres people like that too.

91
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,140
She just doesn't know anything about life.

92
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:49,860
I was offered permanent employment for these construction plans yesterday.

93
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,220
Yeah? Congratulations.

94
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,420
Congratulations.

95
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,540
Very nice.

96
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,700
Very-

97
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,940
I don't understand any of it but..

98
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,740
very nice.

99
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,420
Mr. Father.

100
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,260
I do want to go to the military,

101
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,420
but-

102
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,540
Mizzi!

103
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,500
Oh oh.

104
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,140
She's a sweetie
Right?
A sweetie!

105
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,500
I'll go get her dad, okay?

106
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,740
Yes! Why not.

107
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,820
Mizzi!
Josef!

108
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,300
I've been waiting for you all day.

109
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:31,820
Yeah?

110
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,340
Yes

111
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,300
Come, i have something to tell you.

112
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,340
What is it?

113
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,060
My dad is here.

114
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,500
Oh dear.

115
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:48,940
I'm scared.

116
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:49,900
But he likes you.

117
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,780
Yeah because he doesn't know me.

118
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,140
But he just saw you at the window!

119
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,860
He has very good eyes.

120
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:56,660
Mizzi.

121
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,140
Today i'll tell him, that we both..

122
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,940
If he says yes i'll give him a huge kiss.

123
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,460
Really! I'll kiss him.

124
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,700
He'd like that.

125
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,500
But Josef.

126
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:14,980
Yes?

127
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,100
But..

128
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,740
Theres one more thing i want.

129
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,460
Yes?

130
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,140
Well..

131
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,340
The benefit..

132
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,780
I really want to perform there.

133
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,620
Oh please.

134
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,540
Just once.

135
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,020
Look, one time is no time. (Once wont hurt)

136
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,140
One time is a hundred times.

137
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,140
Mizzi we've discussed this.

138
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,780
Are you with them or are you with me?

139
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,100
with you.

140
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,100
Only with you.

141
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,020
Come. Let's go see my dad.

142
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,100
Yes.

143
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,140
Hello, Miss. I'm the father.

144
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,260
Well!

145
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,220
You don't have to be scared of me.

146
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,540
I'm just the father!

147
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,060
I..
I'm not scared.

148
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,700
I'm so happy to meet you.
The pleasure is all mine. 2x

149
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,540
I didn't think you were such go-getter.

150
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,060
Go-getter, dad?

151
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,180
I like her.

152
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,220
Well why are you telling me!

153
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,860
Why is he telling me? he should be telling you!
Am i right?

154
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,100
He tells me too.

155
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,660
Yeah? Look at that!

156
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:44,300
I always thought he's like.. he's.. he's like our mother.

157
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,940
Always working, always serious,

158
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,860
A young person needs to have a life! Do some partying!

159
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,780
A little umph!

160
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,860
You should've seen me when i was his age.

161
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,380
Oh my.

162
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,780
Oh look, how he's getting red.

163
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,140
Shy head over heels!

164
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,060
My little 'pepe' , when you have to leave to the military,

165
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,100
a small love affair like this is no sin.

166
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,460
What sin are you talking about father? 

167
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,660
We want to get married.

168
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,700
Oh.

169
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,460
Well

170
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,620
Well..

171
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,300
First you have to focus on serving your three years.

172
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,780
The reason i came was because you're supposed to get assessed today.

173
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:33,140
I wasn't prepared for an engagement.

174
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,140
So there we have it.

175
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,420
He doesn't like me.

176
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,100
"He doesn't like me" on the contrary.

177
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:43,100
I like you very much, but..

178
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,020
it's about his mother.

179
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,300
Oh his mom?

180
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:51,980
Not to be henpecked.. but at the end of the day, she is the boss.

181
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,420
I was planning on writing her anyway,

182
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,140
to ask her to let Mizzi live in the house while i'm in the military.

183
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,100
What?

184
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,900
But theres still plenty of time..

185
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,820
until i know if they'll take me or not.

186
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,820
Hello, Hello gentlemen.

187
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,460
Hello, Franz.

188
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,700
What do you want now?

189
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,660
Oh please. Don't get so upset again.

190
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,060
You know it's bad for your beauty.

191
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,820
You have a new brooch, Sophie.

192
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,660
This one?

193
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,300
I've had this one for a while.

194
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,300
I dont know that brooch..

195
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,300
where did you get it?

196
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,260
Hello Ms. Director.

197
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,300
I'm picking up Franz, we're going to the barracks.

198
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,620
Let's go Franz.

199
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,620
That brooch..

200
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,020
is worth at least 12 Gulden.

201
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:05,940
Oh come on.

202
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,300
He's always so economical. Always calculating, always calculating.

203
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,700
But he got that from you Ms. Ebeseder, right?

204
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,500
You're the same way.

205
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,420
Wheres Mizzi?

206
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,220
A seam popped on her dress.

207
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,340
Where (else) would she be?

208
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,060
It's a misfortune, that love.

209
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,860
Mizzi is a true folksinger child. 

210
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,860
This wont end well.

211
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,420
But it's her first love..

212
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,180
I think it's cute.

213
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:36,460
Come on Franz-y we have to go now. The generals must be waiting on us.

214
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,820
See you Ms. Director, we'll be back soon.

215
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,660
How did you get 12 Gulden?

216
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,380
Oh stop it already. Come.

217
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:47,780
Well, well.

218
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,100
I'll go now.

219
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,580
I'll wait for you..

220
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,300
I'll wait for you.. in the barracks.

221
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:53,860
At Rennweg (Street)

222
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,500
Rennweg, of course Rennweg.

223
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,540
What yard?

224
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,980
Yes, check which one you're in.

225
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,700
Probably the third. 

226
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,980
Third yard.

227
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,860
I knew that.

228
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,380
940

229
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,020
940, yes.

230
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,580
See you.
See you.

231
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,500
What was that you said earlier? You want to send me to your mom?

232
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:46,900
Yes.

233
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,100
Why?

234
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,220
I won't leave you with your people.

235
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,500
They wont influence me.

236
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,940
But you know what they want to turn you into.

237
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,460
You have to understand.

238
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,460
They think as a folk singer i am somebody.

239
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,700
You're here for me,

240
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,820
and not for the guys your brother hangs around with.

241
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,820
If i come home with a folksinger for a wife..

242
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,540
People in the countryside won't understand.

243
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,860
If i have to join the military now..

244
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,340
Three years.

245
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,860
What then?

246
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:24,900
Then?

247
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,940
What do you think is gonna happen then?

248
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,620
You'll forget me.

249
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,580
Oh please.

250
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:33,700
Betray me.

251
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,980
Josef!

252
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,100
Look.

253
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,700
I won't forget you.

254
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,060
And i won't betray you.

255
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,180
And i love you.

256
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,900
661, 662, 663, 64, 65.

257
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,660
One ostrich feather please, they took him.

258
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,660
646

259
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,860
647

260
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,740
648

261
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,580
649

262
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,620
650!

263
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,540
My number mom!

264
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,740
651!

265
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:51,580
692, 693, 694, 695

266
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:57,380
696, 697, 698, 699

267
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,140
700!

268
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,580
Hey Miss!

269
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,500
What regiment are you with, hm?

270
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,140
You wan't something?

271
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,140
Come on, it was just a joke.

272
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,940
881 to 86.

273
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,940
Move it!

274
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,660
Don't get riled up Mr. Uncle.

275
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,060
Do i look like an uncle?

276
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,220
I'm Sorry.

277
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,500
Quiet. Get inside.

278
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,580
Bravo, Bravo.

279
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,580
Gotta be strict, gotta be strict.

280
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,980
We also had to ---

281
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,940
Why are you here? Are you a recruit too?

282
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,260
That'd be nice..

283
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,060
but where did the time go.

284
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,780
I'm here with my son, my boy.

285
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,780
Today.. He's joining today.

286
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,620
Yes.
Today you'll take him. Absolutely.

287
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,900
I myself served 12 years.

288
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,020
Yeah?
Active 12 years,

289
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,060
twenty six-er ---

290
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,380
Cigar?
Thank you.

291
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,540
You're welcome.

292
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,100
887 to 890.

293
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,300
Hello Ms.
Hello.
Hello.

294
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,780
Your boy is going in too?

295
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:23,940
Yes. Yes.

296
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,540
Hopefully they take him.

297
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,780
They'll accept mine for sure.

298
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,780
A handsome boy. Two heads bigger than me! 

299
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:33,980
Two heads!

300
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,020
And when you hear him speak..

301
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,020
you wouldn't even believe that he's my..

302
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,260
my son.

303
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,140
(unintelligible) The skin is so stubborn.

304
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,220
He grew up in Berlin.

305
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,740
17 Years, he was there (with his aunt?)

306
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,660
As child, she invited us once, so we drove there with my wife.

307
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,420
And she didn't let him leave. She made him study, and..

308
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,820
that's why he lost our dialect completely.

309
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,180
Completely.

310
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,180
But it's okay.

311
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,660
We'll teach him again, we'll.. we'll teach him again.

312
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,140
Look at that girl over there.

313
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,620
My word!

314
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,980
The pretty ones are always taken huh?

315
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,740
Sadly.

316
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,300
Your brother's coming.

317
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,300
Hello! 

318
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,100
Here we are.

319
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,780
Always making himself important.

320
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,700
Like a rooster on a pile of dirt.

321
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,660
Oh please,

322
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,660
You and your problems with artists.

323
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,980
I really don't get it.

324
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,980
Artist.

325
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,980
Oh look the brother-in-law! Let's not even look at them.

326
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,220
Respect Mr. Oberleutnant.

327
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,220
Gentlemen.

328
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,220
Sophie!
Mr. Oberleutnant.

329
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:48,460
Thank you, thank you, thank you. Can i introduce you, Baron von Daffinger - these are the famous ---
Franz Ebeseder!

330
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,580
Yeah. So, you're scared already huh!

331
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,820
Scared! What should i be scared of! the military is my life!

332
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,460
Mr. Oberleiter. I brought you a program.

333
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,180
Our program for today, here you go.

334
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,860
You'll have a great time. Wonderful, Mr.

335
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,860
Maybe bring (the mayor?) along too.

336
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,580
Oh my, It's Mizzi!

337
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,460
I didn't even notice her!

338
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,380
Mr. Oberleiter we're singing a couplet.

339
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,940
'My old lady won't find out'

340
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,940
749, 750

341
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,300
So who's that girl?

342
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,820
That's my sister.

343
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,300
Is she also being drafted?

344
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,780
He's always joking!

345
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,740
That was a good one.

346
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,900
Who did she come here with?

347
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,660
Yeah if you dont mind, who's she with?

348
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,420
Well she's actually not here with anybody, that's just a friend.

349
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:40,540
Not even a friend it's just a distant relative.

350
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,340
Not even. More like barely a relative, really, nothing more.

351
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,020
Oh come on.

352
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,020
But pretty!

353
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,460
Very pretty!

354
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,660
But he's not pretty.

355
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,660
I was talking about her!
Oh her.

356
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,900
Very pretty, that one.

357
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,500
Yeah well she's my sister isn't she.

358
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,500
Is she performing too?

359
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,500
We're not sure yet.

360
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:02,860
If she'll be there we're going to have to come to the show for sure.

361
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,620
Mr. Oberleutnant, bring the whole reigment along. Would you do that?

362
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,980
We'll have seats ready for you.

363
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,420
You'll have a great-

364
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,420
You'll really have a great time. You'll see.

365
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:18,860
36, 37, 38, 39, 940.

366
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,140
940.

367
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,140
That's you. And..

368
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,220
Don't forget..

369
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,980
I'll always love you.

370
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,860
Bye.
Bye.

371
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:40,860
So?

372
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,300
Mizzi.

373
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,620
I wanna introduce you to the Leutnant.

374
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,180
Why?

375
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,780
Don't even say anything.

376
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,660
He just told me he really likes you.

377
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,580
Yeah?

378
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,820
Are you scared of Josef again?

379
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,220
Nothing worse than a jealous man.

380
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,780
That's just how he is.

381
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,620
But that Leitner.. He's a fine guy.

382
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,620
Noble, rich, a baron.

383
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,100
He's everything.

384
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,420
And not to mention, he's Josef's superior.

385
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,380
Oh? Josef's?

386
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,420
Yes! That's why i'm telling you, he's the right one.

387
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,820
He already moved out.

388
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,300
But they didn't let him in.

389
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,380
If we have luck. Toi Toi.

390
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,340
I'm keeping my fingers crossed.

391
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,460
Yes?

392
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,380
Gentlemen.

393
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,260
This is my friend Mizzie.

394
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,340
Ladies.

395
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,740
Leutnant von Daffinger.

396
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,020
Ebeseder Mizzi

397
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,620
That name obliges.

398
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,980
Your brother told us that you're performing, dear Miss.

399
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:36,500
Me?

400
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,860
That's not true.

401
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,340
But!

402
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,780
But what are you saying!

403
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,060
She's just shy.

404
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,740
Come on.

405
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,620
Can we be there when you celebrate your debut?

406
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,260
No.

407
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:45,740
Why?

408
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,500
Yes.

409
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,980
She's just kidding.

410
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:49,940
You're stupid.

411
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:59,060
Unfit for the final time, because of Malnutrition.

412
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,540
So what is it? Are you fit for duty?

413
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,740
What were you laughing about with them?

414
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,100
Forget about them. Are you fit?

415
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,340
So! What is it? fit?

416
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,940
Dad, warm greetings to mom.

417
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,060
I'm fit.

418
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,260
You're fit..

419
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,860
Wonderful. Come here.

420
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,820
I knew it. I knew it all along.

421
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,820
Wait here, i have an ostrich feather for you.

422
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,460
So this is how it's going to be when im not here.

423
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,340
How. how. how does it look?

424
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,020
I saw the way he was looking at you, the officer.

425
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:38,020
How's that my fault! I cant prevent people from looking at me.

426
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,420
Don't be so childish.

427
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,580
Remember what i told you earlier?

428
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,900
You already forgot, huh?

429
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,340
Mizzi for my sake, please..

430
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,620
Go stay with my mom.

431
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,420
Stay at our place.

432
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,980
Come here.

433
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,140
I'm gonna buy one for me too.

434
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,740
Mizzi.

435
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:16,980
Go to my mom.

436
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,780
Well..

437
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,460
Fine.

438
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,260
I'll go.

439
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,380
Now i'm calm Mizzi.

440
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,700
Now i'll gladly become a soldier.

441
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,140
Hello Kids.

442
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,860
Come here with me.

443
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:25,660
I expect you all to have memorized the song by wednesday.

444
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,540
Go on now.

445
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,580
Go eat your lunch.

446
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,780
My spoon fell..

447
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,780
My spoon fell in.

448
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,340
How about that.

449
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,340
Well when we're done eating we'll find it.

450
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:49,540
Oh it has (milk?) i don't like that. No. I don't want that. 

451
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,820
I don't like it with milk.

452
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,580
Why dont you make a.. a potato soup?

453
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,460
Hello.
Hello.

454
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,420
Mother.

455
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,020
This is Mizzi.

456
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:28,780
Yes?

457
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,380
Sit down.

458
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,180
Give it to her.

459
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,540
Thank you.

460
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,340
Well..

461
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,700
Eat.

462
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,140
Go ahead.

463
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,900
All aboard!

464
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,940
All aboard!

465
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:50,860
Hey you.

466
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,460
I'm so..

467
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,740
Since today i have you..

468
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,620
I can't say it.

469
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,620
Get out.

470
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,660
Josef said to say hello, mother.

471
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,500
Wow.

472
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,380
My performance clothes.

473
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,740
My mom packed it for me.

474
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:11,460
Did you know i was supposed to perform once?

475
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,460
With the folksingers i mean.

476
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:48,060
Now ladies and gentlemen, our main attraction.

477
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:51,340
It's gotten fuller again. I'm happy that more of you came.

478
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:55,900
I'm happy that you all came.

479
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,900
Some of you have brought your wives, and others have brought something better.

480
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:04,700
Ladies and gentlemen, what does a real viennese need?

481
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,860
Money!

482
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,180
Yes money, we all need money.

483
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:10,300
But if he doesn't have it, what does he need to have more than ever?

484
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,140
Ladies and gentlemen, Humor!

485
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,100
That's why i dont have to say anything more to introduce..

486
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:19,300
Sophie Weidling and Franz Ebeseder. Viennas favorites.

487
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,140
Music!

488
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,380
Oh that's my job.

489
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:33,460
<i>Theres no girl in love that doesn't envy me.</i>

490
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:37,340
<i>You've spoken to and broken the hearts of already almost a hundred.</i>

491
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:40,980
<i>But i belong to you, and i swear to you, that you are my world.</i>

492
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:45,660
<i>Because you are so -- today, as real viennese.</i>

493
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:49,860
<i>Oh Sophie, Oh Sophie, what are you doing to me.</i>

494
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:53,740
<i>I am just a man, who can't control himself.</i>

495
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:57,620
<i>Oh Sophie, Oh Sophie, prepare your mouth for a kiss.</i>

496
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:01,700
<i>You are like a passionate, a very passionate</i>

497
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,420
<i>You get involved with me</i>

498
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,060
<i>I have all i need.</i>

499
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:08,820
<i>Oh Sophie, Oh Sophie, what are you doing to me!</i>

500
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:12,620
<i>I am just a man, who can't control himself.</i>

501
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:16,260
<i>Oh Sophie, Oh Sophie, tell me how and when,</i>

502
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,220
<i>Sophie!</i>

503
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,420
<i>I am but only a man.</i>

504
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,140
Too bad Mizzi is not here.

505
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,620
Oh please.

506
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,660
Oh, Mr. Baron.

507
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:13,580
It doesn't matter, she knows what's going on.

508
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,740
I'm sure she'll like you too.

509
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,300
You think so?

510
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,940
I could swear on it!

511
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,460
Yes..

512
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,340
When is she supposed to come back?

513
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,540
When is she supposed to come back, well..

514
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,500
Franz!

515
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,980
My utmost..

516
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,980
Respect, Mr. Oberleutnant.

517
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,740
Compliments, Mr. Baron.

518
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:34,620
Franz, how much longer is Mizzi supposed to wait outside?

519
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,340
3 Years.

520
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,820
3 Years?
Yes.

521
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,900
But we could get her back of course.

522
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:41,380
Yes.

523
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,340
If you could do that..

524
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,740
We can, we can.

525
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:45,900
Well then let's do it.

526
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,860
You see, she wants to rejoice the baron by doing it, right?

527
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:51,180
Yes of course if i can gratify the baron, of course i could..

528
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:54,020
Of course i could. But you see if i leave here,

529
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,060
every day would cost me..

530
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,460
Atleast..

531
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:58,940
If not more.

532
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,060
Yes, colossal. 

533
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,740
A piece of gold, because around here i'm colossally..

534
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:03,740
liked.

535
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,780
I am the.. And i..

536
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:06,620
What's..

537
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,660
She's coming.

538
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,660
I'm her brother after all.

539
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,300
<i>A love song..</i>

540
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:24,980
<i>In the country, where flowers bloom</i>

541
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:30,620
<i>They sing longingly and with all their heart</i>

542
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:36,060
<i>The blackbirds from Lichtental</i>

543
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:40,860
Did you hear them?

544
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:43,180
The kids are already singing along.

545
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:52,900
Mizzi.
Yes?

546
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,140
You.. You're here with upstanding farmers.

547
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,740
Not with a bunch of comedians.

548
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,140
but..

549
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,460
Go home.

550
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,500
The air is good here.

551
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:22,260
The food is good.

552
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:28,140
The people here are especially good, one could congratulate them.

553
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,220
Oh be quiet.

554
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,340
Josef wanted this.

555
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:33,260
Oh Josef?

556
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:34,500
Well..

557
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:37,100
He's more important to you than your art.

558
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:43,660
When a female artist has big success in vienna..

559
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,740
She'll have her own carriage within no time.

560
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:49,220
Everybody knows her and greets her.

561
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:52,980
Everyday theres something about her in the paper, she receives flowers.

562
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:55,780
Gentlemen kiss her hand.

563
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:04,660
But of course the air in Krems..

564
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:06,220
is a lot better.

565
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:08,500
Right?

566
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:27,980
So?

567
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:29,940
I'll drive with you.

568
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,700
I need to talk to Josef.

569
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:32,740
So, what up?

570
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,060
Was Josef reasonable?

571
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:38,540
I couldn't even ask the superiors to talk to Josef.

572
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:39,980
Well..

573
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:41,220
You know what?

574
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:45,860
 You'll just write Josef tomorrow after you've performed. He wont be able to do anything then.

575
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:47,860
But he wont like that.

576
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,260
Oh so what, come on now.

577
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:54,060
Salute, continue.

578
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:57,060
Infantry Kernthaler!

579
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:57,580
Here!

580
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:00,340
Come clean Mr. Feldwebel's shoes with your brush.

581
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:01,300
Aye-Aye Sir.

582
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:06,540
Hand me that program.

583
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:13,580
..the performance of the nightingale from vienna, Mizzi Ebeseder

584
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:17,300
The Ebeseders are supposed to have a good program.

585
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:22,180
Look at that.

586
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:24,780
You can't even clean shoes.

587
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:27,340
And you claim to be an educated person?

588
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:28,900
Let's go.

589
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,500
Continue.

590
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:57,380
Let's go, go, go. Begin. Mariska is todays opening performance.

591
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:59,100
Miss Mariska, are you ready?

592
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:01,660
Don't annoy me. I'm always ready.

593
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:03,180
Go, Go.

594
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:31,620
Good Evening. Can he come in?

595
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:35,180
Of course! Walk right on in Mr. Baron.

596
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:39,340
I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me, i'm on duty.
Aw that's too bad.

597
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:41,260
Bye.
Bye.

598
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:43,300
See you.

599
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:53,100
Can i go say hello?
Of course Mr. Baron.

600
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:56,340
Excuse me.
Oh please. Go on, go on.

601
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:01,380
This way Mr. Baron.

602
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:05,220
Mizzi, the Baron is here.

603
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:06,420
I dont know any Baron.

604
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:07,220
Come in.

605
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:10,580
Oh, it's you Mr. Leutant.

606
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:13,020
Goodbye! oh.

607
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:15,300
I just wanted to wish you luck!
Why?

608
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,140
For tonight.
Oh.

609
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:19,060
What do you mean, luck! Dear God.

610
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:22,780
My God. You're supposed to say break a leg.

611
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:24,500
Oh right.

612
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:28,620
You want anything?

613
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:32,100
You have to excuse me, i'm extremely nervous.
Oh please.

614
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:35,140
Why don't you sit- Sit down.

615
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,500
Yes, well.. Break a leg.

616
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:40,860
Oh please.

617
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:42,140
Thank you.

618
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:49,820
Miss Mizzi. I've been thinking about you a lot.

619
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:51,660
About me?

620
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:53,700
Don't you have anything else to worry about?

621
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:57,220
My bad, of course you don't have anything else to think about.

622
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:59,300
Tell me, Miss Mizzi,

623
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:02,300
Couldn't you like me just a little bit.

624
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,620
Of course! Why not.

625
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:08,220
Because i was thinking, if the both of us, you and me..

626
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:13,980
A profession of love?
Yes.

627
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:16,300
Well.. Break a leg.

628
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:19,740
Oh, pardon. I have to get changed.

629
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:21,340
Excuse me. I'm leaving already.

630
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:25,820
See you. And please don't be mad at me for acting this way.

631
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:27,780
I hope you'll enjoy the performance.

632
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:39,020
Come here, ladies and gentlemen!

633
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:43,540
You'll be amazed! You've never seen anything like this before!

634
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:18,820
Another bouquet for Mizzie from the Leutnant.

635
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:21,340
He's so rich.
But it's for nothing.

636
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:24,100
She's engaged!

637
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:41,580
They're raving!
A very fine and intelligent audience today.

638
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:48,300
Can you hear the thunder?
Come on let's go.

639
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:49,420
Shows over.

640
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:50,900
What a bunch of vermin.

641
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:54,980
Go on out! Let's keep going.

642
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:56,420
Sigh.

643
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:00,180
Hold this.

644
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:06,660
It can only go downhill after our performance,

645
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:08,140
watch how they'll tank.

646
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:13,420
Where's Mizzi?

647
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:16,820
You forgot to say Good Evening.

648
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:18,100
I want to know where Mizzi is.

649
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:19,700
She's staying here for now,

650
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:21,620
she still belongs here for now.

651
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:25,700
But i don't want to be with a folk singer who gets passed around.

652
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:27,700
What! Who get's passed around?

653
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:32,940
--- It's Mizzi i want to marry.

654
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:35,180
And she's supposed to stay good. She'll go rotten on me.

655
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:38,140
She's earning her money respectfully with a good family.

656
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:39,740
No one's rotten.

657
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:51,900
Well..

658
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:55,460
Now i look just like you.

659
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:28,220
Pretty, isn't she?

660
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:34,220
Well.. All she wants is a thank you

661
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:37,460
Adieu.

662
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:43,940
What's so bad about singing a few songs,

663
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:46,140
please let me.

664
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:48,660
Let me?

665
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:50,460
You know i love you.

666
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:52,420
Mizzi, i can't love you like this. Like..

667
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:56,580
Oh forget him. He doesn't understand, because he's not viennese.

668
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:00,820
What did you expect from a foreigner from Krems?

669
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:02,380
Mizzi i beg you.

670
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:04,980
Forget about the theatre, you'll go astray.

671
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:07,580
But Josef, am i not allowed to earn my own bread?

672
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:09,500
So why don't <i>you</i> pay her fee?

673
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,300
Then you can forbid her whatever you want.

674
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:15,740
A good person wouldn't hold on to a girl while he's being drafted.

675
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:18,900
Don't listen to him Josef. Look.

676
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:24,620
Mizzi i want to tell you something.

677
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:26,540
You won't perform here.

678
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:28,420
But it's too late-
Learn to work first.

679
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:32,180
How are you going to learn what work is in this place? from him?

680
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:34,500
The guy who's being taken advantage of by his lover?

681
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,620
How dare you. Say that again.

682
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:38,500
You cheeky bastard.

683
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,300
Out!

684
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,260
Or i'll choke you.

685
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:46,500
I've been waiting for this.

686
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:48,660
To get my hands on you.

687
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:51,460
Give it a rest!

688
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:53,740
Josef don't listen to him. Listen to me, Josef.

689
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:55,660
Ladies and Gentlemen.

690
00:53:55,660 --> 00:54:01,740
As you know, today we are celebrating Mizzi Ebeseders first appearance.

691
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:07,860
She'll be singing and dancing a pretty marsh for you.

692
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:10,020
She's an artist now.

693
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:13,060
Yes. I'm an artist now.

694
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:16,460
Mizzi, for the last time.

695
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:18,980
Are you staying with me, or with them?

696
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:20,780
Of course with you..

697
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:24,300
With you, with you. Where to with you Josef?

698
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,260
It's not like i can live in the barracks with you.

699
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:29,780
Look Josef, please think about it. Theres no other way.

700
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:32,220
It's ringing already.

701
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:36,780
I swear on my love for you,

702
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:39,420
if you get on that stage now,

703
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:41,660
we're over.

704
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:45,460
What am i supposed to do Josef? I'm not made for the countryside.

705
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:47,380
Singing is all i know.

706
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:50,260
I have to work Josef. I have to earn my living somehow.

707
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,380
Well then.

708
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:54,860
Please.

709
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:56,700
Go then.

710
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:58,420
Go then!

711
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:00,780
Oh.

712
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:04,500
It's that easy for you?

713
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:08,060
Fine.

714
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:16,540
Mizzi stay here, stay here, or it's really all over.

715
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:17,780
It's over then.

716
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:20,140
Arguing and preaching, that's your love.

717
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:22,340
I won't let you torment me anymore.

718
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:24,220
And just so you know,

719
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:26,340
standing out there and singing is beautiful,

720
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:27,740
blissfully beautiful,

721
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:31,180
and theres nothing bad about it, and it's honest work.

722
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:34,020
It's just as honest to make people laugh,

723
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:36,180
as it is threshing corn on a field.

724
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:37,140
That's that.

725
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:38,980
Now i'm leaving.

726
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:41,300
Adieu, Josef.

727
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:08,020
<i>Always pretty and cheerful,</i>

728
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:11,820
<i>with fists (?) and trumpets ---- marching</i>

00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:18,900
<i>with fists and trumpets ---- marching</i>

730
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:22,420
<i>Just a little further</i>

731
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:25,820
<i>until the great fortune comes and makes life great again.</i>

732

00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:32,620

<i>As long as the (?) marches to music,</i>

735
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:39,580
<i>the world can never end!</i>

736
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:48,300
I respectfully ask to report myself.

737
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:49,060
Why?

738
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:50,660
Because i left the barracks illegaly.

739
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:53,260
(6 Weeks?) barracks-arrest.

740
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:54,900
You can step down.

741
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:57,020
Recruits!

742
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:58,220
At ease. (Step down.)

743
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:13,700
I have to talk to him.
Miss Mizzi!

744
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:15,500
You can't go in the barracks!

745
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:31,820
You.

746
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:34,980
Kernthaler. Please get Kernthaler for me.

747
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:37,060
Kernthaler, a lady here for you.

748
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,900
I have to talk to you.

749
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:45,740
Theres nothing left to talk about.

750
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:48,300
Scratch his eyes out if you want.
Silence!

751
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:49,660
What is it?

752
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:51,660
Let's make up.

753
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:52,900
Don't put on a show.

754
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:56,580
I have to talk to you Josef.

755
00:57:57,660 --> 00:57:59,420
Can you send these guys away?

756
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:02,140
You don't have to tell me anything. I wont believe you anymore.

757
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:05,260
Look, Josef.

758
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:08,780
If i didn't love you so much, i wouldn't be here.

759
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:12,460
Please. Please, come tonight. Okay? 
No.

760
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:14,660
Go on singing all you want,

761
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:17,220
getting flowers from all those guys.

762
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:19,180
You think i can bare it?

763
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:23,020
Having to think about it every night, how she has to be friendly with him just because he's a good guest.

764
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:25,860
While i have to sleep on hay, not able to leave the barracks.

765
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:28,100
I don't want it anymore.

766
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:30,540
But it's not like that, Josef.

767
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:32,140
Let me explain.

768
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:34,380
No no. You won't reel me in again.

769
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:36,820
Go back to where you came from.

770
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:38,300
You'll be just fine.

771
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:40,900
That's how it is with you.. you,

772
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,340
Folk singers.

774
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:16,740

780
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:29,020
Move it. Move it.

781
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:32,340
Hold on. I wont let you rush me.

782
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:36,460
Is she going to be singing the --- song too?
Yes.

783
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:37,380
Yes?
Oh yes.

784
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:39,340
Because i composed it.
Oh!

785
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:40,940
Next one please.
Goodbye.

786
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:45,980
What's wrong.. Miss Mizzi?

787
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:49,780
Miss Mizzi..

788
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:52,140
What's wrong?

789
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:56,820
Oh come on. Everything's gonna be alright.

790
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:57,900
Come on.

791
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:02,460
You'll go on stage, and sing, and be happy again, and..

792
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:03,500
Come on!

793
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:33,980
<i>and no stranger knows</i>

<i>in a small house.</i>

796
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:53,260
I ordered a table at the wine press.

797
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:56,260
I hope Mizzi will show up.

798
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:58,140
Of course she'll come.

799
01:00:58,140 --> 01:00:59,540
I know it.

800
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:05,540
Mizzi is performing.

801
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:07,980
You see! Can't be that much longer now.

802
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:14,820
<i>in the early morning</i>

Please.

818
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:10,740
A herring, but not too sweet please, okay?

819
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:12,180
Sit.

820
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:14,900
Well, Mizzi?

821
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:18,180
Well, Miss Mizz.

822
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:20,540
The teacher composed my song.

823
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:22,180
Oh really?
Yes.

824
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:24,980
Did you like it?
Yes, very beautiful. Very.

825
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:26,980
I came all the way from Krems to be here.

826
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:34,700
So.. What's new in Krems?

827
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:37,340
What could there be new in Krems.

828
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:40,300
The boys in my singing class still annoy me.

829
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:43,820
And on Wednesday there's the big concert from the men's choir.

830
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:45,060
I'll be conducting again.

831
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:48,820
Good Evening, Mr. Baron.

832
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:50,300
Good Evening.

833
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:51,780
Mr. Baron, do you have any wish?

834
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:53,660
Well, Miss Mizzi, what will it be?

835
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:54,980
What do you want to hear?

836
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:56,100
('My Mother'?) please.

837
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:57,620
My Mother.
Or no,

838
01:04:57,620 --> 01:04:58,740
Play 'Die Amsel' (The Blackbird)

839
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:00,020
The Blackbird!

840
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:01,940
The Blackbird!, Mr. Baron. Very well.

841
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:02,940
The Blackbird!.

842
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:37,140
Cheers!

843
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:44,900
Sophie, something for the soul?

844
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:46,540
Of course something for the soul.

845
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:21,580
Stop.

846
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:24,140
Stop!

847
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:26,780
Over!

848
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:32,220
No sad songs.

849
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:36,940
No ones crying here.

850
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:47,020
Come here.

851
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:48,580
What's going on, Mizzi?

852
01:07:54,740 --> 01:07:55,340
What's this!

853
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:46,140
Miss Mizzi.

854
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:48,220
Yes.

855
01:08:51,220 --> 01:08:53,780
I'm alone with you for the first time today.

856
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:56,180
Yes.

857
01:08:58,780 --> 01:09:00,020
I want to be alone..

858
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:01,620
with you.

859
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:04,100
I already know.

860
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:07,660
You know a small place closeby.

861
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:10,140
We'll just drink a bit of wine.

862
01:09:11,140 --> 01:09:14,300
You won't touch me, you just wanna look in my eyes.

863
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:18,620
And after an hour you promise to take me home.

864
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:22,700
Am i right?

865
01:09:22,980 --> 01:09:24,100
Mr. von Daffinger

866
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:28,140
Then at least call me Fritz.

867
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:28,860
Yes?

868
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:33,420
I want us to remain good friends.

869
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:36,820
Fritz.

870
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:37,860
Franz!

871
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:40,460
Hello lads! Hello.

872
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:43,460
Come drink with us, on brotherhood.

873
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:45,140
May i introduce you to..

874
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:48,420
We already know each other Mr. Kernthaler!

875
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:51,540
So let's drink, the three of us.

876
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:54,020
Excuse me, one more liter please.
One liter please.

877
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:56,300
Cheers lads!
Cheers!

878
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:59,300
Cheers!
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

879
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:02,300
You go first, you go first.

880
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:13,060
Hold on.

881
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:22,340
Folk singer, huh?

882
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:24,620
What do you take me for?

883
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:27,020
He's taking you for a fool, Kernthaler!

884
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:30,500
Tell me, Kernthaler, did you hear my new couplet, 'My old lady won't find out'?

885
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:33,780
'My old- ..Yes. Mansfeld sang it.

886
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:35,180
My couplet?
Mansfeld.

887
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:36,500
But Kernthaler.

888
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:38,780
My couplet?

889
01:10:39,580 --> 01:10:43,900
But she always performed as captain.
Like a colosseum. 
No,

890
01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:46,300
Over at ---street, up there.

891
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:50,460
I can't think of it at the moment. It's on the tip of my tongue, she performed as captain.

892
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:52,380
Those were seaman songs.

893
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:53,700
She mainly sang those.

894
01:10:57,620 --> 01:10:59,140
<i>Over there, i see</i>

895
01:10:59,140 --> 01:10:59,900
<i>A riff.</i>

896
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:01,940
<i>Ship.
Riff.
Ship.
Riff.</i>

897
01:11:01,940 --> 01:11:02,500
<i>Riff!</i>

898
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:05,580
But it doesn't matter, ship or riff.
It does matter. It does!

899
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:08,780
A ship doesn't matter,

900
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:10,820
But a riff!

901
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:15,260
They'll shatter if they hit it.
Kernthaler is right. Kernthaler is right!

902
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:20,460
Cheers!
Wait!
This ones to..
To 'pepe' (Josef's nickname)

903
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:24,900
They locked him up!
Can't tell him nothing, that pepe.

904
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:26,620
Until they locked him in.

905
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:30,660
The wine is good.

906
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:40,060
I don't need a ---

907
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:04,260
If you don't have any rythm, as folk singer..

908
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:05,660
then i'm sorry for you!

909
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:08,300
that you don't have any rythm.

910
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:11,780
I have to leave.
It's only 3 o'clock!

911
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:17,740
My train leaves at 3:45.

912
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:19,740
You're scared of your old lady, huh!

913
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:23,980
I'm not scared, but.. but, i can't let her wait up.

914
01:12:23,980 --> 01:12:25,580
She's still the boss after all.

915
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:30,300
Let her go beg if she's hungry. Come on Kernthaler, sit back down.

916
01:12:49,220 --> 01:12:50,500
I have to go now.

917
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:54,140
---
You can take this with you.

918
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:03,820
This is unbelievable.

919
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:08,580
Where is this supposed to go when someone won't accept a bracelet with brilliants.

920
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:09,860
Where are we gonna go?

921
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:12,380
Who does she think she is?

922
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:13,060
You.

923
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:15,620
I already warned you.

924
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:18,140
I'm an upstanding person.

925
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:19,340
And i want to stay that way.

926
01:13:19,940 --> 01:13:21,740
---
But Josef is right.

927
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:24,060
A slut's place. I don't belong here.

928
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:25,220
I'm going.

929
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:27,580
Godspeed, and greet Krems(?) for me.

930
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:28,500
Oh you'll see.

931
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:33,060
Now you'll really get to know me.

932
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:35,300
This is for Josef.

933
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:38,540
And this is for Daffinger.

934
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:56,660
I only like Josef.

935
01:13:58,820 --> 01:14:01,100
I don't know how i'm gonna live without him.

936
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:04,860
Oh well.

937
01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:06,780
Oh well.

938
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:10,540
It's always the first.

939
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:14,780
<i>It's always</i>

940
01:14:15,260 --> 01:14:17,700
<i>the first</i>

941
01:14:18,380 --> 01:14:24,340
<i>who you can't forget.</i>

942
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:31,500
That Daffinger.

943
01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:34,740
He's a nice guy, but,

944
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:37,060
Josef,

945
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:39,460
i'd do anything for him.

946
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:41,580
Anything.

947
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:45,140
Oh Josef.

948
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:46,580
Kernthaler, Mr. Leutnant.

949
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:48,220
He's under barracks-arrest.

950
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:49,860
Theres no one else here.

951
01:14:50,780 --> 01:14:51,980
Yeah, they all went out.

952
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:55,540
I'll send him right over to Mr. Leutnant.

953
01:14:56,420 --> 01:14:57,140
Aye-aye Mr. Leutnant.

954
01:14:57,140 --> 01:14:59,260
Daffinger is very despaired.

955
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:01,580
He would've loved to go out with you today.

956
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:02,660
What's wrong with him?

957
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:03,940
Well i.. uhm..

958
01:15:05,180 --> 01:15:07,380
I don't know what it's called but, well..

959
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:08,620
Well, he's laying.

960
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:10,980
Why don't we go visit the poor guy?

961
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:13,540
Well, why not, right?
He'd be so happy.

962
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:16,020
Don't be upset but i don't go into appartments.

963
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:16,620
But..

964
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:18,540
But Mizzi, if he's sick..

965
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:19,620
Come on.

966
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:21,540
Of course!

967
01:15:21,820 --> 01:15:23,820
If he sees you he'll get better for sure.

968
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:25,420
You think so?

969
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:26,020
Of course.

970
01:15:26,020 --> 01:15:26,500
Well?

971
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:27,500
Why not.

972
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:34,220
I can assure you Mr. Feldwebel, our program is really first class.

973
01:15:34,220 --> 01:15:37,900
I personally, Frank Ebeseder, am singing the famous and already well known couplet,

974
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:39,820
'My old lady won't find out'

975
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:42,380
first class. first class.

976
01:15:42,380 --> 01:15:43,180
What about Mizzi?

977
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:44,260
She's not singing anymore?

978
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:46,180
Mizzi, Mr. Feldwebel, doesn't sing anymore,

979
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:49,300
but instead we have this new artist, and i can assure you,

980
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:55,620
she looks and acts like a.. like a venus, she looks! i'm not exaggerating.

981
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:04,140
I'll ask --- if he'll join us.

982
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:05,940
Very good Mr. Feldwebel, very good.

983
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:07,740
(Tomorrow your future begins?)

984
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:10,140
Oh, what an honor.

985
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:11,700
Brother in law, hm.

986
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:14,780
Now you did it. Now you can laugh at all us.

987
01:16:14,780 --> 01:16:15,780
Leave me alone, okay?

988
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:18,420
Well, Mizzi moved in with you i assume.

989
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:19,820
What?

990
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:25,420
When you give up your job out of love to such a beautiful man..

991
01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:27,660
What? What are you talking about?

992
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:29,620
Quit being so offended all the time.

993
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:31,540
We should be offended!

994
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:35,180
Her crazy love for you is what led to this.

995
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:38,900
Mizzi leaving her parents home and quitting her career.

996
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:40,700
Now we're ruined!

997
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:43,580
We're totally ruined.

998
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:45,020
Brother in law.

999
01:16:58,100 --> 01:16:58,780
See you.

1000
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:02,220
Mr. Feldwebel.
Yes?

1001
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:03,820
I respectfully ask for a big favor.

1002
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:04,340
Yes?

1003
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:06,420
Can i leave the barracks for one hour?

1004
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:08,300
No way. You're on barracks-arrest.

1005
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:10,140
Can't you give permission Mr. Feldwebel? 

1006
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:11,420
I need to talk to somebody.

1007
01:17:11,820 --> 01:17:13,260
I'm sorry, Kernthaler.

1008
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:29,860
Set the table in the meantime.

1009
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:31,300
But make it look nice.

1010
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:34,180
You'll find everything you need in that drawer.

1011
01:17:34,540 --> 01:17:35,740
At your command Mr. Leutnant.

1012
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:42,580
And when you're getting the wine, bring some nice flowers for the table too.

1013
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:44,140
Yes Mr. Leutnant.

1014
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:49,580
What do you do for work anyway?

1015
01:17:49,580 --> 01:17:51,220
Architectural draftsman, Mr. Leutnant.
Oh?

1016
01:17:51,220 --> 01:17:52,620
Why aren't you a one-year then? (military)

1017
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:54,860
My folks are farmers, they don't think it's necessary.

1018
01:17:56,460 --> 01:17:59,340
Put your service revolver away, it doesn't belong here.

1019
01:17:59,740 --> 01:18:01,660
Because i'm expecting a lady.

1020
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:06,260
A very beautiful one,  by the way.

1021
01:18:07,060 --> 01:18:08,940
I'm sure Mr. Leutnant has the right taste.

1022
01:18:08,980 --> 01:18:11,340
Well, it's not exactly easy with her.

1023
01:18:11,740 --> 01:18:13,580
And you? What about you?

1024
01:18:13,740 --> 01:18:14,860
Don't you have a girl?

1025
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:16,260
Had, Mr. Leutnant.

1026
01:18:16,660 --> 01:18:18,580
But then things drifted apart,

1027
01:18:19,740 --> 01:18:21,260
and now i'd like to get her back.

1028
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:26,340
Could i please respectfully ask Mr. Leutnant, to take a one hour break from my arrest.

1029
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:27,620
Oh wee.

1030
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:30,460
Okay, fine, I'll take responsibility.

1031
01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:32,460
Now go and get the wine,

1032
01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:34,940
you can come in later,

1033
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:37,380
and then go get your girl.

1034
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:38,500
Tell her i said hello.

1035
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:40,500
I respectfully thank you, Mr. Leutnant.
It's okay.

1036
01:19:31,460 --> 01:19:33,900
Come on. Don't make a scene.

1037
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:36,220
Mizzi!
He'll be so happy.

1038
01:19:56,860 --> 01:19:58,340
Walk on in, ladies.

1039
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:01,940
There he is.

1040
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:18,540
Oh, Miss Mizzi.

1041
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:21,460
I'm so happy you came.

1042
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:28,780
I knew right away that this was a hoax.

1043
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:31,020
You're not even sick.

1044
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:31,940
Yes he is!

1045
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:33,860
He's sick with heartache.

1046
01:20:36,180 --> 01:20:37,700
Are you angry, Miss Mizzi?

1047
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:38,940
No.

1048
01:20:39,220 --> 01:20:40,100
I'm leaving.

1049
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:41,060
Oh no.

1050
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:43,180
15 Minutes. Please.

1051
01:20:43,620 --> 01:20:45,300
I didn't expect this from you.

1052
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:46,820
But we never had a chance to be alone.

1053
01:20:46,820 --> 01:20:47,940
Not even one minute!

1054
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:49,620
As we shouldn't.

1055
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:51,740
But i can't talk when others are there.

1056
01:20:51,860 --> 01:20:53,780
So i needed a little white lie!

1057
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:54,780
You see.

1058
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:56,220
Was it that bad?

1059
01:20:57,300 --> 01:21:01,060
Miss Mizzi, you have no idea how happy i am that you're here.

1060
01:21:01,420 --> 01:21:03,900
Come on, let's take off your coat.
No, i'm already leaving.

1061
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:05,380
Look, i have to go.

1062
01:21:05,380 --> 01:21:06,420
But why!

1063
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:08,300
Look, i cant stay.

1064
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:11,980
But Mizzi.
No, i'm scared. Let me go

1065
01:21:14,860 --> 01:21:17,140
You can leave whenever you want.

1066
01:21:21,020 --> 01:21:22,780
You're a good guy, actually.

1067
01:21:36,860 --> 01:21:38,620
Mizzi, i like you so much

1068
01:21:39,380 --> 01:21:42,180
And i'm completely different from my friend Höfelmeyer.

1069
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:44,500
And i know that you're different from Sophie.

1070
01:21:46,180 --> 01:21:46,980
So!

1071
01:21:47,140 --> 01:21:50,260
Tell me, Mizzi. Can't you like me just a little bit,

1072
01:21:53,020 --> 01:21:54,300
I don't know.

1073
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:58,380
Maybe.

1074
01:21:58,660 --> 01:21:59,500
Yes?

1075
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:08,820
Do you want to be my wife?

1076
01:22:09,340 --> 01:22:10,180
Me?

1077
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:11,460
Why not!

1078
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:13,020
Or are you with someone else?

1079
01:22:13,660 --> 01:22:14,900
No one anymore.

1080
01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:33,300
And here's our goods,

1081
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:35,580
and here that window in the tower,

1082
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:37,300
that's where i stay.

1083
01:22:37,580 --> 01:22:39,340
I always stay there on vacation.

1084
01:22:40,260 --> 01:22:43,140
This whole forrest belongs to us.

1085
01:22:44,620 --> 01:22:47,620
You even have cows.
Yes, they all belong to us too.

1086
01:22:48,580 --> 01:22:50,500
And this here is a hundred year old tree.

1087
01:22:53,780 --> 01:22:58,100
Here's a picture of the old bridge. It was destroyed by a big storm last year.

1088
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:00,900
Now they're building a new, modern one.

1089
01:23:02,140 --> 01:23:05,980
In summer, when the corn is ripe, it's wonderful over there.

1090
01:23:09,180 --> 01:23:11,580
My father will be in for a surprise when you come.

1091
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:12,940
Yes.

1092
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:16,420
You'll have to get used to my mom though.

1093
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:28,740
Josef!

1094
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:32,860
Josef.. I..

1095
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:20,500
Hello!

1096
01:24:21,740 --> 01:24:23,500
Why did Mizzi run away?

1097
01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:27,780
Didn't work out either huh?

1098
01:24:30,460 --> 01:24:31,540
Bad luck.

1099
01:24:33,020 --> 01:24:36,500
First you spend weeks trying to charm her and then she wont even let you kiss her.

1100
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:37,900
You.

1101
01:24:39,380 --> 01:24:40,980
This girl is performing right now.

1102
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:43,940
She's wonderful, i'm telling you, wonderful.

1103
01:24:44,660 --> 01:24:46,420
I ordered two tickets for us.

1104
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:49,380
The bakery is really fantastic. fantastic.

1105
01:24:50,140 --> 01:24:51,100
Can i..

1106
01:24:51,660 --> 01:24:54,380
please ask to leave the barracks now.

1107
01:24:55,660 --> 01:24:56,860
Please.

1108
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:12,420
Why are you running?
Because i was a pighead!

1109
01:25:33,380 --> 01:25:33,860
You.

1110
01:25:34,940 --> 01:25:40,420
Come in, let's drink together. I have someone over.

1111
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:41,620
Thank you.

1112
01:26:34,420 --> 01:26:36,100
Leave me alone.

1113
01:26:36,220 --> 01:26:37,460
Give it a rest.

1114
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:41,540
You men are all the same.

1115
01:26:41,980 --> 01:26:45,820
You don't even make an effort to try and understand.

1116
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:52,300
I'm gonna be over you forever.

1117
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:54,380
Go on.

1118
01:26:54,780 --> 01:26:55,780
Please.

1119
01:27:26,860 --> 01:27:27,660
Miss Ebeseder.

1120
01:27:28,020 --> 01:27:30,060
Miss Ebeseder.. I.. Is Mizzi here?

1121
01:27:31,740 --> 01:27:33,020
No no, I..

1122
01:27:33,460 --> 01:27:34,220
Well, where is she?

1123
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:36,620
How should we know?

1124
01:27:37,940 --> 01:27:39,700
I thought she drove to you.

1125
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:40,860
To Krems.

1126
01:27:41,020 --> 01:27:42,740
No no, i just saw her earlier.

1127
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:45,820
If you don't know who else should?

1128
01:27:46,780 --> 01:27:48,340
We don't.

1129
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:52,100
Where should i look for her then?

1130
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:53,620
Try wherever you want.

1131
01:27:53,940 --> 01:27:55,860
But not here with us.

1132
01:28:10,860 --> 01:28:11,860
Mr. Kernthaler.

1133
01:28:12,580 --> 01:28:13,740
I know where Mizzi is.

1134
01:28:13,740 --> 01:28:14,980
Yes? Where!

1135
01:28:14,980 --> 01:28:16,060
In Hizing, with Sophie.

1136
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:17,540
In Hitzing with Sophie.

1137
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:20,140
Yes! If you hurry you can make the last (bus/train)

1138
01:29:13,300 --> 01:29:14,180
Mizzi!

1139
01:29:15,740 --> 01:29:16,740
Where is she?

1140
01:29:17,260 --> 01:29:19,300
She was just here, no?

1141
01:29:29,780 --> 01:29:31,940
Dear Josef.

1142
01:29:35,180 --> 01:29:38,180
I loved only..

1143
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:40,220
you.

1144
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:42,380
Mizzi.

1145
01:29:43,940 --> 01:29:45,420
Leave me alone!

1146
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:46,860
What!

1147
01:29:48,220 --> 01:29:49,380
What the!

1148
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:51,300
What in the!

1149
01:29:52,820 --> 01:29:54,300
She's gone crazy.

1150
01:29:54,740 --> 01:30:00,060
She'll do something to herself!

1151
01:30:29,860 --> 01:30:31,580
A bracelet with brilliants.

1152
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:34,140
That's an unhappy love.

1153
01:30:35,140 --> 01:30:36,420
I don't want it anymore.

1154
