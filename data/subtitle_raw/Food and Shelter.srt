FOOD & SHELTER

5
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:49,041
Okay, Rocio. So, you live alone
with your son in a rented flat, right?

6
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:54,457
How many months' rent are overdue then?

7
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:56,291
Eight months.

8
00:01:58,042 --> 00:01:59,832
How long have you been on the dole?

9
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:02,624
Three and a half years.

10
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:10,749
Rocio, do you have any relative
who can help you out?

11
00:02:11,792 --> 00:02:13,707
No, I don't have family.

12
00:02:15,792 --> 00:02:18,957
Are you receiving
any benefits at the moment?

13
00:02:20,417 --> 00:02:21,791
No, nothing.

14
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:27,124
So, you've no help from family,
and no benefits...

15
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,416
Rocio, what are you living on?

16
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:36,249
I hand out flyers a few times a month
and I get 20 Euros.

17
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,791
How old is your son?

18
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:44,707
Eight.

19
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,124
And with your son...
What did you say his name is?

20
00:02:49,917 --> 00:02:51,541
Adrian.

21
00:02:52,792 --> 00:02:55,666
And with Adrian,
any problems? Is everything fine?

22
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,582
Of course, everything's fine.
Why are you asking?

23
00:03:00,917 --> 00:03:05,582
Don't worry. It's just a formality.

24
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:17,541
Hello. Is he here already?
Crikey, with the morning I'm having.

25
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:24,791
Tell him I'm finishing up
with a girl now and I'll be on my way.

26
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,999
Right, Rocio, here's how it is...

27
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:34,374
As a single mother
and in the situation you're in,

28
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,541
on the one hand,
we can apply for a social wage,

29
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:44,291
which is 550 Euros a month for six months,

30
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:48,124
and on the other hand
we can apply for food stamps

31
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:51,666
which is another 120 Euros a month
for another six months.

32
00:03:52,792 --> 00:03:57,207
The problem is,
benefit payments are taking a long time.

33
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,332
Just to give you an idea:

34
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,999
The stamps are taking six months

35
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:06,249
and the social wage
can take anything up to a year.

36
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:12,666
That's the only thing
we can offer you from here.

37
00:04:17,542 --> 00:04:18,374
Hello.

38
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,082
What do you want me to do?
I can't be in two places at once.

39
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:31,791
Yes, that would be better.
Right. I'm coming.

40
00:04:33,542 --> 00:04:35,999
Sorry, Rocio, I have to go now.

41
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:42,082
The sheet I gave you,
you have to fill out the paperwork,

42
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,207
my number is on there.

43
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:50,249
Call me if you have any questions
and I'll see to you another day, okay?

44
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:56,707
Can I ask you a favour?

45
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:57,624
Sure.

46
00:04:57,917 --> 00:05:00,791
Could you photocopy my CV?

47
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,916
Of course. Come with me.

48
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,791
- Hi, Rocio.
- Hello.

49
00:05:14,917 --> 00:05:15,999
What crazy weather.

50
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,749
It rains,
then the sun comes out...

51
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,124
you can't keep
your hair nice in this weather.

52
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,999
I'll have to go to the hair salon again.

53
00:05:23,042 --> 00:05:24,082
Adrian!

54
00:05:24,417 --> 00:05:25,916
Dani!

55
00:05:26,042 --> 00:05:28,499
They picked us
to play for the school team.

56
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:31,916
That's my boy! And you too, Adrian?

57
00:05:32,042 --> 00:05:34,457
Yeah. And the Coach says
that we'll be playing against

58
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:37,207
another school on Sport's Day
at the end of the year.

59
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,666
Isn't that brilliant?

60
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:40,666
- Aren't you glad, mummy?
- Of course I am.

61
00:05:40,792 --> 00:05:44,582
But you know
I want you to study and get good marks.

62
00:05:45,542 --> 00:05:47,457
Adrian!

63
00:05:48,042 --> 00:05:48,999
What have I told you about puddles?

64
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:51,582
You'll get dirty!
Stop jumping in them!

65
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,374
Don't get angry, they're only kids.

66
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:54,874
Right, see you later.

67
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,082
Bye.

68
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,916
- Thanks.
- See you later.

69
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,041
Hello! What can I get you?

70
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:06,541
A loaf, please.

71
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,874
Can I leave you my CV?

72
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,707
Sure, leave it here.

73
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:25,499
I can do anything. Shop assistant,
cleaning, whatever you need.

74
00:06:28,917 --> 00:06:30,666
- Thanks.
- No problem.

75
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,582
Come on, Adrian.

76
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:52,624
Come on, let's get you home
and get those socks off you

77
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,541
before you catch a cold.

78
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,416
Goal!

79
00:07:15,542 --> 00:07:17,957
Adrian, stop playing and have a shower.

80
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,374
One match and I'll go.

81
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:34,249
Hi, how are you, pet?

82
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:36,291
Fine, same as always.

83
00:07:36,417 --> 00:07:38,957
- Where's your son?
- There, hooked on the game.

84
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,499
He's getting so big and handsome.

85
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,082
Listen,
I brought you a few croquettes

86
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,957
in case you want them for tonight.
I've just made them.

87
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,749
- There's no need, Maria.
- Go on, take them.

88
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,291
All this food just for me.

89
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:54,707
My husband, may he rest in peace,
loved his croquettes.

90
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,749
Well, thanks a lot.
I'll get dinner ready.

91
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,457
Listen,
I wanted to say something before I go.

92
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:03,582
A man came by
asking for you the other day.

93
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:06,582
A man asking for me?
What did he want?

94
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,207
I don't know.

95
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,957
He asked me if I knew you
and if you lived in the block.

96
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,124
He was a serious man
with a folder full of papers.

97
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,124
That's weird, well, I don't know...

98
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,707
Good evening...

99
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:21,874
Having a natter are we?

100
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,582
Hi Ani. How's your leg?

101
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:26,124
Oh, you know.
Some good days some bad.

102
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,666
Par for the course at my age.

103
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:32,457
I heard about your sister, how is she?

104
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,666
Waiting for the tests she needs

105
00:08:34,792 --> 00:08:37,416
but they haven't given her
an appointment until next month.

106
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:39,249
Things have gone to the dogs.

107
00:08:39,417 --> 00:08:41,541
Listen, my daughter's father-in-law...

108
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:43,999
he was sat
in the emergency hospital waiting room.

109
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,749
And that's where
they found him, poor man...

110
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,749
Don't tell me things like that,
it upsets me terribly.

111
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:53,374
All these cut-backs...
I don't know where we'll end up.

112
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,374
Sure, what do you expect
with all these thieving swines...

113
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,207
Come on.
I'll bring you good luck.

114
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:01,916
I've two tickets left
for tomorrow with number 83.

115
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,041
- Come on, one for each of you.
- No thanks.

116
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:08,874
Keep it. If you win,
you can sort out the electricity.

117
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,207
The look of those cables in that window...

118
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:14,499
It's provisional, woman,
until they come to fix it for her.

119
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:17,707
Go on, give them here.
I'll pay you tomorrow.

120
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:18,666
Good luck.

121
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:20,791
- I hope your leg gets better soon.
- Thanks.

122
00:09:20,917 --> 00:09:22,499
- Good night.
- Good night.

123
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,332
She doesn't miss a thing.

124
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,624
She's not a bad person,
just wants to know everything.

125
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,374
She's a real Mrs. Know-It-All...

126
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,499
Don't worry,
I'll pay for your electricity,

127
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,749
you can pay me back whenever you can.

128
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,291
Go on, keep one.
Fingers crossed we win.

129
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,291
And I won't hold you up any longer.

130
00:09:39,417 --> 00:09:43,582
You'll be wanting to get dinner.
I'm glad you're all right.

131
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,082
Good night.
See you Adrian!

132
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,499
- Bye, Maria!
- See you later.

133
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:11,249
"The squad trained by Vicente del Bosque
has already got the preparation stage

134
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:14,082
underway for the European Championship.
To ensure they are in top form...

135
00:10:15,417 --> 00:10:17,124
Adrian, dinner!

136
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,707
...being held in Poland and Ukraine
between June 8th and July 1st,

137

the 'Roja' is set
to play four friendly matches.

138
00:10:22,417 --> 00:10:26,082
The first will be on February 29th
in Malaga against Venezuela.

139

The team will face the remaining
three preparatory games in May...

140
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,291
on Austrian soil where
the team will face a 10-day session...

141
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,291
Hello?

142
00:10:35,417 --> 00:10:38,791
...the Spanish squad will face
Serbia and North Korea.

143
00:10:38,917 --> 00:10:41,207
Am I free?
I'm always free.

144
00:10:44,542 --> 00:10:46,249
What time?

145
00:10:46,542 --> 00:10:51,999
Okay, on time.
Bye!

146
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:56,832
Who was it?

147
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,832
The Marquess, some work tomorrow.

148
00:11:04,417 --> 00:11:06,166
Don't we have any chips?

149
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:09,041
We're keeping them
for Maria's croquettes tomorrow.

150
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,082
Aren't you eating?

151
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:15,332
I'm not hungry.
You eat up.

152
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,666
...this will also be the third European
Championship title for the Spanish

Football Federation's trophy cabinet
equalling Germany's record.

the Spanish team's position
as favourites for the title.

with a style of football
that sparks envy

158
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:37,166
and a goal scoring efficiency
that has their rivals trembling. "

159
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:57,207
Are you tired of not being able
to show off those muscly arms?

160
00:12:57,333 --> 00:13:02,791
The arms are a very important part
of our bodies, and to improve them,

161
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:07,332
we've created
the revolutionary Super weight.

162
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:10,457
Super weight
is the first product capable

163
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,666
of doing away with those flabby arms,

164
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,457
toning them up
and making them stronger.

165
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:39,416
Mum, are you getting up?
It's quarter to nine.

166
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,999
It's really late.
Quick, get dressed.

167
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:18,166
At last!
What happened to you today?

168
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,374
You never learn, do you?

169
00:14:21,542 --> 00:14:23,207
My kid is sick.

170
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,916
You always have an excuse.

171
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:29,457
Well, the next time your kid gets sick,
you know what you can do.

172
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,249
I'm telling you, he's really sick.

173
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:34,666
And today, don't go home until
you've handed out all the flyers.

174
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:38,291
I'll be back later.
And stop looking so miserable!

175
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,249
OFFER: 6 PACKS
OF SAUSAGES FOR 3 EUROS

176
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:55,207
Excuse me, do you know if they're
looking for anybody to work here?

177
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:57,541
I don't think there's anything going.

178
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:01,416
But if you hear about something,
can you let me know?

179
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:03,416
My boss runs the show.

180
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,874
Three ninety.

181
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,291
Look, here he comes.

182
00:16:17,417 --> 00:16:20,666
Hey! Listen! I saw you.
Drop what you're carrying.

183
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,749
Rocio!

184
00:17:32,792 --> 00:17:33,832
Rocio, open the door!

185
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,457
...the Minister stressed
that the only requirements...

186
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,249
Are you going to open up or not?

187
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,999
...has ensured that
by doing this, the banks...

188
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,999
Open the goddamn door!

189
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,916
...would be more solvent
and begin lending to households

190
00:17:47,042 --> 00:17:48,999
and as such, the Spanish people
would also reap the rewards.

191
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:50,416
Nobody takes the piss out of me.

192
00:17:50,542 --> 00:17:54,207
All in all, the bail out to the banks
will be calculated as public debt...

193
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:55,582
Open up!

194
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,416
You've no shame.

195
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:02,874
One of these days I'll grab the shotgun
and shells and then you'll see.

196
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:12,124
If you don't pay me the rent,
there's going to be trouble...

197
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:16,582
Do you hear me? There'll be trouble!
You'd better be careful what you do!

198
00:18:17,167 --> 00:18:18,582
You're going to pay.

199
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:20,582
You'll pay for this.

200
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:43,957
When are you going to pay him?

201
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,916
I have a job interview
this week for some work.

202
00:18:47,792 --> 00:18:49,749
Go on,
drink your milk before it goes cold.

203
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,332
I don't want anymore.

204
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,957
Can I sleep with you tonight?

205
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:00,666
Course you can.
That way we'll be warmer.

206
00:19:01,917 --> 00:19:03,916
Come on, let's get into bed now.

207
00:19:33,292 --> 00:19:34,249
Fuck!

208
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:13,582
Hi!

209
00:20:14,042 --> 00:20:15,582
Good afternoon, Madam.
Sorry.

210
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,041
Do you know
if Rocio Gomez Moreno lives here?

211
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:19,874
Yep.
She lives here.

212
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:21,957
- She has a small boy.
- Okay.

213
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,291
And do you know what time
I could find her at home?

214
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:26,916
She's usually around all the time.

215
00:20:27,042 --> 00:20:28,916
But like everybody,
coming and going all day.

216
00:20:29,417 --> 00:20:31,166
Do you want a ticket for the draw?
I have number 51.

217
00:20:31,292 --> 00:20:32,624
No, thanks, madam.

218
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,791
Good afternoon.

219
00:20:33,917 --> 00:20:35,749
Your loss.

220
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,624
Look, there's your friend Dani.
Give me a kiss.

221
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,041
Bye!

222
00:21:35,792 --> 00:21:36,874
- Hi, Rocio!
- Hi!

223
00:21:37,167 --> 00:21:38,874
Are you up for a spot of breakfast?

224
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,707
A few of the mothers have arranged
to meet in the bar on the corner.

225
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:42,999
I can't.
I must dash.

226
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:47,374
Now that I look at you properly.
Look at you...

227
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,541
All dolled up today.

228
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:51,999
No man could resist you
when you scrub up a bit.

229
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,374
Really, you think?

230
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,207
You better believe it.
Look at yourself.

231
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:59,666
You're a sight for sore eyes.
Go on, come for a coffee...

232
00:21:59,792 --> 00:22:02,499
I've a bit of gossip for you...
I met a Dad, cute and divorced.

233
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:05,457
Really, thanks anyway.
But I must dash. Another time.

234
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,457
As you wish.

235
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:27,249
LIMPIEZAS SHERRY S.L.
General cleaning services

236
00:22:35,167 --> 00:22:36,332
Hello, good morning.

237
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:41,874
The boss has just called to say he's had
a setback and he can't make it today.

238
00:22:42,292 --> 00:22:45,916
Apologies on his behalf and the interview
is postponed until another day.

239
00:22:46,792 --> 00:22:48,124
Another day, but when?

240
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,416
Wait, I hadn't finished.
I also have some good news.

241
00:22:51,917 --> 00:22:55,707
We're just about to close a deal
with a major supermarket chain

242
00:22:55,833 --> 00:23:00,166
and if both parties sign then
there'll be work for all of you.

243
00:23:00,958 --> 00:23:02,749
We'll be in touch real soon.

244
00:23:03,167 --> 00:23:05,416
Brilliant!
I hope they call us.

245
00:23:05,542 --> 00:23:10,124
So, thanks for coming and apologies
for the inconvenience. See you soon.

246
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:13,207
Good bye!

247
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,874
Who is it?

248
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,582
Is Alfonso there?

249
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,374
Is that you, Rocio?

250
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,707
Yes.

251
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,624
Well, he's not here now.

252
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,124
Not here?

253
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:55,249
Come on will you.
You talk to her and tell her yourself.

254
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:57,999
I'm not talking to her.
She can get lost.

255
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,416
Hang on, I'm coming down.

256
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:16,916
- Rocio...
- Hi.

257
00:24:17,042 --> 00:24:18,291
- Rocio, how are you?
- Fine.

258
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:23,332
Sorry about the other night.

259
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:25,999
Since he retired,
Alfonso has been really on edge.

260
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:27,541
I've come to tell him

261
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:30,624
that I'll be getting
some cleaning work soon almost for sure.

262
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,416
Yeah, but when, love?

263
00:24:32,542 --> 00:24:34,916
We've been like this for...
I don't know how long.

264
00:24:35,042 --> 00:24:39,707
I'm serious. I've been for an interview
and they'll call me back for sure.

265
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:41,416
It's out of my hands, Rocio.

266
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:47,124
My son was laid off as well
and he has two kids.

267
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:51,499
Things are brutal everywhere
and we need the cash.

268
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:53,791
You know the banks
don't let anything slide...

269
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,624
I have to go back upstairs.
I'm really sorry, I am, truly.

270
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:29,416
Hello.
Rocio Gomez Moreno?

271
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,791
Is that you?

272
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:33,624
Yes, what do you want?

273
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,999
I'm here to issue you
with notification from the Courts.

274
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:38,791
You're being sued
for non-payment of rent.

275
00:25:38,917 --> 00:25:40,541
I've no idea
what you're talking about...

276
00:25:40,667 --> 00:25:42,291
If you don't want
to accept the notification,

277
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:43,957
I must say you've been notified

278
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:45,624
and the notification is available

279
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,541
as of tomorrow in Lower Court
number 5 in Jerez de la Frontera.

280
00:25:48,667 --> 00:25:51,666
You have 10 days to appeal.
All right?

281
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:25,541
Mummy,

282
00:26:27,792 --> 00:26:29,416
what does "bastard" mean?

283
00:26:34,583 --> 00:26:35,874
Who called you that?

284
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:38,166
Nobody.

285
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,749
Nobody?
So why are you asking me then?

286
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:46,457
If I find out who called you that,
there'll be war. Was it Dani?

287
00:26:48,458 --> 00:26:50,249
Forget about it.
It's nothing.

288
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,749
How did the interview go today?

289
00:26:56,458 --> 00:26:58,416
I might get the job.

290
00:27:01,417 --> 00:27:05,249
Mummy, do you know
what I'd like for my birthday?

291
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:10,374
Football boots. So I can wear them
for the end of year match.

292
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,666
Adrian, you know
I don't have money for that.

293
00:27:12,792 --> 00:27:14,499
Come on, off to bed with you...

294
00:27:14,625 --> 00:27:16,707
And stop asking so many questions,
it's late.

295
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:50,249
- Paco!
- We're ready to go.

296
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:52,624
Don't give up Paco, my man,
don't give up.

297
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,791
Don't give up,
don't give up, Manuel.

298
00:27:54,917 --> 00:27:57,124
- Up we go, get your back into it!
- Hard and up.

299
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,874
- Everybody pulling together now!
- Everybody together.

300
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,499
That's the way!

301
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:33,291
Mummy!

302
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:37,541
- Mummy!
- What do you want?

303
00:28:38,208 --> 00:28:39,624
When are we going?

304
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,124
In a little bit.

305
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:43,791
I feel dizzy.

306
00:29:06,958 --> 00:29:08,332
Drink some water.

307
00:29:09,792 --> 00:29:11,166
- Are you dizzy?
- Yes.

308
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:15,249
You have a temperature.
Let's go home.

309
00:29:41,708 --> 00:29:43,332
What's up?

310
00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:45,749
Nothing, a tummy ache.

311
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:59,166
Are there any biscuits?

312
00:29:59,292 --> 00:30:01,166
No biscuits, Adrian.

313
00:30:03,583 --> 00:30:06,332
I'd kill a steak and chips right now.

314
00:30:06,958 --> 00:30:08,624
Aren't you eating?

315
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:12,457
You're going
to end up like a skeleton.

316
00:32:57,292 --> 00:32:58,624
Hey!

317
00:33:34,292 --> 00:33:35,624
Are you feeling better?

318
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,207
Yeah, I'm not dizzy now.

319
00:33:45,542 --> 00:33:46,874
There's no water?

320
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:55,374
Just what we needed!
They've cut-off our water.

321
00:33:59,167 --> 00:34:01,207
...we'd like to inform you
that at present

322
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:04,416
you do not have enough credit
on your phone to make a call...

323
00:34:11,625 --> 00:34:13,082
Come on, hurry up!

324
00:34:13,208 --> 00:34:14,207
I'm coming.

325
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,707
Wait, mummy.

326
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:42,124
Give it here.

327
00:34:52,792 --> 00:34:54,332
Hi!

328
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:56,249
Where have you been?

329
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:57,707
You're getting so big.

330
00:34:57,833 --> 00:35:00,207
No, don't ruffle his hair like that.
He doesn't like it.

331
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:01,249
Sorry, lad.

332
00:35:01,375 --> 00:35:02,832
Go on, go play with your friends.

333
00:35:04,792 --> 00:35:07,166
I've no water.
We don't have water I mean.

334
00:35:07,292 --> 00:35:09,249
Seriously! How's that?

335
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:11,124
A leak, everything happens to me.

336
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:14,249
That's really bad luck.
Don't worry about it.

337
00:35:14,375 --> 00:35:16,582
Come and get water
from me anytime you need it.

338
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:17,624
Thanks.

339
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:19,832
I'm going upstairs, I'm in a rush.

340
00:35:20,042 --> 00:35:21,832
- Bye.
- See you later.

341
00:35:31,042 --> 00:35:33,082
- Where the hell are you going, kid?
- I didn't do anything.

342
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:34,457
Adrian started it and he hit him.

343
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:36,249
That's a lie. He started on me
and he won't let me play.

344
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:38,457
They're picking on him
because he doesn't have a dad.

345
00:35:38,583 --> 00:35:39,999
He called me a son of a bitch.

346
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:41,916
Did you call him that?

347
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:47,624
Bastard!

348
00:35:48,417 --> 00:35:49,541
What?

349
00:35:50,667 --> 00:35:51,666
Adrian!

350
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,416
Get in there.

351
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:11,416
What have I told you about fighting?

352
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:12,874
They started it.

353
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,291
It's always somebody else who starts it.

354
00:36:14,417 --> 00:36:16,166
And what about the swearing?
Where's that from?

355
00:36:16,292 --> 00:36:17,916
I'll wash your mouth out with bleach!

356
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:19,749
Do you know what?
No console for you.

357
00:36:19,875 --> 00:36:21,541
But I was only standing up for myself.

358
00:36:21,667 --> 00:36:24,082
I don't want you fighting Adrian
and that's that!

359
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:26,291
You know the story.
Off to your room!

360
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,916
Would you mind telling me
what you're doing?

361
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:35,749
You do know Jerez is full of people
looking for work, right?

362
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:39,082
Give me the billboard and the flyers.
I've had it!

363
00:37:39,208 --> 00:37:40,624
Please, don't do this to me...

364
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:41,791
Give them to me now, Christ!

365
00:37:41,917 --> 00:37:43,124
Nacho, think of my kid.

366
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:44,707
I'm sick of your crap.

367
00:37:44,833 --> 00:37:48,916
Give it here...
Girl... girl!

368
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:16,291
I'll give it to you for a euro.

369
00:39:19,792 --> 00:39:23,999
I read tons of these when I was a kid.
The memories...

370
00:39:24,125 --> 00:39:25,416
Take whatever you want.

371
00:39:25,542 --> 00:39:26,499
Alright.

372
00:39:34,042 --> 00:39:37,082
Here, for the comic.

373
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,541
Wait.

374
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,582
Here's a tip.

375
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:44,666
It takes a lot of backbone
to stand here all morning.

376
00:39:44,792 --> 00:39:46,332
Thanks a million.

377
00:39:46,542 --> 00:39:48,624
I have to be careful with the wife.

378
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,874
If she sees them
she throws them out on me.

379
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,082
Okay, see you again!

380
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:53,666
See you!

381
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:30,041
FOR RENT

382
00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:08,207
What are you drawing?

383
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:09,332
I'm coming.

384
00:41:15,958 --> 00:41:18,332
Here, a present for the future.

385
00:41:18,458 --> 00:41:21,791
That's really cool, Adrian!
What is it?

386
00:41:23,125 --> 00:41:26,624
When I'm big I'm going
to look after you and work non-stop

387
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,999
to save up and buy you a really,

388
00:41:29,125 --> 00:41:31,916
really big house...
with a garden full of flowers.

389
00:41:32,042 --> 00:41:35,082
This will be our house...
Here's the pool.

390
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:38,749
And who's that by the BBQ?

391
00:41:38,875 --> 00:41:40,291
Your future boyfriend.

392
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:44,874
Me? A boyfriend? Right...
You've got to be kidding...

393
00:41:46,542 --> 00:41:48,666
Well, Dani's mother is looking for one.

394
00:41:49,292 --> 00:41:50,916
Let her look for what she likes...

395
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:53,707
Do you know what nickname
they've given the mother?

396
00:41:53,833 --> 00:41:55,041
What nickname?

397
00:41:55,167 --> 00:41:56,666
"The scaredicks. "

398
00:41:58,375 --> 00:42:00,124
Why the scaredicks?

399
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:04,332
Because anytime a guy gets near her
she scares them away.

400
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,457
Hey! not a word
to your friend Dani, do you hear me?

401
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:13,791
Let's try this on
to see if it's good on you.

402
00:42:16,292 --> 00:42:17,541
Let's see.

403
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:23,707
Is it okay?

404
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:24,832
Yes.

405
00:42:26,083 --> 00:42:27,041
Okay,

406
00:42:27,583 --> 00:42:30,166
off to bed, it's really late.

407
00:42:38,458 --> 00:42:41,291
Come up and get water anytime you need it.

408
00:42:41,417 --> 00:42:43,291
Don't think twice about it.

409
00:42:43,417 --> 00:42:47,624
Go on, finish filling it up while I check
the fish and tomato casserole.

410
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:08,582
Hello, What's up?

411
00:43:10,125 --> 00:43:16,124
But... but what the hell
did they say to her?

412
00:43:20,125 --> 00:43:21,874
And how is she holding up?

413
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,124
Maria.

414
00:43:49,167 --> 00:43:50,416
Maria?

415
00:43:57,417 --> 00:43:59,291
What's wrong?

416
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,624
It's my sister...

417
00:44:08,083 --> 00:44:10,541
My brother-in-law
from Barcelona just called.

418
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,207
They've found something bad.

419
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:17,832
I'm so sorry.

420
00:44:17,958 --> 00:44:19,457
The poor woman.

421
00:44:23,667 --> 00:44:27,749
If there's anything you need me to do...

422
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:34,166
You've enough on your plate
to be taking on my woes, love.

423
00:44:38,583 --> 00:44:40,916
Take some casserole with you.

424
00:44:41,458 --> 00:44:44,249
No, no, really.
I've already taken so much.

425
00:44:44,375 --> 00:44:46,249
Go on.
Take it, take it.

426
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:49,166
That's it.

427
00:44:50,417 --> 00:44:52,374
It's fine.

428
00:45:13,333 --> 00:45:16,916
Adrian!

429
00:45:17,042 --> 00:45:19,332
Stop messing around.

430
00:45:19,458 --> 00:45:22,666
Adrian, stop playing jokes and get up.

431
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,707
Adrian, Adrian, what's wrong with you?
Are you okay? Are you dizzy?

432
00:45:33,792 --> 00:45:36,249
That's it now.

433
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:41,416
You'll feel better.

434
00:45:43,042 --> 00:45:44,332
That's it.

435
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:54,457
Are you all right?
What happened to you?

436
00:46:00,542 --> 00:46:02,124
I'll be fine here.

437
00:46:06,875 --> 00:46:08,374
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

438
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,041
How are things, love?

439
00:46:10,708 --> 00:46:13,332
My leg is killing me.
I've pain everywhere.

440
00:46:13,958 --> 00:46:15,332
What brings you here?

441
00:46:15,583 --> 00:46:17,332
The kid got sick.

442
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,249
Go on, buy a lottery ticket from me
and you'll see how lucky you'll be.

443
00:46:21,375 --> 00:46:24,707
God you're annoying
with the lottery tickets, they never win.

444
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,499
I've handed out loads of prizes
in this neighbourhood,

445
00:46:27,625 --> 00:46:31,082
but recently with things being
so tough, people buy less.

446
00:46:32,542 --> 00:46:34,666
Let's see if things
pick up a bit soon.

447
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,624
You can say that again.

448
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,457
Turn on the TV, for God's sake,

449
00:46:38,583 --> 00:46:40,874
and it's full of politicians robbing,

450
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,082
this one, and that one...

451
00:46:43,542 --> 00:46:47,499
Bunch of useless no-good tykes
who aren't worth a damn.

452
00:46:47,625 --> 00:46:49,082
Where's it all going to end?

453
00:46:52,583 --> 00:46:53,832
Look...

454
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:58,207
What a shame, that poor girl.

455
00:46:58,333 --> 00:47:00,207
I've known her since she was a baby,

456
00:47:01,417 --> 00:47:03,707
she was a lovely kid, and good,

457
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:09,582
I remember she had a small boy
and social services took him from her.

458
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,499
Adrian Gomez.

459
00:47:17,667 --> 00:47:21,249
They're calling you, love.

460
00:47:31,333 --> 00:47:32,249
Hi!

461
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:38,249
Okay. Come in and sit down,

462
00:47:38,375 --> 00:47:43,124
over here on the edge
so I can listen to your breathing, okay?

463
00:47:45,333 --> 00:47:47,499
That's nothing, give it a moment.

464
00:47:53,792 --> 00:47:56,124
Go on, a little deeper.

465
00:47:58,583 --> 00:48:00,832
Okay, now here.

466
00:48:11,625 --> 00:48:14,374
You're a champion.

467
00:48:16,125 --> 00:48:18,624
You have to buy this supplement for him.

468
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:20,166
It's not covered by the social security,

469
00:48:20,292 --> 00:48:23,124
but get it and give it to him,
one every 12 hours for a month.

470
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:27,457
He's fine,
there's nothing wrong with him,

471
00:48:27,583 --> 00:48:30,041
just give him a little boost.

472
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,582
And how about his diet?
Does he eat well?

473
00:48:32,708 --> 00:48:34,332
Does he have a balanced diet?

474
00:48:34,458 --> 00:48:37,291
Does he eat everything,
main course, dairy, fruit?

475
00:48:37,417 --> 00:48:39,666
Yeah, the kid eats everything,
he eats well.

476
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:43,666
All right, but just in case,
we'll run some tests,

477
00:48:43,792 --> 00:48:49,332
that way we'll see how things are going...
blood, ions...

478
00:48:50,458 --> 00:48:55,707
and his defences,
just to check and put your mind at rest.

479
00:48:56,833 --> 00:49:00,207
Okay, so just stop by the desk outside

480
00:49:00,333 --> 00:49:02,207
and they'll give you an appointment.

481
00:49:02,792 --> 00:49:05,832
Okay, Adrian, see you soon and be good.

482
00:49:06,917 --> 00:49:08,499
See you later.

483
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:24,216
Mum! Mum! Mum!

484
00:49:39,667 --> 00:49:42,082
Adrian! Adrian!

485
00:49:55,583 --> 00:49:59,541
Quiet. A little respect, please.

486
00:50:00,792 --> 00:50:04,124
Bless this food we are about to eat Lord.

487
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:08,624
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

488
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:12,249
Our Father,
Who art in Heaven,

489
00:50:12,375 --> 00:50:17,166
hallowed be Thy name.
Thy Kingdom come,

490
00:50:17,292 --> 00:50:22,166
Thy will be done on earth
as it is in Heaven.

491
00:50:22,292 --> 00:50:26,957
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses

492
00:50:27,083 --> 00:50:30,541
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

493
00:50:30,667 --> 00:50:32,832
And lead us not into temptation,

494
00:50:32,958 --> 00:50:35,499
but deliver us from evil.
Amen.

495
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:47,416
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

496
00:50:48,583 --> 00:50:53,707
Today we have fried ham and cheese,
bean stew. Fruit and yoghurt.

497
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,207
That's great.

498
00:50:57,708 --> 00:50:59,541
Very rich, here you go.

499
00:51:02,875 --> 00:51:04,707
- Thank you very much.
- Not at all.

500
00:51:04,833 --> 00:51:06,666
- Goodbye, Rocio.
- See you tomorrow.

501
00:51:06,792 --> 00:51:07,624
Bye!

502
00:53:24,042 --> 00:53:25,207
Adrian!

503
00:53:33,667 --> 00:53:36,249
Come out Adrian.
I'm getting annoyed!

504
00:53:47,375 --> 00:53:49,666
Adrian, come upstairs!

505
00:53:52,125 --> 00:53:53,582
I said upstairs, now!

506
00:54:00,292 --> 00:54:01,791
Close the door.

507
00:54:06,708 --> 00:54:10,249
I don't like you
out on the street during school hours.

508
00:54:10,375 --> 00:54:12,707
Keep still with the ball, lad.

509
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:14,291
Have you had breakfast?

510
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:15,332
Yes.

511
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,957
Adrian! Pack it in
with the ball, for fuck sake!

512
00:55:01,042 --> 00:55:02,624
Here.

513
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:09,582
Hello? Ah...
Hi, Pilar. What's up?

514
00:55:12,417 --> 00:55:15,624
Really.
That's fantastic Pilar,

515
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:17,874
really and how do I go about it?

516
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,666
The Government Social Welfare Office...
Okay.

517
00:55:20,792 --> 00:55:23,082
And what time are they open until?

518
00:55:23,208 --> 00:55:28,499
Okay, I'll go there now.
Thanks a million, really, thank you.

519
00:55:31,167 --> 00:55:33,666
Adrian,
they've given us a cheque for food!

520
00:55:33,792 --> 00:55:36,166
Come here and give me a kiss.

521
00:55:40,792 --> 00:55:44,207
Tomorrow don't sleep in late
because it's the end of school year party.

522
00:55:44,333 --> 00:55:47,082
- No.
- Can I go with you?

523
00:55:47,208 --> 00:55:49,332
No, no, you shouldn't be going to school.

524
00:55:49,625 --> 00:55:52,041
- Don't you want to stay with Maria?
- Okay.

525
00:55:52,167 --> 00:55:53,791
All right, let's get going.

526
00:55:59,708 --> 00:56:01,207
- Hello.
- Hello.

527
00:56:01,333 --> 00:56:02,999
To pick up the cheque for food?

528
00:56:03,125 --> 00:56:04,332
Your name, please.

529
00:56:04,458 --> 00:56:05,582
Rocio Gomez Moreno.

530
00:56:05,708 --> 00:56:06,541
Gomez?

531
00:56:06,667 --> 00:56:07,457
Moreno.

532
00:56:11,458 --> 00:56:13,291
If you just fill in this form here,

533
00:56:13,417 --> 00:56:17,166
name, two surnames,
ID number and sign here.

534
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,249
Here you go.

535
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:39,624
Thank you very much.

536
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:40,999
Goodbye.

537
00:58:58,333 --> 00:59:00,541
...kick out for Spain...

538
00:59:03,042 --> 00:59:07,499
Spain playing.
Short pass to Iniesta...

539
00:59:08,708 --> 00:59:09,791
Adrian...

540
00:59:11,333 --> 00:59:13,207
...ball to Xavi.

541
00:59:13,333 --> 00:59:15,749
Both teams playing
in a very tight space now.

542
00:59:15,875 --> 00:59:17,624
Xavi to Iniesta.

543
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:21,124
Trying to make the play
throw in to the French side...

544
00:59:21,333 --> 00:59:23,124
This is pretty good...

545
00:59:25,792 --> 00:59:27,749
What did you get up to with Maria?

546
00:59:27,875 --> 00:59:30,791
She was telling me about
when she was a little girl.

547
00:59:30,917 --> 00:59:34,874
I'm very fond of Maria.
She's so kind.

548
00:59:35,417 --> 00:59:36,874
That's very true.

549
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:41,874
Mummy, why did you tell Maria

550
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,499
that I don't like people
ruffling my hair?

551
00:59:44,625 --> 00:59:47,207
I said that? I never said that...

552
00:59:51,375 --> 00:59:53,624
Here, a little early,
something for your birthday.

553
01:00:05,417 --> 01:00:06,707
Do you like them?

554
01:00:06,833 --> 01:00:08,624
They're great, mummy!
They're cool!

555
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:11,291
I'll definitely score a goal
with these tomorrow.

556
01:00:11,417 --> 01:00:13,249
Let's try them on.

557
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:24,832
My boy is going to score
one great goal tomorrow.

558
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:31,207
Come on, let's eat!

559
01:00:36,292 --> 01:00:39,041
...he's ready to take the corner.

560
01:00:39,167 --> 01:00:41,624
He kicks the ball
into the area... Casillas!

561
01:01:04,042 --> 01:01:07,666
...the French defenders return back
and holds the midfield,

562
01:01:07,792 --> 01:01:11,499
very far forward to try
and stop Spain from playing their way.

563
01:01:12,333 --> 01:01:14,916
Casillas boots it up field...

564
01:01:46,792 --> 01:01:47,832
Mum?

565
01:01:49,375 --> 01:01:50,457
Can I come in?

566
01:02:00,292 --> 01:02:02,832
Mum, what's wrong with you?

567
01:02:03,083 --> 01:02:04,666
Should I call Maria?

568
01:02:26,417 --> 01:02:27,416
Mummy.

569
01:02:57,833 --> 01:03:00,374
Please, if you'd come this way.

570
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:13,457
Come in.

571
01:03:18,167 --> 01:03:19,916
Are you the lady who called this morning?

572
01:03:20,042 --> 01:03:21,124
Yes.

573
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:24,749
Please, take a seat, Miss.
I can call you miss, can't I?

574
01:03:24,875 --> 01:03:26,749
Of course.

575
01:03:26,875 --> 01:03:30,374
Okay, I'm going to try and help you,
if possible. Did you bring the letter?

576
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:31,541
Yes.

577
01:03:42,833 --> 01:03:44,624
This letter enforces a sentence

578
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:47,207
suing you for non-payment
of rent of a property.

579
01:03:49,167 --> 01:03:51,041
This is from some time ago...

580
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:55,332
- Your name is...?
- Rocio.

581
01:03:55,458 --> 01:03:57,166
Okay, let me explain, Rocio.

582
01:03:58,250 --> 01:04:02,291
This notice must have arrived
in the post about four months ago

583
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:04,624
and it's the suit brought against you

584
01:04:04,833 --> 01:04:07,999
by the property owner
for non-payment of the rent.

585
01:04:08,125 --> 01:04:10,874
In cases like these there are
several options open to you.

586
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:16,832
When the notice arrives you have 10 days
to either make payment of the debt,

587
01:04:16,958 --> 01:04:22,707
abandon the flat or file an appeal,
if you don't agree with it.

588
01:04:23,208 --> 01:04:25,166
So, what happens then?

589
01:04:27,292 --> 01:04:30,791
Well, the term for filing
an appeal has run out.

590
01:04:32,958 --> 01:04:38,541
Which means that the term for doing
anything about it has already expired.

591
01:04:39,958 --> 01:04:43,999
So, then?
What happens now?

592
01:04:45,667 --> 01:04:49,374
Rocio,
there's nothing I can do to help you,

593
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:53,499
the Courts have issued the eviction date

594
01:04:54,667 --> 01:04:57,332
and that means
you'll have to leave your home.

595
01:04:57,625 --> 01:04:59,707
But, how can that be possible?

596
01:04:59,833 --> 01:05:02,541
Can't I appeal or something?

597
01:05:03,708 --> 01:05:05,291
You've come a bit late.

598
01:05:05,708 --> 01:05:08,499
But you're a lawyer,
you can do something, can't you?

599
01:05:09,958 --> 01:05:12,166
You should have come to see me earlier.

600
01:05:12,292 --> 01:05:15,374
There's nothing we can do at this point.

601
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:16,874
That's how the law works.

602
01:05:19,417 --> 01:05:23,791
You'll have to be out of the flat

603
01:05:23,917 --> 01:05:26,874
before July 2nd at 10:45 am.

604
01:05:29,167 --> 01:05:32,082
The best thing
is to start looking for somewhere else.

605
01:05:33,792 --> 01:05:37,124
I can't do anything to help you.
I really am sorry.

606
01:05:40,375 --> 01:05:44,666
Charo, could you come here
to show the lady out, please?

607
01:05:47,708 --> 01:05:51,166
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'd better get back to work.

608
01:05:51,292 --> 01:05:53,666
But, isn't there anything
you can do to help me?

609
01:05:53,792 --> 01:05:57,541
I'm on my own with a small boy.
Don't you need anybody,

610
01:05:57,667 --> 01:06:00,499
I don't know,
to clean the offices or something?

611
01:06:00,625 --> 01:06:03,957
Or maybe you know somebody
who's taking people on?

612
01:06:04,708 --> 01:06:06,082
No, I'm really sorry.

613
01:06:06,208 --> 01:06:08,499
Now, I'm afraid
you'll have to leave, please.

614
01:06:11,167 --> 01:06:12,916
Would you come with me please?

615
01:09:04,625 --> 01:09:07,832
Did you see my pass to Dani,
and the goal he scored?

616
01:09:08,542 --> 01:09:11,166
- Have a great summer.
- See you next year.

617
01:09:11,292 --> 01:09:12,291
Bye.

618
01:09:13,917 --> 01:09:15,291
Cheers...

619
01:09:17,208 --> 01:09:18,874
- Bye
- Bye, see you.

620
01:09:41,292 --> 01:09:43,374
Wait here, I'll be right out.

621
01:09:52,125 --> 01:09:54,416
Son of a bitch!
I'm going to fucking kill you!

622
01:09:54,542 --> 01:09:57,332
You're going to throw me out
onto the street!

623
01:09:57,458 --> 01:09:59,207
Take your hands off me.

624
01:09:59,333 --> 01:10:00,499
Let me go.

625
01:10:00,625 --> 01:10:03,082
- Is she mental or what?
- Fucker...

626
01:10:03,208 --> 01:10:04,874
- Are you fucking mad?
- Bastard...

627
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,332
Get lost, fuck off!

628
01:10:06,458 --> 01:10:08,416
What do I do now?

629
01:10:08,542 --> 01:10:10,791
Go on, get the fuck out of here!

630
01:10:10,917 --> 01:10:12,582
You fucking faggot!

631
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:16,041
Do you thieves want to get
the fuck out of here now, or what?

632
01:10:17,333 --> 01:10:19,082
You fucking son of a bitch!

633
01:10:19,208 --> 01:10:20,874
- Get the hell out of here!
- Fucking...!

634
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:21,957
Son of a bitch!

635
01:10:38,917 --> 01:10:42,582
Mum, mum.

636
01:10:48,167 --> 01:10:50,457
Are you getting up?
It's nine o'clock.

637
01:10:56,375 --> 01:10:57,916
Have you eaten anything?

638
01:10:58,667 --> 01:11:00,624
Yes, but I'm still hungry.

639
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:05,416
Come here to me.

640
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:14,499
What was wrong with you earlier?

641
01:11:16,875 --> 01:11:18,124
No idea.

642
01:11:21,083 --> 01:11:23,374
I've never seen you like that.

643
01:11:26,917 --> 01:11:29,374
I'm like my mother in that way.

644
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:33,457
When your granny used to get angry,
she had a serious temper...

645
01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:26,957
TODAY, JULY 1ST AT 8:45PM.
SPAIN VS ITALY.

646
01:13:32,750 --> 01:13:35,166
I can't wait to see the football tonight.

647
01:13:37,833 --> 01:13:40,874
If Spain wins tonight,
will you buy the newspaper tomorrow?

648
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,624
We'll see.

649
01:13:43,292 --> 01:13:44,457
Mum.

650
01:13:44,583 --> 01:13:45,416
What?

651
01:13:45,542 --> 01:13:49,499
Can I invite some friends over
this Friday for my birthday?

652
01:13:53,458 --> 01:13:54,416
Maria!

653
01:13:54,542 --> 01:13:55,707
- Hey, Rocio!
- Hi!

654
01:13:55,833 --> 01:13:58,457
I've just been to your house,
to say goodbye to you.

655
01:13:58,583 --> 01:14:00,082
Where are you going?

656
01:14:00,208 --> 01:14:04,541
I'm off to Barcelona,
my sister is worse. She's practically...

657
01:14:05,917 --> 01:14:07,166
Adrian, come here,

658
01:14:07,958 --> 01:14:10,291
for your birthday.
Seeing as I won't be here for it.

659
01:14:15,917 --> 01:14:18,707
- Christ!
- Maria!

660
01:14:19,333 --> 01:14:20,957
It's cool, isn't it?

661
01:14:23,708 --> 01:14:26,082
I'm really going to miss you!

662
01:14:26,208 --> 01:14:28,082
I'm not staying in Barcelona for good.

663
01:14:30,333 --> 01:14:33,624
Okay, I'm off, I have to get a taxi.

664
01:14:34,708 --> 01:14:37,541
Adrian, you handsome boy.

665
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:39,999
My boy...

666
01:14:40,125 --> 01:14:41,999
I'm going to show the shirt to my friends.

667
01:14:50,625 --> 01:14:53,874
For God's sake,
look after yourself, Rocio, okay?

668
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,916
Okay, see you, Maria, have a safe journey.

669
01:15:07,667 --> 01:15:09,999
- Bye, Rocio.
- Goodbye.

670
01:15:37,333 --> 01:15:39,582
Mummy, what are you doing?

671
01:15:39,708 --> 01:15:41,582
Putting away the winter clothes.

672
01:15:48,167 --> 01:15:49,707
It smells like fire.

673
01:15:49,833 --> 01:15:50,832
What?

674
01:15:50,958 --> 01:15:52,832
It smells like fire.

675
01:16:13,333 --> 01:16:14,541
Go outside.

676
01:16:45,125 --> 01:16:45,957
Mum,

677
01:16:47,833 --> 01:16:51,041
can I turn the TV on?
The match is about to start.

678
01:16:51,333 --> 01:16:53,041
We can't turn the TV on Adrian.

679
01:16:55,208 --> 01:16:57,166
You're not telling me
I can't watch the final are you?

680
01:16:57,292 --> 01:16:58,374
We've no electricity.

681
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:00,707
It's always the same.
It's all your fault.

682
01:17:04,292 --> 01:17:05,207
Adrian!

683
01:17:06,375 --> 01:17:08,791
Don't get at me, do you hear me?
None of this is my fault.

684
01:17:08,917 --> 01:17:11,374
No, of course it isn't.
Now I can't watch the match.

685
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:13,707
I'm sick of it.
Why can't you be a normal mother?

686
01:17:13,833 --> 01:17:14,666
What do you mean?

687
01:17:14,792 --> 01:17:17,207
Dani's mother scares off men
but they don't even go near you.

688
01:17:17,333 --> 01:17:18,582
What are you talking about?

689
01:17:18,708 --> 01:17:20,582
I don't even have a father...

690
01:17:24,708 --> 01:17:26,082
Stop it!

691
01:17:26,583 --> 01:17:28,082
You're acting crazy.

692
01:17:32,042 --> 01:17:33,541
Bastard.

693
01:17:36,833 --> 01:17:40,624
Adrian!

694
01:19:11,583 --> 01:19:14,874
Ball for Xavi Alonso.
Xavi. Xavi to Torres.

695
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,791
Offside.
A little tight that one I think.

696
01:19:18,333 --> 01:19:21,999
Well, well. It's nearly over.
Ball for Italy. Ten and half left.

697
01:19:22,125 --> 01:19:25,416
We can't believe it. It's incredible
but we have too much time.

698
01:19:25,583 --> 01:19:28,332
Careful, watch out.
Spain are back on the attack.

699
01:19:28,625 --> 01:19:31,041
There's Xavi,
he passes the ball to Torres...

700
01:19:31,167 --> 01:19:33,041
Goal!

701
01:20:43,583 --> 01:20:45,666
I'm so sorry, forgive me.

702
01:20:47,083 --> 01:20:51,707
Me too. That's enough of that,
today is a day to celebrate.

703
01:20:52,792 --> 01:20:56,457
You know
things have been really tough lately.

704
01:20:56,583 --> 01:20:58,457
Yeah, you're really acting weird.

705
01:20:59,750 --> 01:21:03,749
I haven't been able to pay
the rent now for a few months.

706
01:21:05,458 --> 01:21:11,457
And the landlord has reported us.
We have to leave.

707
01:21:14,708 --> 01:21:16,207
When, mum?

708
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:21,582
Tomorrow.

709
01:21:26,875 --> 01:21:28,457
Goal!

710
01:23:42,583 --> 01:23:43,999
You can open the door.

711
01:23:58,208 --> 01:23:59,624
Go ahead.

712
01:25:07,708 --> 01:25:12,707
In my flesh, the nest of shame

713
01:25:13,208 --> 01:25:17,374
The nail grime that claws yearningly

714
01:25:19,417 --> 01:25:25,416
Splinters of my shipwreck
The cuts of the eyes looking at me

715
01:25:28,042 --> 01:25:33,166
In my mouth the wound
The same wingless prayer

716
01:25:33,667 --> 01:25:37,707
The cry that they tread on me
The cowards

717
01:25:39,917 --> 01:25:45,916
I forgot the kisses
The smile and love in words

718
01:25:48,583 --> 01:25:53,916
My frozen hands, locked doors

719
01:25:54,042 --> 01:25:57,957
I walk the paths
Of a world with nothing

720
01:25:58,083 --> 01:26:01,124
I beg for the coat
I ask for crumbs

721
01:26:01,250 --> 01:26:06,999
And life goes by
The flame goes out

722
01:26:13,458 --> 01:26:15,707
In Spain, 526 people
lose their homes each day in 2012.

723
01:26:15,833 --> 01:26:18,916
The unemployment rate currently stands
at 26%, the highest it has ever been.

724
01:26:19,042 --> 01:26:22,541
13 million people are at risk
of poverty or social exclusion

725
01:26:22,667 --> 01:26:25,624
The banking sector was bailed out
to the tune of 100 billion Euros.

726
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:27,832
So, who's going to bail you out?
