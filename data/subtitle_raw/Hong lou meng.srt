1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,269
Dream of the Red Chamber

2
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:44,310
Based on the novel by Cao Xueqin

3
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:58,316
Directed by Bu Wancang

4
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,828
Master Jia, rest easy.

5
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,414
What? Why can't we enter through the
front.

6
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:37,923
Mistress Lin has arrived.

7
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:43,724
Grandmother.

8
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:48,422
It was so unexpected.

9
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:53,427
Your mother passed away in front of me.

10
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:05,443
Please don't cry.

11
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:08,954
Don't cry. I am more dismayed.

12
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:15,460
Mother, you shouldn't feel sad.

13
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:19,464
Though Grandmother weeps, it is the
hand of fate.

14
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:22,627
She has a good granddaughter.

15
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:25,630
You can take comfort in knowing that.

16
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:33,473
Daiyu, this is your aunt and uncle.

17
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:37,505
Aunt. Uncle.

18
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:39,985
Make yourself at home.

19
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:46,492
Child, your body feels a little weak.

20
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:50,618
Are you ill?

21
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,487
Since childhood,

22
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:54,499
I've been taking medicine nearly every
day.

23
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,663
We have sent for many doctors

24
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,496
but to no avail.

25
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,340
The young madam has traveled far.

26
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:08,514
No need for her to be tutored.

27
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:11,513
Yes.

28
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,031
Ah I seem to have arrived late.

29
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,526
I've neglected our guest.

30
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,638
Grandmother.

31
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:37,539
Don't you recognize her?

32
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:41,543
She's a spiteful woman, as we all know
around here.

33
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:45,550
This is my niece and elder brother's Lian's
wife.

34
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:48,380
Her name is Wang Xifeng.

35
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:51,215
Second Sister-in-law.

36
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,731
The world is truly blessed by her beauty.

37
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,569
I cannot blame Grandmother for missing
you so.

38
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,403
Old Madam, Master Bao has arrived.

39
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:09,870
Very well.

40
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:19,414
Grandmother.

41
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:24,590
Mother.

42
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:28,587
Second Sister-in-law.

43
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,896
Do you know who she is?

44
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:40,594
It seems that I've met this younger sister
before.

45
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:44,610
Of course not, you've only just met and
now you call her sister?

46
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,110
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

47
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:49,615
Yes, I'm sure I've seen her before,

48
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,611
but I've forgotten where.

49
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:59,317
Don't be ridiculous. Where could you have
seen her?

50
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,957
She is your cousin, Lin Daiyu.

51
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:04,129
Of course.

52
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,624
It's not wrong to call her "little sister".

53
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,637
Little Sister Lin, where did you study?

54
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:14,637
I believe you certainly can read.

55
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,976
Miss Lin, do you have one of these?

56
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:29,655
No.

57
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:37,162
Silly child. That jade stone was made for
your

58
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,656
when you were one month old.

59
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,657
How could just anyone have one?

60
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,797
A gift or not,

61
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:47,665
both younger and elder sisters do not
have one.

62
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,671
What use do I have of it?

63
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:54,179
Hey! Hey! What's the matter with you!

64
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:55,681
Come on, put your arms up!

65
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:59,685
I don't want it! I don't want it!

66
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:07,683
Take it. I don't want this old thing.

67
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:10,696
All right. Give it to me.

68
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:17,202
Silly child. You make too much trouble.

69
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:19,705
Your cousin Lin had one once,

70
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,706
but your aunt had died. She couldn't give it
up.

71
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:24,707
So it had been buried with her.

72
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:26,711
Your cousin does not wish to discuss it.

73
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:30,507
So please don't mention it.

74
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,717
Why are you being silly?

75
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,219
Dear child, put it on.

76
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:35,713
Quickly.

77
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:45,350
Dear child, your sister Lin has arrived.

78
00:07:45,351 --> 00:07:47,655
Let her wash up. Come,
let's go to the courtyard.

79
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,310
I'm not going.
I want to follow Sister Lin.

80
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,735
Miss Lin, let me taste the rouge from your
lips.

81
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:01,046
Eh, you are a devil child.

82
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:05,751
She has only met you today, and you are
being unruly.

83
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,754
What to do with you!

84
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,760
Very well. Let's go.

85
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:33,778
Feng Lazi.

86
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:36,774
Call the servants to prepare two rooms for
Madam Lin.

87
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:39,611
Make her feel at home.

88
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:40,786
Yes, madam.

89
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,296
Is this the serving wench you've brought?

90
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:54,792
What is her name?

91
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:55,797
Her name is Xueyuan.

92
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:01,804
I believe see she's too small for the task.

93
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,810
But I have many servant girls.

94
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:07,813
Yuanyang, call Zijuan here

95
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:09,271
Yes, madam.

96
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,150
You're so thin.

97
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:18,317
Have you been taking your tonic?

98
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:22,827
Yes, I often take renshen yangrong herbal
pills.

99
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:26,157
I have some here.

100
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:29,831
Let me have some prepared for you.

101
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:34,833
This is Miss Lin.

102
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,740
There are too many people here.

103
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:39,845
From now on, you will serve Miss Lin.

104
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,347
Miss Lin.

105
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,199
Madam, it's cold out here.

106
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:27,885
What's on your mind?

107
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:34,389
I see that you shouldn't worry so.

108
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:35,901
Is your grandmother's home similar to
yours?

109
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,906
I'm not homesick.

110
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:46,334
I just think my fate is a bitter one.

111
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:49,506
You think I've only just arrived here.

112
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,918
Let cousin start the rumor.

113
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:56,547
And cast away the jade as he tried to.

114
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:01,085
As he should have.

115
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,395
Such is my fate.

116
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,397
He's a fool.

117
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,332
Since your cousin has lived here so long,

118
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:10,935
he's familiar with everyone.

119
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:12,764
He has a bit of a temper.

120
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:16,430
It's cold out here. Come inside.

121
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:31,081
What are you doing?

122
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,959
Doing? Just preparing to have your child
someday.

123
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:50,965
Xiren, we have a relative over, did you
know?

124
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,978
I knew. It's Mistress Lin.

125
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:58,815
Did you see Miss Lin?

126
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:03,978
She is truly beautiful.

127
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:11,485
Qingwen, I think Miss Lin looks a bit like
you.

128
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,495
What rubbish. If I could be like her,

129
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,463
I'd be ecstatic.

130
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:21,996
Either way, 'tis better to be a woman than
a man.

131
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,441
Why's that?

132
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:26,033
You don't know.

133
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:31,012
Woman is made of water and man is
made of mire.

134
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,018
When I see a woman, I can feel how clean
she is.

135
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:37,616
A man simply feels dirty.

136
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:40,025
Stuff and nonsense again.

137
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,201
Master Bao.

138
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:00,803
Second Grandmother.

139
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,809
What's he up to?

140
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,049
Second Grandmother.

141
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:14,688
Today, we have a double surprise.

142
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,054
Guess who's here?

143
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:17,320
Who?

144
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:20,064
Your Aunt Xue has brought your cousin
Xue Baochai along.

145
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,063
She has come to live here.

146
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,292
Are you fooling me?

147
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:26,063
Is there lack of housing in Nanjing?

148
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,399
Why should they come here?

149
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,576
Certainly with Xue's abundance of
farmland,

150
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:33,711
she'd still visit her relatives.

151
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:36,081
They've just arrived in Beijing today.

152
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:39,084
The main reason for this trip is because

153
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,253
your cousin Xue Pan killed a foreigner.

154
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:43,080
So in order to avoid trouble,

155
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,950
they're traveling here.

156
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,490
By the way, they also wish to visit your
mother.

157
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:49,093
That sounds good. Where are they?

158
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:50,924
Take me to them.

159
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,098
Come on, help me get dressed in the...

160
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,100
Look at you.

161
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:57,094
So impatient, you can't even finish your
sentence.

162
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,434
It's certainly busy idleness.

163
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:04,609
I want to see if this elder sister is as
beautiful as Cousin Lin.

164
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:07,112
So I especially invited her here for you.

165
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:11,116
Good woman, you cherish me.

166
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:15,119
Here, put this on.

167
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,119
In one year, this child Baoyu has grown so
high.

168
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:31,636
I heard that when Baoyu was born,

169
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,139
he had a jade stone in his mouth.

170
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,470
Is this true?

171
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:41,545
Look, isn't that it hanging on his chest?

172
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:46,546
His mother often speaks to me of this.

173
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,443
Baoyu, may I look at it?

174
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:50,155
All right.

175
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,163
"Lose me not, forget me not,

176
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:13,837
Eternal life shall be your lot"

177
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,881
Well...

178
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,684
those two sentences do sound familiar

179
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:22,184
when the two slices of jade are put
together.

180
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:27,181
Sister, can you show me your jade piece?

181
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:30,188
I don't have one, or don't you believe
sister Feng?

182
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,193
No, I want to see.

183
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:34,528
Don't be like that. I'll show it to you.

184
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,214
Very fragrant.

185
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,884
"Let not this token wander from your side,

186
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,727
And youth perennial shall with you abide".

187
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:06,028
"Lose me not, forget me not,

188
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,233
Eternal life shall be your lot".

189
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:11,236
This really is a pair.

190
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:15,228
All right, then don't ever lose that jade
piece.

191
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:19,244
Look at Baochai's gold locket.

192
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,242
Doesn't this mean that you are destined
for each other?

193
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:27,485
Sister Bao,

194
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:32,246
was this gold piece found in your mouth
when you were born?

195
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:34,751
No.

196
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:39,958
This is Miss Lin.

197
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,259
Miss Lin, please sit down.

198
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,270
I didn't mean to interrupt your
conversation.

199
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,268
How do I put it...?

200
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:50,275
Had I known you were here,

201
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,273
I wouldn't have disturbed you.

202
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,042
Everyone here is a good sister.

203
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:58,681
No one will be left out.

204
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:03,280
Miss Lin, I finally recognize you.

205
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:05,790
Really? - No fooling.

206
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,293
I think tomorrow, you should carve out a
slice of gold.

207
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:11,121
What? A slice of gold?

208
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,298
Sister Bao has a gold locket.

209
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:16,300
The inscription goes along with my own
jade.

210
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:21,306
Ah, what a coincidence.

211
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:26,310
Could you announce to everyone

212
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:29,313
that we shall now have some wine?

213
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:44,659
Baoyu, you can't drink wine.

214
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:47,332
Good mother, I'm only having one cup.

215
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:51,336
No, if you get drunk, Grandmother will
blame it on me.

216
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:55,135
I won't get drunk. Don't worry.

217
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:58,673
I see that Baoyu still listens to Aunty.

218
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:02,204
If you cannot enjoy wine,

219
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:03,681
you cannot enjoy anything.

220
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,783
True, if you cannot enjoy,

221
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:08,847
you should not drink.

222
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:12,357
Yes, Brother Baoyu is willing to be a little
naughty.

223
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:17,362
Please have some.

224
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:46,891
That little strumpet.

225
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,394
A wench worth two pieces of silver!

226
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:51,888
How dare she assume such arrogance

227
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:53,792
in front of me!

228
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:56,901
Oh! This harlot.

229
00:18:57,436 --> 00:19:00,234
She'll take Baoyu as her own,

230
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:03,408
and forget that I was the woman who
nursed him.

231
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:08,902
I'll soon tell old madam not to find you a
man.

232
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,416
Will you still be up to your tricks?

233
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:14,885
Qingwen.

234
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:24,929
Why are you crying?

235
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:28,231
I don't want to stay in this house any
longer.

236
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,992
You ran me out to be with another.

237
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,937
What rubbish is this?

238
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,901
Why are you so upset?

239
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:38,272
After you left,

240
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,342
everyone went out.

241
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:41,946
I was taking a nap when

242
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:44,442
your wet nurse Lee came.

243
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:46,441
I didn't know.

244
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:48,452
She said I didn't greet her.

245
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:50,784
She called me a strumpet.

246
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:55,460
She said she'll make sure I won't have any
man.

247
00:19:58,497 --> 00:19:59,964
That old hag.

248
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:02,796
Why do you listen to her?

249
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,870
I'll leave anyway.

250
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:10,475
It's useless. She'll run me out.

251
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:15,480
The first two days, my elder brother came.

252
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:18,482
Prepared to give you silver

253
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:20,481
to buy me back.

254
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,490
Is this true?

255
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:28,489
Good sister, would you leave?

256
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,189
So strange.

257
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,499
I'm not the mistress of this house. How
can I stay?

258
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:40,004
According to your words, you assured me.

259
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:41,665
Certainly.

260
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:48,342
I knew early on

261
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:50,674
you'll all want to go.

262
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,517
Leaving me all alone.

263
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:25,550
You really don't want me to go?

264
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:38,119
Why do you need to be so sullen?

265
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:41,122
If you want me to stay,

266
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,568
promise me three things.

267
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:52,406
If you say three pieces, I'll promise you
three hundred pieces.

268
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:53,737
Tell me.

269
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,905
First, I forbid you to taste another woman's
lips again.

270
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:04,077
Second, I forbid you talk about staying
lonely.

271
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:06,591
Third,

272
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,090
Where did you come from?

273
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:11,592
From Miss Lin's.

274
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:12,764
What did she say?

275
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:14,764
She wonders why you didn't come up to
see her.

276
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:17,602
Yes, I should go see her.

277
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,006
Did Miss Lin really say that?

278
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:27,271
No, I lied. She's in her busy idleness.

279
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:31,013
Let her attend to her own affairs.

280
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:36,780
Spring is here again.

281
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:41,387
Where is she?

282
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:07,652
Miss Lin, Miss Lin.

283
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:11,155
What's the matter? Don't touch me.

284
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,487
I see you've overslept.

285
00:23:13,488 --> 00:23:14,988
Get up! Let's chat.

286
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:19,664
My entire body aches. Too tired to get up.

287
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,667
So, let me lie down too.

288
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:27,000
There's no other pillow.

289
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,666
We'll have to share one.

290
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,176
Oh, for heaven's sake.

291
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:41,686
You really are the evil star in my cluster.

292
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,695
Whose nails have pared your face?

293
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:55,864
It's just a piece of rouge.

294
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:59,533
You really should be more discreet.

295
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:02,707
Otherwise, we'll both be blamed for it.

296
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:08,811
This is a good fragrance. Show me what it
is.

297
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:11,814
It's nothing.

298
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,885
Dear miss, may I take another sniff?

299
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:15,879
What for?

300
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:17,721
I have no gold locket

301
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:20,721
that could compare to your beloved
Baoyu.

302
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,728
'Tis no use to sample my fragrance.

303
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:27,732
If you say that to me again,

304
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:29,730
I will give you some of this.

305
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:35,239
Elder brother,

306
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,839
I won't say it again.

307
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:42,747
How lively it is in here.

308
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:48,913
Wherever this devil child goes, he makes
a lot of noise.

309
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:51,251
That's true.

310
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:55,923
Did you come to interrupt us?

311
00:24:57,562 --> 00:24:59,757
No, I came out to join in the fun.

312
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,767
You wench, you whore.

313
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:12,608
You shameless thing.

314
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:14,608
You dare to leave.

315
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,610
I tried to reason with you.

316
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:23,276
Even if she's in the wrong, she's still your
wet nurse.

317
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:25,786
Do you want to have her beaten?

318
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:24,178
You have to be careful around Baoyu.

319
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,859
What? You still need him to tend to these
affairs.

320
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:37,854
Well, this is really none of my business,

321
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:41,365
But he doesn't want other people to do it.

322
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,868
There's no reasoning with him.

323
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:46,871
You are too busy.

324
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:48,865
May I be of some help?

325
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:51,876
Miss Baochai, you're too kind.

326
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:54,040
I really want to thank you.

327
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:56,881
You should feel at home.

328
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:01,374
From now on, if you need something, don't
hesitate to ask.

329
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,448
And if you need anything, just tell me.

330
00:58:56,165 --> 00:58:57,496
Please tear it.

331
00:59:07,176 --> 00:59:08,473
It makes a lovely sound.

332
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:20,990
Won't you regret it?

333
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:24,520
They say, "A thousand pieces of gold can't
buy a smile".

334
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:27,455
How much is this fan worth?

335
00:59:27,697 --> 00:59:29,824
I'd say I got a bargain.

336
00:59:31,868 --> 00:59:33,836
Master Bao, you're smiling.

337
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:37,339
Just now a servant in Madam's room has
told me

338
00:59:37,874 --> 00:59:39,842
that Jincha has fallen into the well and
died.

339
00:59:39,976 --> 00:59:41,466
She has died over you.

340
00:59:47,283 --> 00:59:49,342
It's all my fault.

341
00:59:49,886 --> 00:59:51,854
I got angry and beat her once.

342
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:53,852
Then I let her outside.

343
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:56,415
I only meant to send her away for a few
days,

344
00:59:56,893 --> 00:59:59,259
then ask her to come back.

345
00:59:59,696 --> 01:00:01,857
How would I know she'd jump into the
well?

346
01:00:02,298 --> 01:00:05,790
I fear Aunty may be mistaken.

347
01:00:05,902 --> 01:00:07,870
Perhaps she lost her footing

348
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:09,971
while playing alongside the well.

349
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:16,276
That may be so,

350
01:00:16,913 --> 01:00:18,938
but I'm worried.

351
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:22,384
Then it's of no consequence.

352
01:00:22,919 --> 01:00:25,888
If you feel bad, simply put two pieces of
silver

353
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:28,886
into her coffin with some fresh new clothes

354
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:30,890
for her memorial.

355
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:35,557
I think I should.

356
01:00:35,932 --> 01:00:37,900
I've already given her 52 pieces of silver,

357
01:00:38,267 --> 01:00:40,895
but there's no time to make a new dress.

358
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:42,905
That's easy.

359
01:00:43,439 --> 01:00:45,907
I have two new outfits that I haven't
altered.

360
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,907
We can pack them into her memorial hall.

361
01:00:50,947 --> 01:00:52,915
You are truly good and wise.

362
01:01:32,488 --> 01:01:33,455
Stop.

363
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:36,959
Father.

364
01:01:37,927 --> 01:01:39,656
What did you do?

365
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:41,122
Nothing.

366
01:01:45,001 --> 01:01:45,968
Uncle.

367
01:01:48,004 --> 01:01:49,972
What's the matter, that you should cry?

368
01:01:52,008 --> 01:01:54,977
Master, my sister Jincha jumped into the
well and drowned.

369
01:01:56,012 --> 01:01:58,139
Why did she jump in the well?

370
01:01:59,015 --> 01:02:00,482
What is it?

371
01:02:01,017 --> 01:02:02,484
I don't know.

372
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:05,988
Dammit. How can this happen in my
family?

373
01:02:09,025 --> 01:02:11,493
Young master raped his serving wench,

374
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:14,997
and she jumped in the well.

375
01:02:16,032 --> 01:02:18,330
And we have to bury the body.

376
01:02:18,801 --> 01:02:19,995
Damn, the shame of it all.

377
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:23,996
Go to the den with me.

378
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:29,803
Go.

379
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:38,012
Mr. Jiao, what were you talking about?

380
01:02:40,056 --> 01:02:42,183
Mind your own business.

381
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:47,029
My sister died by herself - by her own
hand.

382
01:02:47,163 --> 01:02:49,188
You're drunk. Your mouth is not clean.

383
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:52,034
Clean?

384
01:02:52,568 --> 01:02:56,026
In this house, I see two lions guarding the
doorway.

385
01:02:57,073 --> 01:02:59,041
Those are the only clean items in this
household.

386
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:08,050
You have to tell me. How did Jincha die?

387
01:03:10,586 --> 01:03:11,951
I don't know.

388
01:03:12,588 --> 01:03:15,056
Beast. Didn't you hear me?

389
01:03:15,591 --> 01:03:18,059
How many young masters live in this
house besides you?

390
01:03:22,098 --> 01:03:24,066
Bar the doors.

391
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:42,084
Father.

392
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,849
You unfilial beast.

393
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:48,249
You've trampled on everything I've taught
you.

394
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:50,856
Now you've committed a serious crime.

395
01:03:52,128 --> 01:03:54,096
Father. Father!

396
01:03:58,134 --> 01:04:00,102
My child.

397
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:02,094
What are you doing?

398
01:04:02,305 --> 01:04:05,103
The master should teach the child.

399
01:04:05,474 --> 01:04:08,739
I've waited fifty years to bear a son.

400
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:12,106
Master, can't you see in his face that he is
yours?

401
01:04:15,484 --> 01:04:17,111
Well, if you kill him,

402
01:04:17,653 --> 01:04:20,520
you'll have to kill me too.

403
01:04:21,657 --> 01:04:24,626
What right does Old Madam have to tell
me this?

404
01:04:25,161 --> 01:04:27,129
Why are you barging here?

405
01:04:29,665 --> 01:04:32,828
I have no son. Not one who treats me like
this.

406
01:04:33,169 --> 01:04:35,137
I am speechless.

407
01:04:40,176 --> 01:04:41,473
Mother.

408
01:04:43,179 --> 01:04:46,148
I'm simply teaching him a lesson. It will be
good for him.

409
01:04:46,682 --> 01:04:48,547
If you speak this way,

410
01:04:49,185 --> 01:04:51,153
how can I bear it?

411
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:55,151
I say that you cannot bear the
responsibility.

412
01:04:56,192 --> 01:04:59,559
You beat him with no evidence?

413
01:05:00,196 --> 01:05:02,164
Can you bear this burden?

414
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,667
Mother, don't be upset.

415
01:05:06,202 --> 01:05:09,501
I won't beat him.

416
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:16,474
You don't need to follow your anger.

417
01:05:17,213 --> 01:05:20,182
You've shown me how you feel about
mother and son.

418
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:25,187
Come.

419
01:05:25,721 --> 01:05:27,018
Prepare a sedan chair for me.

420
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:30,192
I shall return to Nanjing with Madam and
Baoyu.

421
01:05:31,227 --> 01:05:33,695
Don't cry.

422
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:37,199
Baoyu is still young. You have hurt him.

423
01:05:38,234 --> 01:05:42,193
When he grows up, he will remember you.

424
01:05:45,241 --> 01:05:46,708
Mother please.

425
01:05:47,243 --> 01:05:51,202
Your son has no ground to stand upon.

426
01:05:53,249 --> 01:05:56,013
That much is clear. You've brought that
upon yourself.

427
01:05:56,252 --> 01:05:59,221
Call them to prepare the sedan chair for
me.

428
01:05:59,755 --> 01:06:03,213
Look how you've beaten him.

429
01:06:08,264 --> 01:06:10,232
Old Madam, you take a rest.

430
01:06:12,268 --> 01:06:14,236
Quickly, get a bench here to lift Baoyu
aloft.

431
01:07:06,789 --> 01:07:07,756
Xueyan,

432
01:07:08,157 --> 01:07:10,455
what are you two talking about.

433
01:07:13,662 --> 01:07:15,289
Elder sister says

434
01:07:15,498 --> 01:07:17,796
that Master Bao's father beat him for no
reason.

435
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:20,302
That he was beaten badly.

436
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:38,013
Melt this pill in his wine

437
01:07:38,687 --> 01:07:40,314
and take it to him.

438
01:07:40,456 --> 01:07:43,323
This should cause his blood to clot.

439
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:45,657
Okay.

440
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:21,863
Miss Lin, why do you cry?

441
01:08:26,402 --> 01:08:29,371
You must correct your own mistakes from
now on.

442
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:33,375
You needn't worry.

443
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:35,703
I'm only faking to teach them a lesson.

444
01:08:36,912 --> 01:08:38,880
In fact, I feel no pain.

445
01:08:40,082 --> 01:08:41,549
Second Daughter-in-law is here.

446
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:45,546
Don't go.

447
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:48,389
If one were to look me in the eyes,

448
01:08:48,724 --> 01:08:51,386
I would feel humiliated.

449
01:09:02,438 --> 01:09:04,406
Do you feel a little better now?

450
01:09:10,446 --> 01:09:14,405
He was in pain, and now he's fast asleep.

451
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:17,419
Maybe a little better.

452
01:09:19,455 --> 01:09:20,922
When he wakes, he'll be hungry.

453
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:22,917
Call someone to bring him something from
my room.

454
01:09:29,465 --> 01:09:30,591
Qingwen.

455
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:34,428
Why did you pretend to sleep?

456
01:09:38,474 --> 01:09:41,443
Do me a favor. Take these handkerchiefs
to Miss Lin.

457
01:09:49,485 --> 01:09:51,783
Master Bao wants to give you this.

458
01:10:10,906 --> 01:10:13,466
Even in such dire peril,

459
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:17,479
he still thinks of me.

460
01:10:48,544 --> 01:10:54,505
"Vain are all these idle tears,

461
01:10:55,551 --> 01:11:02,514
tears shed secretly - for whom?

462
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:10,521
Your kind gift of a foot of gauze,

463
01:11:11,567 --> 01:11:17,528
only deepens my gloom".

464
01:11:47,603 --> 01:11:49,036
Good morning, Aunty.

465
01:11:49,605 --> 01:11:51,072
Come sit with me.

466
01:11:52,107 --> 01:11:53,574
I feel a bit stuffy.

467
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:56,077
You worry me.

468
01:11:56,612 --> 01:11:58,580
I can certainly ease your sorrow.

469
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:02,208
After Baoyu's father flogged him,

470
01:12:03,118 --> 01:12:04,585
I haven't slept well.

471
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,588
Baoyu has grown older, but more
mischievous.

472
01:12:08,123 --> 01:12:11,286
I think we should have a wedding
breakfast for him.

473
01:12:13,962 --> 01:12:15,930
You're not mistaken.

474
01:12:16,632 --> 01:12:19,601
But Baoyu's affairs have already been
taken care of.

475
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:23,130
Taken care of? Are you referring to Lin
Daiyu?

476
01:12:23,639 --> 01:12:25,607
No. - No?

477
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:29,599
Of course not. I'm talking about Miss
Baochai.

478
01:12:30,145 --> 01:12:32,613
When you compare Miss Lin with Miss
Baochai,

479
01:12:33,649 --> 01:12:35,617
only Miss Baochai has many blessings.

480
01:12:36,151 --> 01:12:38,119
She is also a good relative of the Wangs,

481
01:12:38,654 --> 01:12:41,623
if Aunty can turn them in our favor?

482
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:47,629
Sister's niece is the perfect match for my
son.

483
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:49,457
It'll be for the best.

484
01:12:50,265 --> 01:12:52,631
Miss Baochai is not as unique as Miss Lin.

485
01:12:54,503 --> 01:12:56,630
But I've always liked her.

486
01:12:56,939 --> 01:13:00,136
However, Old Madam knows Baoyu is
very fond of Lin Daiyu.

487
01:13:00,676 --> 01:13:03,645
If Old Madam won't promise Baochai his
hand in marriage...

488
01:13:05,013 --> 01:13:06,640
Then we should tell Old Madam

489
01:13:06,782 --> 01:13:09,649
that one is gold and one is jade.

490
01:13:10,018 --> 01:13:12,145
Gold and jade together will make a good
match.

491
01:13:12,688 --> 01:13:16,146
Wouldn't Old Madam agree to that?

492
01:13:16,692 --> 01:13:18,660
You are so clever.

493
01:13:19,194 --> 01:13:20,491
I also heard that Brother Fan

494
01:13:20,863 --> 01:13:23,161
plans to move Aunty and Miss Baochai
away.

495
01:13:23,699 --> 01:13:25,667
This will be much better.

496
01:13:26,034 --> 01:13:28,662
In case Baochai's not able to come back
for a while.

497
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:36,177
Second Daughter-in-law.

498
01:13:37,713 --> 01:13:39,180
Sister Baochai.

499
01:13:39,882 --> 01:13:42,680
When you move, we'll truly be saddened.

500
01:13:42,885 --> 01:13:45,683
We've bothered you enough.

501
01:13:45,988 --> 01:13:47,512
Nonsense.

502
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:51,853
I think you should come visit my home
some time.

503
01:14:27,095 --> 01:14:28,892
It's autumn already.

504
01:14:32,267 --> 01:14:35,725
The garden appears more desolate.

505
01:14:38,774 --> 01:14:41,242
For sure. Miss Lin has taken ill.

506
01:14:42,778 --> 01:14:44,746
And Xue Baochai has moved away.

507
01:14:45,614 --> 01:14:48,242
How desolate indeed.

508
01:14:48,784 --> 01:14:51,753
Baochai was happy here. Why did she
move?

509
01:14:52,788 --> 01:14:55,086
She has her own house.

510
01:14:55,791 --> 01:14:57,759
Why must she live here?

511
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:03,257
I'm going to see Miss Lin.

512
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,097
Don't disturb her.

513
01:15:06,301 --> 01:15:08,997
These past two days, she has felt rather
sad.

514
01:15:09,137 --> 01:15:09,837
Why?

515
01:15:10,305 --> 01:15:12,773
A few days ago, a letter arrived from
Yangzhou.

516
01:15:13,141 --> 01:15:15,769
Her father, a scholar-official, has just
passed away.

517
01:15:18,146 --> 01:15:21,013
Why am I not told of these things?

518
01:15:21,817 --> 01:15:23,284
Because you were ill.

519
01:15:23,819 --> 01:15:27,277
Madam ordered us not to discuss outside
affairs.

520
01:15:43,839 --> 01:15:47,798
"Upon one's self are mainly brought

521
01:15:48,844 --> 01:15:53,804
regrets in spring and autumn gloom;

522
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:58,809
A face, flowerlike may be and moonlike
too;

523
01:15:59,855 --> 01:16:03,814
but beauty all for whom?"

524
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:10,320
"Cool autumn is here once more.

525
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:15,325
Alone I dwell, my heart is sore.

526
01:16:16,371 --> 01:16:20,330
Day lilies in the northern halls

527
01:16:21,376 --> 01:16:26,336
cannot make me forget my cares.

528
01:16:26,882 --> 01:16:30,841
"I pace the court. Where can I go?

529
01:16:32,387 --> 01:16:37,347
Lost, my past happiness.

530
01:16:37,893 --> 01:16:41,852
Remembered joys.

531
01:16:43,398 --> 01:16:48,358
But fill me with distress".

532
01:16:48,904 --> 01:16:52,863
"The Milky Way is twinkling,

533
01:16:53,909 --> 01:16:58,869
there is no sleep for aching hearts.

534
01:16:59,915 --> 01:17:04,875
The atmosphere strikes chill.

535
01:17:05,921 --> 01:17:10,881
My grief I must impart".

536
01:17:25,941 --> 01:17:27,238
Miss Zijuan.

537
01:17:29,444 --> 01:17:30,741
Can't you hear? She is depressed.

538
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:33,076
Don't you make her angry again.

539
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:36,918
I heard that Uncle has passed away.

540
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:39,087
She is ill all the time.

541
01:17:39,955 --> 01:17:42,321
She might grow thinner.

542
01:17:45,961 --> 01:17:49,419
Remember, these past two days, she
wasn't that ill.

543
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:53,699
Amitabha.

544
01:17:55,470 --> 01:17:58,928
This is news. You practically shouted it.

545
01:17:59,307 --> 01:18:01,935
If I'm being disorderly, send for a doctor.

546
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:06,948
Are you feeling cold? Your dress is rather
thin.

547
01:18:07,983 --> 01:18:09,280
Don't get fresh.

548
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:11,952
What will other people think?

549
01:18:12,988 --> 01:18:14,956
Zijuan.

550
01:18:15,323 --> 01:18:17,120
What did the doctor say about Miss Lin?

551
01:18:18,493 --> 01:18:20,120
Don't shout and make a scene.

552
01:18:20,996 --> 01:18:22,964
We'll discuss this over there.

553
01:18:28,003 --> 01:18:30,972
The doctor prescribed some bird's nest
soup.

554
01:18:32,007 --> 01:18:33,804
Easy enough. Tomorrow I'll tell Old
Madam

555
01:18:34,009 --> 01:18:36,307
to order one or two liang of soup.

556
01:18:37,012 --> 01:18:38,980
That should be good for a few years.

557
01:18:39,514 --> 01:18:41,482
You say it so eloquently.

558
01:18:42,017 --> 01:18:44,986
What will you do when she goes home?

559
01:18:46,521 --> 01:18:47,818
Who's going home?

560
01:18:48,023 --> 01:18:49,320
Miss Lin.

561
01:18:50,025 --> 01:18:53,392
You're lying. Her parents are dead.

562
01:18:54,029 --> 01:18:55,997
Where can she go?

563
01:18:57,032 --> 01:19:00,001
Young Master, you should know.

564
01:19:00,535 --> 01:19:03,504
Your family, the Jia clan is very big and
powerful.

565
01:19:04,039 --> 01:19:07,008
Sure her parents are gone.

566
01:19:08,043 --> 01:19:12,002
But I'm sure she has many uncles.

567
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:14,511
She is of the Lin family.

568
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:18,486
Why would she live with the Jia's?

569
01:19:19,054 --> 01:19:21,181
We're related. Why can't she live here?

570
01:19:22,057 --> 01:19:25,026
The Lins come from a long line of scholars.

571
01:19:25,027 --> 01:19:26,527
They won't neglect their progeny.

572
01:19:28,063 --> 01:19:31,032
So early this year, or late next year,

573
01:19:31,466 --> 01:19:34,026
someone in her family will pick her up

574
01:19:34,402 --> 01:19:37,030
and marry her off.

575
01:19:38,573 --> 01:19:41,041
I believe Miss Lin will loathe
to leave here.

576
01:19:42,077 --> 01:19:43,544
Not exactly.

577
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:46,047
Night before last, Miss Lin told me that

578
01:19:46,581 --> 01:19:48,048
she wants to tell you

579
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:52,042
that she intends to go home.

580
01:19:57,592 --> 01:19:59,059
Master Bao, Old Madam is calling for you.

581
01:20:02,597 --> 01:20:04,258
What's the matter?

582
01:20:22,117 --> 01:20:23,084
Miss.

583
01:20:24,619 --> 01:20:25,586
Miss.

584
01:20:26,121 --> 01:20:27,418
Please take your medicine.

585
01:20:43,138 --> 01:20:45,436
Did someone just come by?

586
01:20:46,641 --> 01:20:48,609
Only Young Master Bao.

587
01:20:49,477 --> 01:20:51,445
Why didn't you tell me?

588
01:20:52,147 --> 01:20:53,944
You looked so sad.

589
01:20:54,149 --> 01:20:56,117
I didn't want him to disturb you.

590
01:20:57,652 --> 01:21:00,120
It's no use!

591
01:21:01,156 --> 01:21:05,616
Oh, Baoyu. How truly horrid!

592
01:21:08,163 --> 01:21:10,131
Zijuan. Zijuan.

593
01:21:12,167 --> 01:21:15,136
What did you tell that simpleton just now?

594
01:21:16,171 --> 01:21:17,638
His eyes were glazed over.

595
01:21:18,173 --> 01:21:19,640
Hands and feet are cold.

596
01:21:20,175 --> 01:21:21,642
He couldn't say a word.

597
01:21:21,776 --> 01:21:23,744
It's as though he were dead.

598
01:21:26,181 --> 01:21:29,150
You... You... You...

599
01:21:38,193 --> 01:21:40,161
Stop doing that.

600
01:21:41,196 --> 01:21:43,164
Have the courage to

601
01:21:44,432 --> 01:21:46,161
strangle me to death.

602
01:21:48,203 --> 01:21:51,570
I spoke in jest.

603
01:21:52,207 --> 01:21:55,176
I told him you wished to return to Suzhou.

604
01:21:56,211 --> 01:21:59,180
And he took it seriously.

605
01:22:00,715 --> 01:22:01,682
In any case,

606
01:22:02,217 --> 01:22:03,684
come with me.

607
01:22:04,219 --> 01:22:06,187
Old Madam and Aunty are with him.

608
01:22:06,721 --> 01:22:08,518
You'll have to take the responsibility.

609
01:22:10,225 --> 01:22:13,194
Go. Go.

610
01:22:13,728 --> 01:22:16,196
Perhaps he'll wake up when he sees you.

611
01:22:32,747 --> 01:22:34,715
What is it now?

612
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:37,218
He's near death.

613
01:22:38,753 --> 01:22:41,221
Baoyu, what is wrong with you?

614
01:22:42,257 --> 01:22:44,225
Baoyu.

615
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:47,228
Baoyu.

616
01:22:49,264 --> 01:22:51,232
How did this happen?

617
01:22:57,272 --> 01:22:58,739
You useless wench.

618
01:22:59,107 --> 01:23:02,235
What did you say to make him like this.

619
01:23:03,278 --> 01:23:05,405
I was only having fun with him.

620
01:23:06,281 --> 01:23:08,249
I told him Miss Lin wants to go home to
Suzhou.

621
01:23:08,783 --> 01:23:10,751
I didn't say anything else.

622
01:23:11,286 --> 01:23:13,254
Come see what you've done.

623
01:23:14,289 --> 01:23:15,256
Little witch.

624
01:23:21,296 --> 01:23:22,763
Master Bao.

625
01:23:24,799 --> 01:23:25,663
Master Bao.

626
01:23:26,801 --> 01:23:28,098
Master Bao.

627
01:23:34,309 --> 01:23:36,277
If you have to go, take me with you.

628
01:23:38,313 --> 01:23:40,440
I was only having a little fun.

629
01:23:41,316 --> 01:23:42,874
We won't leave.

630
01:23:50,325 --> 01:23:52,293
Isn't that the ship that will pick up Miss
Lin?

631
01:23:52,494 --> 01:23:53,791
Quickly, bring it here.

632
01:24:04,105 --> 01:24:06,096
Now it can't leave.

633
01:24:06,341 --> 01:24:07,933
Baoyu, stop worrying.

634
01:24:08,343 --> 01:24:10,811
Miss Lin will not be leaving.

635
01:24:14,349 --> 01:24:15,475
What?

636
01:24:15,850 --> 01:24:18,080
His jade is missing.

637
01:24:22,357 --> 01:24:24,325
He just came back with Qingwen.

638
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:27,328
I was frightened and didn't notice.

639
01:24:28,797 --> 01:24:31,960
That jade is Baoyu's life-giver.

640
01:24:32,367 --> 01:24:34,335
Perhaps it's the lack of the jade

641
01:24:34,536 --> 01:24:36,504
that made him careless.

642
01:24:36,871 --> 01:24:38,338
What can we do?

643
01:24:39,374 --> 01:24:40,841
Old Madam, don't you worry.

644
01:24:41,376 --> 01:24:44,345
Xiren, when Master Bao went out, did you
hold his jade?

645
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:48,349
When I put it on him, he still had it.

646
01:24:50,385 --> 01:24:53,354
He had it on when he talked to me.

647
01:24:54,389 --> 01:24:56,357
Then it's lost in his home.

648
01:24:56,724 --> 01:24:58,783
All right then.

649
01:25:00,895 --> 01:25:04,353
Old Madam and Aunty, go have a rest.

650
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:07,368
We'll call the doctor to attend to Baoyu.

651
01:25:08,403 --> 01:25:10,371
As for the jade,

652
01:25:11,406 --> 01:25:14,807
hand it to me when you find it.

653
01:25:16,411 --> 01:25:17,708
Did he feel better?

654
01:25:18,413 --> 01:25:19,880
He has no disease.

655
01:25:20,415 --> 01:25:22,144
It's because he lost his jade stone.

656
01:25:22,417 --> 01:25:25,875
He believes it connects him to the spiritual
world.

657
01:25:27,455 --> 01:25:29,389
If Baoyu has lost it, how...?

658
01:25:30,925 --> 01:25:32,222
You know him.

659
01:25:32,927 --> 01:25:34,895
I wish to see him.

660
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:38,399
Miss, I notice you're still immobile.

661
01:25:39,901 --> 01:25:41,391
Without that jade stone...

662
01:25:43,938 --> 01:25:47,396
Second Sister-in-Law is looking for it
in the garden right now.

663
01:25:47,775 --> 01:25:49,402
She'll find it.

664
01:26:08,463 --> 01:26:09,896
I found it.

665
01:26:10,465 --> 01:26:11,932
Where?

666
01:26:13,468 --> 01:26:14,435
Here!

667
01:26:21,476 --> 01:26:24,445
(Reciting Twelve Earthly Rows)

668
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:26,947
To the west!

669
01:26:43,498 --> 01:26:44,465
Look here.

670
01:26:49,504 --> 01:26:52,473
Madam, I've seen that Qingwen

671
01:26:52,674 --> 01:26:54,471
has been behaving in a frivolous manner.

672
01:26:54,642 --> 01:26:56,303
Though I don't believe she stole the jade,

673
01:26:56,511 --> 01:26:58,809
it wouldn't be wise to keep her around
Baoyu.

674
01:26:59,514 --> 01:27:01,243
You're right.

675
01:27:01,516 --> 01:27:04,485
With her snake-light waist, and her thick
shoulders,

676
01:27:04,686 --> 01:27:06,654
she's a bit like Lin Daiyu.

677
01:27:08,523 --> 01:27:09,820
Madam, Second Sister-in-law.

678
01:27:10,525 --> 01:27:12,493
I've checked Qingwen's wardrobe.

679
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:14,487
The jade isn't there.

680
01:27:15,530 --> 01:27:17,498
What did she say when you checked her
wardrobe?

681
01:27:18,032 --> 01:27:20,500
She was getting annoyed.

682
01:27:21,536 --> 01:27:24,505
She hasn't eaten since yesterday.

683
01:27:25,139 --> 01:27:26,504
That little witch.

684
01:27:26,708 --> 01:27:29,006
It isn't good for her to be here.

685
01:27:29,344 --> 01:27:31,505
We should send her away.

686
01:27:33,548 --> 01:27:35,106
Master Bao!

687
01:27:35,883 --> 01:27:39,284
Master Bao! Master Bao.

688
01:27:49,897 --> 01:27:51,023
I don't understand.

689
01:27:52,233 --> 01:27:54,531
How can the jade completely disappear?

690
01:27:55,570 --> 01:27:58,038
I see this is one of those disasters.

691
01:27:58,573 --> 01:28:01,041
Yesterday, I asked a fortune teller.

692
01:28:01,576 --> 01:28:04,545
She said, only someone born of gold can
help him.

693
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:07,548
Only she can bring him happiness.

694
01:28:08,082 --> 01:28:10,550
Otherwise you will never recover the jade.

695
01:28:12,587 --> 01:28:16,546
The stars are in place for him to be
married.

696
01:28:17,592 --> 01:28:20,561
Let the stars solve this problem for him.

697
01:28:21,596 --> 01:28:23,564
Old Madam speaks wisely.

698
01:28:24,098 --> 01:28:26,066
I watched Brother Baoyu grow up.

699
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:28,569
Should have married him off earlier.

700
01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:31,568
So we would have no worries.

701
01:28:32,106 --> 01:28:34,574
Yes, I certainly think so.

702
01:28:39,614 --> 01:28:41,582
Hey, am I not the mistress of the house?

703
01:28:41,783 --> 01:28:43,580
Why would I not be allowed in?

704
01:28:43,785 --> 01:28:45,753
Old Madam is talking. Wait a while.

705
01:28:51,626 --> 01:28:55,585
I see that Baoyu is completely taken with
Lin Daiyu.

706
01:28:56,631 --> 01:28:58,599
If we want him to recover,

707
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:01,598
we must allow her to stay with him.

708
01:29:04,138 --> 01:29:06,106
Surely under normal circumstances,

709
01:29:06,641 --> 01:29:08,609
Daiyu is fine for him.

710
01:29:08,810 --> 01:29:12,109
But I think the child's physical endowment
is weak.

711
01:29:12,647 --> 01:29:14,615
And don't forget.

712
01:29:14,816 --> 01:29:17,614
She is not the one born of gold.

713
01:29:18,119 --> 01:29:21,111
Right. This is Baoyu's future we are talking
about.

714
01:29:21,656 --> 01:29:24,625
Old Madam should plan ahead for him.

715
01:29:27,662 --> 01:29:29,789
I understand completely.

716
01:29:30,665 --> 01:29:32,963
For the sake of our dignity,

717
01:29:33,668 --> 01:29:36,637
it's Xue Baochai who is destined to be with
him.

718
01:29:38,673 --> 01:29:41,642
Old Madam has good taste.

719
01:29:42,009 --> 01:29:44,978
And both sides are all related.

720
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:48,148
It isn't for me to say.

721
01:29:48,683 --> 01:29:51,652
It's only for Baoyu's future that I care.

722
01:29:52,687 --> 01:29:54,655
A younger sister of the Xue family

723
01:29:54,856 --> 01:29:56,653
and Baoyu will make a good pair.

724
01:29:57,692 --> 01:29:59,660
Old Madam, do you believe

725
01:29:59,861 --> 01:30:01,829
a slice of gold and a slice of jade

726
01:30:02,029 --> 01:30:03,997
are destined for a good marriage.

727
01:30:04,699 --> 01:30:06,724
Regrettably, the jade is lost.

728
01:30:07,201 --> 01:30:09,666
Never mind that.
We have the gold.

729
01:30:09,837 --> 01:30:13,170
Perhaps after they wed, we'll find the jade.

730
01:30:15,710 --> 01:30:17,678
I expect to.

731
01:30:18,713 --> 01:30:22,672
So is your younger sister willing to make
this vow.

732
01:30:22,884 --> 01:30:24,852
Certainly.

733
01:30:25,219 --> 01:30:27,187
She has said that the gold locket comes
from a monk

734
01:30:27,722 --> 01:30:30,691
who told her to find the special one who
has the jade.

735
01:30:31,726 --> 01:30:33,694
Old Madam, don't you see this is a good
opportunity.

736
01:30:35,897 --> 01:30:38,695
Yes, don't you see?

737
01:30:40,735 --> 01:30:43,203
I concur,

738
01:30:43,738 --> 01:30:45,706
but Baoyu is still in love with Daiyu.

739
01:30:47,241 --> 01:30:49,709
We should settle this matter in secret.

740
01:30:54,749 --> 01:30:56,717
I think it's a good idea.

741
01:30:59,587 --> 01:31:01,214
What's so funny?

742
01:31:02,256 --> 01:31:03,723
Master Baoyu marrying Baochai?

743
01:31:04,292 --> 01:31:05,884
Why is that funny?

744
01:31:07,762 --> 01:31:10,560
Miss Baochai is Baoyu's first cousin on his
mother's side.

745
01:31:10,765 --> 01:31:12,733
What would we call her?

746
01:31:14,769 --> 01:31:15,736
Silly wench.

747
01:31:16,137 --> 01:31:19,038
They were having a private conversation.
Don't make a scene.

748
01:31:24,545 --> 01:31:25,375
Yuchuan.

749
01:31:25,780 --> 01:31:26,747
Yes.

750
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:29,074
Why were you shouting?

751
01:31:29,784 --> 01:31:32,753
This silly wench tried to come in. I stopped
her.

752
01:31:33,187 --> 01:31:34,745
If you heard our conversation,

753
01:31:34,889 --> 01:31:36,754
I forbid you to repeat it. Understand?

754
01:31:36,958 --> 01:31:38,255
Yes.

755
01:31:52,306 --> 01:31:54,774
I haven't seen him for days.

756
01:31:56,277 --> 01:31:59,769
I don't know what to expect.

757
01:32:37,518 --> 01:32:39,145
I forgot to take my medicine.

758
01:32:39,387 --> 01:32:40,649
I'll go get it.

759
01:33:07,882 --> 01:33:09,349
Why are you crying?

760
01:33:10,885 --> 01:33:12,853
Sister Yuchuan beat me.

761
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:15,188
Why did she beat you?

762
01:33:15,890 --> 01:33:18,859
For something I said about Master Baoyu
marrying Baochai.

763
01:33:22,897 --> 01:33:25,866
If Master Baoyu marries Baochai,

764
01:33:27,902 --> 01:33:30,871
why would she beat you?

765
01:33:31,072 --> 01:33:34,269
Old Madam and Aunty were talking about
having

766
01:33:34,408 --> 01:33:36,376
Master Baoyu marry Baochai.

767
01:33:36,911 --> 01:33:39,880
And I asked what are we supposed to call
her.

768
01:33:40,414 --> 01:33:42,882
Baochai is his first cousin.

769
01:33:44,418 --> 01:33:46,886
So she slapped my mouth.

770
01:34:02,937 --> 01:34:05,906
Mistress, how did you end up over there?

771
01:34:15,950 --> 01:34:17,918
I want to speak to Baoyu.

772
01:34:21,956 --> 01:34:23,924
Is Master Baoyu home?

773
01:35:02,997 --> 01:35:04,123
Baoyu.

774
01:35:04,999 --> 01:35:06,967
Why are you sick?

775
01:35:08,502 --> 01:35:10,470
I am sick over Miss Lin.

776
01:35:15,176 --> 01:35:17,144
This is not normal.

777
01:35:18,012 --> 01:35:20,981
Zijuan, take her to get some rest.

778
01:35:24,351 --> 01:35:25,978
Mistress, please take a rest.

779
01:35:40,034 --> 01:35:42,002
Mistress, let's go back.

780
01:35:45,439 --> 01:35:46,997
All right.

781
01:35:48,042 --> 01:35:51,011
Time for us to leave.

782
01:36:15,069 --> 01:36:17,037
Meet me in my room.

783
01:36:18,072 --> 01:36:19,039
Yes, madam.

784
01:36:28,382 --> 01:36:31,545
The situation with Baoyu is very serious.

785
01:36:32,586 --> 01:36:35,054
Yesterday, I called in a seer.

786
01:36:36,090 --> 01:36:39,059
She said only a person who is born of gold
can help.

787
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:41,050
Only then can he recover.

788
01:36:43,097 --> 01:36:44,962
I heard it said that Xue Baochai was born
with

789
01:36:45,099 --> 01:36:47,067
a piece of gold in her mouth.

790
01:36:47,568 --> 01:36:50,059
She has made a gold locket from it.

791
01:36:50,604 --> 01:36:53,573
This gold and jade would make for a good
marriage.

792
01:36:54,775 --> 01:36:56,174
What are your thoughts?

793
01:36:56,610 --> 01:36:59,238
Since Old Madam loves him so,

794
01:36:59,613 --> 01:37:03,071
and cares enough to arrange a marriage,

795
01:37:05,119 --> 01:37:08,088
How can I refuse?

796
01:37:08,355 --> 01:37:10,789
But if Baochai's Aunt gives her blessing
and Baoyu remains ill,

797
01:37:11,125 --> 01:37:13,093
then this marriage will be for naught.

798
01:37:14,962 --> 01:37:17,089
I've already consulted your daughter-in-
law.

799
01:37:18,632 --> 01:37:21,601
Her aunt's given her blessing, concerned
for Baoyu's health.

800
01:37:22,136 --> 01:37:25,105
She'll follow the matrimonial rites
according to southern law.

801
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:29,109
Send for a sedan chair with eight men to
bear them.

802
01:37:29,310 --> 01:37:30,937
They'll take their vows in the hall,

803
01:37:31,145 --> 01:37:33,113
then entreat to the nuptial chamber.

804
01:37:34,148 --> 01:37:37,117
And what about friends and relatives?

805
01:37:38,152 --> 01:37:41,121
We don't need to bother.

806
01:37:43,557 --> 01:37:45,115
When Baoyu recovers,

807
01:37:45,326 --> 01:37:47,123
we'll let them know and then invite them.

808
01:37:47,261 --> 01:37:48,421
All right.

809
01:37:49,063 --> 01:37:51,122
We did our part.

810
01:37:51,498 --> 01:37:53,625
Now you do yours.

811
01:37:54,168 --> 01:37:55,135
Yes.

812
01:38:05,179 --> 01:38:07,147
This affair has me worried a bit.

813
01:38:08,682 --> 01:38:11,150
Worried a bit, indeed.

814
01:38:14,188 --> 01:38:17,157
I know what you mean, Old Madam.

815
01:38:17,658 --> 01:38:20,149
You're afraid that Baoyu still loves Miss
Lin.

816
01:38:20,361 --> 01:38:23,660
He will take no pleasure in marrying
Baochai, yes?

817
01:38:24,198 --> 01:38:27,656
Yes, it's a difficult matter.

818
01:38:29,203 --> 01:38:30,932
Old Madam, you need not worry.

819
01:38:31,705 --> 01:38:33,172
Let me talk to Baoyu.

820
01:38:34,208 --> 01:38:36,176
I have a plan.

821
01:38:36,377 --> 01:38:37,503
Okay, do it.

822
01:38:47,221 --> 01:38:48,688
Brother Baoyu, congratulations.

823
01:38:49,223 --> 01:38:53,182
Old Master has already chosen a day for
your wedding.

824
01:38:57,231 --> 01:39:00,200
It's Miss Lin you wish to marry, isn't it?

825
01:39:05,239 --> 01:39:06,706
Old Master says,

826
01:39:07,241 --> 01:39:09,209
while you are ill, you can marry Miss Lin.

827
01:39:09,410 --> 01:39:11,378
But if you stay silly, she won't marry you.

828
01:39:14,248 --> 01:39:16,216
I'm not silly. You're silly.

829
01:39:17,084 --> 01:39:19,211
I go to see Miss Lin.

830
01:39:21,755 --> 01:39:23,916
Miss Lin is the bride now.

831
01:39:24,258 --> 01:39:26,726
She is bashful and unwilling to see you.

832
01:39:32,766 --> 01:39:34,233
Fortunately, my heart

833
01:39:34,335 --> 01:39:36,235
belongs to Miss Lin.

834
01:39:36,437 --> 01:39:39,406
She will bring it to me when we are
married

835
01:39:40,274 --> 01:39:42,242
or put it in my belly.

836
01:39:50,284 --> 01:39:51,581
How did it go?

837
01:39:52,286 --> 01:39:56,245
I see we'll need to make a switch.

838
01:39:56,623 --> 01:39:58,750
What sort of switch?

839
01:40:01,295 --> 01:40:04,264
We tell Master Baoyu that Miss Lin

840
01:40:04,465 --> 01:40:06,956
is to be wed to him.

841
01:40:07,301 --> 01:40:10,429
While we disguise Miss Baochai to
secretly take her vows.

842
01:40:17,311 --> 01:40:19,745
Good plan.

843
01:40:21,315 --> 01:40:23,783
Though Miss Baochai may frown upon it.

844
01:40:42,336 --> 01:40:43,462
Miss.

845
01:40:44,338 --> 01:40:47,307
I know you've no reason to listen to me.

846
01:40:48,342 --> 01:40:50,810
But with Baoyu's illness so severe,

847
01:40:51,345 --> 01:40:53,142
how can they hold a wedding for him?

848
01:41:12,066 --> 01:41:12,964
Give me some light.

849
01:41:13,367 --> 01:41:14,334
I'm about to throw up

850
01:41:15,369 --> 01:41:18,338
and I want to see if anything's wrong.

851
01:41:34,388 --> 01:41:35,355
Blood.

852
01:41:42,396 --> 01:41:44,364
Don't be afraid.

853
01:41:51,905 --> 01:41:53,372
Mistress, Mistress.

854
01:41:55,409 --> 01:41:56,376
Mistress.

855
01:41:56,910 --> 01:41:58,377
Mistress.

856
01:42:22,436 --> 01:42:25,405
The betrothed will enter through this door

857
01:42:25,606 --> 01:42:27,403
with Aunt Xue.

858
01:42:28,275 --> 01:42:30,607
Do not let our guests from Xiaoxiang
Garden know.

859
01:42:30,878 --> 01:42:31,902
Yes, madam.

860
01:42:34,548 --> 01:42:36,573
What is your wish, madam?

861
01:42:39,853 --> 01:42:43,721
Tell Baoyu that today is a joyous day.

862
01:42:44,458 --> 01:42:46,722
He will be married to Miss Lin.

863
01:42:47,461 --> 01:42:49,725
He must not act silly from here on.

864
01:42:49,897 --> 01:42:52,195
After he'd heard he will wed Miss Lin,

865
01:42:52,466 --> 01:42:55,435
His head seems a little more clear.

866
01:43:38,512 --> 01:43:39,570
Handkerchief.

867
01:43:40,514 --> 01:43:42,482
Handkerchief... in the chest.

868
01:44:01,034 --> 01:44:02,001
No... not this one.

869
01:44:02,536 --> 01:44:05,505
The one with the embroidery.

870
01:44:45,579 --> 01:44:48,548
Mistress, what's the matter?

871
01:44:51,585 --> 01:44:54,554
Heat... heat.

872
01:44:57,357 --> 01:44:58,551
The brazier.

873
01:45:26,620 --> 01:45:29,589
Mistress, what are you doing?

874
01:46:00,654 --> 01:46:03,282
Mistress... Mistress... Mistress!

875
01:46:07,661 --> 01:46:09,094
What's wrong with Mistress Lin?

876
01:46:20,974 --> 01:46:24,068
Zijuan, come with me.

877
01:46:36,523 --> 01:46:38,650
I see Mistress Lin doesn't look well.

878
01:46:39,359 --> 01:46:41,418
But it's of no consequence.

879
01:46:42,195 --> 01:46:43,992
This isn't Old Madam's affair

880
01:46:44,197 --> 01:46:46,165
and she needs you now.

881
01:46:46,466 --> 01:46:47,660
Let me take you to her.

882
01:46:49,703 --> 01:46:50,670
I cannot.

883
01:46:50,871 --> 01:46:53,840
Look at her. I can't leave her side.

884
01:46:54,708 --> 01:46:57,438
Tell her this.

885
01:46:57,711 --> 01:46:59,440
If Mistress Lin stops breathing,

886
01:46:59,713 --> 01:47:01,180
I will leave.

887
01:47:01,715 --> 01:47:04,684
But why give me orders at this time?

888
01:47:07,721 --> 01:47:10,690
If you can't go, then call Xueyan.

889
01:47:34,181 --> 01:47:35,876
Tell her yourself.

890
01:48:02,776 --> 01:48:04,744
Zijuan, I'm going.

891
01:48:32,806 --> 01:48:34,774
Since you are marrying Miss Lin,

892
01:48:34,975 --> 01:48:36,943
your head must remain clear.

893
01:48:37,210 --> 01:48:39,770
If you act silly, she will be very angry.

894
01:48:40,814 --> 01:48:42,782
I know. I know.

895
01:48:44,851 --> 01:48:46,876
Miss Lin is coming from the garden.

896
01:48:47,821 --> 01:48:50,221
Is there a problem? Why isn't she here
yet?

897
01:48:52,325 --> 01:48:54,793
When the time is right, she'll be here.

898
01:51:21,975 --> 01:51:23,943
Xueyan, I'm weak.

899
01:51:29,983 --> 01:51:31,041
Xueyan.

900
01:51:32,552 --> 01:51:34,952
She went to Old Madam.

901
01:51:36,556 --> 01:51:37,955
I'm Zijuan.

902
01:51:44,497 --> 01:51:45,464
Zijuan,

903
01:51:49,502 --> 01:51:53,302
I have nothing here.

904
01:51:56,009 --> 01:51:56,976
Listen.

905
01:52:01,514 --> 01:52:05,974
My body is clean.

906
01:52:10,023 --> 01:52:11,991
Call them.

907
01:52:13,026 --> 01:52:15,995
Send... me...

908
01:52:19,599 --> 01:52:20,998
Send... me... back.

909
01:52:22,035 --> 01:52:23,502
Yes, mistress.

910
01:52:31,044 --> 01:52:32,011
Baoyu.

911
01:52:33,046 --> 01:52:35,014
Baoyu.

912
01:52:41,054 --> 01:52:44,023
Hello.

913
01:52:48,061 --> 01:52:49,528
Miss Lin.

914
01:53:17,090 --> 01:53:20,059
Miss Lin, I haven't seen you for days.

915
01:53:21,094 --> 01:53:24,063
Ironically, you are now beneath the
wedding veil.

916
01:53:27,100 --> 01:53:29,068
Why do you need to cover your face?

917
01:53:47,120 --> 01:53:48,587
I want to...

918
01:53:49,122 --> 01:53:51,090
Would she be angry?

919
01:53:53,126 --> 01:53:54,593
She will not.

920
01:54:29,596 --> 01:54:31,120
Where am I?

921
01:54:32,165 --> 01:54:34,133
Am I in a dream?

922
01:54:35,168 --> 01:54:37,033
Today is your special day.

923
01:54:37,170 --> 01:54:39,638
What dream do you mean?

924
01:54:48,181 --> 01:54:49,614
Who is she?

925
01:54:50,183 --> 01:54:53,152
She is your fiancée, Xue Baochai.

926
01:54:53,686 --> 01:54:54,914
No... no...

927
01:54:55,188 --> 01:54:57,156
I am to marry Miss Lin. Where is she?

928
01:54:57,690 --> 01:55:00,158
Don't shout. Old Madam and Aunty are
here.

929
01:55:01,895 --> 01:55:03,453
I have to find Miss Lin.

930
01:55:04,364 --> 01:55:05,922
You'll do no such thing.

931
01:55:06,199 --> 01:55:08,167
Miss Lin is very ill.

932
01:55:08,368 --> 01:55:11,997
When she recovers, she will see you.

933
01:55:14,707 --> 01:55:16,675
Of course. She's ill.

934
01:55:17,210 --> 01:55:19,178
I've also become ill.

935
01:55:20,647 --> 01:55:22,171
We will both die.

936
01:55:25,218 --> 01:55:27,186
Old Madam, I beg you.

937
01:55:28,221 --> 01:55:32,180
Beg you to give us an empty house.

938
01:55:33,226 --> 01:55:36,195
Let me die with Lin Daiyu

939
01:55:36,296 --> 01:55:37,695
together.

940
01:55:40,233 --> 01:55:42,201
Old Madam, I beg you.

941
01:56:15,268 --> 01:56:16,735
Have some porridge.

942
01:56:19,105 --> 01:56:21,403
Master has promised me the hand of Miss
Lin.

943
01:56:22,041 --> 01:56:24,339
Why did Baochai take her place?

944
01:56:31,284 --> 01:56:33,081
I was to be married to you.

945
01:56:33,286 --> 01:56:36,255
Your father and Old Madam has agreed.

946
01:56:37,290 --> 01:56:40,259
It was not my idea.

947
01:56:41,294 --> 01:56:42,761
Even now,

948
01:56:43,296 --> 01:56:46,265
you still pine for Miss Lin.

949
01:56:49,302 --> 01:56:52,760
It will make Old Madam feel sad.

950
01:56:55,308 --> 01:56:57,606
Don't talk to me.

951
01:56:58,311 --> 01:57:00,279
Who do you tell these lies to?

952
01:57:05,318 --> 01:57:07,286
Honestly, I tell you.

953
01:57:08,321 --> 01:57:10,289
Your sweetheart Lin Daiyu

954
01:57:12,325 --> 01:57:14,293
has just died.

955
01:57:16,829 --> 01:57:17,796
She's dead?

956
01:57:18,631 --> 01:57:19,791
When?

957
01:57:20,333 --> 01:57:23,791
On the day of our wedding.

958
01:57:31,344 --> 01:57:34,313
Baoyu, please don't be uncivil.

959
01:57:35,348 --> 01:57:36,315
I'll do as I please.

960
01:57:36,849 --> 01:57:39,317
Lin Daiyu has died. I've never been more
serious.

961
01:57:43,356 --> 01:57:45,324
Baoyu. Baoyu.

962
01:57:58,371 --> 01:57:59,338
Miss Lin.

963
01:58:00,373 --> 01:58:02,671
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

964
01:58:16,389 --> 01:58:19,358
Whose nails have pared your face?

965
01:58:21,394 --> 01:58:22,361
It's just a piece of rouge.

966
01:58:23,896 --> 01:58:25,523
You really should be more discreet.

967
01:58:25,731 --> 01:58:30,361
Otherwise, we'll both be blamed for it.

968
01:58:31,804 --> 01:58:35,069
My body feels weak.

969
01:58:35,908 --> 01:58:37,375
Touched by such exquisite beauty.

970
01:58:38,010 --> 01:58:40,137
What are you saying?

971
01:58:40,413 --> 01:58:42,881
I'll tell Uncle and Aunt.

972
01:58:43,416 --> 01:58:45,714
You show me such licentious songs

973
01:58:45,918 --> 01:58:47,715
and impudent verse,

974
01:58:48,254 --> 01:58:49,380
only to humiliate me.

975
01:58:51,190 --> 01:58:52,885
Dear miss,

976
01:58:53,426 --> 01:58:55,394
if I had the heart to humiliate you,

977
01:58:55,928 --> 01:58:58,396
then tomorrow, let me be a tortoise and
drop into the river.

978
01:59:02,935 --> 01:59:05,403
The world is no banquet.

979
01:59:05,638 --> 01:59:08,402
Tomorrow I shall return home.

980
01:59:08,774 --> 01:59:10,399
What about you?

981
01:59:10,443 --> 01:59:12,172
I'll follow you.

982
01:59:12,445 --> 01:59:13,571
If I should die?

983
01:59:14,447 --> 01:59:16,745
If you should die, I shall become a monk.

984
01:59:20,953 --> 01:59:22,079
Baoyu.

985
01:59:22,455 --> 01:59:23,581
Baoyu.

986
01:59:24,457 --> 01:59:25,583
Baoyu.

987
01:59:38,471 --> 01:59:39,768
Zijuan, come help.

988
01:59:39,972 --> 01:59:43,601
I'll call Old Madam and Aunty.

989
01:59:55,988 --> 01:59:58,456
You just missed her.

990
01:59:58,991 --> 02:00:00,458
It's too late.

991
02:00:02,495 --> 02:00:04,156
I know.

992
02:00:09,502 --> 02:00:12,960
I don't even know her last words.

993
02:00:15,508 --> 02:00:18,477
She said she has no close relatives here.

994
02:00:20,012 --> 02:00:24,176
She wished to be buried in the south.

995
02:00:28,521 --> 02:00:31,979
She... what else did she say?

996
02:00:34,527 --> 02:00:36,495
When she spoke her last breath,

997
02:00:37,029 --> 02:00:39,497
she called out your name.

998
02:00:54,547 --> 02:00:56,014
Miss Lin.

999
02:00:56,549 --> 02:01:00,007
I will never forget your love for me.

1000
02:01:41,427 --> 02:01:42,553
Baoyu.

1001
02:01:43,596 --> 02:01:45,063
He just left.

1002
02:01:46,098 --> 02:01:48,566
Xiren, he's probably returned to his room.

1003
02:01:48,768 --> 02:01:49,894
Go find him.

1004
02:02:14,627 --> 02:02:18,586
He never runs outside aimlessly.

1005
02:02:19,632 --> 02:02:22,965
Why did he just leave?

1006
02:02:26,138 --> 02:02:28,606
Don't worry. I'm sure he...

1007
02:02:29,642 --> 02:02:30,609
Sir.

1008
02:02:32,645 --> 02:02:34,112
It's Mister Jiao.

1009
02:02:38,484 --> 02:02:39,451
What is it?

1010
02:02:39,652 --> 02:02:40,619
Master,

1011
02:02:41,654 --> 02:02:44,122
I've been all over Beijing.

1012
02:02:44,323 --> 02:02:47,121
Inside and outside, I've asked around.

1013
02:02:47,660 --> 02:02:50,128
No news.

1014
02:02:50,496 --> 02:02:51,622
Just one man who told me,

1015
02:02:51,997 --> 02:02:53,624
he'd met a man under Wutai Mountain

1016
02:02:54,166 --> 02:02:57,624
who very much resembled our Master
Baoyu.

1017
02:02:58,671 --> 02:03:01,640
But he can't swear it's him.

1018
02:03:04,176 --> 02:03:07,634
I should have seen this coming.

1019
02:04:19,251 --> 02:04:22,550
The End

1020
02:04:22,755 --> 02:04:25,223
