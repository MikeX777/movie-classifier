1
00:02:14,756 --> 00:02:16,553
Got him. Right on the nose.

2
00:02:20,396 --> 00:02:23,035
It's all right. He had it coming to him.

3
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:25,075
He's always making trouble.

4
00:02:25,156 --> 00:02:27,670
One of these days, Tarzan'll get mad...

5
00:02:27,956 --> 00:02:30,311
and that'll be the end of Mr. Leopard.

6
00:02:44,756 --> 00:02:46,747
Cheetah, don't get too rough.

7
00:02:46,836 --> 00:02:48,554
He's only a baby.

8
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,349
You better stop, Cheetah.

9
00:02:58,436 --> 00:03:01,189
If his mother shows up,
she'll eat your head off.

10
00:03:14,996 --> 00:03:16,714
Tarzan's going for a swim.

11
00:03:45,596 --> 00:03:46,665
Swim.

12
00:06:12,836 --> 00:06:15,225
Cheetah, stop teasing Buli.

13
00:06:18,996 --> 00:06:21,715
Cheetah, I warn you now.
Stop teasing Buli.

14
00:06:43,676 --> 00:06:47,464
I suppose they just wouldn't be happy
if they weren't wrangling all the time.

15
00:06:47,556 --> 00:06:50,673
Buli happy, Cheetah happy, Jane happy...

16
00:06:51,236 --> 00:06:52,589
Tarzan happy.

17
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,509
Tarzan, stop it.

18
00:06:58,996 --> 00:07:00,509
Hey, look what I found.

19
00:07:00,596 --> 00:07:03,064
Shiny stones. Real heavy ones, too.

20
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,475
Just right for my sling.

21
00:07:04,556 --> 00:07:07,024
Boy, let me see those stones a moment.

22
00:07:07,116 --> 00:07:09,584
- Where'd you find them?
- At the bottom of the pool.

23
00:07:09,676 --> 00:07:11,075
They're gold.

24
00:07:11,796 --> 00:07:13,946
- Gold nuggets.
- Gold?

25
00:07:14,036 --> 00:07:15,071
Nuggets?

26
00:07:15,156 --> 00:07:17,545
Yes. Lumps of a very precious metal.

27
00:07:21,436 --> 00:07:23,825
More nuggets up mountain. Big nuggets.

28
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,669
If people in the outside world
heard there was gold here...

29
00:07:26,756 --> 00:07:28,986
they'd come swarming up here
like an army of ants.

30
00:07:29,076 --> 00:07:30,111
Why, Mother?

31
00:07:30,196 --> 00:07:33,791
Back in civilization, darling,
one can buy anything one wants with gold.

32
00:07:33,876 --> 00:07:34,911
Almost.

33
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,509
Buy? What's "buy"?

34
00:07:37,116 --> 00:07:39,994
Well, supposing I have some fruit
and Tarzan's hungry...

35
00:07:40,076 --> 00:07:43,113
Tarzan gives me the gold,
and I give him the fruit.

36
00:07:43,236 --> 00:07:45,147
Tarzan hungry. Want dinner.

37
00:07:46,436 --> 00:07:48,506
Cheetah's choking on the gold.

38
00:07:55,756 --> 00:07:58,111
Gold no good. Tarzan get dinner.

39
00:08:26,516 --> 00:08:28,950
And so you see, here when we want food...

40
00:08:29,036 --> 00:08:31,266
Tarzan just goes out and catches it.

41
00:08:31,396 --> 00:08:33,626
Mother, why do people in...

42
00:08:34,396 --> 00:08:35,795
Civilization?

43
00:08:36,036 --> 00:08:40,314
Yes, but why do they have to buy clothes,
food, and houses? Why?

44
00:08:40,556 --> 00:08:42,228
Darling, I honestly don't know.

45
00:08:42,316 --> 00:08:45,513
It's a problem they've been trying to settle
for hundreds of years...

46
00:08:45,596 --> 00:08:48,668
and they haven't settled it yet.
At least they hadn't when I left.

47
00:08:48,756 --> 00:08:51,031
What else do they have
in the civilization, Mother?

48
00:08:51,116 --> 00:08:53,266
Lots of things.
There's the radio, for instance.

49
00:08:53,356 --> 00:08:56,871
It's like a box, and you can hear
music and voices coming right out of it.

50
00:08:56,956 --> 00:08:58,594
You mean the box can talk?

51
00:08:58,676 --> 00:09:00,826
Not really. But the voices come out of it...

52
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:04,067
and it sounds as though
people were right there in the box talking.

53
00:09:04,156 --> 00:09:06,306
Are the eggs done yet, Cheetah?

54
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:15,745
Not yet?

55
00:09:18,316 --> 00:09:20,352
Tarzan, what lovely grapes.

56
00:09:20,876 --> 00:09:23,470
Tell me some more
about civilization, Mother.

57
00:09:23,556 --> 00:09:24,989
Then they have airplanes...

58
00:09:25,076 --> 00:09:28,307
houses with wings that fly,
and they carry people through the air.

59
00:09:28,396 --> 00:09:30,432
They go faster than anything
you've ever seen.

60
00:09:30,516 --> 00:09:33,667
- Faster than Tarzan?
- Much faster. Faster than the wind.

61
00:09:33,756 --> 00:09:35,906
Is civilization very far from here, Mother?

62
00:09:35,996 --> 00:09:38,191
Now, darling,
just you forget about civilization.

63
00:09:38,276 --> 00:09:41,632
Our world here is far more lovely
and exciting than the outside world...

64
00:09:41,716 --> 00:09:42,705
I promise you.

65
00:09:42,796 --> 00:09:45,788
Now, you run and get the caviar
from the refrigerator.

66
00:10:02,196 --> 00:10:04,027
Good, the eggs are ready.

67
00:10:07,156 --> 00:10:10,307
Here, Cheetah, take these
and cool them in the brook.

68
00:10:15,956 --> 00:10:17,594
Doesn't this look cool and appetizing?

69
00:10:17,676 --> 00:10:20,873
In the outside world, you'd have to pay
quite a lot of gold for this.

70
00:10:20,956 --> 00:10:21,991
For fish eggs?

71
00:10:22,076 --> 00:10:24,636
When the fish eggs happen to be caviar.

72
00:10:25,276 --> 00:10:28,985
Now, Cheetah, you bring the eggs
over here, and no monkey business.

73
00:10:30,276 --> 00:10:31,914
Cheetah, stop that.

74
00:10:34,956 --> 00:10:37,186
No monkey business now, Cheetah.

75
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:39,666
Come on, Cheetah. Now, hurry up.

76
00:11:10,516 --> 00:11:14,111
Cheetah, you've had enough grapes.
Come on, help with the dishes.

77
00:11:27,956 --> 00:11:29,628
Gold's been used for lots of things.

78
00:11:29,716 --> 00:11:33,072
But it's the first time I've seen it used
for chasing hyenas.

79
00:11:33,996 --> 00:11:35,554
Jane like Tarzan?

80
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:38,669
What woman wouldn't like a husband
who brings her orchids?

81
00:11:38,756 --> 00:11:41,316
There's a whole valley of orchids
just across the river.

82
00:11:41,396 --> 00:11:44,354
I know, but out in civilization
they don't grow that way.

83
00:11:44,436 --> 00:11:46,904
You have to be very rich to have them.

84
00:11:46,996 --> 00:11:49,794
You don't realize what a very wealthy man
your father is.

85
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,275
Who? Tarzan?

86
00:11:52,036 --> 00:11:55,506
Yes, he has everything
any man could want. Everything.

87
00:11:56,076 --> 00:11:57,634
Tarzan have Jane.

88
00:12:00,316 --> 00:12:01,715
You have Jane, all right.

89
00:12:01,796 --> 00:12:05,232
You'll have me in a thousand pieces
if you're not careful.

90
00:12:05,876 --> 00:12:07,594
That's for the orchid.

91
00:12:07,676 --> 00:12:10,031
Let's walk over to
civilization tonight, Mother...

92
00:12:10,116 --> 00:12:12,584
- before we go to bed.
- You've had a long and busy day.

93
00:12:12,676 --> 00:12:14,746
You'll go home, say your prayers,
and go to bed.

94
00:12:14,836 --> 00:12:15,871
Cheetah!

95
00:12:16,676 --> 00:12:19,793
Take these plates to the river
and wash them. And don't break them.

96
00:12:19,876 --> 00:12:21,787
Remember, no juggling.

97
00:12:32,676 --> 00:12:34,234
Buli, stop that.

98
00:12:34,396 --> 00:12:36,273
Leave those dishes alone.

99
00:13:31,876 --> 00:13:34,344
Bad Buli. You'll wake Tarzan. Come on.

100
00:13:47,356 --> 00:13:48,948
Cheetah, go home.

101
00:13:50,236 --> 00:13:52,227
Cheetah, you have to go home.

102
00:14:28,236 --> 00:14:31,353
You'll have to go back, Buli.
You can't cross here.

103
00:14:33,516 --> 00:14:36,952
You think you're smart, pretty cute,
don't you, the way you followed me?

104
00:14:37,036 --> 00:14:39,504
Well, you can just go back with Buli.

105
00:14:53,236 --> 00:14:54,385
Come on!

106
00:15:04,796 --> 00:15:06,832
Hurry up, Cheetah! Hurry up!

107
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:31,989
Come on, Cheetah.

108
00:17:58,076 --> 00:18:00,192
Stay there. I'll get you out.

109
00:18:43,876 --> 00:18:46,310
That rhino was mad, all right, wasn't he?

110
00:18:46,396 --> 00:18:48,864
You know where I'm going?
I'm going to civilization.

111
00:18:48,956 --> 00:18:51,948
I'm going to buy an airplane.
I've got gold, see.

112
00:19:03,756 --> 00:19:05,109
What did you say?

113
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:11,708
You mean friends.

114
00:19:13,196 --> 00:19:14,424
Friends?

115
00:19:14,516 --> 00:19:17,508
Yes, friends. You, me, friends.

116
00:19:17,596 --> 00:19:19,075
Like Cheetah and me.

117
00:19:23,476 --> 00:19:24,795
Friends.

118
00:19:27,116 --> 00:19:28,515
What's your name?

119
00:19:30,196 --> 00:19:33,393
Yes, what do they call you?
What does your mother call you?

120
00:19:33,476 --> 00:19:34,909
My name's Boy.

121
00:19:35,876 --> 00:19:36,865
Boy?

122
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:38,668
That's right. Boy.

123
00:19:41,836 --> 00:19:43,554
Tumbo. Boy.

124
00:19:49,676 --> 00:19:50,711
Juju!

125
00:19:51,476 --> 00:19:53,512
That come from your village?

126
00:19:54,796 --> 00:19:55,865
Juju!

127
00:20:06,316 --> 00:20:08,546
Why are so many people sick, Tumbo?

128
00:20:47,276 --> 00:20:49,710
She's your mother, Tumbo, isn't she?

129
00:21:09,996 --> 00:21:11,031
Juju.

130
00:21:11,956 --> 00:21:15,187
No, Tumbo, not juju. It's sickness.

131
00:21:27,876 --> 00:21:29,070
Friend.

132
00:21:58,076 --> 00:22:00,351
Tell them I didn't bring the sickness.

133
00:22:29,156 --> 00:22:30,509
I didn't do it.

134
00:23:37,196 --> 00:23:38,868
Well, you're safe now, lad...

135
00:23:38,956 --> 00:23:41,868
but what are you doing here
in the middle of the African jungle?

136
00:23:41,956 --> 00:23:43,992
I live here, up on the escarpment.

137
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:48,191
Come on, Tumbo. Friends.

138
00:23:48,356 --> 00:23:50,870
- Friends?
- This is Tumbo, he's my friend.

139
00:23:56,236 --> 00:23:57,749
Nice work, O'Doul.

140
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:00,270
- What's the matter?
- He's fainted. Get some brandy.

141
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:02,233
Make it Irish whiskey, please.

142
00:24:06,716 --> 00:24:08,627
Better make a run for it.

143
00:24:37,996 --> 00:24:39,349
It's Tarzan!

144
00:24:43,676 --> 00:24:44,825
Tarzan!

145
00:24:55,676 --> 00:24:57,792
Tarzan? Then there really is a Tarzan.

146
00:24:57,876 --> 00:25:00,436
For years I've been hearing about him
from the natives.

147
00:25:00,516 --> 00:25:03,030
The White Ape Man they call him,
the King of the Jungle.

148
00:25:03,116 --> 00:25:04,344
- Boy all right?
- I'm fine.

149
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:07,234
You came just in time, Tarzan.
Where's Mother?

150
00:25:07,316 --> 00:25:08,385
Jane wait.

151
00:25:08,476 --> 00:25:10,353
Is she gonna punish me, Tarzan?

152
00:25:10,436 --> 00:25:12,313
Boy wait. Boy find out.

153
00:25:12,516 --> 00:25:16,475
He's the spitting image of
the ancient Irish giant...

154
00:25:16,716 --> 00:25:18,069
Finn McCool.

155
00:25:19,036 --> 00:25:21,106
This is Tarzan. He's my father.

156
00:25:21,196 --> 00:25:23,630
How do you do, Tarzan? My name's Elliott.

157
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,590
Tarzan thank.

158
00:25:27,676 --> 00:25:30,748
We thank you.
You certainly saved our lives just now.

159
00:25:30,836 --> 00:25:33,145
It looked for a while
as though we were finished.

160
00:25:33,236 --> 00:25:34,589
You've a fine boy there.

161
00:25:34,676 --> 00:25:36,155
Fine boy, little Tarzan.

162
00:25:36,236 --> 00:25:39,034
My name is O'Doul, Mr. Tarzan,
Dennis O'Doul.

163
00:25:39,636 --> 00:25:42,275
You're a fine figure of a man, Mr. Tarzan.

164
00:25:42,356 --> 00:25:44,631
I'll wager you have some Irish in you.

165
00:25:46,116 --> 00:25:47,913
Now I'm certain of it.

166
00:25:48,796 --> 00:25:50,752
This is Mr. Medford, Tarzan.

167
00:25:50,836 --> 00:25:53,396
- He's my associate on this expedition.
- How do you do?

168
00:25:53,476 --> 00:25:55,990
- This is Mr. Vandermeer, our guide.
- Glad to know you.

169
00:25:56,076 --> 00:25:59,307
This gentleman you just shook hands with
is our cameraman.

170
00:25:59,876 --> 00:26:01,514
Men not need guns now.

171
00:26:01,596 --> 00:26:03,712
He doesn't like guns. They kill his animals.

172
00:26:03,796 --> 00:26:07,232
You needn't worry, Tarzan.
We're not hunters, we're scientists.

173
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:10,786
We're trying to find an almost
forgotten tribe called the Van-usi.

174
00:26:10,876 --> 00:26:14,027
They're a people that wandered down
from Asia into Africa ages ago.

175
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:15,231
Ever hear of them?

176
00:26:15,316 --> 00:26:16,988
Van-usi? Live up Fyn Mano River.

177
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:19,112
That's just where we figured to find them.

178
00:26:19,196 --> 00:26:21,585
We were trying to find
a pass across the mountains...

179
00:26:21,676 --> 00:26:23,189
when we came across this village.

180
00:26:23,276 --> 00:26:26,154
Safari can't cross mountain.
All ice and snow.

181
00:26:26,476 --> 00:26:27,545
Did you hear that?

182
00:26:27,636 --> 00:26:29,467
I know it will be a hard job...

183
00:26:29,556 --> 00:26:32,024
but I figure we could make it
in eight or ten weeks.

184
00:26:32,116 --> 00:26:33,105
Men die.

185
00:26:33,196 --> 00:26:36,313
Tarzan take safari up escarpment.
Reach river six days.

186
00:26:36,396 --> 00:26:39,069
- Six days?
- That'd be a tremendous help.

187
00:26:39,156 --> 00:26:42,193
Men help Boy, Tarzan help men. Come.

188
00:26:42,556 --> 00:26:44,308
I don't know how to thank you.

189
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:46,193
This is Tumbo. He's my friend.

190
00:26:46,276 --> 00:26:48,232
His mother just died from the sickness.

191
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:49,590
Mother die?

192
00:27:00,836 --> 00:27:04,954
Look at this house on wheels.
It runs and makes noises like an elephant.

193
00:27:05,476 --> 00:27:06,909
Is there an elephant inside?

194
00:27:06,996 --> 00:27:10,386
Well, not exactly an elephant,
but it's 125 horses.

195
00:27:10,476 --> 00:27:12,353
It's an automobile, a truck.

196
00:27:12,676 --> 00:27:14,792
- Truck?
- Horses? Where?

197
00:27:16,396 --> 00:27:17,624
What are horses?

198
00:27:17,716 --> 00:27:19,866
Well, they're like zebras.

199
00:27:19,996 --> 00:27:23,113
They carry all our camp,
and pull the truck a mile a minute.

200
00:27:23,196 --> 00:27:26,154
Truck no good.
One Ubardi spear kill all horses.

201
00:27:26,476 --> 00:27:28,865
No kill elephant. Elephant better.

202
00:27:40,516 --> 00:27:43,906
That's not a gun, Tarzan.
O'Doul was just taking your picture.

203
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:48,105
Something like these, Mr. Tarzan,
if you'd like to have a look.

204
00:27:56,356 --> 00:27:57,789
Cheetah like pictures.

205
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:59,275
Come, let's get loaded up.

206
00:27:59,356 --> 00:28:01,426
Yes, just as soon as I get that tank fixed.

207
00:28:01,516 --> 00:28:02,790
M'Hona!

208
00:28:03,276 --> 00:28:04,504
Get the petrol.

209
00:28:05,436 --> 00:28:07,472
Come on, boys. Get in here.

210
00:28:09,836 --> 00:28:13,431
That's good stuff.
Try a nip of whiskey, Mr. Tarzan.

211
00:28:19,076 --> 00:28:20,395
Whiskey bad.

212
00:28:20,796 --> 00:28:24,471
Mr. Tarzan, you're the last man
I'd have taken for a temperance worker.

213
00:28:24,556 --> 00:28:27,275
I'm afraid there isn't much Irish in you.

214
00:28:38,596 --> 00:28:42,191
Your lad's having the time of his life
with that horn, Mr. Tarzan.

215
00:28:42,716 --> 00:28:44,593
Make noise like rhino.

216
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:46,394
Not so good a noise, I'll wager.

217
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:50,435
No mechanical contrivance can compete
with the voice of a living creature.

218
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:52,914
O'Doul smart man.

219
00:28:54,676 --> 00:28:57,349
Thank you, Mr. Tarzan.
Another compliment like that...

220
00:28:57,436 --> 00:28:59,666
and you'll have
a smart corpse on your hands.

221
00:28:59,756 --> 00:29:01,633
There's nothing like nature.

222
00:29:01,716 --> 00:29:04,628
It's the natural creatures,
the little birds and the beasties.

223
00:29:04,716 --> 00:29:07,105
It's them that touches
the cockles of your heart.

224
00:29:29,676 --> 00:29:31,951
That's the drink.
That's what drink does to you.

225
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:35,187
I'll never touch another drop of drink
as long as I live.

226
00:29:35,676 --> 00:29:38,315
Stop pushing that horn, will you?

227
00:29:39,356 --> 00:29:41,711
When do we come to the escarpment?
Have you any idea?

228
00:29:41,796 --> 00:29:45,505
Pretty soon now. We'll be able to see it
as soon as we get through the woods.

229
00:29:45,596 --> 00:29:47,109
It reaches almost to the sky.

230
00:29:47,196 --> 00:29:49,551
I suppose we'll have to
leave the trucks behind us.

231
00:29:49,636 --> 00:29:51,786
If we had an airplane,
we could fly up there.

232
00:29:51,876 --> 00:29:53,707
Too bad we didn't bring one with us.

233
00:29:53,796 --> 00:29:56,435
I was gonna buy an airplane
when we got to civilization.

234
00:29:56,516 --> 00:30:00,225
I was gonna buy an automobile, too.
A big one, bigger than this one.

235
00:30:00,316 --> 00:30:02,307
I was gonna buy everything.

236
00:30:02,756 --> 00:30:05,873
Look, Tumbo, this is gold.
It buys everything in civilization.

237
00:30:05,956 --> 00:30:07,708
- What's that?
- Gold.

238
00:30:07,796 --> 00:30:08,865
Gold?

239
00:30:08,956 --> 00:30:12,471
- Yes, sir, gold. It buys everything.
- Let me have a look at that.

240
00:30:15,716 --> 00:30:17,115
Look at this.

241
00:30:19,956 --> 00:30:21,230
Where did you get this?

242
00:30:21,316 --> 00:30:23,227
In the river where we swim.

243
00:30:23,316 --> 00:30:26,274
I see. Is there any more of it?

244
00:30:26,516 --> 00:30:28,586
There's lots of it on the bottom.

245
00:30:28,676 --> 00:30:29,995
Lots of it.

246
00:30:30,556 --> 00:30:31,875
What do you do with it?

247
00:30:31,956 --> 00:30:34,834
I use it in my sling.
They're heavier than stones.

248
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,908
Mother says in civilization
you can buy everything with it.

249
00:30:37,996 --> 00:30:40,146
I could buy an airplane with this,
couldn't I?

250
00:30:40,236 --> 00:30:42,067
Yes, I guess you could, son.

251
00:30:42,236 --> 00:30:44,955
Have you told Mr. Elliott
and Mr. O'Doul about this?

252
00:30:45,036 --> 00:30:46,151
No, sir, I haven't.

253
00:30:46,236 --> 00:30:48,033
You know, you shouldn't tell anyone.

254
00:30:48,116 --> 00:30:51,313
In civilization, gold loses its value
if you talk about it too much.

255
00:30:51,396 --> 00:30:53,591
Let's keep this a secret,
just between ourselves.

256
00:30:53,676 --> 00:30:55,712
- Shouldn't I even tell the Professor?
- No.

257
00:30:55,796 --> 00:30:57,275
Then it wouldn't be a secret.

258
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:59,870
Secrets aren't very healthy
on an expedition, Medford.

259
00:30:59,956 --> 00:31:02,834
Why don't we wait
and discuss this point at the proper time?

260
00:31:02,916 --> 00:31:05,111
Tell you what, son,
you keep this a secret...

261
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,107
we'll buy you an airplane for yourself.

262
00:31:07,196 --> 00:31:09,027
- You will?
- We'll buy you two of them.

263
00:31:09,116 --> 00:31:11,425
Then Tumbo can have one, too, can't he?

264
00:31:11,756 --> 00:31:14,111
It's a secret. I won't tell anyone ever.

265
00:31:14,196 --> 00:31:16,790
Go ahead, blow the horn if you feel like it.

266
00:31:26,516 --> 00:31:29,314
Look, Tumbo, there's the escarpment.
That's where I live.

267
00:31:32,436 --> 00:31:33,471
Juju.

268
00:31:34,276 --> 00:31:36,471
There's no juju if Tarzan wants you there.

269
00:31:36,556 --> 00:31:40,071
That's where you're gonna live, Tumbo,
up there with Tarzan, Jane, and me.

270
00:31:40,156 --> 00:31:41,669
Come on.

271
00:32:07,036 --> 00:32:08,389
Thank you, Tarzan.

272
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:10,906
My head was spinning there for a moment.

273
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:13,874
- Escarpment high up.
- Yes, it must be the altitude.

274
00:32:14,596 --> 00:32:15,631
Boy.

275
00:32:18,116 --> 00:32:21,586
Darling, where have you been?

276
00:32:21,796 --> 00:32:24,390
Where did you go?
I've been so worried about you.

277
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:25,795
You gonna punish me, Mother?

278
00:32:25,876 --> 00:32:29,346
No, darling, not now.
But you must never go away again.

279
00:32:29,596 --> 00:32:31,905
- What happened to you?
- Nothing much.

280
00:32:31,996 --> 00:32:35,352
Here's Tumbo. He's my best friend.
Can't talk very well yet, though.

281
00:32:35,436 --> 00:32:37,347
Happy to know you, Tumbo.

282
00:32:38,396 --> 00:32:39,795
- Friends.
- Friend?

283
00:32:39,876 --> 00:32:42,265
I met him just when the rhino
was going to kill him.

284
00:32:42,356 --> 00:32:43,345
What rhino?

285
00:32:43,436 --> 00:32:45,108
Just before we came in the plague.

286
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:46,470
The plague?

287
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:48,747
Tarzan, what happened?
Who are these people?

288
00:32:48,836 --> 00:32:49,951
People?

289
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:58,750
How do you do?

290
00:32:58,836 --> 00:33:01,509
I'm doing better, ma'am,
thanks to your charming presence.

291
00:33:01,596 --> 00:33:03,746
O'Doul good little man, like Cheetah.

292
00:33:04,036 --> 00:33:07,028
Now don't be comparing me with him.

293
00:33:07,516 --> 00:33:09,711
If this hairy heathen resembles anybody...

294
00:33:09,796 --> 00:33:12,868
it's me wife's second brother
Marcus V. O'Connell.

295
00:33:13,836 --> 00:33:17,306
That's the last bottle of Irish whiskey
between here and Dublin.

296
00:33:17,436 --> 00:33:20,155
What are these horrible things
that Boy's been telling me?

297
00:33:20,236 --> 00:33:22,386
Boy have good time. Little Tarzan.

298
00:33:22,476 --> 00:33:25,149
- My name is Medford. Glad to know you.
- How do you do?

299
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:28,114
Tarzan's just been telling me
how kind and brave you've been.

300
00:33:28,196 --> 00:33:31,427
We'll never be able to repay you,
so welcome to our home.

301
00:33:31,516 --> 00:33:33,984
We should have been at a loss
without Tarzan.

302
00:33:34,076 --> 00:33:37,989
Now I am up here, I can understand why
I never could find it indicated on any map.

303
00:33:38,076 --> 00:33:40,510
We like to think of it
as being above and beyond maps.

304
00:33:40,596 --> 00:33:42,188
Sort of a world of our own.

305
00:33:42,276 --> 00:33:44,551
I'm so curious,
I must risk being impertinent.

306
00:33:44,636 --> 00:33:48,265
How does such a lovely person with
your obvious background and position...

307
00:33:48,356 --> 00:33:49,391
come to be here?

308
00:33:49,476 --> 00:33:52,115
A compliment is never impertinent,
Mr. Medford.

309
00:33:52,276 --> 00:33:54,585
I came here. Tarzan and I met.

310
00:33:54,676 --> 00:33:57,793
I fell in love with my future husband.
So naturally I stayed.

311
00:33:57,876 --> 00:33:59,594
You must be very happy here.

312
00:33:59,676 --> 00:34:00,665
We are.

313
00:34:00,756 --> 00:34:02,030
Why, this is Utopia.

314
00:34:02,116 --> 00:34:04,346
Look at the wealth
of this country, Professor.

315
00:34:04,436 --> 00:34:08,145
Just standing here you can see
rubber, palm oil, gum, copra.

316
00:34:08,236 --> 00:34:10,306
- We have caviar, too.
- Caviar?

317
00:34:10,396 --> 00:34:13,866
Yes. Mother says that's what you call
fish eggs in your country.

318
00:34:14,596 --> 00:34:16,985
I suppose this area's
very rich in mineral deposits?

319
00:34:17,076 --> 00:34:20,307
I don't really know, Mr. Medford.
It's possible, I suppose.

320
00:34:23,556 --> 00:34:25,547
My husband's a mind reader.

321
00:34:25,756 --> 00:34:26,950
What did he say?

322
00:34:27,036 --> 00:34:29,504
He says he's sure you're very hungry
because he is.

323
00:34:29,596 --> 00:34:31,791
- We are hungry, too.
- Shall we go to the house?

324
00:34:31,876 --> 00:34:34,436
Now then, all of you, look this way, please.

325
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:38,471
This is going to be a masterpiece.

326
00:34:56,436 --> 00:34:59,746
It'll be out of the fixing bath
in no time at all now.

327
00:35:00,356 --> 00:35:02,267
Boy is having the time of his life.

328
00:35:02,356 --> 00:35:04,472
Just think, he's never seen
a photograph before.

329
00:35:04,556 --> 00:35:08,708
There isn't any need for that sort of thing
in this beautiful, private world you have.

330
00:35:08,796 --> 00:35:10,514
I feel almost like an intruder.

331
00:35:10,596 --> 00:35:12,746
But you're not.
You're a most welcome guest.

332
00:35:12,836 --> 00:35:14,667
We hope you'll stay with us a long time.

333
00:35:14,756 --> 00:35:18,226
There's nothing I'd like better
than to spend the rest of my days here...

334
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:20,955
but I'm afraid we have to push on.
We've a job ahead of us.

335
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:22,833
After you've been here a little while...

336
00:35:22,916 --> 00:35:26,591
you'll find those jobs aren't as important
as you thought they were.

337
00:35:27,596 --> 00:35:29,348
Look, everybody's lost their heads.

338
00:35:29,436 --> 00:35:30,789
They're lost all right.

339
00:35:30,876 --> 00:35:33,709
And you can thank
this long-haired scamp here.

340
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:39,674
What's the matter, Cheetah?

341
00:37:41,436 --> 00:37:43,188
You look awfully funny.

342
00:37:43,276 --> 00:37:44,311
Hey, Boy.

343
00:37:44,396 --> 00:37:47,035
- You want to look through the telescope?
- Yes, sir.

344
00:37:47,116 --> 00:37:48,185
Here.

345
00:37:49,236 --> 00:37:50,669
Here, go ahead.

346
00:37:51,876 --> 00:37:53,355
Do you see the moon?

347
00:37:53,956 --> 00:37:57,505
But I can't see the man in the moon now.
Where's he gone to?

348
00:37:57,596 --> 00:38:00,349
There's no man in the moon.
That's an illusion.

349
00:38:00,436 --> 00:38:02,267
The face you see is made up of shadows...

350
00:38:02,356 --> 00:38:04,392
caused by mountains and craters
on the moon.

351
00:38:04,476 --> 00:38:07,354
I used to like him. He looked so friendly.

352
00:38:07,436 --> 00:38:09,825
Well, you have got new friends now.

353
00:38:10,356 --> 00:38:11,789
Say, by the way...

354
00:38:11,876 --> 00:38:15,152
when are you going to show us the place
where you found the gold?

355
00:38:15,236 --> 00:38:16,715
You mean our secret?

356
00:38:17,116 --> 00:38:19,152
Tomorrow morning. Before anybody's up.

357
00:38:19,236 --> 00:38:20,305
Good. Fine.

358
00:38:20,396 --> 00:38:24,230
I'm so happy Boy's getting a chance to see
something of the wonders of science.

359
00:38:24,316 --> 00:38:25,715
I can never thank you enough.

360
00:38:25,796 --> 00:38:27,832
That's nothing. We're glad to do it.

361
00:38:27,916 --> 00:38:30,146
Professor Elliott has
another surprise for you.

362
00:38:30,236 --> 00:38:31,430
Movies.

363
00:38:31,516 --> 00:38:33,234
Movies? What's that?

364
00:38:33,316 --> 00:38:34,590
Wait till you see.

365
00:38:34,676 --> 00:38:36,906
O'Doul has the projection machine
set up now.

366
00:38:36,996 --> 00:38:39,066
Come on, Boy. You too, Tumbo.

367
00:38:41,676 --> 00:38:44,031
Looks like
we'll be getting up early in the morning.

368
00:38:44,116 --> 00:38:46,232
All ready to start now in a minute, folks.

369
00:38:46,316 --> 00:38:48,955
Sit down there
and make yourselves comfortable.

370
00:39:21,436 --> 00:39:23,028
Isn't it exciting?

371
00:39:38,156 --> 00:39:40,272
There is speed for you, Tarzan.

372
00:39:40,356 --> 00:39:42,586
That train goes at least 100 miles an hour.

373
00:39:42,676 --> 00:39:43,665
Why?

374
00:39:46,716 --> 00:39:48,866
- It gets you there faster.
- Why?

375
00:39:50,036 --> 00:39:52,266
Well, to save time, of course.

376
00:39:53,196 --> 00:39:54,629
What do with time?

377
00:39:54,716 --> 00:39:57,310
I'm afraid he has you there, Vandermeer.

378
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:10,834
Look, Boy. Airplane.

379
00:40:10,956 --> 00:40:12,787
Look, Tumbo, airplane.

380
00:40:13,996 --> 00:40:17,432
That's what Mr. Medford's going to get us
when we get the gold.

381
00:40:28,116 --> 00:40:29,185
Is that all?

382
00:40:29,276 --> 00:40:31,995
Now, it's way past your bedtime, Boy.
You better go to bed.

383
00:40:32,076 --> 00:40:34,465
- But I'm not a bit sleepy.
- Boy, go.

384
00:40:34,556 --> 00:40:36,547
- Good night, Mother.
- Good night, darling.

385
00:40:36,636 --> 00:40:38,115
Good night, Tarzan. Come on, Tumbo.

386
00:40:38,196 --> 00:40:40,790
- Good night, Boy.
- Good night, everybody.

387
00:40:42,716 --> 00:40:46,072
Boy said something
about you and gold and an airplane.

388
00:40:46,156 --> 00:40:48,431
Yes, Medford. What was all that about?

389
00:40:48,716 --> 00:40:49,944
Nothing much.

390
00:40:50,036 --> 00:40:53,551
Just that the other day Boy told me
he'd discovered gold on the escarpment.

391
00:40:53,636 --> 00:40:54,671
Gold up here?

392
00:40:54,756 --> 00:40:57,634
Naturally, I told him
what a great piece of luck it would be...

393
00:40:57,716 --> 00:41:00,184
and I told him about the things
he could buy with gold.

394
00:41:00,276 --> 00:41:01,311
Like the airplanes.

395
00:41:01,396 --> 00:41:02,624
But that's such nonsense.

396
00:41:02,716 --> 00:41:05,435
Little boys tell the most fantastic tales.

397
00:41:07,956 --> 00:41:09,150
That's that.

398
00:41:09,236 --> 00:41:11,909
I'm afraid Boy's going to be disappointed
about the plane.

399
00:41:11,996 --> 00:41:15,272
But, Medford, why didn't you mention
this gold business before?

400
00:41:15,356 --> 00:41:17,916
It was a bit hard to believe, Professor.

401
00:41:17,996 --> 00:41:21,272
I wanted to wait around and dig
and see if I could find the gold.

402
00:41:21,356 --> 00:41:23,187
- No.
- This is any man's country up here.

403
00:41:23,276 --> 00:41:25,915
- Nobody owns this part of the world.
- Tarzan's country.

404
00:41:25,996 --> 00:41:28,510
This is not any man's country.
This is our home.

405
00:41:28,596 --> 00:41:30,268
And we'd be very poor guests indeed...

406
00:41:30,356 --> 00:41:34,144
if we repaid your hospitality by doing
anything to displease Tarzan or yourself.

407
00:41:34,236 --> 00:41:37,467
- I know you'll agree with me on that point.
- Of course.

408
00:41:37,556 --> 00:41:38,830
Jane, come.

409
00:41:38,916 --> 00:41:39,905
Coming.

410
00:41:39,996 --> 00:41:41,509
Good night. Sleep easily.

411
00:41:41,596 --> 00:41:42,745
We leave tomorrow morning...

412
00:41:42,836 --> 00:41:45,748
and you and your family will have
your home to yourselves again.

413
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:48,828
- Jane, come.
- Coming, darling. Thank you, Professor.

414
00:41:48,916 --> 00:41:50,235
Good night.

415
00:41:52,516 --> 00:41:56,475
I'm afraid the O'Douls are born
to be poor to the end of their days.

416
00:41:56,876 --> 00:42:00,710
This is a scientific expedition, and
I'll not permit it to turn into a gold hunt.

417
00:42:00,796 --> 00:42:02,991
- Are you afraid of that savage?
- It isn't that...

418
00:42:03,076 --> 00:42:06,227
but I don't believe we'd have much chance
against him in the jungle.

419
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:08,511
It's simply that
we've been given to understand...

420
00:42:08,596 --> 00:42:11,588
that there is no gold to be had here
and I believe it.

421
00:42:11,676 --> 00:42:13,667
I want to believe it. I like Tarzan.

422
00:42:13,756 --> 00:42:16,270
He's created a beautiful home
in this paradise here...

423
00:42:16,356 --> 00:42:19,075
and I wouldn't want to see it
overrun and destroyed.

424
00:42:19,156 --> 00:42:22,592
I hope you gentlemen
will feel the same way. Good night.

425
00:42:23,396 --> 00:42:24,954
Good night, Professor.

426
00:42:35,876 --> 00:42:37,832
- Thanks.
- Come on.

427
00:42:37,916 --> 00:42:40,430
A little touch of vertigo that hit me.

428
00:42:40,996 --> 00:42:43,715
I thought for a moment there
I'd been drinking.

429
00:42:43,796 --> 00:42:45,434
- You better go to bed now.
- Yes.

430
00:42:45,516 --> 00:42:47,711
You better go to bed and stay there.

431
00:42:49,236 --> 00:42:51,511
- Boy.
- Tarzan, don't wake him now.

432
00:42:51,876 --> 00:42:54,754
Get two airplanes, give one to Tumbo.

433
00:42:54,956 --> 00:42:57,754
I hope all the excitement hasn't upset him.

434
00:42:59,716 --> 00:43:03,470
We better let him sleep. You can talk
to him in the morning. Come on.

435
00:43:11,196 --> 00:43:14,905
You mustn't be angry with him, dear.
He realizes so little yet.

436
00:43:16,036 --> 00:43:18,027
Boy good. People bad.

437
00:43:19,316 --> 00:43:21,466
And we mustn't blame them
for wanting gold.

438
00:43:21,556 --> 00:43:24,024
In the outside world,
gold means as much to them...

439
00:43:24,116 --> 00:43:26,107
as the strength in your arms
means to you.

440
00:43:26,196 --> 00:43:28,107
People... fools.

441
00:43:28,796 --> 00:43:30,309
Not all of them.

442
00:43:30,636 --> 00:43:32,786
But none of them have what we have.

443
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:34,434
Tarzan have Jane.

444
00:43:34,516 --> 00:43:36,950
They'll be gone tomorrow,
and we'll be alone again.

445
00:43:37,036 --> 00:43:39,596
Wonderfully alone as we've always been.

446
00:43:41,836 --> 00:43:44,191
Has it seemed a long time, Tarzan?

447
00:43:44,556 --> 00:43:47,548
Sun make one safari for Jane and Tarzan.

448
00:43:50,636 --> 00:43:53,628
A poet couldn't have said that
more beautifully.

449
00:43:55,436 --> 00:43:56,471
Come.

450
00:44:19,756 --> 00:44:21,712
My, the water's beautiful tonight.

451
00:44:21,796 --> 00:44:23,787
Not water. Jane.

452
00:44:25,356 --> 00:44:29,110
As nice little Mr. O'Doul would say,
"'Tis blarney you're giving me."

453
00:44:29,676 --> 00:44:30,950
Blarney?

454
00:44:31,236 --> 00:44:33,431
Well, we call it love, darling.

455
00:44:33,676 --> 00:44:36,668
Do you remember
when we first used to swim here?

456
00:44:37,036 --> 00:44:38,549
Tarzan remember.

457
00:44:39,316 --> 00:44:42,035
To think that I was ever frightened of you.

458
00:44:43,276 --> 00:44:47,110
You know, Tarzan, when a man meets
a young lady in the outside world...

459
00:44:47,436 --> 00:44:50,394
he doesn't dare behave
not one bit like you did.

460
00:44:50,516 --> 00:44:51,869
What man do?

461
00:44:52,476 --> 00:44:55,912
Well, they shake hands.
That is, if she offers him her hand.

462
00:44:55,996 --> 00:44:59,272
Then he bows from the hips,
and asks permission to call.

463
00:44:59,356 --> 00:45:00,789
And then if she's of age...

464
00:45:00,876 --> 00:45:04,949
he takes her to some parties
or theater or somewhere to dine.

465
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:08,553
And then if he decides
he wants her for his wife...

466
00:45:08,836 --> 00:45:10,588
he goes to see her father.

467
00:45:10,676 --> 00:45:12,314
Why? What do with father?

468
00:45:12,396 --> 00:45:14,910
To ask his permission
to marry his daughter.

469
00:45:14,996 --> 00:45:15,985
Why?

470
00:45:16,436 --> 00:45:19,553
That's the way it's done. Politely.
With etiquette.

471
00:45:20,596 --> 00:45:22,905
Too much talk. Tarzan way better.

472
00:45:25,076 --> 00:45:27,749
Yes. It is better.

473
00:45:28,996 --> 00:45:31,715
Remember? Tarzan, big hand...

474
00:45:32,836 --> 00:45:34,394
Jane, little hand?

475
00:45:54,236 --> 00:45:56,545
- The last one, Mr. Medford.
- You sure?

476
00:45:56,636 --> 00:45:59,150
Yes, sir. I hunted all over the bottom.
There's no more.

477
00:45:59,236 --> 00:46:01,796
- It's not much, is it?
- Is it enough to buy an airplane?

478
00:46:01,876 --> 00:46:02,865
There must be more.

479
00:46:02,956 --> 00:46:05,151
Tarzan knows
where there's a whole mountain of it.

480
00:46:05,236 --> 00:46:06,225
He knows where it is?

481
00:46:06,316 --> 00:46:08,876
- That's what he said.
- I knew there must be more of it.

482
00:46:08,956 --> 00:46:12,471
This isn't river gold.
It came from a vein of almost solid metal.

483
00:46:14,756 --> 00:46:17,714
We've been waiting breakfast for you.
What have you been doing?

484
00:46:17,796 --> 00:46:20,788
We were sure you were wrong
about there not being any gold here.

485
00:46:20,876 --> 00:46:23,674
Look at these. Boy brought them up
from the bed of the river.

486
00:46:23,756 --> 00:46:25,474
Men say they go last night.

487
00:46:25,556 --> 00:46:27,626
Now, let's be friends and talk this over.

488
00:46:27,716 --> 00:46:30,389
Boy told us you know
where there's a mountain full of gold.

489
00:46:30,476 --> 00:46:32,432
- Go!
- Please, madam, let's be sensible.

490
00:46:32,516 --> 00:46:34,154
We'll handle the entire operations...

491
00:46:34,236 --> 00:46:36,192
and there will be great wealth for all of us.

492
00:46:36,276 --> 00:46:38,073
You can be the richest woman
in the world.

493
00:46:38,156 --> 00:46:40,875
I've no wish to be.
I told you last night, this is our home.

494
00:46:40,956 --> 00:46:43,629
We don't want it disturbed.
I was hoping you'd understand.

495
00:46:43,716 --> 00:46:46,947
Suppose we don't choose to recognize
that you and he have any right...

496
00:46:47,036 --> 00:46:48,310
Tarzan say go.

497
00:46:48,396 --> 00:46:50,034
Now, wait a minute...

498
00:46:56,836 --> 00:46:58,474
Jane, Boy, home.

499
00:47:00,596 --> 00:47:01,824
Men go.

500
00:47:03,676 --> 00:47:05,394
That man is a madman, Professor.

501
00:47:05,476 --> 00:47:08,195
- There is gold here. Just as the boy said.
- I see.

502
00:47:08,276 --> 00:47:10,836
There's every indication
it's a very rich vein.

503
00:47:10,916 --> 00:47:12,065
Safari go.

504
00:47:12,156 --> 00:47:15,307
I'm sorry, Tarzan, I didn't know this
or it wouldn't have happened.

505
00:47:15,396 --> 00:47:18,513
We'd be ready to start now
if O'Doul hadn't suddenly been taken ill.

506
00:47:18,596 --> 00:47:21,554
He's very sick at the moment.
We'll leave immediately he's well.

507
00:47:21,636 --> 00:47:23,706
- Little man sick?
- Touch of fever.

508
00:47:24,116 --> 00:47:25,754
- Where?
- There.

509
00:47:38,996 --> 00:47:41,715
Ubardi plague. Tarzan cure.

510
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:47,795
Is Mr. Tarzan gone?

511
00:47:47,956 --> 00:47:50,345
Yes, but he'll be back soon,
I'm pretty sure.

512
00:47:50,436 --> 00:47:53,269
Then I want to tell you
something about him.

513
00:47:53,716 --> 00:47:56,913
- I was back in old Dublin just now.
- Take it easy.

514
00:47:57,396 --> 00:47:59,626
I was departing here, Professor.

515
00:47:59,836 --> 00:48:01,428
I'm certain I was.

516
00:48:03,556 --> 00:48:05,786
And then Mr. Tarzan walked in...

517
00:48:07,276 --> 00:48:09,471
I stopped, I couldn't go on.

518
00:48:10,676 --> 00:48:12,871
He put his hand on me head...

519
00:48:13,356 --> 00:48:17,713
and it yanked me back to life
as sudden as a rope around me body.

520
00:48:20,116 --> 00:48:21,754
It's hard to die...

521
00:48:22,516 --> 00:48:24,666
when Mr. Tarzan is around.

522
00:48:31,356 --> 00:48:34,348
Would you kindly give me
a sip of cool water?

523
00:48:37,076 --> 00:48:39,385
That's where I was, back in old Dublin.

524
00:48:49,596 --> 00:48:51,029
Medicine cure.

525
00:48:55,276 --> 00:48:57,346
- Better soon.
- Thank you.

526
00:48:58,236 --> 00:49:00,989
It's a fine Christian you are, Mr. Tarzan.

527
00:49:08,836 --> 00:49:10,269
He's terribly sick, Tarzan.

528
00:49:10,356 --> 00:49:12,950
He collapsed
on his way back from the river.

529
00:49:16,476 --> 00:49:17,875
Ubardi plague.

530
00:49:19,516 --> 00:49:21,746
Tarzan get medicine. Tarzan cure.

531
00:49:23,996 --> 00:49:26,226
I'm afraid, I'm terribly afraid.

532
00:49:26,596 --> 00:49:27,745
Tarzan cure.

533
00:49:27,956 --> 00:49:30,834
We should never have allowed him
out in the jungle by himself.

534
00:49:30,916 --> 00:49:32,554
It's all my fault.

535
00:49:33,276 --> 00:49:34,470
He's dying.

536
00:49:35,876 --> 00:49:37,594
Tarzan get medicine.

537
00:49:37,956 --> 00:49:39,548
Boy better soon.

538
00:49:58,516 --> 00:50:00,507
Your fever's broken, Dennis.

539
00:50:01,116 --> 00:50:04,153
Now you won't need any more medicine
for a while.

540
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:07,674
I'm glad you've come, gentlemen.

541
00:50:07,756 --> 00:50:09,428
O'Doul is getting better.

542
00:50:10,076 --> 00:50:12,067
Tarzan's medicine did the trick.

543
00:50:12,396 --> 00:50:14,512
What's the matter with you, Professor?

544
00:50:14,596 --> 00:50:15,995
You don't look so good to me.

545
00:50:16,076 --> 00:50:18,829
I'm all right.
Just a little rocky at the moment.

546
00:50:22,316 --> 00:50:24,386
We'll break camp first thing
tomorrow morning.

547
00:50:24,476 --> 00:50:26,273
O'Doul will be able to travel then.

548
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:28,916
We've no intention of leaving
the escarpment, Professor.

549
00:50:28,996 --> 00:50:30,224
Not for a while, anyway.

550
00:50:30,316 --> 00:50:32,784
You're still members of this expedition...

551
00:50:33,276 --> 00:50:34,675
and I'm still in charge.

552
00:50:34,756 --> 00:50:37,350
We are not interested
in your expedition anymore.

553
00:50:37,436 --> 00:50:38,551
I see.

554
00:50:40,556 --> 00:50:42,831
So that's what the guns are all about.

555
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:50,074
And you're the gentlemen who look upon
Tarzan as some sort of barbarian.

556
00:50:52,316 --> 00:50:56,195
I'm sure of one thing.
I'm sure he'll know how to deal with you.

557
00:51:05,436 --> 00:51:06,664
Allow me.

558
00:51:09,196 --> 00:51:10,595
I'm sorry.

559
00:51:42,556 --> 00:51:44,194
Perhaps this is a piece of luck.

560
00:51:44,276 --> 00:51:46,506
Anyway, it's worth trying. Come on.

561
00:51:48,316 --> 00:51:49,988
Mr. Elliott is down with fever himself.

562
00:51:50,076 --> 00:51:53,671
I've had a little medical experience.
I thought I might be able to help.

563
00:51:53,756 --> 00:51:56,145
Boy is so sick, I don't know what to do.

564
00:52:00,836 --> 00:52:02,827
Yes, he's a very sick boy.

565
00:52:02,916 --> 00:52:06,511
- What have you done for him?
- Tarzan gave him his medicine.

566
00:52:06,596 --> 00:52:09,633
It's hard to tell about
these so-called natural remedies.

567
00:52:09,716 --> 00:52:12,355
- O'Doul is worse.
- You mean the medicine didn't help him?

568
00:52:12,436 --> 00:52:14,392
No, madam, he's much worse now.

569
00:52:14,476 --> 00:52:15,909
Tarzan say go.

570
00:52:18,116 --> 00:52:20,676
But, Tarzan, they came here to help us.

571
00:52:23,276 --> 00:52:25,471
Medicine cure. Boy better soon.

572
00:52:25,796 --> 00:52:27,275
If I could be just sure.

573
00:52:27,356 --> 00:52:29,187
We have some medicine that might help.

574
00:52:29,276 --> 00:52:30,391
Sulfamyradol.

575
00:52:30,476 --> 00:52:33,070
It's a new drug that works wonders
in cases such as this.

576
00:52:33,156 --> 00:52:35,511
- Elliott's already sent a runner for some.
- Where?

577
00:52:35,596 --> 00:52:39,032
We foolishly enough left it
in the truck at the foot of the escarpment.

578
00:52:39,116 --> 00:52:42,313
- The runner will be back in a day or two.
- A day or two...

579
00:52:42,636 --> 00:52:43,955
may be too late.

580
00:52:49,756 --> 00:52:51,030
Tarzan will go.

581
00:52:51,116 --> 00:52:53,755
He travels swiftly.
He'd be back by morning.

582
00:52:53,876 --> 00:52:56,231
- That's a good idea.
- Yes, it is a good idea.

583
00:52:56,316 --> 00:52:59,035
- No.
- But, Tarzan, you have to go.

584
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:01,587
Tarzan's medicine cure.

585
00:53:01,676 --> 00:53:03,746
Tarzan, we can't leave anything undone.

586
00:53:03,836 --> 00:53:06,509
Oh, darling,
I have great faith in you always.

587
00:53:06,596 --> 00:53:10,111
But if anything happened to Boy,
we'd never forgive ourselves.

588
00:53:10,196 --> 00:53:12,471
Darling, if you love me...

589
00:53:12,556 --> 00:53:15,116
if you love Boy, you've got to go.

590
00:53:18,156 --> 00:53:19,430
Tarzan go.

591
00:53:24,596 --> 00:53:27,156
The native guards at the truck
will give it to you.

592
00:53:27,236 --> 00:53:30,148
It's in a special medical kit
in a white tin box.

593
00:53:30,236 --> 00:53:31,635
Hurry, Tarzan.

594
00:53:31,916 --> 00:53:33,144
Tarzan get kit.

595
00:53:51,156 --> 00:53:52,305
All right, O'Doul.

596
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:56,071
If you're finished there, you better
get moving. We're leaving tonight.

597
00:53:56,156 --> 00:53:59,034
Tonight? But we can't leave
the sick lad here.

598
00:53:59,116 --> 00:54:02,233
He's all right. His fever's broken.
We're going over to see him now.

599
00:54:02,316 --> 00:54:05,547
Be sure M'Hona has the boys ready
to leave when Vandermeer gets back.

600
00:54:05,636 --> 00:54:08,673
- Are you not coming with us?
- No, I'm staying...

601
00:54:08,756 --> 00:54:10,189
to wait for Tarzan.

602
00:54:10,636 --> 00:54:14,629
Never mind any more questions, O'Doul.
I'm in charge now. Get going.

603
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:52,987
They're all right. They're fine.

604
00:54:53,316 --> 00:54:54,874
You were right about that medicine.

605
00:54:54,956 --> 00:54:58,392
It cured the little fellow,
just like that. Marvelous medicine.

606
00:54:59,036 --> 00:55:02,108
There's something
I'd like to talk to you about, Tarzan.

607
00:55:05,196 --> 00:55:07,152
It won't do any good to kill me.

608
00:55:12,116 --> 00:55:15,074
You'd better quiet down
or you'll never see your family again.

609
00:55:15,156 --> 00:55:16,305
Where Elliott?

610
00:55:18,156 --> 00:55:20,511
He's gone. The fever got him.

611
00:55:21,196 --> 00:55:22,311
Tarzan understand.

612
00:55:22,396 --> 00:55:25,627
But your family is all right.
They're over with Vandermeer.

613
00:55:26,596 --> 00:55:28,154
Now, listen, Tarzan...

614
00:55:28,276 --> 00:55:31,029
here's the idea,
if only you'll let me explain it.

615
00:55:31,116 --> 00:55:32,993
If you show me
where that gold comes from...

616
00:55:33,076 --> 00:55:35,544
you can have your family back
safe and sound.

617
00:55:35,636 --> 00:55:38,753
The sooner you show me the gold,
the sooner you'll have them back.

618
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:40,155
How Tarzan know?

619
00:55:41,716 --> 00:55:45,106
Gold's all we want.
That shouldn't be difficult to understand.

620
00:55:45,276 --> 00:55:46,311
Go!

621
00:56:04,836 --> 00:56:06,428
Where Jane? Where Boy?

622
00:56:07,916 --> 00:56:10,589
You know the little lake
near the cut at the end of the chasm?

623
00:56:10,676 --> 00:56:13,952
- Tarzan know.
- They're over there with Vandermeer.

624
00:56:37,036 --> 00:56:39,231
There's no sign of him.
I think I've finished him.

625
00:56:39,316 --> 00:56:41,466
Tarzan juju man, <i>bwana.</i>

626
00:56:41,556 --> 00:56:43,865
He'll need plenty of juju
if he's broken his neck...

627
00:56:43,956 --> 00:56:46,470
or if one of those slugs
caught up with him.

628
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:20,994
Hey, Vandermeer.

629
00:57:27,356 --> 00:57:28,835
You are a wealthy man, my friend.

630
00:57:28,916 --> 00:57:30,713
- Did he show it to you?
- It's enormous.

631
00:57:30,796 --> 00:57:32,514
A second Johannesburg.

632
00:57:37,276 --> 00:57:39,187
Mr. Medford, where is Tarzan?

633
00:57:39,516 --> 00:57:41,632
Your husband's behaving rationally
for a change.

634
00:57:41,716 --> 00:57:44,469
He's meeting us by the trucks
at the base of the escarpment.

635
00:57:44,556 --> 00:57:46,672
- I don't believe you.
- Why not?

636
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:48,475
Tarzan understands quite clearly...

637
00:57:48,556 --> 00:57:51,832
that the only way I can be sure
of his allowing us to leave safely...

638
00:57:51,916 --> 00:57:53,952
is by keeping you with us until we do.

639
00:57:54,036 --> 00:57:55,833
You see, I respect your husband.

640
00:57:55,916 --> 00:57:58,066
And I'm making certain
that he respects me.

641
00:57:58,156 --> 00:57:59,908
Tarzan would never agree to that.

642
00:57:59,996 --> 00:58:01,588
You're keeping something back.

643
00:58:01,676 --> 00:58:03,189
I'm going to him.

644
00:58:03,836 --> 00:58:05,588
Perhaps I better guard these heathens.

645
00:58:05,676 --> 00:58:07,189
There's no need for that, O'Doul.

646
00:58:07,276 --> 00:58:09,665
I never thought that you, too, would...

647
00:58:11,756 --> 00:58:15,226
Tarzan will twist your head off for this
and feed it to hyenas.

648
00:58:16,276 --> 00:58:17,550
What savage sentiment.

649
00:58:17,636 --> 00:58:19,786
This is the only way
we can deal with a man...

650
00:58:19,876 --> 00:58:22,026
who swings through the trees
without trousers...

651
00:58:22,116 --> 00:58:24,391
and tries to block the progress
of civilization.

652
00:58:24,476 --> 00:58:25,909
Now, as your partner...

653
00:58:25,996 --> 00:58:27,714
We're not interested in your opinions.

654
00:58:27,796 --> 00:58:29,673
Tell the boys to get packed.
We leave at once.

655
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:31,269
Certainly, gentlemen.

656
00:58:33,436 --> 00:58:34,915
What really happened to Tarzan?

657
00:58:34,996 --> 00:58:37,829
- I had to dispose of him.
- I didn't count on murder, Medford.

658
00:58:37,916 --> 00:58:39,872
It was he or I. The beast attacked me.

659
00:58:39,956 --> 00:58:42,470
But if he is dead,
what do you want her and the boy for?

660
00:58:42,556 --> 00:58:46,071
There's just a chance I didn't finish him.
Fell in a ravine, out of sight.

661
00:58:46,156 --> 00:58:48,226
We better hold them, just in case.

662
00:58:48,596 --> 00:58:50,871
In any event,
we've got to get out of here, fast.

663
00:58:50,956 --> 00:58:53,709
Get organized, come back
with machinery and equipment.

664
00:58:53,796 --> 00:58:55,434
What's a short route out of here?

665
00:58:55,516 --> 00:58:56,949
This is new country to me.

666
00:58:57,036 --> 00:58:58,708
We'll have to go back the way we came.

667
00:58:58,796 --> 00:59:01,549
It'll take us eight weeks
to get back to Nairobi.

668
00:59:02,436 --> 00:59:04,506
Ask him if he knows a quicker way.

669
00:59:07,716 --> 00:59:09,388
There is a shortcut along the river.

670
00:59:09,476 --> 00:59:11,865
But then we have to
cross the country of the Jaconi.

671
00:59:11,956 --> 00:59:13,514
- We'll take it.
- Now, wait a moment.

672
00:59:13,596 --> 00:59:16,030
Jaconi are the most dangerous tribe
in Africa.

673
00:59:16,116 --> 00:59:17,993
We would be much better off...

674
00:59:19,196 --> 00:59:22,393
He says the porters won't go that way.
They are afraid of the Jaconi.

675
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:25,070
- He says they are water devils.
- Never mind what he says.

676
00:59:25,156 --> 00:59:27,226
Tell them to get going.
We'll pay L5 bonuses.

677
00:59:27,316 --> 00:59:28,954
Hop to it. Let's be off.

678
00:59:32,716 --> 00:59:34,593
I'm going, Mother. I'm going to get Tarzan.

679
00:59:34,676 --> 00:59:37,588
- No, Boy. You mustn't.
- I must. Don't worry, please.

680
01:00:09,276 --> 01:00:10,994
I want no help from you, Mr. O'Doul.

681
01:00:11,076 --> 01:00:14,591
Well spoken, ma'am.
If your spirits are up, you'll never be down.

682
01:00:21,036 --> 01:00:23,072
This isn't the way back to your trucks.

683
01:00:23,156 --> 01:00:24,589
It's our way.

684
01:00:24,756 --> 01:00:26,428
Where are you taking us?

685
01:00:26,756 --> 01:00:28,872
Where's Tarzan?
What did you do to Tarzan?

686
01:00:28,956 --> 01:00:32,107
If you don't keep quiet,
I'll have you bound and carried.

687
01:00:32,356 --> 01:00:34,472
Boy, no.

688
01:00:53,356 --> 01:00:55,426
Jaconis. War drums.

689
01:00:55,636 --> 01:00:57,752
M'Hona, tell those boys to keep up.

690
01:00:58,476 --> 01:01:00,387
They refuse to go any farther.

691
01:01:15,076 --> 01:01:17,306
This way, we can keep an eye on them.

692
01:01:51,796 --> 01:01:53,752
This is no good. We better get back.

693
01:01:53,836 --> 01:01:56,145
You're a little too late.
We are surrounded by now.

694
01:01:56,236 --> 01:01:58,192
Why don't we make a stab for it
and fight them off?

695
01:01:58,276 --> 01:01:59,595
Our only chance is to make the river.

696
01:02:00,236 --> 01:02:02,511
He's right.
The Jaconis want to capture us alive.

697
01:02:02,596 --> 01:02:04,552
They kill white people very slowly.

698
01:02:04,636 --> 01:02:06,194
Look. Mr. O'Doul.

699
01:02:09,676 --> 01:02:12,429
He's probably better off. Come. M'Hona!

700
01:02:37,116 --> 01:02:38,390
Yeah, come on.

701
01:02:45,516 --> 01:02:49,065
Make a run for it, sonny. I can't move.

702
01:02:50,716 --> 01:02:52,672
The angels and the saints preserve me...

703
01:02:52,756 --> 01:02:55,828
and the pickaninny here,
keep an eye on him, too.

704
01:02:59,196 --> 01:03:01,073
All right, you big bully.

705
01:03:01,556 --> 01:03:04,434
I'll take no more
of your insults and intimidations.

706
01:03:04,516 --> 01:03:06,905
All right, now, enough is enough.

707
01:03:19,436 --> 01:03:20,994
Come out here, you coward.

708
01:03:21,076 --> 01:03:24,864
Come out here, and I'll give you
the thrashing of your miserable life.

709
01:03:46,836 --> 01:03:50,511
That arrow couldn't have come
from more than 10 feet away.

710
01:03:51,116 --> 01:03:54,028
- Stop wasting your bullets.
- I thought I saw something moving.

711
01:03:54,116 --> 01:03:55,754
Get a hold of yourself.

712
01:03:56,276 --> 01:03:57,311
Stop.

713
01:04:02,396 --> 01:04:05,274
Tell them anybody who tries it again
gets the same.

714
01:05:50,516 --> 01:05:51,665
I can't stand any more.

715
01:05:51,756 --> 01:05:53,587
Why don't they take me
and get it over with?

716
01:05:53,676 --> 01:05:55,428
No such luck. They're saving us.

717
01:05:55,516 --> 01:05:58,553
They'll take us down the river tomorrow
to the village.

718
01:06:43,196 --> 01:06:44,629
What do those drums say?

719
01:06:44,716 --> 01:06:48,026
I don't know, but I can assure you
it is not to our benefit.

720
01:08:09,996 --> 01:08:12,464
That's a bad spot for Mr. Tarzan to be in.

721
01:08:14,236 --> 01:08:15,828
What did you say, Mr. Tarzan?

722
01:08:15,916 --> 01:08:18,953
Get vine. Tarzan catch.

723
01:08:57,356 --> 01:08:59,586
Grab a hold of that and pull it back.

724
01:09:06,996 --> 01:09:10,750
That's something like it, me bucko.
Pull! Pull it, Timba.

725
01:09:23,196 --> 01:09:26,074
Come on, Samson,
we'll give this thing another try.

726
01:09:51,876 --> 01:09:53,867
Suffering snakes! He made it.

727
01:10:13,916 --> 01:10:15,429
Better hurry up, Mr. Tarzan.

728
01:10:15,516 --> 01:10:18,394
Them scoundrels have got hold
of Mrs. Tarzan and the youngster.

729
01:10:18,476 --> 01:10:20,785
They're heading for the Jaconi country.

730
01:14:01,236 --> 01:14:02,794
I'm coming, Mr. Tarzan.

731
01:14:02,876 --> 01:14:04,275
I'm on the way.

732
01:16:29,156 --> 01:16:31,590
You may be a monster
to the local inhabitants...

733
01:16:31,676 --> 01:16:34,349
but you're just another lizard to O'Doul.

734
01:16:36,316 --> 01:16:40,150
Timba will take you over the mountains.
From there on, the way is easy.

735
01:16:42,076 --> 01:16:44,032
What on earth might this be?

736
01:16:44,116 --> 01:16:46,869
It is a large and ponderous fruit, so it is.

737
01:16:47,276 --> 01:16:48,868
It's a bon voyage basket.

738
01:16:48,956 --> 01:16:50,708
- Jungle-style.
- Thank you, ma'am.

739
01:16:50,796 --> 01:16:52,866
Here's something to keep
the sun off your head.

740
01:16:52,956 --> 01:16:54,230
Thank you, son.

741
01:16:55,596 --> 01:16:57,393
We're going to miss you.

742
01:16:58,316 --> 01:16:59,908
Tarzan find friend.

743
01:16:59,996 --> 01:17:02,464
It's me that's found a friend, and the best.

744
01:17:02,556 --> 01:17:04,706
If there were more folks
like you in the world...

745
01:17:04,796 --> 01:17:06,514
it would be a sweet and a smiling place.

746
01:17:06,596 --> 01:17:08,154
I'll never forget you.

747
01:17:15,796 --> 01:17:17,912
Goodbye, heaven bless you.

748
01:17:18,076 --> 01:17:21,227
- Goodbye, Mr. O'Doul.
- Goodbye, good luck always.

749
01:17:21,316 --> 01:17:25,355
Wouldn't you like to see Mr. O'Doul 's face
when he finds the melon's full of gold?

750
01:17:25,436 --> 01:17:26,994
O'Doul laugh, then cry.

751
01:17:27,076 --> 01:17:28,395
He'll be rich, won't he?

752
01:17:28,476 --> 01:17:30,592
And he'll never tell
where his riches came from.

753
01:17:30,676 --> 01:17:32,075
You can be sure of that.

754
01:17:32,156 --> 01:17:33,555
Tarzan sure.

755
01:17:36,116 --> 01:17:37,151
Friend.
