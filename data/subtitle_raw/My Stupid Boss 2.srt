1
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,000
Mr. Kho.

2
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:54,458
Please tell Bossman
to buy us new saw machines.

3
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:55,666
That'll help us a lot.

4
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,250
We could work way faster.

5
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,208
The work would be done
in minutes. Am I right?

6
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:00,333
Yes, but...

7
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,750
Tell that guy to move his bike.
If Bossman finds out, he'll give us hell.

8
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:12,708
Nah, maybe he's just a customer.

9
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:14,041
Talk to him if you want.

10
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:16,708
Hello. Happy morning.

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,416
You can't park your motorcycle there.

12
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,500
Because... it's very troublesome.

13
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:26,750
Good morning.

14
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:32,708
Riding a bike to work is actually fun.

15
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:35,583
It's new, you know, Mr. Kho.

16
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:36,666
Fresh from the showroom.

17
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:38,750
Take a look at it. Huge bike.

18
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:42,416
Right? Don't get too excited though.
Take it easy.

19
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:44,916
It's cool, right?

20
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,250
Kamen Rider.

21
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:48,333
Hey! It's Renegade, Mr. Kho.

22
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:50,666
Not "Kamen Rider."

23
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:52,875
It's expensive, you know.

24
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:54,625
It's way more expensive than a Proton,

25
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:56,291
your national brand.

26
00:01:57,083 --> 00:02:00,666
- It seems that you have a lot of money.
- Business is good so far, thank God.

27
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:04,958
Can you buy a new saw machine for Faisal?

28
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,208
I don't have the money.

29
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:07,250
Huh?

30
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:10,208
But you said,
"Business is good so far, thank God."

31
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:11,791
When did I say that?

32
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,375
Are you making that up?

33
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:16,458
I think you're getting old
and you have hearing problems.

34
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,375
Have you tried cotton buds?

35
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,000
Bunch of fools.

36
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,958
Hey, Faisal! Park my bike.

37
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,750
Let's go, guys, pick up the pace!

38
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,333
- Is the letter ready, Sikin?
- Hold on.

39
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:37,041
Did you wash your face with sugar?

40
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:38,000
What?

41
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:41,083
Because you look so sweet today.

42
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:44,125
Hey, Adrian, it's too early to flirt.

43
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:49,916
- You ready, Rahmat?
- Yes, ma'am.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,708
- Other Indonesian workers ready?
- Yes, ma'am.

45
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,625
Sikin, cover for me while I'm out.

46
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,958
- OK.
- Good morning.

47
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,583
Hey!

48
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,583
Why do you all look dumbfounded?

49
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,291
Take it easy.

50
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:20,375
Sikin, close your mouth.

51
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,500
I'm not a celebrity.

52
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,583
You look like you've never seen one.

53
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,791
Why are you still wearing your helmet
in the office?

54
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,041
Because this morning,

55
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,583
I rode my new bike to work.

56
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:34,791
A huge bike.

57
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:35,875
Whoa!

58
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:39,833
If you're curious,
you can check it out at the parking lot.

59
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,500
It's expensive, you know.

60
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,666
- Do you want to know how much?
- No.

61
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,375
Of course.

62
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,291
Even if I tell you,

63
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,500
it will be too expensive for you, right?

64
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:57,833
Even if I had the money,
I can't ride a bike!

65
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:02,708
- See you.
- Where are you going?

66
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,791
- And you, Udin, where are you going?
- It's Rahmat.

67
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,500
I know. Ramdan, what are you doing here?

68
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,833
You should be in the factory
not in the office.

69
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:09,833
Silly.

70
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,583
We're going to vote.
It's election day today.

71
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,708
Wait, are we gonna punch the card
or just check mark it?

72
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,375
It doesn't matter.

73
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:18,625
Who gave you permission?

74
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:19,875
Today's election day.

75
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,375
The ambassador instructed employers
to give permission

76
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,583
for all Indonesian employees
and workers to go vote.

77
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:27,666
Are they gonna pay my loss
when all of my workers gone?

78
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,208
I don't wanna hear bullshit about punching
or checking anymore.

79
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,916
It's unacceptable.

80
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,458
It is our right as Indonesian citizens.

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,250
And you will be sued
if you deny our rights.

82
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:42,125
I'll chose Ms. Kerani. How about you?

83
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,125
Me, too.

84
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:48,125
Gosh. We're so in synch.

85
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,541
- OK!
- Dear God!

86
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,333
Let me ask you something.

87
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,833
How many Indonesians
are working in this company?

88
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,041
Ten.

89
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,708
Or 11 if we count you, too.

90
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:04,500
OK, I want you
to call the election committee.

91
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:08,125
And tell them to build one cemetery
in this factory.

92
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,791
- It's called a voting booth!
- Yeah, that.

93
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:14,875
So you guys don't have to go to KL.

94
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,375
It will save your energy, too.

95
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:20,208
OK, Kera-ni?

96
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,791
Hey, call the Embassy.

97
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,458
I'm watching you.

98
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:29,666
Tell them to put the voting booth
on the back side of our factory.

99
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,875
OK?

100
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,333
I can't believe that stupid mustache clown
you call friend.

101
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,541
He didn't give me permission to vote.

102
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,250
So, you...

103
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,375
You didn't go?

104
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,166
I went anyway.

105
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,833
I don't care.

106
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,833
It's my right as an Indonesian citizen.

107
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,208
I'm proud of you, honey.

108
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:07,125
What matters is that you voted.

109
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:08,750
But still...

110
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,958
He's gonna cut my salary. Ugh!

111
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,291
That sleazy bastard!

112
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,500
Calm down.

113
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:18,125
You know him.

114
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,125
That damn dictator!

115
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:22,500
Well...

116
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,000
I believe he is.

117
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,625
Are you taking his side?

118
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:28,583
It's not like that.

119
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:32,625
But you already know, it's just who he is.

120
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:40,833
Are you going somewhere?
Why are you all dressed up?

121
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,125
Am I?

122
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:52,125
Excuse me.

123
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,916
<i>- Bro...
- Hello, bro.</i>

124
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,083
Are we still on for karaoke tonight?

125
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:05,333
- Sorry, I can't.
- What?

126
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,458
Are you ditching me?

127
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,458
This is our chance
since my wife is still in Hong Kong.

128
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:13,625
Tonight we can, you know,
entertain ourselves?

129
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,708
Sorry.

130
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:20,041
I don't feel good tonight.
I think I have a fever.

131
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:23,083
I don't believe it. Send me your pic.

132
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,916
I bet you didn't get permission
from your wife.

133
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,875
- No.
- Buy her Padang food on your way home.

134
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,250
It'll shut her mouth.

135
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:35,083
I have to go.
I need to cool down my fever.

136
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,166
Bye.

137
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,500
Bro! Hello? Hey!

138
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:44,833
Who called you?

139
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:45,916
Um...

140
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,875
That was... my business partner.
He wants to hang out.

141
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,666
But his wife is sick,
so I told him to cancel.

142
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,291
I feel sorry for his wife being sick
and she would be alone and lonely.

143
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:57,708
- I couldn't force him to go. You know me.
- OK.

144
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,458
- I'm going to bed.
- OK.

145
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,875
I'll be there in a minute.

146
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:24,708
- Honey!
- Yes?

147
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,791
I just got off the phone
with your so-called business partner.

148
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,375
He told me to let you go
to karaoke with him.

149
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,666
Since when are you doing business
with that mustache clown?

150
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,125
I don't know who you're talking about.

151
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,916
"Miracle Hair Treatment."

152
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,583
That's awesome.

153
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,000
I still have hope.

154
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,500
I need a miracle.

155
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:55,583
What? I'm busy.

156
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,458
Excuse me, sir.

157
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,708
I'm just letting you know
that Arjun is taking sick leave.

158
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,833
His leg was injured
during work last night.

159
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:03,791
Have he seen a doctor?

160
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:07,916
He did. The doctor said it was
not serious, but told him to stay home.

161
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,416
Because he still can't work.

162
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,458
That's just an excuse.

163
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:15,166
Ms. Sikin,
he's the saw machine operator, right?

164
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,916
I've never seen a saw machine operator
walk around to do his work.

165
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:22,708
- I don't understand.
- Call Arjun.

166
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:24,708
Tell him to come to work anyway.

167
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:27,375
He could walk to see a doctor,
so how hard is it to walk to work?

168
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,208
Are we clear?

169
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,083
Can you talk to Mr. Bossman?

170
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:35,333
If he continues his behavior,
nobody will want to work here.

171
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,250
Please, talk to him.

172
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,250
He's too harsh.

173
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,708
Don't worry, Ms. Sikin.

174
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,125
If the Bossman does you wrong,

175
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,916
I'm gonna protect you.

176
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,375
Body and soul.

177
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,208
And how are you gonna protect me

178
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:54,083
if you're afraid of him, too?

179
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,291
No, I'm not.

180
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:59,916
<i>Adrian, come to my office now.</i>

181
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:03,916
Hey, Adrian. Answer me!

182
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:05,291
Is he ignoring me?

183
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,250
Dear God.

184
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:11,000
What did I do wrong this time?

185
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:16,208
Adrian? I'm praying for you, bro.

186
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:25,125
Kerani, you should talk to Faisal.

187
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,041
He said he can't take it.
He doesn't want to work here anymore.

188
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:31,666
Now what?
Can't we have a day without problems?

189
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,833
Happy morning.

190
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:40,041
How could this machine always be broken?

191
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:48,625
Ms. Kerani, our saw machine is too old.

192
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,458
It keeps going on and off, on and off.

193
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:53,208
And it's happening
at least ten times a day.

194
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,500
We should get a new one.

195
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,250
Please tell the boss.

196
00:10:58,541 --> 00:10:59,666
OK, I understand.

197
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,625
I'll try to get him buy a new one.

198
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,166
Raj!

199
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:07,500
Hey! Where's that lazy guy?

200
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,916
Hey, I want to talk to you.

201
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,541
So, you took some leave last week?

202
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:15,375
- Did you say your father passed away?
- Please don't be mad at me.

203
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:18,708
Have mercy, I lost my father.
I'm so miserable.

204
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,958
- I'm fatherless now.
- Raj.

205
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:24,375
You've been watching
too many Bollywood movies.

206
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:27,250
I'm so sorry for you.
I think you have potential to be in one.

207
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,416
Don't waste your talent
working in a factory.

208
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:32,083
I suggest you go be an actor
and make a movie with Shah Rukh Khan.

209
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,750
I... I don't understand.

210
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,250
Five months ago, you took leave.

211
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,791
Two weeks leave without notice!

212
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,125
That time you also said your father died.
Did he die again?

213
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,000
Is he Superman, dying over and over again?

214
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,458
Here's your warning letter. Now get lost.

215
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,125
What?

216
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,000
- Faisal wants to say something.
- Are you Faisal?

217
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,791
- Of course not.
- Then why are you talking?

218
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,125
- Boss.
- Mm?

219
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:59,000
Our saw machine is too old. It's too old.

220
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:01,583
Can we get a new machine?

221
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,000
That one is useless.

222
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:05,416
How can we work if it keeps breaking down?

223
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,791
This machine will claim our lives someday.

224
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,666
Hey!

225
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,583
Repair it. A new one is too expensive.

226
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,500
Sir, our machine is one of the oldest
saw machines in the world.

227
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,833
- Are you mocking me?
- But it is true!

228
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:23,375
It's too old and inefficient. We need
five days to finish two days' work.

229
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:24,375
She's right.

230
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,416
Hmm...

231
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,208
OK!

232
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:33,958
- Hey, Faisal.
- Yes?

233
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,500
- If you need anything, you ask Kerani?
- Yes, boss.

234
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,708
- And if she does, she'll ask me, right?
- Absolutely, boss.

235
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:40,833
Then who should I ask?

236
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,041
Bunch of losers.

237
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:54,041
Hey! Get back to work!

238
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,583
Are you playing hide-and-seek?

239
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,208
If he won't listen to us, I give up.

240
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:00,500
You're right.

241
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,708
He loves cutting my salary.

242
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:05,541
Once I was late for work due to flooding.

243
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:08,041
- He cut my salary.
- Yeah. And he never trusts us.

244
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,833
If we take sick leave,
he doesn't trust us.

245
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,791
He wants the doctor to tell him
in person.

246
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,250
He's crazy.

247
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:16,208
He wants me to sweep
the floor. I'm a supervisor.

248
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,208
- Not a janitor!
- Exactly!

249
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,916
OK. I quit!

250
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,416
Yes, we quit!

251
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,333
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

252
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,416
- I quit!
- Quit!

253
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,041
Faisal!

254
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,041
Good luck, Mr. Kho.

255
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,166
I'll see you later.

256
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,958
Please talk to Mr. Bossman, Kerani.

257
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,541
We're about to lose all of our workers.

258
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,625
It will give us headache.

259
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,958
We're gonna be doomed!

260
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:10,625
He might even make us do their jobs.

261
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,125
Like we did that day.

262
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:18,750
<i>Don't be so down. I can see you.</i>

263
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:22,333
<i>Do the work. Kerani, don't be sulky.</i>

264
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:24,791
<i>Sulky.</i>

265
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:30,750
Oh my God, please no!

266
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:34,458
Please talk to Mr. Bossman,
because he only listens to you.

267
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,458
It's for our own good.

268
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,041
You can do it!

269
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:42,416
God has the power to change one's heart.

270
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,875
- Please, Kerani...
- OK!

271
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:59,708
Kerani!

272
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,500
- I have no money.
- Sir.

273
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:08,500
Do you know
our workers are quitting one by one?

274
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,125
And this isn't the first time.

275
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,541
If you keep doing this to them,
you're gonna lose all of them.

276
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:16,916
Sir?

277
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,291
Sir, are you listening?

278
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,125
You should tone down your nastiness.

279
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:22,416
Nobody wants to work with you.

280
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,750
It's not about me!

281
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:27,375
They hate working for you!

282
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,041
Really?

283
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,208
Positive?

284
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:32,916
Are you sure?

285
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,250
You know what, I don't care.

286
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:39,083
But we lost some of the workers,
which means it will affect productivity.

287
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,541
Don't blame me if bad things happen.

288
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:44,125
And don't tell me to sand the wood again.

289
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,416
What you mean?

290
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:51,208
Your work time is from eight to five,
and you're being paid for it.

291
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:52,875
Stop whining.

292
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,000
What do you mean?

293
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:56,666
You should obey me
if I tell you to sand the wood.

294
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,166
I'm your boss, remember?

295
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:03,791
Subang Jaya?

296
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,333
Hey, what are you looking at?

297
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:09,875
Do you think my office is an aquarium?
Get back to work!

298
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,833
Get busy, don't just look busy.

299
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:29,666
Hey, Raj.

300
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Stop it with your Bombay acting.

301
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,583
No, boss. My chest suddenly feels heavy.

302
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:35,791
Heavy?

303
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:38,958
Well...

304
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,541
why don't you just quit...

305
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,458
like your friends did?

306
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,750
No, boss.

307
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:49,708
Nobody wants to hire
unskilled person like me.

308
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:54,958
Good. Great. You understand.

309
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,583
Good.

310
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,416
Get back to work. Nothing to see here.

311
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,375
You go see a doctor.

312
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,041
Don't tell anyone I gave you money.

313
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:26,583
Put it in your pocket.

314
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,958
Boss, our suppliers are getting impatient.

315
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,916
They want payment
by the end of this week.

316
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:41,041
Tell them I'm on a business trip abroad.
It's that simple.

317
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,666
I can't. They already know your tricks.

318
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,791
And they're asking for your phone number.

319
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,583
Whose number should I give them?

320
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:50,625
Give them Kerani's.

321
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:58,541
<i>Kerani! Mr. Kho! Adrian!
Azahari! Norahsikin!</i>

322
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,375
<i>To the meeting room right now!</i>

323
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,541
Before we start the meeting this morning,

324
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,208
as always, let's take attendance.

325
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:12,291
One by one. OK? Kerani.

326
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:13,458
No need!

327
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,541
We're not school children anymore.

328
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:16,875
OK.

329
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:18,666
So, here's the thing.

330
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:22,666
This is an urgent meeting.

331
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,541
How many times do I have to tell you,

332
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,291
speak Malaysian or English.

333
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,708
- We don't understand.
- What's wrong?

334
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,166
Stop complaining like netizens.

335
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:32,708
Do you understand?

336
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,666
Don't be such a whiner, Mr. Kho.

337
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:37,125
OK, let's move on.

338
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:40,875
So, your amazing boss, me.

339
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,625
Amazing.

340
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:45,416
Amazing.

341
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,791
That word always brings tears to my eyes.

342
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:52,958
Speechless.

343
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,375
Can't speak.

344
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:59,291
So, I just got an invitation...

345
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,291
to give a speech

346
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:07,083
at a Furniture and Furnishing Association
event in Vietnam.

347
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,000
Wow. Isn't that amazing?

348
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:14,875
This is a proud moment.
I bet you're so proud of me now.

349
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:20,250
So! I know that...

350
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:24,500
we don't have enough workers now.

351
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:27,125
So, my plan is...

352
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:34,000
we find workers from there.

353
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,458
What do you mean "we"?

354
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:40,041
It's obvious! You Mr. Kho, Adrian,
and Kerani will join me to Vietnam.

355
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,333
Sikin and Azhari can hold the fort for us.

356
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,083
Thank goodness!

357
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,333
What?

358
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,583
I mean...

359
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:51,750
I thank God that you trust us
to run the office while you're away.

360
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:56,833
God willing,
Sikin and I will do our best to run it.

361
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:58,750
- If God is willing.
- He's right.

362
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,333
It will be a great honor for us.

363
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:05,583
How about
Sikin and I run the office for you?

364
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:07,958
No.

365
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,583
Do you think I don't know...

366
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:14,125
that you are chasing Sikin?

367
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:21,666
Hey. No office romance allowed.

368
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:23,500
Don't worry, Sikin.

369
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,125
I'll be back in a jiffy.

370
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,958
I won't even care if you don't come back.

371
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,333
OK!

372
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:34,708
Meeting's over,
and we'll leave in two days.

373
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,083
What?

374
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,875
Sir. Sir!

375
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:43,791
The business trip is such short notice.
I have to ask my husband first.

376
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,041
I'll talk to him.

377
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,250
You? Are you his wife?

378
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,291
Are you jealous?

379
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,583
Jealous of an ugly sack of potatoes?

380
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,750
Hey, I heard that!

381
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,416
But, sir...

382
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,875
No buts. We'll leave in two days,

383
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,833
or all of you can work overtime
at the factory.

384
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:11,166
How about that?

385
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,958
You're beginning to act like Mr. Kho,
always complaining.

386
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:31,791
Honey...

387
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,458
Are you trying to be naughty?
Why did you come home late?

388
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:40,125
That puffer fish made me work overtime.

389
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:41,916
Oh, honey.

390
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,625
I cooked you dinner.

391
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:48,208
Oh, that's so sweet. Thank you, honey.

392
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,291
I know. Don't mention it.

393
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:54,541
Anyway...

394
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:56,458
I need to tell you something.

395
00:21:57,958 --> 00:22:00,208
I know it's short notice, but...

396
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:03,875
If you want to tell me about
your business trip to Vietnam.

397
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:05,833
Don't worry about it.

398
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,125
You're free to go.

399
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:12,583
Actually this dinner is to celebrate it.

400
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
And don't worry, your luggage is ready.

401
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:24,041
- Bon appetite.
- How do you know about the Vietnam trip?

402
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:27,583
That ugly sack of potatoes
called you, didn't he?

403
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:33,166
- I shouldn't know about it?
- I'm your wife.

404
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,208
I'm the one who supposed to tell you,
not him.

405
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:39,166
Good point. It is weird.

406
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:42,083
- Honey, I know he's your friend.
- Yeah.

407
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:45,666
But why do I feel like
I'm the third wheel here?

408
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:48,750
Honey... you're wrong.

409
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:50,708
He's not my type.

410
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:54,250
- Come on, honey. I'm serious.
- Oh, I'm dead serious.

411
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:57,666
I wouldn't date a fat balding man
with weird mustache like him.

412
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:01,666
Even if I were gay,
my taste wouldn't be that low.

413
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,125
- Don't worry.
- Honey, enough.

414
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:06,833
<i>I don't want that bajaj
to ruin our marriage. Period!</i>

415
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:16,166
Don't you worry.

416
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,333
<i>I promise,
no bajaj will ruin our marriage.</i>

417
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:24,125
I'm making this promise.
This sacred promise.

418
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:27,916
<i>Bajaj promise!</i>

419
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,875
Promise.

420
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:38,083
Ke. Ra. Ni.

421
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:42,875
<i>I think the end is near.</i>

422
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:47,833
Hey. I know Dika gave you
permission to go.

423
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:51,208
He always does what he's told.

424
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:53,833
We have some kind of...

425
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,250
bromance.

426
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:04,125
- Ah, sir?
- Mm?

427
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:07,000
Do you want to purchase airline tickets
online or through travel agent?

428
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:13,000
And you said you were smart
and up to date.

429
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:15,666
But you even thought about
ordering tickets through a travel agent?

430
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,166
Online, of course!

431
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:19,208
You're so old fashioned.

432
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,000
Even I always buy tickets online.

433
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:23,250
It's my job to present you with options.

434
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:25,916
If you want to buy them online,
I'll need your credit card.

435
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,916
- What for?
- To pay for the tickets.

436
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,250
Why do you need my credit card?

437
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:32,958
You just told me to buy them online.

438
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:35,791
They only take credit cards
or debit cards.

439
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:38,958
And you said you were familiar
with online purchases.

440
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:40,958
You don't need to mock me.

441
00:24:41,041 --> 00:24:42,958
Call the airline.

442
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:45,583
I'm gonna check if they really need
my credit card for the tickets.

443
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:55,041
Remember, don't eat too much.

444
00:24:56,541 --> 00:24:58,666
- Hey. I'm sorry.
- Yes?

445
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:01,041
I think, I bring your suitcase.

446
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:02,625
We have same suitcase.

447
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:13,125
Hey! You must put bad thing in my...

448
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:14,291
suitcase.

449
00:25:14,375 --> 00:25:15,916
No! No! No! I'm sorry.

450
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,916
What are you sorry for?
Hey, there is no sorry!

451
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,625
Bad thing in my suitcase, no sorry.

452
00:25:19,708 --> 00:25:20,791
No, no!

453
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:21,916
Don't jump to conclusions.

454
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,791
Shut up, Mr. Kho. Stop talking.

455
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:28,125
We're in Vietnam, not Cililitan.
They could even attack with grenades!

456
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:30,708
- During war time!
- Shut up!

457
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:35,500
If you put bad, I'll call the police.

458
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:36,541
No, no.

459
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:37,541
No... No...

460
00:25:37,625 --> 00:25:41,333
Don't be harsh on me! I was polite to you!

461
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:43,208
- Don't be harsh on me!
- Run, run.

462
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,791
I'm not afraid of you.

463
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:47,583
Excuse me.

464
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:49,708
Excuse me.

465
00:25:49,791 --> 00:25:51,250
I'm not afraid of you.

466
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:54,208
- Excuse me.
- Come back here! Face me!

467
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:09,250
Gosh.

468
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:11,333
My back is killing me.

469
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:15,333
Don't get us in more trouble.
This is not our country.

470
00:26:15,416 --> 00:26:18,291
Shut up, Mr. Kho.

471
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:20,291
Don't you know that I'm in pain?

472
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:24,250
- Good evening.
- Yes, good evening.

473
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:29,625
Adrian, what kind of hotel did you book?

474
00:26:29,708 --> 00:26:32,208
Bossman will kill you
if you booked a cheap hotel.

475
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:34,916
You know him.

476
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,833
He wants everything cheap.

477
00:26:36,916 --> 00:26:38,666
The only cheap hotel
I could get is this one.

478
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:41,708
With his budget,
we can only afford a half star hotel.

479
00:26:41,791 --> 00:26:43,250
But he wants five star service.

480
00:26:43,708 --> 00:26:44,958
But I feel sorry for you.

481
00:26:45,041 --> 00:26:46,916
He's gonna be really pissed off with you.

482
00:26:48,458 --> 00:26:50,875
Hey! Who booked the hotel?

483
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,625
I did, boss. Why?

484
00:26:56,666 --> 00:26:57,833
Very good.

485
00:26:58,416 --> 00:26:59,791
Because it's cheap.

486
00:27:01,916 --> 00:27:03,041
Come on.

487
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:07,250
At least he won't cut my salary.

488
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:12,000
Are you crazy?

489
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:15,458
You booked one room
for the three of us with him?

490
00:27:15,916 --> 00:27:19,416
But Bossman ordered me to book two rooms.

491
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,541
One room for Kerani, and one for us.

492
00:27:22,416 --> 00:27:24,375
You're gonna have to sleep beside him.

493
00:27:24,791 --> 00:27:27,000
Please don't be mad at me.

494
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:28,416
I didn't have a choice.

495
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,791
If he told you to jump off
the building, would you do that, too?

496
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:32,541
That's not fair...

497
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:34,291
And would you eat shit if he told you to?

498
00:27:41,625 --> 00:27:44,666
Hey! Mr. Kho? Adrian?

499
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:46,000
What are you two arguing about?

500
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:48,750
You fight like a couple.

501
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:50,375
Huh?

502
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:55,083
If there's a problem with your marriage,

503
00:27:55,166 --> 00:27:58,000
you should discuss it calmly.

504
00:27:58,083 --> 00:27:59,916
Don't yell at each other.

505
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,541
Do you want to ruin your marriage?

506
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:06,833
Take it easy. Be nice to each other.

507
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:08,791
Since we're going to share
the bed tonight.

508
00:28:17,291 --> 00:28:20,666
This room has a very nice view.

509
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:29,083
Miss. Please button up your shirt.

510
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,958
You'll catch a cold.

511
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:56,583
What's wrong with Mr. Kho?
He didn't sleep last night?

512
00:28:57,791 --> 00:28:59,500
How could we sleep?

513
00:28:59,583 --> 00:29:02,125
The boss snored like a starving tiger.

514
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:03,750
Ugh.

515
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:06,166
What time is it?

516
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:08,666
Call him.

517
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:10,333
No way.

518
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:11,833
What if he pounces on me?

519
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,500
Why don't you call him, instead?

520
00:29:26,208 --> 00:29:27,375
<i>- Hello?
- Hello?</i>

521
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:29,708
Why are you calling me this early?

522
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:34,916
Boss, you told us to gather in the lobby
at 7:00 a.m. It's already 9:00 a.m.

523
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
What are you doing in the lobby
this early?

524
00:29:38,083 --> 00:29:40,333
<i>Don't you have anything better to do?</i>

525
00:29:40,416 --> 00:29:42,375
Don't blame us,
we're just following your order!

526
00:29:42,458 --> 00:29:44,166
I'm still sleeping,
I can't even open my eyes.

527
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,333
<i>Can you even arrange a meeting properly?</i>

528
00:29:46,416 --> 00:29:47,541
You're so clueless.

529
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:48,708
It's not my fault!

530
00:29:49,666 --> 00:29:52,000
Boss? Hello?

531
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,791
Let's go! Don't just stand there.

532
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:05,375
We have many things to do today.

533
00:30:06,916 --> 00:30:08,333
For God's sake, sir!

534
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:12,708
Why did you stop so suddenly?

535
00:30:16,416 --> 00:30:18,166
I forgot to bring my speech.

536
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:19,291
Huh?

537
00:30:19,916 --> 00:30:22,750
How could I forget to bring it?

538
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:24,541
Can you do the speech without notes?

539
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:27,625
You seem to have no problem
rambling about everything.

540
00:30:27,708 --> 00:30:30,000
But I always ramble in Javanese,
not in English.

541
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:31,166
Are you stupid or something?

542
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,375
Here. Mr. Kho, Adrian,
help me write down my speech.

543
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:35,583
Don't listen to
the screeching of this broken record.

544
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:37,958
We don't understand any word you said.

545
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:41,333
You. I. Write. Speech.

546
00:30:41,416 --> 00:30:42,666
For me. Understand?

547
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:45,250
Speech! For me?

548
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,583
Yes, come on.

549
00:30:46,666 --> 00:30:48,291
Do you want to order something?

550
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:49,375
No, no.

551
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:52,416
No eating. No drink, no eating. No food.

552
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,791
- You can...
- OK.

553
00:30:54,875 --> 00:30:56,041
Yes, thank you.

554
00:30:56,125 --> 00:30:57,958
Hurry.

555
00:30:58,583 --> 00:31:01,833
Come on.
"How to be a successful person."

556
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:03,958
What the speech is about?

557
00:31:04,041 --> 00:31:05,166
I just told you.

558
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:06,833
Are you deaf?

559
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:09,875
How to be...

560
00:31:09,958 --> 00:31:13,791
a successful businessman like me.

561
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:17,916
- In English?
- No, Mr. Kho. In a hippo language.

562
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,041
Of course in English.
Write it down, hurry!

563
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:24,416
Any longer and Kerani might order food,
and you know she eats a lot.

564
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,083
Taking all of you on this trip
is costing me too much money.

565
00:31:27,166 --> 00:31:29,541
- I do not eat a lot!
- Come on.

566
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:31,041
Number one.

567
00:31:31,125 --> 00:31:33,000
Sir. Have a seat.

568
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:38,291
This place is very nice.

569
00:31:40,666 --> 00:31:44,041
<i>♪ Oh, oh, who is he? ♪</i>

570
00:31:44,125 --> 00:31:46,208
Look at it...

571
00:31:46,291 --> 00:31:48,583
Go on, take a good look.

572
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:51,166
Go closer.
Take a close look at my picture.

573
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:54,500
You must be so proud of me.

574
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:57,208
Your boss' picture is there

575
00:31:57,291 --> 00:32:00,125
with pictures of influential people
in Asia.

576
00:32:00,208 --> 00:32:01,083
Isn't that awesome?

577
00:32:02,208 --> 00:32:03,250
Here. Look.

578
00:32:03,583 --> 00:32:04,666
I'm wearing a red suit.

579
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:08,250
Never, ever forget history.

580
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:11,791
I'm making history.

581
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:12,875
Oh my...

582
00:32:12,958 --> 00:32:14,000
The proudest moment.

583
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:15,500
Hey! Are you proud of me?

584
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:17,041
I'm very proud of you, sir.

585
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:19,583
I'm gonna update my Facebook status
right after this

586
00:32:19,666 --> 00:32:21,000
and show it to my family.

587
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:24,541
That's a good idea.
You're not so dumb after all.

588
00:32:24,625 --> 00:32:25,875
Let's take a wefie.

589
00:32:26,958 --> 00:32:29,500
Sir, excuse me.

590
00:32:29,583 --> 00:32:31,458
- Can you take a picture?
- Picture?

591
00:32:31,541 --> 00:32:35,291
Yes, picture.
He understands my English.

592
00:32:35,375 --> 00:32:39,416
There you go.
Make sure everyone's in the picture.

593
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,833
Look forward, smile.

594
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:43,750
Don't block my picture.

595
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,500
Yes, come on.

596
00:32:46,583 --> 00:32:49,791
Ready? Do the thumbs up.

597
00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:52,333
Good job.

598
00:32:55,708 --> 00:32:57,208
Mr. Kho. I need my speech.

599
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:11,833
What's this?

600
00:33:11,916 --> 00:33:13,583
It's a newspaper. Just read it.

601
00:33:13,666 --> 00:33:16,125
I can't give my speech
by reading from a newspaper.

602
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:18,333
What if they found out?

603
00:33:18,416 --> 00:33:20,625
It's a Malaysian-English newspaper.

604
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:23,958
You have stayed in the USA
for a long time. You should know.

605
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:26,125
Ladies and gentlemen,

606
00:33:26,208 --> 00:33:28,875
allow me to introduce to you
our honored guest,

607
00:33:28,958 --> 00:33:30,958
successful businessman from Malaysia,

608
00:33:31,041 --> 00:33:32,958
Mr. Hendrik Suryaman.

609
00:33:34,333 --> 00:33:36,375
Also known as Bossman.

610
00:33:40,666 --> 00:33:42,250
Yes.

611
00:33:43,541 --> 00:33:45,291
Thank you.

612
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:51,041
Let's pray he won't be
a disgrace to our country.

613
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:55,041
Ladies and gentlemen.

614
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,125
It is an...

615
00:33:58,583 --> 00:34:01,083
honor for me...

616
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,083
to speak...

617
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:06,625
in front of you all

618
00:34:06,708 --> 00:34:09,208
about my...

619
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:13,708
successful business in furniture industry.

620
00:34:15,375 --> 00:34:16,208
Hold on.

621
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:23,916
Development of furniture design

622
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,208
in South East Asia

623
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:28,916
has long been

624
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,500
a key issue

625
00:34:30,583 --> 00:34:34,000
in each individual country.

626
00:34:34,083 --> 00:34:37,916
The driver and achievement of design...

627
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:39,708
and of...

628
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:44,416
What's that?

629
00:34:45,916 --> 00:34:47,291
Enormously.

630
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:52,416
Azhari!

631
00:34:52,916 --> 00:34:55,833
I just talked to Mr. Chung
from our timber supplier downstairs.

632
00:34:55,916 --> 00:34:57,458
He is furious, asking about Bossman

633
00:34:57,541 --> 00:34:59,583
and demanding we pay our debt today.

634
00:34:59,666 --> 00:35:03,291
If it not,
tomorrow he will send a debt collector.

635
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:06,208
- I'm freaking out!
- Calm down, Sikin.

636
00:35:06,291 --> 00:35:10,875
God will not give you
more than you can bear.

637
00:35:11,791 --> 00:35:13,041
Don't ever question God.

638
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:24,416
I think that's another supplier
demanding their money.

639
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,541
Answer the phone. I'll pray for you.

640
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:30,000
God will not give you
more than you can bear.

641
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:31,333
No.

642
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:33,791
It's better if you answer
the phone instead.

643
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:35,833
I will pray for you.

644
00:35:35,916 --> 00:35:37,250
Why me?

645
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:41,625
So. This is it.

646
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:47,000
What? Where's the rest?

647
00:35:48,708 --> 00:35:50,458
What have you done, Mr. Kho?

648
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:53,083
Where's the rest of the speech?

649
00:35:53,541 --> 00:35:55,500
Hey! Psst!

650
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:58,333
I... excuse me. I'm going to the toilet.

651
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:00,750
Hey, Mr. Kho!

652
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:02,833
Adrian!

653
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:04,708
What's going on?

654
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:06,916
Hold on.

655
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,625
I dropped something.

656
00:36:14,541 --> 00:36:15,875
So...

657
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:17,791
Thank you.

658
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:22,125
Have a great day and great lunch.

659
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:31,166
<i>Hello. Hello?</i>

660
00:36:31,791 --> 00:36:32,791
<i>Hello?</i>

661
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:35,708
<i>- Hello?
- I'm Babloo.</i>

662
00:36:35,791 --> 00:36:37,625
<i>Mr. Sanjay from Sarawak Paint,</i>

663
00:36:37,708 --> 00:36:39,250
<i>- asked me to collect the debt.
- Hello?</i>

664
00:36:39,333 --> 00:36:40,291
<i>- Hello?
- The debt.</i>

665
00:36:41,916 --> 00:36:43,875
<i>- When will you...
- Bad connection!</i>

666
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:52,125
Next time, you answer the phone
and I'll do the praying.

667
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:07,500
- How much?
- 300,000 dong.

668
00:37:07,583 --> 00:37:09,166
Too expensive.

669
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:13,041
You can't do that. I can get it
for 50,000 rupiah in Tanah Abang.

670
00:37:13,125 --> 00:37:15,333
Are you trying to rip me off?

671
00:37:15,416 --> 00:37:17,708
Sir! This is Vietnam, not Tanah Abang.

672
00:37:17,791 --> 00:37:19,791
And it's real silk,
you can't get it for 50,000.

673
00:37:19,875 --> 00:37:22,125
Are you stupid? I won't buy it for 50,000.

674
00:37:22,208 --> 00:37:23,500
My final offer is 30,000.

675
00:37:23,583 --> 00:37:25,458
Miss, I'll buy this for 30,000 dong.

676
00:37:25,541 --> 00:37:27,041
Your price is too expensive
and don't rip me off.

677
00:37:27,125 --> 00:37:28,833
Go! Go, go, go!

678
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:30,666
- Is she telling me to go?
- Please, you're making a scene.

679
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,708
Scammer!

680
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:36,833
Both our countries are still categorized
as third world countries. So smug.

681
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:41,083
I have an idea.

682
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:43,208
We'd better...

683
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:44,958
...act like locals.

684
00:37:45,041 --> 00:37:49,916
Act like locals. Yeah?

685
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,750
That way, they'll give us local prices.

686
00:38:24,291 --> 00:38:26,208
Hurry, make an order. Call the waiter.

687
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:29,666
Mr. Kho.

688
00:38:30,416 --> 00:38:31,500
I want...

689
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:34,000
pho, mam chung...

690
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:35,208
Hey, Mr. Kho.

691
00:38:35,708 --> 00:38:38,000
You're spending the company's money.
Don't get too excited.

692
00:38:38,791 --> 00:38:40,333
Do you want me to take it
from your salary?

693
00:38:42,541 --> 00:38:45,625
- Pho only.
- OK. And you?

694
00:38:47,416 --> 00:38:48,833
- Same.
- OK.

695
00:38:49,208 --> 00:38:51,541
- What about you?
- Yes, yes.

696
00:38:52,583 --> 00:38:54,291
Fried rice with "Hamlet" egg.

697
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:57,541
Hamlet egg? We don't have Hamlet egg.

698
00:38:58,291 --> 00:38:59,833
You don't have Hamlet egg?

699
00:38:59,916 --> 00:39:03,333
Hamlet egg is a very simple
egg. I can cook it in your kitchen.

700
00:39:03,416 --> 00:39:06,666
Look, this is egg...

701
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:10,375
you smash it, beat it,
and then you fry it.

702
00:39:10,458 --> 00:39:11,791
How come you can't do it?

703
00:39:12,041 --> 00:39:13,916
Sorry.

704
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,791
Excuse me. Do you have omelet egg?

705
00:39:16,458 --> 00:39:20,041
Yeah. But your friend ordered
Hamlet egg, not omelet egg.

706
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:22,583
Oh, no. Trust me,
he wants omelet egg.

707
00:39:22,666 --> 00:39:23,750
OK.

708
00:39:23,833 --> 00:39:26,000
- Am I right? You want an omelet?
- Yes.

709
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:27,416
It's called "omelet" not "Hamlet".

710
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,708
Hamlet is from a Shakespearean play,
the Prince of Denmark.

711
00:39:29,791 --> 00:39:30,791
Are you sure?

712
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,250
And for you?

713
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:34,916
- No, thank you. I'm fine.
- OK.

714
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:39,041
- You're not ordering anything?
- I lost my appetite.

715
00:39:41,166 --> 00:39:44,125
Look how fat she is when she's not hungry.
Can you imagine when she is?

716
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:46,791
You are fat!

717
00:39:47,125 --> 00:39:48,750
- I forgot.
- Yeah?

718
00:39:49,583 --> 00:39:52,250
Pho not two, no, one.

719
00:39:54,583 --> 00:39:55,458
Sharing.

720
00:39:55,708 --> 00:39:57,125
OK...

721
00:39:57,208 --> 00:39:58,916
Thank you. OK, go.

722
00:39:59,208 --> 00:40:03,208
It will be more romantic
if you eat from one bowl.

723
00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:08,875
Don't forget,
we'll gather again in the lobby

724
00:40:08,958 --> 00:40:11,083
tomorrow morning at 7:00 a.m.
I don't want anyone to be late.

725
00:40:11,166 --> 00:40:12,166
Are you sure?

726
00:40:12,708 --> 00:40:14,583
That means you have to wake up
at 6:00 a.m.

727
00:40:14,666 --> 00:40:18,375
Yeah, absolutely. Why?
I'm a morning person, no problem.

728
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,125
Are you doubting me?

729
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:22,041
Are you sure?

730
00:40:22,375 --> 00:40:23,875
Sure?

731
00:40:23,958 --> 00:40:26,916
- Certain?
- Hey! I'm your boss.

732
00:40:27,583 --> 00:40:29,083
Respect me!

733
00:40:29,333 --> 00:40:31,833
Again, 7:00 a.m., don't be late.

734
00:40:31,916 --> 00:40:33,791
If you're late, I'll cut your salary.

735
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:39,708
- This time, you sleep in the middle.
- No way!

736
00:40:39,791 --> 00:40:43,416
Please, Mr. Kho...

737
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,166
Now that's a good sign.

738
00:40:53,541 --> 00:40:55,000
You two getting along nicely.

739
00:40:56,833 --> 00:40:58,625
What a cute couple.

740
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:07,625
- This room has a very nice view.
- Hi.

741
00:41:07,708 --> 00:41:10,083
This again?
You told us already last night.

742
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:15,333
You're a party pooper, you know that?

743
00:41:16,166 --> 00:41:17,416
Are you jealous of me?

744
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,875
I'm warning you...

745
00:41:21,291 --> 00:41:24,000
nobody snores while I'm sleeping.

746
00:41:25,458 --> 00:41:27,125
It'll be a nightmare for me.

747
00:41:31,666 --> 00:41:33,666
My queen's calling.
It must be important.

748
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:36,541
Hey!

749
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:39,208
Hello, Mommy, darling.

750
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:41,375
Daddy, darling.

751
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:43,916
What are doing tonight?

752
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,875
I'm about to go nite-nite.

753
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:51,708
You're going nite-nite this early?
I don't buy it.

754
00:41:51,791 --> 00:41:56,000
Once you hang up the phone, you'll go
straight to a karaoke club, right?

755
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:59,208
Who would I take to the club? Mr. Kho?

756
00:41:59,291 --> 00:42:00,583
He's over the hill.

757
00:42:00,666 --> 00:42:02,541
What if his rheumatoid plays up?

758
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:06,625
You can't say bad things about people
behind their back.

759
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:10,166
I'm so sad tonight.

760
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:12,708
<i>I feel so old,</i>

761
00:42:12,791 --> 00:42:17,375
with all the wrinkles
and sagging on my face.

762
00:42:17,458 --> 00:42:20,000
I know that,

763
00:42:20,083 --> 00:42:23,166
but I still love you so much.

764
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:26,666
I want to get Botoxed.

765
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:31,125
They say Botox can make me
look like Kim Kardashian.

766
00:42:31,208 --> 00:42:32,583
Who are you talking about?

767
00:42:33,916 --> 00:42:35,208
Is she related to Kim Jong Un?

768
00:42:35,291 --> 00:42:37,041
Can I do Botox, Daddy?

769
00:42:37,125 --> 00:42:38,625
Of course.

770
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:41,000
Do whatever you want.

771
00:42:41,083 --> 00:42:42,875
As long as it's cheap.

772
00:42:42,958 --> 00:42:47,875
Daddy, I love you more and more each day.

773
00:42:47,958 --> 00:42:50,250
<i>You're the best.</i>

774
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:53,250
Do you miss me?

775
00:42:53,541 --> 00:42:56,750
My thoughts are only of you.

776
00:42:57,166 --> 00:42:58,333
I miss you so much.

777
00:42:58,416 --> 00:43:00,250
<i>Prove it.</i>

778
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:04,291
Blow me a kiss.

779
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:06,791
I don't feel it.

780
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:10,333
<i>Kids today call it a wet kiss.</i>

781
00:43:10,416 --> 00:43:12,916
OK, Mommy.

782
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:19,875
<i>Oh, Daddy.</i>

783
00:43:23,791 --> 00:43:26,916
- Not sleeping again?
- How could we?

784
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,166
There were two lovers
flirting on the phone all night.

785
00:43:33,666 --> 00:43:35,916
Hey! Good morning!

786
00:43:38,708 --> 00:43:41,958
Hey! Come on, where's your spirit?

787
00:43:42,041 --> 00:43:43,916
Where's your spirit? Wake up!

788
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,666
Look alive! What time is it?

789
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,500
Good morning!

790
00:43:49,583 --> 00:43:52,041
Good morning, boss. We go "ow"?

791
00:43:52,125 --> 00:43:55,708
- What?
- We. Go. Ow?

792
00:43:55,791 --> 00:43:57,000
What is he talking about?

793
00:43:57,083 --> 00:44:00,041
- We go ow?
- It's "we go out".

794
00:44:00,125 --> 00:44:01,666
Oh, we go "out."

795
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:03,833
Why did you say, "We go ow"?

796
00:44:03,916 --> 00:44:05,666
- OK, let's go.
- Let's go.

797
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:06,708
Yeah.

798
00:44:08,333 --> 00:44:09,166
Good.

799
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:19,458
Are we lost? We've been driving for hours.

800
00:44:19,541 --> 00:44:22,583
Hey, sir.

801
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,416
Wrong way! We go back.

802
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,458
- Map. Go back.
- What?

803
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:30,375
Are you listening to me?

804
00:44:30,458 --> 00:44:32,625
Where did you get the driver? From Uganda?

805
00:44:32,708 --> 00:44:35,500
He doesn't know where he's going
and he dares to talk back to me.

806
00:44:35,583 --> 00:44:37,708
If you wrong-wrong, I can't concentrate.

807
00:44:37,791 --> 00:44:38,791
Did he just yell at me?

808
00:44:38,875 --> 00:44:40,916
Please, sir, he's a local.

809
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,125
He knows where he's going.

810
00:44:42,208 --> 00:44:44,541
How do you know if he's local or not?

811
00:44:44,625 --> 00:44:46,500
Did he show you his birth certificate?

812
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:47,958
Do you know Obama's nationality?

813
00:44:48,041 --> 00:44:49,750
- American.
- How do you know?

814
00:44:50,458 --> 00:44:52,291
Did he show you his birth certificate?

815
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,416
Are you laughing at me?

816
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,833
Hey! Do you want your salary cut?

817
00:45:07,375 --> 00:45:09,666
Hey, Duong, wake up.

818
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:11,041
I've told you over and over again.

819
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:12,875
Don't go to the karaoke club every night.

820
00:45:12,958 --> 00:45:14,291
Work hard! Don't get messed up.

821
00:45:14,375 --> 00:45:15,375
A client's about to come.

822
00:45:15,458 --> 00:45:16,416
Yeah, yeah.

823
00:45:22,291 --> 00:45:24,666
Get ready! Open your eyes wide!

824
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:26,375
My eyes are like this.
They're open already.

825
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:30,083
Are they Chinese?

826
00:45:30,166 --> 00:45:31,416
No, Malaysian!

827
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,166
Nguyen!

828
00:45:35,791 --> 00:45:37,666
<i>Konnichiwa.</i>

829
00:45:39,375 --> 00:45:41,291
Hello, Bossman. Welcome to Vietnam.

830
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:42,375
Yes.

831
00:45:42,458 --> 00:45:45,541
I thought you got lost on the way,
but you're here before us.

832
00:45:45,625 --> 00:45:46,750
I live here, boss.

833
00:45:46,833 --> 00:45:47,750
I won't get lost.

834
00:45:47,833 --> 00:45:50,375
Yeah, I forgot about that.

835
00:45:50,458 --> 00:45:52,583
Guys, this is Nguyen.

836
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:55,666
He lived in Malaysia quite a long time.

837
00:45:55,750 --> 00:46:00,541
He's smart, kind, and friendly.

838
00:46:00,833 --> 00:46:03,375
Stupid! You embarrassed me!

839
00:46:03,458 --> 00:46:05,916
You've eaten so many
noodles, your brain works like one!

840
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,666
<i>"Konnichiwa" is Japanese, not Malay.</i>

841
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:09,958
Stupid!

842
00:46:11,208 --> 00:46:12,791
OK, Bossman and friends.

843
00:46:12,875 --> 00:46:14,125
I'll take you to meet the workers.

844
00:46:14,208 --> 00:46:15,125
They're all ready,

845
00:46:15,208 --> 00:46:16,333
and all is come from North.

846
00:46:16,416 --> 00:46:17,458
Good.

847
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,750
What's with your face? Smile!

848
00:46:20,833 --> 00:46:22,541
Do you want them to think
our country is not hospitable?

849
00:46:22,625 --> 00:46:24,333
Don't embarrass me! Smile!

850
00:46:24,583 --> 00:46:27,000
Open your eyes! Open them wide!

851
00:46:27,083 --> 00:46:28,833
They'll think you're sleeping!

852
00:46:28,916 --> 00:46:29,958
Smile!

853
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,500
OK, let's go.

854
00:46:32,583 --> 00:46:34,583
- The boat's ready.
- Yes.

855
00:46:35,791 --> 00:46:36,708
Smile!

856
00:46:38,083 --> 00:46:39,083
Smile!

857
00:46:40,708 --> 00:46:41,708
Smile!

858
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:43,833
<i>Konnichiwa.</i>

859
00:46:46,916 --> 00:46:48,166
Are you sure?

860
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:50,208
Do you need to ask?

861
00:46:50,291 --> 00:46:53,875
Look at me, do I look I'm afraid
of this kind of adventure?

862
00:46:53,958 --> 00:46:56,625
I'm excited.

863
00:46:56,708 --> 00:46:59,416
Unlike some people I know.

864
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,333
You need fighting spirit.

865
00:47:01,416 --> 00:47:02,375
Move.

866
00:47:02,708 --> 00:47:04,833
- Lady's first.
- Lady.

867
00:47:04,916 --> 00:47:06,458
Kerani, get in the boat.

868
00:47:07,416 --> 00:47:08,958
All right, all right!

869
00:47:10,458 --> 00:47:12,958
This is unexpectedly comfortable.

870
00:47:30,583 --> 00:47:32,458
Where are we going, really?

871
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:36,666
I don't know, and even if I knew,
I wouldn't tell you.

872
00:47:37,458 --> 00:47:39,041
Hey, Nguyen...

873
00:47:39,125 --> 00:47:42,958
what kind of boat doesn't have
any fan or AC?

874
00:47:43,041 --> 00:47:44,750
- I'm cooked!
- I can't hear you!

875
00:47:44,833 --> 00:47:47,000
This is called adventure, boss.

876
00:47:47,083 --> 00:47:50,083
Right, Mr. Kho? Right, Kerani?

877
00:47:50,541 --> 00:47:52,583
Hey, Duong, don't sleep!

878
00:47:53,416 --> 00:47:55,750
Don't you dare sleep,
or I'll give your eyes chili sauce!

879
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:59,291
Can you drive faster?

880
00:47:59,375 --> 00:48:01,916
How many times
do I have to tell you to fix the machine!

881
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,583
Why don't you fix this?

882
00:48:03,666 --> 00:48:05,416
Don't rock the boat, you'll tip it!

883
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:07,791
Hey! Calm down!

884
00:48:26,458 --> 00:48:28,750
- Hey, Nguyen!
- Yes, Boss?

885
00:48:28,833 --> 00:48:31,666
- Are there any anacondas in here?
- Huh?

886
00:48:36,333 --> 00:48:39,791
Where are we heading to?
We've been going for hours.

887
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,958
Are you leading us
to the King Kong village?

888
00:48:42,375 --> 00:48:44,333
- Are we there yet?
- Remember, boss.

889
00:48:44,416 --> 00:48:46,250
Fighting spirit!

890
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:51,000
Sir, I don't think going to rural area
was on my contract.

891
00:48:51,791 --> 00:48:54,541
Look at Mr. Kho.
I think he's turning into a zombie.

892
00:48:54,625 --> 00:48:56,750
That's his normal expression.

893
00:49:02,791 --> 00:49:03,916
Remember, Azhari.

894
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,416
God will not give you more
than you can bear.

895
00:49:19,625 --> 00:49:22,708
Pick up the phone, Azhari.
Don't question God.

896
00:49:24,166 --> 00:49:27,125
Hello, sorry, wrong number!

897
00:49:27,208 --> 00:49:28,791
Wrong number, you said?

898
00:49:31,791 --> 00:49:34,500
We're dead!

899
00:49:34,583 --> 00:49:37,708
Yeah! Where's your boss?

900
00:49:39,458 --> 00:49:41,500
Oh, my goodness!

901
00:49:41,583 --> 00:49:43,083
Find Bossman.

902
00:49:43,166 --> 00:49:45,083
If he tries to fight back, bag him.

903
00:49:46,541 --> 00:49:47,875
Find him first.

904
00:49:47,958 --> 00:49:51,625
If he tries to fight back,
bag him and throw him into the sea.

905
00:49:51,708 --> 00:49:53,000
Don't do that!

906
00:49:53,083 --> 00:49:54,625
Listen up, find him.

907
00:49:54,708 --> 00:49:57,500
And don't let Inspector Vijay
find him first.

908
00:49:57,583 --> 00:49:59,791
This slanted jerk!

909
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:03,583
Spread out! Bring Bossman to me
as soon as you find him.

910
00:50:03,958 --> 00:50:06,208
Search every nook and cranny!

911
00:50:06,291 --> 00:50:10,541
Don't let that Sun Go Kong
get his hands on him first!

912
00:50:11,166 --> 00:50:12,458
You jerk!

913
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:15,375
Come, Bossman. Come.

914
00:50:17,458 --> 00:50:19,083
Anybody want to carry me?

915
00:50:19,958 --> 00:50:21,458
I'll raise your salary!

916
00:50:21,541 --> 00:50:22,708
Fighting spirit, boss!

917
00:50:22,791 --> 00:50:24,166
Shut up!

918
00:50:25,333 --> 00:50:29,666
My feet are killing me. Is there any
vehicle here to drive us there?

919
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:31,750
Sir...

920
00:50:32,125 --> 00:50:35,291
Bossman went abroad.

921
00:50:35,375 --> 00:50:37,708
Hey! Let me tell you.

922
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,333
Your boss said he'd pay us last week.

923
00:50:42,708 --> 00:50:45,958
Where's the money? Where?

924
00:50:46,875 --> 00:50:50,125
He took many containers of our logs.

925
00:50:50,416 --> 00:50:53,083
My boss is getting impatient.

926
00:50:53,166 --> 00:50:56,375
If Bossman won't pay us,
let's bag them instead.

927
00:50:57,416 --> 00:51:00,791
Please, be patient, gentlemen.

928
00:51:00,875 --> 00:51:05,416
God is with those who are patient.

929
00:51:07,833 --> 00:51:09,375
We've run out of patience!

930
00:51:09,458 --> 00:51:12,375
You guys talk too much!

931
00:51:12,458 --> 00:51:15,833
I came here to get my money,
not to be patient!

932
00:51:15,916 --> 00:51:18,833
If you try anything funny,
I'm gonna bury you alive!

933
00:51:18,916 --> 00:51:21,208
Understand?

934
00:51:21,291 --> 00:51:24,833
Your boss owes my boss money.

935
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:29,083
His name is Mr. Sanjay.
He has failed to pay us since last year!

936
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:36,416
Bossman and friends,
beautiful view, isn't it?

937
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:40,083
No time to admire the view!
We're exhausted!

938
00:51:43,125 --> 00:51:44,125
Ma'am.

939
00:51:44,583 --> 00:51:46,583
Are all roads in this area like this?

940
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:48,875
Have you ever get tired
walking everywhere?

941
00:51:48,958 --> 00:51:49,875
Hey, beautiful.

942
00:51:51,958 --> 00:51:56,083
- Have mercy on us, God!
- Pay up now.

943
00:51:56,416 --> 00:51:58,541
If you don't wanna pay,
I'll make you guys black and blue!

944
00:52:00,125 --> 00:52:02,208
Wanna taste my fist?

945
00:52:03,916 --> 00:52:04,791
Understand?

946
00:52:04,875 --> 00:52:06,875
Understand.

947
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:10,833
- Understand?
- Understand.

948
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,041
Hurry up!

949
00:52:13,125 --> 00:52:14,666
Tell the cow to move aside.

950
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:18,583
Move! Move!

951
00:52:18,666 --> 00:52:22,916
Please pick up, Kerani!

952
00:52:31,833 --> 00:52:35,958
We're almost there, Bossman! Fighting.

953
00:52:36,041 --> 00:52:38,666
- Where are you, Kerani?
- Hey!

954
00:52:39,041 --> 00:52:41,208
Where's your boss?

955
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:43,083
- I want to talk to him.
- OK, OK!

956
00:52:43,166 --> 00:52:46,000
Beautiful, call your boss...

957
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:48,333
Otherwise, I'll kill him!

958
00:52:48,416 --> 00:52:50,625
- Please, don't kill me.
- I'll kill him.

959
00:52:50,708 --> 00:52:53,625
Wait! I'm calling the boss!

960
00:52:53,708 --> 00:52:55,916
Spare me, please,
I haven't go to the Hajj.

961
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,208
Get ready.

962
00:52:59,791 --> 00:53:02,833
Put your shirt on.
You think this is the field?

963
00:53:03,875 --> 00:53:06,500
Gosh! Did you get drunk last night?

964
00:53:07,291 --> 00:53:12,208
Hurry up!

965
00:53:13,541 --> 00:53:17,500
Why is he always angry?
Is he talking to them or yelling at them?

966
00:53:18,625 --> 00:53:19,625
Gosh.

967
00:53:27,208 --> 00:53:28,375
- Bossman?
- What?

968
00:53:28,458 --> 00:53:30,125
These are the workers I told you about.

969
00:53:30,208 --> 00:53:35,000
OK. Mr. Kho, Adrian, go interview them.

970
00:53:35,083 --> 00:53:37,375
What interview? Isn't that Kerani's job?

971
00:53:37,458 --> 00:53:39,500
Because I'm telling you to do it.

972
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:42,541
If she does the interview,
she'll end up asking about chili price.

973
00:53:42,625 --> 00:53:44,541
Stop questioning my decision. Go!

974
00:53:49,291 --> 00:53:50,583
Wait here, boss.

975
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:57,250
- Why do you want me here then?
- Come with me.

976
00:53:57,333 --> 00:53:58,958
You have more important things to do.

977
00:53:59,041 --> 00:54:01,416
What are those?

978
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:05,291
Tell them to fill in bio data
and working experience.

979
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:06,750
What do you mean working experience?

980
00:54:07,541 --> 00:54:08,625
Working experience.

981
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:11,333
Cannot.

982
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:13,666
Cannot.

983
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,208
I have a feeling
this isn't going to end well.

984
00:54:18,333 --> 00:54:20,500
Don't make me look fat.

985
00:54:20,791 --> 00:54:23,583
Can I do something more useful

986
00:54:23,666 --> 00:54:25,708
than taking your stupid photos?

987
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:27,833
Can you stop complaining for once?

988
00:54:27,916 --> 00:54:29,458
You're not complaining only when you eat.

989
00:54:29,541 --> 00:54:30,916
Look how fat you are. Give me my phone.

990
00:54:31,416 --> 00:54:34,541
Well, then, take your own picture!

991
00:54:37,541 --> 00:54:39,916
My bag isn't shown in the picture.

992
00:54:41,208 --> 00:54:42,541
Yes, Sikin.

993
00:54:42,625 --> 00:54:44,208
Hello, Miss Kerani!

994
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,458
Thank goodness.

995
00:54:46,875 --> 00:54:50,583
Miss, some gangsters
have taken us hostage.

996
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,875
<i>They came here
to collect the boss' debt.</i>

997
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:56,416
If we don't give them money today,

998
00:54:56,500 --> 00:55:00,541
we will be killed.

999
00:55:00,625 --> 00:55:03,250
Die!

1000
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:06,875
OK, calm down.

1001
00:55:06,958 --> 00:55:09,166
<i>Bossman is here with me.
I'm gonna give the phone to him.</i>

1002
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:10,583
Bossman?

1003
00:55:13,291 --> 00:55:14,916
Sir.

1004
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,041
Sikin and Azhari are being held hostage
by some gangsters.

1005
00:55:18,125 --> 00:55:20,791
They want their money today.

1006
00:55:20,875 --> 00:55:23,541
- Do something! They're freaking out!
- Really?

1007
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,750
Hello, Sikin.

1008
00:55:29,833 --> 00:55:31,500
Hello? Boss?

1009
00:55:33,458 --> 00:55:36,000
Uh-huh... Yes...

1010
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:39,083
Are you sure, boss?

1011
00:55:39,166 --> 00:55:40,916
Calm down.

1012
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,291
Take a deep breath and say hi to Azhari.

1013
00:55:43,375 --> 00:55:45,250
OK, OK.

1014
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:51,625
Thank God!

1015
00:55:51,708 --> 00:55:55,375
Bossman said he'll send someone
to deliver the money to you.

1016
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:02,583
But if your Bossman lies again,

1017
00:56:02,666 --> 00:56:08,083
I will destroy this office!

1018
00:56:11,083 --> 00:56:14,625
If your boss lies again, I will...

1019
00:56:15,333 --> 00:56:17,416
- Yeah?
- Guys.

1020
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:20,208
What did Inspector Vijay say?

1021
00:56:20,291 --> 00:56:21,750
He'll destroy this office.

1022
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:25,875
Ah. If your boss lies again,

1023
00:56:25,958 --> 00:56:28,083
I'll burn this office!

1024
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,416
No!

1025
00:56:34,416 --> 00:56:37,625
- Well?
- Don't worry.

1026
00:56:37,708 --> 00:56:39,583
Just enjoy the view.

1027
00:56:39,666 --> 00:56:41,583
Flowers all around you...

1028
00:56:42,791 --> 00:56:45,208
- Boss!
- And, they destroy the view. What?

1029
00:56:45,458 --> 00:56:47,250
- Problem.
- What problem?

1030
00:56:47,333 --> 00:56:50,083
If you want to be in the picture with me,
then no. Get back to work!

1031
00:56:50,375 --> 00:56:53,250
Those men don't have any work experience.

1032
00:56:53,333 --> 00:56:55,041
No working experience.

1033
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:56,833
What?

1034
00:56:56,916 --> 00:56:59,000
You said you didn't mind
if they had no experience.

1035
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:00,375
All you want is cheap.

1036
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:01,916
I give you good and cheap.

1037
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,125
When did I say that? I didn't say that.

1038
00:57:04,208 --> 00:57:06,041
We have many workers
without working experience.

1039
00:57:06,458 --> 00:57:10,458
- Some of them are even illiterate.
- Nobody asked you.

1040
00:57:10,541 --> 00:57:13,375
Tell them, without experience,
the offer will be reduced to half.

1041
00:57:13,458 --> 00:57:15,083
But, boss, we agreed.

1042
00:57:15,166 --> 00:57:16,250
If you don't pay full,

1043
00:57:16,333 --> 00:57:17,291
you'll breach the contract.

1044
00:57:17,375 --> 00:57:18,875
What contract?

1045
00:57:18,958 --> 00:57:21,041
Mr. Kho, go back there and tell them.

1046
00:57:21,125 --> 00:57:25,083
- No thanks. Tell them yourself.
- OK!

1047
00:57:27,208 --> 00:57:29,708
Kerani, go tell them.

1048
00:57:29,791 --> 00:57:31,166
Why me?

1049
00:57:35,125 --> 00:57:37,125
- Radio.
- Yes, boss.

1050
00:57:39,166 --> 00:57:43,375
Let's turn on the radio.

1051
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:08,541
This song makes me sick.

1052
00:58:10,791 --> 00:58:12,583
Hey, bro. Do you have a problem?

1053
00:58:15,375 --> 00:58:18,250
No, bro. Do you have a problem, bro?

1054
00:58:18,333 --> 00:58:21,333
No, bro. Do you have a problem, bro!

1055
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:23,458
Chill, bro!

1056
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:26,625
Everything will be all right, Bro!

1057
00:58:26,708 --> 00:58:28,041
Do you have a problem, bro?

1058
00:58:29,666 --> 00:58:32,041
Excuse me. It's praying time.

1059
00:58:34,125 --> 00:58:35,458
Nice try, bro.

1060
00:58:36,958 --> 00:58:38,666
He said he's a gangster.

1061
00:58:39,083 --> 00:58:42,625
But he listens to mellow music
from, what are they called?

1062
00:58:42,916 --> 00:58:45,541
- Boy band, boss.
- Ah, boy band!

1063
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:50,750
It's better than your people.

1064
00:58:51,875 --> 00:58:55,250
Broken-hearted, crying,
sad, or even mad...

1065
00:58:55,333 --> 00:58:56,416
you're always dancing.

1066
00:58:58,875 --> 00:59:02,000
Have you ever seen a sad person dancing?

1067
00:59:02,083 --> 00:59:04,208
If you see a tree, you'll dance around it.

1068
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,416
You see a clothesline,
you'll dance around it, too.

1069
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:08,833
Embarrassing!

1070
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,291
Oh, you being racist, bro?

1071
00:59:19,291 --> 00:59:22,208
No, bro. I'm being realistic, bro.

1072
00:59:24,416 --> 00:59:26,041
Fine!

1073
00:59:30,958 --> 00:59:34,041
Please don't fight in here.

1074
00:59:34,916 --> 00:59:39,666
Let's have a battle to see who's the best.

1075
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:40,916
OK.

1076
00:59:41,916 --> 00:59:43,875
- Both of you...
- Are gonna be our witnesses.

1077
01:00:37,875 --> 01:00:38,791
Calm down.

1078
01:00:38,875 --> 01:00:41,583
The agreement
wasn't like that! We disagree!

1079
01:00:41,666 --> 01:00:45,833
- I know, but listen up...
- No!

1080
01:00:45,916 --> 01:00:47,583
- Listen up...
- Cheater!

1081
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:49,916
You guys tried to trick us?

1082
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:50,958
Listen up...

1083
01:00:51,041 --> 01:00:53,250
Mr. Kho, what are they yelling about?

1084
01:00:53,333 --> 01:00:54,333
I don't know.

1085
01:00:54,416 --> 01:00:57,333
But I can confirm
they're not saying "I love you."

1086
01:01:44,916 --> 01:01:47,500
- Listen up...
- Let's beat them up!

1087
01:01:47,583 --> 01:01:48,875
Why is everything like this?

1088
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:53,125
Look what you've done!

1089
01:01:53,208 --> 01:01:54,208
Mr. Kho, Adrian.

1090
01:01:54,291 --> 01:01:55,625
What's going on?

1091
01:01:55,708 --> 01:02:00,708
Wait for me!
Can you even negotiate, Mr. Kho?

1092
01:02:00,791 --> 01:02:01,750
Hey!

1093
01:02:48,041 --> 01:02:49,416
DO NOT ENTER
WITHOUT PERMISSION

1094
01:03:51,166 --> 01:03:52,625
Peace be upon you.

1095
01:03:54,833 --> 01:03:56,833
Peace be upon you, too.

1096
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:58,708
Smartass, who are you?

1097
01:03:59,041 --> 01:04:00,875
Want me to punch you?

1098
01:04:00,958 --> 01:04:02,208
Are you Bossman's friend?

1099
01:04:02,291 --> 01:04:03,333
Relax, bro.

1100
01:04:03,416 --> 01:04:04,666
I'm innocent.

1101
01:04:05,541 --> 01:04:08,625
Look at me. I'm innocent.

1102
01:04:08,708 --> 01:04:13,791
I couldn't be friends with Bossman.

1103
01:04:18,958 --> 01:04:21,625
See?

1104
01:04:22,083 --> 01:04:25,375
I think the horse hates him, too.

1105
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:27,750
Come, look closer.

1106
01:04:28,291 --> 01:04:33,958
If the horse could speak,
what would it say?

1107
01:04:36,583 --> 01:04:38,791
Hold on. Who are you?

1108
01:04:43,083 --> 01:04:45,541
Hey, chicks!

1109
01:04:46,875 --> 01:04:50,208
I'm here to give you money.

1110
01:04:52,125 --> 01:04:54,208
- Where's the money?
- I got the money.

1111
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:56,500
The money...?

1112
01:04:56,583 --> 01:04:57,791
With me.

1113
01:04:57,875 --> 01:04:59,416
Give it to me, quick!

1114
01:05:01,333 --> 01:05:03,250
Patience.

1115
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,750
- Thank you.
- Hey, smartass.

1116
01:05:05,833 --> 01:05:07,416
He got the money, what about mine?

1117
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:08,916
Patience.

1118
01:05:13,791 --> 01:05:17,041
Paid off. Now off you go.

1119
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:20,541
- Geng, let's go.
- Go.

1120
01:05:31,416 --> 01:05:32,750
Thank God.

1121
01:05:46,875 --> 01:05:50,666
The car's gone!

1122
01:05:50,916 --> 01:05:54,416
You complained to him so much
the driver left us here!

1123
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:58,541
Do you realize
you almost got us all killed?

1124
01:05:59,708 --> 01:06:02,791
Kerani, stop rambling,

1125
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:05,000
and start looking for an ice cream vendor.

1126
01:06:06,291 --> 01:06:07,958
I'm thirsty.

1127
01:06:13,166 --> 01:06:14,666
Hey!

1128
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:57,833
No, I give you money 20,000 dong,

1129
01:06:57,916 --> 01:06:59,458
not 10,000.

1130
01:06:59,541 --> 01:07:02,875
So, you give my money back 10,000 dong.

1131
01:07:02,958 --> 01:07:05,500
- Understand?
- No. 10,000 Dong.

1132
01:07:05,583 --> 01:07:09,250
Yes, give me back.
You're wrong. Give me back.

1133
01:07:09,333 --> 01:07:11,333
- No! No!
- Yes! Yes!

1134
01:07:11,416 --> 01:07:13,041
- No!
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

1135
01:07:13,125 --> 01:07:14,208
No! No! No!

1136
01:07:17,416 --> 01:07:19,666
Get out,
penniless passenger. No money, out.

1137
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:22,375
Making such a fuss over a small problem.

1138
01:07:22,458 --> 01:07:24,916
I'm not afraid of that amount of money.
I'm rich.

1139
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,458
That's only a little bit of money.
Why are you guys so stupid?

1140
01:07:27,541 --> 01:07:29,458
Why are you pointing at me?

1141
01:07:29,541 --> 01:07:33,458
- What do you want? Why you pointing at me?
- Sir, stop it.

1142
01:07:33,541 --> 01:07:35,875
Who's in the wrong?
You didn't give my money back.

1143
01:07:35,958 --> 01:07:37,375
Why are you hitting my bus?

1144
01:07:37,458 --> 01:07:39,000
- Let's beat them!
- Let me finish you!

1145
01:07:39,083 --> 01:07:43,166
- Come here if you can!
- Jerk!

1146
01:08:17,583 --> 01:08:19,458
My lungs just blew up.

1147
01:08:19,541 --> 01:08:21,125
Where's Mr. Kho and Adrian?

1148
01:08:47,833 --> 01:08:49,000
Kerani.

1149
01:08:50,041 --> 01:08:51,916
Please don't be mad at me.

1150
01:08:52,625 --> 01:08:54,333
I'm scared when you're mad.

1151
01:08:54,625 --> 01:08:55,833
You look scary.

1152
01:08:57,958 --> 01:09:00,541
I'll buy you pizza after this.

1153
01:09:00,625 --> 01:09:02,125
It will be delicious.

1154
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:03,916
I'm gonna pay for it.

1155
01:09:08,916 --> 01:09:10,375
Are we good?

1156
01:09:17,458 --> 01:09:19,458
Hey! Nguyen?

1157
01:09:20,416 --> 01:09:22,083
- Psst!
- Evening, Officer.

1158
01:09:22,166 --> 01:09:23,125
Are they your friends?

1159
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:24,791
Yes, they're my friends.

1160
01:09:25,916 --> 01:09:29,416
I'll explain this misunderstanding.

1161
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:31,333
OK. You can meet them now.

1162
01:09:31,416 --> 01:09:32,333
Thank you, sir.

1163
01:09:32,666 --> 01:09:33,666
Nguyen.

1164
01:09:36,041 --> 01:09:38,291
- Nguyen.
- Are you OK?

1165
01:09:38,375 --> 01:09:39,458
Do I look OK?

1166
01:09:40,208 --> 01:09:42,041
I'm helping you for the last time.

1167
01:09:42,125 --> 01:09:43,750
After this. I don't want to

1168
01:09:43,833 --> 01:09:45,666
deal with any of you again. Understand?

1169
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:47,250
What an asshole-

1170
01:09:48,291 --> 01:09:49,458
You want my help or not?

1171
01:09:49,875 --> 01:09:51,958
Thank you so much.

1172
01:09:52,041 --> 01:09:53,416
Ignore him.

1173
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:54,875
Just help the rest of us.

1174
01:09:54,958 --> 01:09:56,291
Entitled bastard!

1175
01:10:03,958 --> 01:10:05,083
Kera.

1176
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:12,458
What now? I'm about to sleep!

1177
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:15,791
I bought you pizza.

1178
01:10:15,875 --> 01:10:18,500
I thought you were hungry,
because you're always hungry.

1179
01:10:18,583 --> 01:10:20,750
It has a special Vietnam grass topping.

1180
01:10:20,833 --> 01:10:22,708
Don't play nice with me,
it won't change a thing.

1181
01:10:22,791 --> 01:10:25,166
And I'm too tired to eat
after being chased by everyone in Vietnam.

1182
01:10:31,916 --> 01:10:34,458
Then who's gonna eat this pizza?

1183
01:10:34,541 --> 01:10:36,416
I can't eat this.

1184
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:37,916
What if I become fat?

1185
01:10:38,541 --> 01:10:40,250
On the other hand, you're already fat.

1186
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:46,166
If he's not come in half an hour,

1187
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:47,250
let's leave him.

1188
01:10:49,625 --> 01:10:53,166
Where's the car? And where's the driver?

1189
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:55,291
Don't just stand there.

1190
01:10:55,375 --> 01:10:57,583
You booked the car for two hours ago.

1191
01:10:57,666 --> 01:10:59,458
Obviously the driver took another guest.

1192
01:10:59,541 --> 01:11:02,083
What a sleazy hotel.
Wait till I file for a complaint.

1193
01:11:02,166 --> 01:11:05,833
Please don't create more trouble.

1194
01:11:05,916 --> 01:11:08,083
He's right. Let's just grab a taxi.

1195
01:11:08,166 --> 01:11:09,958
- What did you say?
- Grab a taxi?

1196
01:11:10,041 --> 01:11:11,416
Grab a taxi?

1197
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:13,250
To the airport? Grab a taxi?

1198
01:11:13,333 --> 01:11:15,041
It's too expensive!

1199
01:11:15,125 --> 01:11:17,166
How convenient for you.

1200
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:20,166
The airport is far from our hotel, fool.
You never learn, do you?

1201
01:11:41,458 --> 01:11:43,541
Psst!

1202
01:11:45,083 --> 01:11:45,958
Psst!

1203
01:11:47,291 --> 01:11:48,916
Are you sure
the bus is going to the airport?

1204
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,458
Yes, it is.

1205
01:11:51,291 --> 01:11:54,500
Am I smart or what?
If you're kind to people,

1206
01:11:54,583 --> 01:11:56,833
somehow there's always a way out.

1207
01:11:58,625 --> 01:11:59,916
There's always a way out!

1208
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,250
Are you sleeping already?

1209
01:12:01,333 --> 01:12:02,458
Hi, everyone.

1210
01:12:02,958 --> 01:12:03,791
Li Hua.

1211
01:12:08,708 --> 01:12:10,291
Are they a tourist group?

1212
01:12:10,375 --> 01:12:13,375
Yeah. But they're all going
to the airport, too.

1213
01:12:13,458 --> 01:12:15,083
But we don't belong to their group.

1214
01:12:15,166 --> 01:12:17,666
Stop complaining.
It's a free ride. Be grateful!

1215
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:21,416
He's coming.

1216
01:12:26,291 --> 01:12:28,708
- Who are you?
- Me?

1217
01:12:28,791 --> 01:12:30,000
Yeah.

1218
01:12:31,583 --> 01:12:32,583
George.

1219
01:12:32,666 --> 01:12:34,625
George what?

1220
01:12:34,708 --> 01:12:35,708
George...

1221
01:12:36,666 --> 01:12:37,750
George Clooney?

1222
01:12:37,833 --> 01:12:39,375
George Clooney?

1223
01:12:39,916 --> 01:12:42,291
We don't have your name on this list.

1224
01:12:42,375 --> 01:12:46,166
Oh, it cannot be. There must be a mistake.

1225
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:48,291
Because we're in the same group.

1226
01:12:48,375 --> 01:12:49,958
Same group with...

1227
01:12:50,041 --> 01:12:52,083
With Li Hua? Hua Liu?

1228
01:12:52,625 --> 01:12:56,625
Hey, yeah! My friend. See?

1229
01:12:56,708 --> 01:12:59,208
Friend. Good friend. Group. Same.

1230
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:02,208
But we don't have your name on this list.

1231
01:13:02,291 --> 01:13:04,333
It's not my problem. It's your problem.

1232
01:13:04,416 --> 01:13:06,166
- My problem?
- Yes, your problem.

1233
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:08,875
Because I'm not in your list.

1234
01:13:08,958 --> 01:13:11,750
You. Wrong. You can get fired. Kick out.

1235
01:13:11,833 --> 01:13:13,500
Understand? Complain.

1236
01:13:13,583 --> 01:13:15,208
- I will complain about you.
- Huh?

1237
01:13:15,291 --> 01:13:16,583
I'll call your big boss.

1238
01:13:19,125 --> 01:13:20,708
What's wrong with this guy?

1239
01:13:20,916 --> 01:13:22,750
Damn it! What day today?

1240
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:27,958
Psst!

1241
01:13:28,041 --> 01:13:29,166
Li Hua!

1242
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:34,875
He's grinning!

1243
01:14:03,041 --> 01:14:04,541
George Clooney!

1244
01:14:05,333 --> 01:14:06,666
Julia Robert!

1245
01:14:07,333 --> 01:14:08,291
Ben Affleck!

1246
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:09,833
Boboho!

1247
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:13,333
George Clooney!

1248
01:14:13,416 --> 01:14:14,875
Julia Robert!

1249
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:16,666
Ben Affleck!

1250
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:17,791
Boboho!

1251
01:14:19,125 --> 01:14:20,916
We're here now.

1252
01:14:21,375 --> 01:14:22,583
Let's go.

1253
01:14:23,541 --> 01:14:25,166
Sir.

1254
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:28,500
No money! No money!

1255
01:14:28,583 --> 01:14:29,916
Everyone, follow me.

1256
01:14:35,291 --> 01:14:37,416
Put your luggage in the bus.

1257
01:14:38,041 --> 01:14:39,166
Why?

1258
01:14:39,666 --> 01:14:42,041
OK, up to you. We go together.

1259
01:14:42,125 --> 01:14:44,666
Please don't separate
yourself from the group.

1260
01:14:44,916 --> 01:14:46,083
Erm...

1261
01:14:46,166 --> 01:14:48,541
Excuse me. Where are we going?

1262
01:14:48,625 --> 01:14:51,125
We are going to see the prison museum.

1263
01:14:51,208 --> 01:14:53,375
No, no, no!

1264
01:14:53,458 --> 01:14:56,333
I went to the prison yesterday.

1265
01:14:56,833 --> 01:14:59,291
With the police. I was afraid.

1266
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:04,041
Hey, excuse me!

1267
01:15:05,333 --> 01:15:06,333
Come here.

1268
01:15:07,583 --> 01:15:09,625
We don't go to the airport?

1269
01:15:09,708 --> 01:15:13,541
Yes, but before we are going
to see the prison museum.

1270
01:15:13,625 --> 01:15:16,916
And then go to the Pagoda National Park,

1271
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:21,125
after that then, we are going
to the airport in the evening at six.

1272
01:15:21,916 --> 01:15:22,958
What?

1273
01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:27,458
Everyone, follow me.

1274
01:15:27,541 --> 01:15:28,750
Sick?

1275
01:15:31,916 --> 01:15:35,250
Our flight leaves at 3:00 p.m.

1276
01:15:35,333 --> 01:15:37,750
I don't want to spend another night
in this country.

1277
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:41,000
- I want to go home!
- Fine, Julia. Don't worry.

1278
01:15:41,083 --> 01:15:44,958
I'm gonna find a way to leave this group
without anyone noticing.

1279
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:47,291
Be more like Ben Affleck and Boboho.

1280
01:15:47,375 --> 01:15:49,416
They don't complain as much as you do.

1281
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:53,041
You'd cut our salary
if we dared to complain to you.

1282
01:15:55,041 --> 01:15:57,875
The murderous crime of the France colonies

1283
01:15:57,958 --> 01:16:03,916
against the Vietnam
political prisoners in Hoa Lo Prison,

1284
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,500
who used a guillotine
to execute them.

1285
01:16:07,583 --> 01:16:11,541
The guillotine
that was used in Hoa Lo prison

1286
01:16:11,625 --> 01:16:17,125
was imported from France
to Hanoi in 1894.

1287
01:16:17,208 --> 01:16:19,708
Everyone follow me.

1288
01:16:38,541 --> 01:16:39,458
Come.

1289
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:17,458
Everyone follow me.

1290
01:17:17,541 --> 01:17:19,291
We are going to another room.

1291
01:17:46,208 --> 01:17:47,125
Honey.

1292
01:17:49,583 --> 01:17:50,958
Thank you.

1293
01:17:56,375 --> 01:18:00,000
Don't waste your time thinking about it.

1294
01:18:00,083 --> 01:18:01,666
But, honey...

1295
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:04,583
- You need to forget about it.
- I know, but...

1296
01:18:07,875 --> 01:18:09,250
Listen to me...

1297
01:18:09,333 --> 01:18:11,041
look at me, look into my eyes.

1298
01:18:11,125 --> 01:18:13,125
Nothing but my eyes. Only my eyes.

1299
01:18:13,208 --> 01:18:15,458
Not my forehead, not my eyebrows, glasses,

1300
01:18:15,541 --> 01:18:16,875
not my eyelashes, but my eyes.

1301
01:18:16,958 --> 01:18:18,083
One, two, three, you're under.

1302
01:18:18,166 --> 01:18:20,583
Forget about your problems in Vietnam,
it's all over now.

1303
01:18:20,666 --> 01:18:23,291
And forget about your company's debt,
it has been dealt with.

1304
01:18:23,375 --> 01:18:25,208
You're done.
One, two, three, you're back.

1305
01:18:26,916 --> 01:18:29,291
Debt?

1306
01:18:30,791 --> 01:18:32,666
How do you know about my company's debt?

1307
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:34,708
You don't know?

1308
01:18:34,791 --> 01:18:39,083
- I don't know about what?
- That I helped him paid the debts.

1309
01:18:39,958 --> 01:18:41,958
But he said he told you!

1310
01:18:42,041 --> 01:18:44,375
Oh my God, honey!

1311
01:18:44,458 --> 01:18:46,791
- You paid the debts?
- Yeah.

1312
01:18:46,875 --> 01:18:48,500
Honey, come on.

1313
01:18:48,583 --> 01:18:50,333
He's always late paying my salary.

1314
01:18:50,416 --> 01:18:53,625
And if I show up to the office
five minutes late, he cuts my salary.

1315
01:18:53,708 --> 01:18:56,541
If I use the company PC to access Facebook
during lunch he cuts my salary.

1316
01:18:56,625 --> 01:18:58,791
And now we cover the company's debts?

1317
01:18:59,291 --> 01:19:00,416
Well...

1318
01:19:01,625 --> 01:19:03,125
he's my best friend.

1319
01:19:03,208 --> 01:19:05,041
Your best friend?

1320
01:19:05,125 --> 01:19:07,375
It was your best friend's fault that
your wife was chased around

1321
01:19:07,458 --> 01:19:09,291
by everybody in Vietnam!
Not to mention being jailed!

1322
01:19:09,375 --> 01:19:11,833
Is that what you call "best friend"?

1323
01:19:12,541 --> 01:19:14,250
Honey...

1324
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:16,083
Don't "honey" me.
You're not sleeping with me tonight!

1325
01:19:16,166 --> 01:19:17,750
Go sleep with your best friend!

1326
01:19:17,833 --> 01:19:20,583
I can't do that. His wife won't be happy.

1327
01:19:23,833 --> 01:19:26,000
OK, I've decided.

1328
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:27,833
I want to resign.

1329
01:19:32,875 --> 01:19:34,500
Me, too.

1330
01:19:34,583 --> 01:19:36,833
I can't stand working for him anymore.

1331
01:19:38,875 --> 01:19:41,916
Me, too. This place is like a hell for me.

1332
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,708
- I want to quit, too.
- Me, too.

1333
01:19:44,791 --> 01:19:47,375
And I'll follow wherever you go, Sikin.

1334
01:19:50,625 --> 01:19:52,875
Hello?
Yes, we'll deliver your order today.

1335
01:19:52,958 --> 01:19:54,250
You're good?

1336
01:19:54,333 --> 01:19:57,125
What are you doing?

1337
01:19:57,208 --> 01:19:58,750
Practicing for a march?

1338
01:19:59,083 --> 01:20:00,708
- Get back to work.
- Yes, ma'am.

1339
01:20:03,708 --> 01:20:05,125
OK, here's what we'll do.

1340
01:20:05,208 --> 01:20:07,125
Let's finish today's work.

1341
01:20:07,208 --> 01:20:08,625
Then we go to his office

1342
01:20:08,708 --> 01:20:10,750
and tell him that we're quitting. Well?

1343
01:20:10,833 --> 01:20:13,250
Good. OK.

1344
01:20:13,333 --> 01:20:16,583
- Let's eat!
- Your food looks delicious.

1345
01:20:16,666 --> 01:20:19,958
- Do you want to try it?
- Delicious fish!

1346
01:20:20,041 --> 01:20:21,083
Wanna try my tempeh?

1347
01:20:21,166 --> 01:20:22,791
I cooked it this morning.

1348
01:20:22,875 --> 01:20:24,583
It's our pleasure.

1349
01:20:24,666 --> 01:20:26,791
This tempeh looks delicious!

1350
01:20:28,125 --> 01:20:31,208
I'm suspicious.
Just tell me what you're up to.

1351
01:20:33,291 --> 01:20:34,458
Suspicious about what?

1352
01:20:35,458 --> 01:20:37,250
We're not doing anything. Right, guys?

1353
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:39,083
Yeah!

1354
01:20:58,458 --> 01:21:00,625
Thank goodness.

1355
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Oh my goodness!

1356
01:21:03,083 --> 01:21:05,333
- Isn't it delicious?
- Your tempeh is very good!

1357
01:21:15,333 --> 01:21:17,708
I know what you're gonna say.

1358
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,041
About what, sir?

1359
01:21:28,791 --> 01:21:29,875
Raj died.

1360
01:21:31,291 --> 01:21:32,583
Raj died?

1361
01:21:32,666 --> 01:21:35,250
I told you.
Are you listening to me at all?

1362
01:21:35,333 --> 01:21:39,500
May he rest in peace.

1363
01:21:39,583 --> 01:21:44,291
Let's go to the hospital,
I'll ride with you. Come on.

1364
01:21:50,625 --> 01:21:52,750
Poor Raj.

1365
01:21:53,416 --> 01:21:55,875
I didn't know he had a heart condition.

1366
01:21:57,500 --> 01:22:00,041
When he had just come from India,

1367
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:02,750
he couldn't even speak Malay.

1368
01:22:04,583 --> 01:22:06,208
He lied like a rug,

1369
01:22:06,833 --> 01:22:09,000
but he was loyal to Bossman.

1370
01:22:16,583 --> 01:22:17,916
There's a problem.

1371
01:22:19,541 --> 01:22:26,291
Raj didn't put his beneficiary
in his bank account details.

1372
01:22:27,833 --> 01:22:28,833
You're right.

1373
01:22:28,916 --> 01:22:31,125
I went with him
when he opened the account.

1374
01:22:31,208 --> 01:22:32,833
He didn't put any name on it.

1375
01:22:32,916 --> 01:22:34,791
That's unfortunate.

1376
01:22:34,875 --> 01:22:37,208
He was illiterate.

1377
01:22:37,291 --> 01:22:39,750
He didn't know anything about finance.

1378
01:22:40,250 --> 01:22:42,875
Then how did he sign the documents,

1379
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:44,541
if he was illiterate?

1380
01:22:45,458 --> 01:22:47,916
He used thumbprint signature.

1381
01:22:49,833 --> 01:22:52,208
This is his will.

1382
01:22:52,291 --> 01:22:55,958
But if the police investigate,
you'll take the responsibility.

1383
01:22:56,625 --> 01:22:58,916
Boss, I got the ink.

1384
01:23:02,666 --> 01:23:05,833
Mr. Kho, Adrian, Kerani, follow me.

1385
01:23:05,916 --> 01:23:07,583
Let's go.

1386
01:23:16,416 --> 01:23:19,875
Kerani, go ahead. You go first.

1387
01:23:19,958 --> 01:23:21,125
No, I won't.

1388
01:23:21,208 --> 01:23:22,708
Come on!

1389
01:23:23,625 --> 01:23:24,583
Come on!

1390
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:35,125
- Kerani.
- Mm?

1391
01:23:35,208 --> 01:23:37,166
You go first.

1392
01:23:37,250 --> 01:23:38,625
No way!

1393
01:23:38,708 --> 01:23:41,375
I'm practically blind.
I can't see in dim light.

1394
01:23:41,458 --> 01:23:42,916
No, you're not.

1395
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,791
You can spot money from across the sea.

1396
01:23:45,875 --> 01:23:47,250
I can?

1397
01:24:03,541 --> 01:24:06,000
Too many bodies. My goodness.

1398
01:24:06,083 --> 01:24:08,416
Raj.

1399
01:24:09,166 --> 01:24:11,666
Which one is you?

1400
01:24:13,083 --> 01:24:14,625
Excuse me, dead people.

1401
01:24:14,708 --> 01:24:16,708
We've only come here for Raj.

1402
01:24:16,791 --> 01:24:19,208
- Hey, listen.
- What?

1403
01:24:19,291 --> 01:24:21,250
Which one do you think is Raj?

1404
01:24:21,333 --> 01:24:23,000
How would I know?

1405
01:24:23,416 --> 01:24:26,791
- Peek under the covers one by one.
- I won't do that!

1406
01:24:26,875 --> 01:24:29,208
- Go open the covers!
- No!

1407
01:24:30,041 --> 01:24:32,333
Mr. Kho, you do it then.

1408
01:24:32,750 --> 01:24:33,916
You're the eldest here.

1409
01:24:34,458 --> 01:24:36,916
Then you do it, Adrian.

1410
01:24:37,791 --> 01:24:40,666
Then who's gonna do it?
Are you expecting me to do it?

1411
01:24:41,333 --> 01:24:42,541
Bunch of cowards.

1412
01:24:43,875 --> 01:24:44,916
OK.

1413
01:24:45,958 --> 01:24:47,125
I'm gonna lift their covers...

1414
01:24:47,625 --> 01:24:48,708
but you do the looking.

1415
01:24:52,416 --> 01:24:53,875
Excuse me.

1416
01:24:55,541 --> 01:24:58,041
Get ready to look.

1417
01:24:59,041 --> 01:25:00,875
Here, take a look at it.

1418
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:03,500
It's still covered, sir!

1419
01:25:03,583 --> 01:25:04,708
Are you sure?

1420
01:25:05,666 --> 01:25:06,791
Is it him?

1421
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,625
No, no, no...

1422
01:25:12,708 --> 01:25:14,458
Forgive me, sir.

1423
01:25:18,708 --> 01:25:20,083
How about this one?

1424
01:25:24,541 --> 01:25:26,000
No, no, no.

1425
01:25:26,833 --> 01:25:28,166
Hey!

1426
01:25:28,250 --> 01:25:29,666
He...

1427
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:31,333
looks like me.

1428
01:25:33,750 --> 01:25:34,958
There's too many bodies in here.

1429
01:25:35,041 --> 01:25:37,291
If we have to check one by one,
we're gonna be dead soon, too.

1430
01:25:37,375 --> 01:25:39,000
Don't talk about death.

1431
01:25:45,291 --> 01:25:46,958
- No, no, no...
- Really?

1432
01:25:47,041 --> 01:25:48,041
Yes!

1433
01:25:48,125 --> 01:25:50,041
- Positive?
- Absolutely!

1434
01:25:50,416 --> 01:25:52,916
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure!

1435
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,791
- Close it!
- Forgive me.

1436
01:25:55,375 --> 01:25:58,625
Where are you, Raj?

1437
01:25:58,708 --> 01:26:02,375
Even after you're dead,
you're still giving us trouble.

1438
01:26:03,208 --> 01:26:05,000
How about this one?

1439
01:26:06,375 --> 01:26:08,250
Dear God!

1440
01:26:08,791 --> 01:26:10,708
Did he turn into old woman?

1441
01:26:10,791 --> 01:26:13,791
Show a little respect to the dead.
What if she woke up?

1442
01:26:13,875 --> 01:26:16,375
Let's move on.

1443
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,125
Let's try this one.

1444
01:26:26,416 --> 01:26:27,916
Excuse me.

1445
01:26:30,333 --> 01:26:31,291
Is this him?

1446
01:26:31,750 --> 01:26:35,041
Raj!

1447
01:26:35,125 --> 01:26:36,875
Poor, Raj.

1448
01:26:36,958 --> 01:26:39,125
Farewell, Raj.

1449
01:26:39,208 --> 01:26:40,875
Choose your words wisely.

1450
01:26:40,958 --> 01:26:42,791
What if he woke up and walked away?

1451
01:26:44,166 --> 01:26:47,541
Where's the ink for the fingerprint?
Take his fingerprint, quick.

1452
01:26:48,833 --> 01:26:51,750
Why are you stepping back? Hurry up!

1453
01:26:51,833 --> 01:26:53,666
You do it, I'm your boss!

1454
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:56,416
Just do it quickly. Hurry!

1455
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:58,125
Bunch of cowards.

1456
01:26:59,333 --> 01:27:02,166
Raj, it's Bossman.

1457
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:04,666
I'm with Adrian.

1458
01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:09,125
Kerani and Mr. Kho.

1459
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:11,916
If you don't mind,

1460
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:17,916
we need your fingerprint
to cash out your money from the bank.

1461
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,541
I feel sorry for your wife and children

1462
01:27:20,625 --> 01:27:23,083
if you left them with nothing.
You worked so hard...

1463
01:27:24,333 --> 01:27:25,833
- You startled me!
- Hurry up!

1464
01:27:25,916 --> 01:27:28,666
Give me a minute!

1465
01:27:28,750 --> 01:27:33,000
Sorry, Raj. You know how Kerani is.

1466
01:27:33,083 --> 01:27:37,041
Please forgive me, Raj.
Please don't haunt me.

1467
01:27:37,125 --> 01:27:38,791
Give me the ink.

1468
01:27:43,375 --> 01:27:45,291
Is the thumb already in the ink bottle?

1469
01:27:45,375 --> 01:27:47,000
Yes, sir.

1470
01:27:48,458 --> 01:27:51,041
Give me the paper! Don't just stare at me!

1471
01:27:52,166 --> 01:27:53,291
Seriously.

1472
01:27:54,708 --> 01:27:57,333
Forgive me, Raj. Relax your thumb a bit.

1473
01:27:57,875 --> 01:28:02,250
- I've got it.
- You have? Good!

1474
01:28:02,333 --> 01:28:03,833
Let's go.

1475
01:28:03,916 --> 01:28:05,791
Let go of the paper, Raj.

1476
01:28:05,875 --> 01:28:07,250
Wait for me!

1477
01:28:13,625 --> 01:28:15,416
Cowards!

1478
01:28:18,125 --> 01:28:20,750
Hey, wait up!

1479
01:28:23,416 --> 01:28:24,750
Ouch.

1480
01:28:24,833 --> 01:28:25,916
Will you stop that?

1481
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,208
Why did you leave me behind?

1482
01:28:28,291 --> 01:28:29,750
My heart is about to explode.

1483
01:28:31,291 --> 01:28:33,833
- Well?
- It's settled.

1484
01:28:33,916 --> 01:28:36,208
Thank God!

1485
01:28:36,291 --> 01:28:38,416
It was like something from a horror story.

1486
01:28:39,833 --> 01:28:41,083
Oh my God!

1487
01:28:42,333 --> 01:28:43,416
What is it?

1488
01:28:43,833 --> 01:28:45,083
What's wrong, boss?

1489
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:47,583
- What?
- It's just...

1490
01:28:47,666 --> 01:28:48,916
It's just what?

1491
01:28:50,375 --> 01:28:52,500
<i>It's just, I left my bag in the morgue.</i>

1492
01:29:19,041 --> 01:29:20,291
So...

1493
01:29:21,083 --> 01:29:22,708
How about our plan to quit?

1494
01:29:23,583 --> 01:29:24,833
I don't know.

1495
01:29:24,916 --> 01:29:28,041
I feel bad doing this.
It's not that I like him.

1496
01:29:28,125 --> 01:29:31,125
But I was surprised
to see what he did to Raj.

1497
01:29:31,416 --> 01:29:33,583
And he was just a factory worker.

1498
01:29:33,666 --> 01:29:38,041
Mm, I was surprised to see
his sympathy for Raj's family.

1499
01:29:38,125 --> 01:29:38,958
I know.

1500
01:29:39,041 --> 01:29:41,541
Even I wouldn't think that far.

1501
01:29:41,833 --> 01:29:43,750
God has willed.

1502
01:29:43,833 --> 01:29:45,666
I have to admit it,
he was so sympathetic.

1503
01:29:47,875 --> 01:29:49,583
So, what do we do now?

1504
01:29:54,791 --> 01:29:57,541
We give him one more chance?

1505
01:30:09,083 --> 01:30:10,375
OK.

1506
01:30:12,041 --> 01:30:14,916
So, we give him one more chance?

1507
01:30:15,416 --> 01:30:16,833
One more.

1508
01:30:17,958 --> 01:30:19,000
OK.

1509
01:30:19,083 --> 01:30:22,833
Yes, sir. I'll be right there.

1510
01:30:23,250 --> 01:30:26,625
I'll see you there.

1511
01:30:28,541 --> 01:30:31,583
Yes, sir. OK!

1512
01:30:39,958 --> 01:30:44,208
I'm so happy
to see you all working so hard.

1513
01:30:44,291 --> 01:30:47,500
By the way,
I have a last-minute meeting...

1514
01:30:47,583 --> 01:30:49,000
with the prime minister.

1515
01:30:50,750 --> 01:30:53,625
The new one. So, I'm gonna have to
leave the office early.

1516
01:30:53,916 --> 01:30:55,791
And I bought pizza for you.

1517
01:30:55,875 --> 01:30:57,291
It's free.

1518
01:30:57,375 --> 01:31:00,250
It's not gonna be charged on your salary.
Enjoy it.

1519
01:31:00,333 --> 01:31:02,958
Every one of you can have them.

1520
01:31:04,458 --> 01:31:07,666
I'll see you guys later.

1521
01:31:12,750 --> 01:31:14,041
Thank God.

1522
01:31:14,125 --> 01:31:16,416
Pizza!

1523
01:31:22,708 --> 01:31:24,625
This is delicious.

1524
01:31:24,708 --> 01:31:27,083
Thank God he won't charge it
against our salary.

1525
01:31:27,166 --> 01:31:30,166
- I know.
- This is a blessing.

1526
01:31:30,250 --> 01:31:32,875
If he did this every day,
nobody would want to quit.

1527
01:31:32,958 --> 01:31:35,541
Maybe he is enlightened.

1528
01:31:36,791 --> 01:31:38,416
Let's eat.

1529
01:31:39,583 --> 01:31:41,166
It looks good.

1530
01:31:41,250 --> 01:31:42,541
Hey!

1531
01:31:43,375 --> 01:31:45,166
Where's your Bossman?

1532
01:31:46,166 --> 01:31:47,708
I'm here to collect my money!

1533
01:31:49,208 --> 01:31:55,125
- That slimeball!
- We're dead!

1534
01:32:30,583 --> 01:32:31,958
Fell out.

1535
01:32:32,208 --> 01:32:33,208
Yes.

1536
01:32:50,250 --> 01:32:51,458
What you mean?

1537
01:32:51,541 --> 01:32:56,291
Your work time is from eight to five,
and you're being paid for it.

1538
01:32:57,166 --> 01:32:58,416
- No...
- Take six.

1539
01:32:59,458 --> 01:33:03,708
Last week, you said
your father passed away?

1540
01:33:09,041 --> 01:33:13,833
Or all of you can work overtime...

1541
01:33:15,083 --> 01:33:16,625
You're wrong, honey...

1542
01:33:17,791 --> 01:33:19,458
You're wrong, honey...

1543
01:33:22,083 --> 01:33:23,541
Oh, I'm dead serious.

1544
01:33:23,666 --> 01:33:27,000
I wouldn't date a fat balding man
with weird mustache like him.

1545
01:33:27,125 --> 01:33:31,041
Even if I...

1546
01:33:31,833 --> 01:33:36,708
Hey, who...

1547
01:33:55,041 --> 01:33:56,750
Sorry.

1548
01:34:00,750 --> 01:34:02,041
You're right.

1549
01:34:03,041 --> 01:34:05,041
You're right.

1550
01:34:12,583 --> 01:34:14,833
What's wrong? Not cut yet.

1551
01:34:15,125 --> 01:34:17,875
Forget about your problems in Vietnam,
it's all over now.

1552
01:34:17,958 --> 01:34:19,833
And forget about your company's debt...

1553
01:34:23,125 --> 01:34:24,708
I know... but...

1554
01:34:37,166 --> 01:34:41,000
Mr. Kho, call...
