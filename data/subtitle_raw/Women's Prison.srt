1
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,814
State's prison.
All prisons look alike from the outside,

2
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:21,720
but inside, each has a different character.

3
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:27,783
In this one,
caged men are separated only by a thick wall

4
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,189
from caged women.

5
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:35,359
The system is wrong,
but it goes on and on and on.

6
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:38,733
Men and women behind the same wall,

7
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:42,968
with only concrete and rifle bullets
trying to keep them apart.

8
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:44,336
All right, Helene, this is it.

9
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,170
Commonly known as the sneezer, the can,
the clink, the jug and stir.

10
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,470
Come on, girls, let's go.

11
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:52,636
You won't like it at first,

12
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:55,509
but when you get used to it,
you'll really hate it.

13
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:11,326
Hope there's nobody home.

14
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,592
- Hiya, Miss Green.
- Hello, Frank.

15
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:24,406
- Hi!
- Well, Brenda!

16
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:28,605
I didn't know you with the new hair you got.
How about that?

17
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,812
She's paroled a brunette,
and she comes back a blonde.

18
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:34,182
- You like it?
- Yeah. You look sharp.

19
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:36,016
You must have been doing good
on the outside.

20
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:37,646
I did too good.

21
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:40,325
That's why I'm back here. I need a rest.

22
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:42,917
- Well, happy holiday.
- Thanks.

23
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:48,996
- Well, well, well, Brenda.
- Hi, Sturgess. You've put on a little weight.

24
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,696
I'll lose some of it
now that you're back on our hands.

25
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:53,999
I'll do all I can to help you, Sturgess.

26
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:56,405
- Is this the Jensen girl?
- That's right.

27
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,069
Come on in. You're more than welcome.

28
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,684
Helene.

29
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:18,122
- How do you do?
- I'm Deputy Sheriff Green.

30
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:20,698
And I'm Miss Whittier, Reception Officer.

31
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,132
This is Helene Jensen and Brenda Martin.

32
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,999
If you'll sign for them, I'll be on my way.

33
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:27,334
I'd like to catch the afternoon train
back to town.

34
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,409
- I've got an important date tonight.
- Indeed.

35
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,979
- Goodbye, Helene.
- Goodbye, Miss Green.

36
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,275
- Thanks for everything.
- That's all right.

37
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,815
Try to adjust yourself.

38
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:41,785
A lot of women have gone through this
and survived, and you will, too.

39
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:45,254
- Listen to Brenda. She knows the ropes.
- Every twist.

40
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,916
Thank you very much, Miss Whittier.

41
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:52,720
- So long, Brenda. Good luck.
- Same to you on that date tonight.

42
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:56,800
- Be a good little cop.
- I'll try. Goodbye.

43
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,667
Bye. She's a good sport.

44
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:02,673
- I beg your pardon?
- I was talking about sports.

45
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,575
Something you wouldn't know
anything about.

46
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,438
Jensen, Helene, housewife.

47
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:12,040
Manslaughter, 1 to 10.

48
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:14,448
You killed a child.

49
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,211
It was an accident.

50
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:20,315
Driving your car at 50 miles an hour,
trying to pass a car on the right.

51
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,916
- A child killed.
- Hey, lookit,

52
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:25,053
she's in here to serve her time,
so don't rub it in.

53
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:29,696
Martin, Brenda, forgery, 1 to 14.

54
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:31,497
Commonly known as paper-hanging.

55
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,970
I've been in here before,
and I may be here again.

56
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:36,200
Empty your bags on my desk, please.

57
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:40,576
All articles of value are held here
until the time of your release.

58
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,210
I'll take that ring.

59
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:49,321
And here are the rules of the institution.

60
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:52,186
I daresay you've broken every one
in the book.

61
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:57,593
Jensen, your number will be 10914,
and yours, 10915.

62
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:00,029
- Thanks a lot.
- That will be all.

63
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,893
Report to the infirmary for your physicals.
I'm sure you know the way.

64
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:06,733
Like my own girdle.

65
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,805
Come on, kid.

66
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,771
- One moment, Martin.
- What?

67
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,938
I'll trouble you for those earrings.

68
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:20,117
Yeah, wear them with green, honey.
They did wonders for me.

69
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:39,894
I know them legs!

70
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,406
- Brenda!
- Hi, Pol.

71
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:46,945
- Bless my soul, where you been?
- Outside, Pol, on parole. You know that.

72
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:49,879
- But I didn't make it.
- What happened this time?

73
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:54,385
Well, I saw a $150 dress reduced to 32.50.

74
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:58,357
You know me,
I couldn't resist such a bargain.

75
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:02,225
Never you mind.
Anyhow, I'm sure glad you come home.

76
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:04,829
Thanks, hon. Helene, this is Polly.

77
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:09,334
Polyclinic Jones, my mother named me
after the hospital where I was born.

78
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:13,866
What you doing here, honey?
You don't belong in no place like this.

79
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:17,071
What happened,
did you get mixed up with some man?

80
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,474
It's a long story, hon...

81
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,681
- Hold that paint detail!
- Hold it, men.

82
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:26,443
- Men in here?
- Sure. This is a coeducational joint.

83
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:31,886
But the boys never get in here
except on work detail. When they do, wow!

84
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:36,155
- Let's check those passes.
- Wait right here.

85
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:43,092
- All right, girls, break it up.
- Come on, you. Break it up.

86
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,727
Come on, clear the corridor. Come on.

87
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,708
Where did you think you were going?

88
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:52,174
Captain, this is the paint detail.

89
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,678
We were on our way over here to decorate
one of the front offices

90
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,646
in the women's division.

91
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,780
I'm one of the best painters
you got in this joint.

92
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,376
Wait a minute. That's not your card!

93
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:04,221
How dumb can you guys get?

94
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:06,655
- But, Captain, it looks okay.
- Take another look.

95
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,919
You'll find it's been doctored.

96
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:10,086
The name and the number
have been changed.

97
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,528
That card was made out to Murphy.

98
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:15,699
And Murphy's in the cell block, sick.

99
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:17,226
That's right, Captain,

100
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:19,702
but the poor guy was afraid you might think
he was dogging it,

101
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,468
so I substituted. Keep his record clean.

102
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:25,806
Don't think you can con me,
you jailhouse lawyer!

103
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,004
Take it easy, Captain!

104
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,978
Take a punch at me, will you?

105
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:31,577
Come on.

106
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,088
All right, get these men back to their cells.

107
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,885
Make a note of their numbers for discipline.
They knew what was going on.

108
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:42,483
- All right, you guys...
- And you, Burton, you come with me.

109
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,927
You've got a date with the warden!

110
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,634
What now, Tierney?

111
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,008
Burton here altered this work card.

112
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,045
Got himself onto the paint detail
assigned to the women's division.

113
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,583
I spotted him just in time.
That's not his real number.

114
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,179
What is it?

115
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:09,015
- 79639.
- Eddie!

116
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:10,486
Yes, sir.

117
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:14,957
Did you think you could hit the wall
easier from the women's side?

118
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:18,861
I wasn't trying to escape, Warden,
not by that route. I know better.

119
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:21,297
When I stopped him,
he tried to take a punch at me.

120
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,664
What have you got to say to that?

121
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:24,963
Nothing.

122
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,810
Armed robbery, finance companies' offices,

123
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:34,708
one count of kidnap robbery,
ten years to life.

124
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:37,783
Your wife, Joan Burton,
is doing time over on the women's side.

125
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,476
That's why you were trying to get over there!

126
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:41,644
What kind of a deal did you have cooked up
with her?

127
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:45,087
Warden, don't put the heat on Joan.
This was my idea.

128
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,681
She knew nothing about it.

129
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,953
I wanted to talk to her, that's all. I've got to!

130
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:50,050
What about?

131
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,995
I've been asking you for months
to let me see her for just a few minutes.

132
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:56,431
You know as well as I do that crime partners
are not permitted to visit each other.

133
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,629
She wasn't my crime partner.

134
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:02,372
She was convicted because
they found my guns in her possession.

135
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,534
Why do you want to see her?

136
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,334
She's my wife.

137
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:09,041
She'll be out of here within a year,

138
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:12,117
and with 10 to life, I might not make it in 20.

139
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,880
Why, you said yourself
she could never visit me.

140
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:18,784
I might die in here.
I might never see her again.

141
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:20,657
I've got to tell her something.

142
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,661
- Send your lawyer to see her.
- She won't listen to anybody but me.

143
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:25,788
- I want to tell her this...
- Shut up.

144
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,957
What you need is a hitch on the rock pile.

145
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:32,197
Warden, don't forget,
this guy tried to sock me.

146
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,865
That's right. Twenty days in the hole.

147
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,573
- Get him out of here.
- Let's go.

148
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:45,311
Trying to smuggle himself over
on a paint detail.

149
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,353
Leave it to a con to think of a deal like that.

150
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:52,916
When are they going to do something
about a separate prison for women?

151
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,357
I've been beefing about that for years,

152
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:58,396
but the state legislature won't come through
with the dough.

153
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:02,892
Warden speaking.

154
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,034
It's for you, Doc.

155
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,703
This is the doctor.

156
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:11,932
Yes.

157
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,275
I see.

158
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:17,572
When did it happen?

159
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:19,982
I'll be right over.

160
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,109
That was Sturgess.

161
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:23,586
One of the girls they brought in
this afternoon

162
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:25,247
seems to be in a state of shock.

163
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,849
One of those dames
are always in a state of shock.

164
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,427
But Amelia knows how to handle them.

165
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,257
She knows my methods.

166
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,425
Excuse me, Warden.

167
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,831
I have a patient waiting.

168
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,968
Doctor, Jensen, Helene, 10914.

169
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:46,476
She's had her bath and her physical,
and the report's in here,

170
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:48,443
also, her admission papers.

171
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:51,277
Whittier in the admitting room
thought you'd better see them.

172
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,318
You can leave this
on Miss van Zandt's desk.

173
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:54,408
Thank you.

174
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,080
And for heaven sakes, Doctor,
give her something.

175
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:00,955
We have no time to fool with hysteria cases.

176
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:08,131
- I'm the doctor, Miss Jensen.
- Doctor...

177
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:13,063
Apparently, this is your first experience
in a place of this kind.

178
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,196
Yes.

179
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,437
I know how you feel.

180
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,111
Well, you have a clean bill of health.

181
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,682
And as for the trouble
that brought you here...

182
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:27,617
I killed a child.

183
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:30,847
It was an accident.

184
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:33,424
Yes, I see. That's too bad.

185
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:37,625
A little girl, so little.

186
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,754
You're married?

187
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,261
Children?

188
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,368
I'm sure your husband's standing by you.

189
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,564
Yes, yes, he always will.

190
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:50,801
But 1 to 10 years?

191
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:54,646
I know. Sounds frightening,

192
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,372
but you won't serve many of those years.

193
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:02,479
You'll see your husband often,
you'll be paroled,

194
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,490
and he'll be waiting for you.

195
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:11,794
A prison isn't a pleasant place to live.

196
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,928
I'm not crazy about it myself,

197
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,803
but at least you don't have to worry
about the rent.

198
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:23,933
Ask Mrs. Sturgess to come in, please.

199
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,505
They'll feed you and find work for you.
You'll get along.

200
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:33,014
Here, take this. It's a sedative, that's all.

201
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,280
Thank you.

202
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:44,385
You'll find friends here.
Your instinct will tell you the right ones.

203
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,891
Well? Is she all right now?

204
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,197
I think so. Just a case of nerves, that's all.

205
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:54,537
- You've had them yourself.
- Yes, Doctor.

206
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:58,142
Come along, Miss Jensen.
We'll give you your supper

207
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,838
and tuck you in for the night.

208
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:02,541
Come on.

209
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:12,849
- Doctor.
- Hello, Amelia.

210
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:16,253
Was that the Jensen girl you had in here,
the one who was taken sick?

211
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:19,559
Yes, I just dismissed her.
She's in a state of shock.

212
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:20,926
Oh, that.

213
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,431
Though criminally negligent,
she is not a criminal.

214
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:30,066
- She has a very good background.
- Frankly, I'm not impressed by backgrounds.

215
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:31,768
This is a prison.

216
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,840
I'm well aware of that.

217
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:38,143
However, in this case, I suggest you forgo
the usual period of isolation.

218
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,185
Really? How can I do that?
She has to be quarantined.

219
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:42,982
Those are the rules.

220
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:47,354
If you put this girl in a cell alone,
I won't be responsible.

221
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:50,287
Well, the responsibility is all mine, Doctor.

222
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:12,050
This is quarantine. You'll be here two weeks.

223
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:15,848
Out for meals, right back in.
One cigarette after each meal.

224
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,148
Police your cell. Keep it spotless.

225
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:22,557
Watch the ashtray, keep it clean.
Make trouble, you get trouble.

226
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:24,225
Good night.

227
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:56,650
Oh, dear God! Dear God!

228
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,370
Helene!

229
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,441
Helene! Take it easy!

230
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,850
Quiet down!

231
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:41,469
Leave her alone!

232
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,070
All right, open up.

233
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:52,680
No! No! Don't! Leave me alone! Don't!

234
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:55,479
Put me... No...

235
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:59,056
Please! Don't!

236
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:04,095
Leave her alone!
Why don't you leave the poor kid alone?

237
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:06,687
Leave her...

238
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:10,830
Martin, be quiet,
unless you want the straitjacket, too.

239
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,417
Bring her out.

240
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,601
What's she doing now?

241
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,673
Still crying.
That jacket's so tight she can't scream.

242
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:52,801
Naturally. Good night.

243
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:22,468
Don't go, Harry. Please don't go.

244
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:55,402
Don't go, Harry. Please don't go.

245
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,906
Grace.

246
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,874
Don't leave me, Harry.

247
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:02,241
Gracie! Grace.

248
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:05,206
- Yeah?
- Was Harry here again?

249
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:06,579
Yeah.

250
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:08,050
Well, the next time he shows up,
just tell him

251
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:09,882
to bring a friend along, will you?

252
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:11,478
Okay, Mae.

253
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:15,491
Polly! All right, Polly, hit the deck.

254
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,084
I'm hitting it.

255
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,724
Them springs.

256
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:24,368
They're working their way
right through my mattress.

257
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,866
Got me all marked up like a waffle.

258
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:34,302
How long have you been up?

259
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:38,312
I've been working on myself
since 3:00 this morning, by moonlight.

260
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,484
Do you know what day this is?

261
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:43,020
- That's right, you're getting out.
- Out.

262
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:46,453
Oh, baby, that guy of mine
will be waiting right at the gate.

263
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:49,354
That wonderful, wonderful guy!

264
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,159
Look, Carol,

265
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:58,024
there's something your fellow
can do for me and my fellow.

266
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,196
You know what happened yesterday
when Glen tried to get over here,

267
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,398
I haven't heard the end of it, yet.

268
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:05,807
Your boyfriend's never done time.
He can visit Glen.

269
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:09,775
Have him tell Glen
not to try a crazy trick like that again.

270
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:12,282
Step on it, you two. Police that cell!

271
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:17,914
Hey, Sturgess,
have you seen Jensen this morning?

272
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:21,290
No, but I don't think she's gone anyplace.

273
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:23,891
How do you expect to turn us into ladies
when you make us wear

274
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,226
cotton romance killers like these?

275
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:30,893
Fine clothes do not the lady make,
nor iron bars a cage.

276
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,737
Yeah.

277
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:37,672
Well, I suppose the crummier we look,
the more it helps van Zandt feel

278
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:40,040
like the Queen of Sheba in her clothes.

279
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:54,322
Okay, Jensen, time to get up.

280
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,219
Come on, what's the matter with you?

281
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,762
Snap out of it.

282
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,533
Jenny! Jenny!

283
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:14,243
Something wrong here.
This girl is out, maybe worse.

284
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,814
I can't even feel a pulse.

285
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:19,181
Get the cart, quick!

286
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,015
What was done to her?

287
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:00,816
The usual thing, I suppose.
I wasn't on duty last night.

288
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:03,894
The jacket?

289
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:08,393
- Well, yes, she... She had to be restrained.
- Even if it killed her?

290
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:12,135
Does Miss van Zandt know about this?

291
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:13,864
- Not yet.
- Tell her!

292
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:14,973
Yes, sir.

293
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:17,837
You, call the head nurse.
Have her bring blankets.

294
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,500
Yes, Doctor.

295
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:25,276
Miss van Zandt. Excuse me.

296
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:26,908
- Yes?
- We've got trouble.

297
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,850
- Well?
- That Jensen girl.

298
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,286
- What, again?
- Well, I found her unconscious in the jacket.

299
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,187
I couldn't revive her,
so I rushed her to the doctor's.

300
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,954
- You should have called me first.
- But she was like dead, Miss van Zandt.

301
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:38,256
I don't care. You should have called me.

302
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:46,927
- You can go, Sturgess.
- Yes, ma'am.

303
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:54,407
How is she, Doctor?

304
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,605
You and your system nearly finished her.

305
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:00,617
A girl in her mental condition
could easily be shocked to death.

306
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,653
- Nonsense.
- You think so?

307
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:07,324
Have them strap you in a straitjacket
and throw you in a black hole overnight.

308
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:10,623
When they hauled you out in the morning,
you'd need a lot more than medicine.

309
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:13,220
Aren't you over-dramatizing this situation?

310
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:16,462
I'll tell you something else.

311
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:19,867
If she does recover, I'm not so sure
that she'll be in her right mind.

312
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:23,737
She was probably a borderline psychopath
when they brought her in here.

313
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:26,636
I told you she was in shock.

314
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:30,374
She's suffering from a guilt complex
that's close to madness.

315
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:36,052
If she recovers from this,
she's not going back into isolation.

316
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,020
It's about time you got here.

317
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:45,722
This girl is in a coma. I want her kept warm.

318
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:49,699
She must have the constant attention
of a nurse. Not an inmate. One of the staff.

319
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:51,029
Yes, sir.

320
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:55,298
- I'll be in presently.
- Shall I put her back in isolation?

321
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:59,609
Of course not, nurse.
Take her to the infirmary.

322
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:04,380
You see, Doctor, you're not the only one
who knows the quality of mercy.

323
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:32,538
Hello. Well, we're going to get you up
out of that bed today and on your feet.

324
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:35,711
Within a few more days,
you'll be able to join the other girls.

325
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,441
When can I see my husband?

326
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:42,077
An inmate is permitted visitors
30 days from the date of her admission.

327
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:44,752
I don't understand why he hasn't written me.

328
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:46,824
But he has, every day.

329
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:50,891
Then why don't they give me his letters?

330
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:55,626
An inmate is not permitted to receive mail
during the time of her quarantine.

331
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:59,963
But I'll tell you something.
I stole three letters from the mailroom.

332
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:02,039
You'll find them under your pillow.

333
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:06,740
It's all right.
Now, you read those letters quickly.

334
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:10,377
On my next time around,
I'll sneak these back and get you three more.

335
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:12,143
Thank you, Doctor.

336
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,980
So how much do I owe you?

337
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:54,490
$3,250,000.

338
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:59,721
No, hon, not like that.
Not like you do at home.

339
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:02,498
Like they do in the army barracks.

340
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:04,967
Or have you ever been in an army barracks?

341
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,163
No. My husband was in the army.

342
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:09,706
I remember he told me
the top blanket should be stretched so tight

343
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:11,275
you could bounce a nickel on it.

344
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:13,037
Where are you going this summer?

345
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:16,978
Universal Airlines,
with their 300-mile-an-hour luxury corsairs,

346
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:20,483
offers you a wide choice of vacation resorts.

347
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:23,349
Make love to her on the beach at Waikiki,

348
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:26,491
woo her under the moon
in the Canadian Rockies,

349
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:29,389
give her a second honeymoon
on the Riviera...

350
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:32,929
- Is he kidding?
- Shut your big mouth.

351
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,325
- Gin.
- What?

352
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:36,991
What have you got?

353
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:43,434
10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60.

354
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:47,642
$3,250,060.

355
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:49,771
They only give you five minutes
after the morning bell

356
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,473
to get everything shipshape.

357
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:53,574
Thanks for the lesson, Brenda.

358
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:55,319
Brenda!

359
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,444
- Mae!
- Hi.

360
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:57,522
Hi!

361
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,690
Gee, it's great to have you back
on the campus again, Bren.

362
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:01,952
Thanks. I'm here for a post-graduate course.

363
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,085
Well, you'll hook up
with the old sorority again, won't you?

364
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:07,790
I sure will. It's the Alpha Baka Pie.

365
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,866
Brenda used to learn me
how to talk good English.

366
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:13,403
I'm doing much better since
you seen me last, ain't I?

367
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:15,473
Yeah, you sure ain't.

368
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,100
The joint's full of new faces, Bren.

369
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:19,938
I think the gals have taken over
all the rackets

370
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:22,343
the way they're packing them in here.

371
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:24,381
Grace. Grace, come here.

372
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:27,043
Grace is a freshman.

373
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:28,346
- Hi.
- Hi.

374
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:31,081
And she finished her prep course
at Brookside Reformatory.

375
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:32,213
This is Helene Jensen.

376
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:33,416
- Hello.
- Hello.

377
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:36,790
You're the fish that had a tough time
their first night in the aquarium.

378
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:38,863
The first time's the worst, kid.

379
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,495
I still dream about what it did to me.

380
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:45,993
That ain't all you dream about.
Grace is worried about a guy.

381
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:49,472
I'm just afraid he might ditch me, that's all.

382
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:52,509
Honey, every guy thinks
he's something special,

383
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:56,103
but they're all at the same assembly line.
There's always a replacement around,

384
00:26:56,214 --> 00:26:59,081
in case the one you've got gets lost
or broken.

385
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:01,084
Brenda!

386
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:02,844
Dottie!

387
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:10,384
They told me you were here.
I said, "What does she want?

388
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:12,557
"What's she after?"

389
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:17,100
I know. I know, George.

390
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:21,596
- Bette Davis.
- I know, and it's wonderful.

391
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:25,708
- Hey, this kid's got brains.
- Dottie's from show business.

392
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:29,644
Yeah, a stripteaser,
but I always wanted to do impersonations.

393
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:33,475
I wanted to take off people, not my clothes,

394
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:36,779
and that's why I'm doing a stretch
from 10 to life.

395
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:39,914
10 to life? For just taking off your clothes?

396
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:43,488
No, I shot my agent.

397
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:47,561
Tell me, Bren, how's everything outside?

398
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:49,696
Everything is shaping up for the worst.

399
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:53,737
- Not the men?
- No. They're still the same old gyps.

400
00:27:57,008 --> 00:28:00,375
Bless their hearts. Do you know, darlings,

401
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:05,573
at this moment,
I'd give my right arm for one week, one day,

402
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:08,119
one hour, outside.

403
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:10,812
I'd settle for 10 minutes.

404
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:14,083
- Who's that?
- Durante.

405
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:16,351
You're nuts.

406
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:17,928
What's the matter,
am I slipping or something?

407
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,998
- No, honey, we know who it is.
- Say, you know something?

408
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:25,559
I've been assigned to this cell.
Yeah, you and me and this new fish,

409
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,001
- and...
- Joan Burton.

410
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:29,835
- Hello, Brenda.
- Hi, old-timer. How are things breaking?

411
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:33,104
Just terrible.
Van Zandt's had me up front again.

412
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:37,043
She thinks it's my fault
that Glen was over here on that paint detail.

413
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:39,514
That dame wears her brains in her bustle.

414
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:43,519
Of course I want to see Glen.
I'm dying to see him, but I'm not that silly.

415
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:45,486
Helene's in the same fix you are.

416
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:47,987
She's sweating it out to see her guy, too.

417
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:50,354
At least you have a chance.

418
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,328
Come on, honey,
that's the bell for daily count.

419
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,408
- DeHaven, Joyer, McDowell, White.
- Okay.

420
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:13,546
Carson, Jolley, Lipman, Cooper.

421
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:15,514
- Where's Cooper?
- Cooper!

422
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,814
Here I am.

423
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,388
You're supposed to stay in the lineup.

424
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:21,459
- But I was just...
- Shut up, you know the rules.

425
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:28,029
- Burton, Martin, Jensen, LaRose.
- Okay.

426
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:34,095
- Watkins, Jones, Brown, O'Shaughnessy.
- Okay.

427
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:40,138
- Walker, Tracey, Swartz, Hammer.
- Okay.

428
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:48,644
Right.

429
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:51,312
Full count on the men's side.

430
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,151
The dames are late as usual.

431
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:56,060
There they are.

432
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:59,554
Hi, Sturgess, what's the matter?
A couple of babes missing?

433
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:02,623
Okay. They got them all.

434
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:15,207
This is what we call the main line
where we get the evening dish of beans.

435
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,678
I'm not hungry.

436
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:18,510
Don't worry, honey,
you'll see your husband soon.

437
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:20,516
Fifteen days seems a lifetime.

438
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:22,586
Quiet, you! No talking.

439
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:53,840
Hiya, hon.

440
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:57,513
- Gee, I'm glad to see youse, baby.
- I'm glad to see you.

441
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:00,553
- Thanks!
- No, I mean, you should say "you."

442
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:02,793
- Not "youse."
- Yeah?

443
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:05,896
Yeah. I'm learning
how to speak good English.

444
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:10,592
Do you know there's dames in this joint
with IQ's that stick out like sore thumbs?

445
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:12,497
- No kidding.
- Yeah.

446
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:16,301
But I'm gonna talk like a lady
when I matrigulate from this joint.

447
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:17,738
Matrigulate?

448
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:22,074
When I graduate, stupid.
And youse is gonna talk like a gent.

449
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,011
I can learn.

450
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,589
Helene?

451
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:40,029
Don.

452
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,800
- Don.
- Honey.

453
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,166
You've got to get me out of here.
You've just got to!

454
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:48,569
Take your hands off that screen!

455
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:56,874
It's horrible, the confinement,
the work, the food!

456
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:59,211
Honey, please, please try to take it easy.

457
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:02,184
Look, I've mortgaged the house,
sold the car and gotten a new lawyer.

458
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:04,755
Michaels, he's a good man,
one of the best in the state.

459
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,824
He's petitioning the Governor for a pardon,

460
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:10,417
- but it may take a little time.
- That's what I'm afraid of, time.

461
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:14,626
A day in this place seems like a year.
You don't know what it does to me.

462
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:17,226
If it goes on much longer, it may be too late.

463
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:21,601
- Honey, please don't talk like that.
- You must get me out. Don, you must!

464
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:23,537
Time's up!

465
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:26,542
What do you mean, time's up? I haven't
talked to my wife for more than a minute.

466
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:30,580
Her visit was over the second time
she put her hands on that screen.

467
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:33,081
She knows the rules, or she ought to.

468
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:35,319
Get back to your cell.

469
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:38,847
- No, Don. Please, Don.
- Get her out of here!

470
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:41,958
No, Don!

471
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:43,694
Don!

472
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:46,053
No, no, no, Don...

473
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:47,722
Take your hands off her.
You don't have to do that.

474
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:50,096
Don! Please, Don!

475
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,667
Let me go!

476
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:56,469
I want to see someone in authority here.

477
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:59,270
You'll see the desk sergeant
if you don't get out of here!

478
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:00,742
Take your hands off me.

479
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:03,746
Take him to Miss van Zandt.
She'll settle him.

480
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:05,713
Come on, mister.

481
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,544
What have you done to my wife?

482
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,180
Mr. Jensen, your wife
has received the same treatment

483
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:14,918
as every other woman committed here.

484
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:17,927
I can't believe that.
She's half out of her mind.

485
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:23,556
I hate to tell you this, but I'm afraid
your wife is a borderline psychopath.

486
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:25,895
She wasn't when she came here!

487
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,131
No, of course, not to you perhaps.

488
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:31,606
But you see, confinement often reveals
these mental deficiencies.

489
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:34,039
Your matrons treated her like
a homicidal maniac.

490
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:35,476
If you think I'll stand for that you're...

491
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,241
Now, look, I'll tell you what.

492
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:39,211
Why don't you see Warden Brock?

493
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:41,251
I'll see the Department of Corrections.

494
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:44,287
I'm afraid they'll tell you that
during the term of your wife's imprisonment,

495
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:46,482
she's under our control, not yours.

496
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,120
You know, I'm worried,

497
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:49,955
because demonstrations
such as this afternoon

498
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:52,222
can endanger her chances of parole.

499
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,327
I'm sorry, Mr. Jensen.

500
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:58,095
We'll notify you
when you can see her again. Goodbye.

501
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:11,312
- What happened to Helene?
- She's in the hole again.

502
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:15,047
What happened to your visit?

503
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:20,117
Plenty. It was Carol's boyfriend.
Her man visited my guy next door.

504
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:22,757
It seems my husband has a one-track mind.

505
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:26,762
- Haven't they all?
- He just gets out of the hole for that last try,

506
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:30,798
now he sends word he's got a surefire way
of getting over here.

507
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:33,801
It seems he's got something
he wants to tell me.

508
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:37,039
Something he can't trust to anybody else.

509
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:40,074
He'll fix it so we'll never get out of here.

510
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:47,108
Something you want, Doctor?

511
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:51,177
- You put the Jensen girl back in isolation.
- Yes, that's right.

512
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:54,684
This time I won't stand for any interference.

513
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,553
I listened to you once.

514
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:59,095
This afternoon's exhibition was
the result of it.

515
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:01,688
You enjoy your power, don't you, Amelia?

516
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:04,324
I enjoy my work, if that's what you mean.

517
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:09,766
After all, I'm rebuilding human beings,
the lives of women committed to my care.

518
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:12,843
You know, I'm a student
of psychology, Doctor.

519
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:17,305
So am I.
May I tell you what's wrong with you?

520
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,674
Do, by all means.

521
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:23,242
You dislike most of the women here
because, deep down,

522
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:25,148
you're jealous of them.

523
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:30,592
- That's absurd.
- You're feminine, attractive.

524
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:33,391
You must have had opportunities to marry.

525
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:37,058
Maybe you even cared for somebody once
in your cold way.

526
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:39,201
How dare you?

527
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:42,702
But, possibly, he turned to somebody
who could give him what he really wanted,

528
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:46,173
warmth, understanding, love.

529
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:50,875
There's hardly a woman inside these walls
that doesn't know what love is.

530
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,007
Yes, and that's why most of them are here.

531
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:54,379
Exactly.

532
00:35:54,852 --> 00:35:57,912
Even the broken wrecks
have known some kind of love,

533
00:35:58,055 --> 00:35:59,784
and that's why you hate them.

534
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:04,855
What you call hate is
complete understanding, Doctor.

535
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:08,959
Knowledge gained by years of study
and hard work.

536
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:14,062
I know these women, all of them,
and only a strong mind can control them,

537
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:15,638
and if you had any real understanding,

538
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:18,174
you'd know what I am doing
to rehabilitate them.

539
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:20,301
Yes, even the psychopath.

540
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,503
You're the psychopath, Amelia. Believe me.

541
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:24,979
Get out of here!

542
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:27,915
- One of the worst in this institution.
- Get out!

543
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:31,282
- And you've gone past the borderline.
- Get out!

544
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:40,354
Get out of here!

545
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:01,215
- How you doing, Sarah?
- Okay.

546
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:04,117
- You getting out on parole soon, ain't you?
- Yeah, after nine years.

547
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:07,123
- I'll be out in six months if I make it.
- You'll make it.

548
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:09,021
Look what I brung you, dolls.

549
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:14,029
Girl, not "what I brung you,"
"what I brought you."

550
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:18,100
Grace, look what she brung us.

551
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:19,430
Pants!

552
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:24,566
Oh, that I might fill this empty vessel
with the wine of life.

553
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:27,269
It must have been a little one.

554
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,015
But this was the noblest Roman of them all.

555
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:34,778
The elements so mixed in him
that Nature might stand up

556
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:37,183
and say to all the world,

557
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:40,484
"This was a man!"

558
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:45,551
- What goes on here?
- Shakespeare, honey.

559
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,526
Okay, Shakespeare, get those clothes folded.

560
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:51,063
The recess bell will ring in 10 minutes.

561
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:55,431
- Gee, you did good this morning.
- Yeah.

562
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:57,469
Boy, am I bushed.

563
00:37:57,575 --> 00:37:59,475
This pretty little thing is sticking to me
all over.

564
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:02,546
- We break for exercise pretty soon.
- Exercise!

565
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:05,907
- That's all I need now is exercise.
- I can't take any more.

566
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:07,541
Well, I'll bring the rest, honey, when I finish.

567
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:09,313
All right.

568
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:17,685
Joan.

569
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:20,228
Glen.

570
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:28,299
- Are you crazy?
- I had to see you.

571
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:31,766
- How did you get over here?
- Don't ask me.

572
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:34,571
If you don't know,
they can't sweat it out of you.

573
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:40,884
Glen. Glen! Glen.

574
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:41,985
Glen.

575
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:48,520
Look, if you make parole, I want you
to dig up that dough I stashed away.

576
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,058
I don't know where it is.

577
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:53,225
- It's in the staircase in your mother's house.
- Under the carpet?

578
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,061
No, under the tread,
third step from the bottom.

579
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,964
There's just one guy can help me
get out of here.

580
00:38:58,069 --> 00:38:59,502
- Who?
- Steve Browder.

581
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:01,093
He couldn't help us when we were convicted.

582
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:02,832
I know, but he's got good connections now.

583
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:06,171
He came to see me, but I didn't dare tell him
where I hid the money.

584
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:10,008
Now, you get it, contact him, make the deal.
He'll know what to do.

585
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:33,092
Brenda!

586
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:36,906
Yeah, I'm sorry.

587
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:42,443
How could you be so clumsy?

588
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:45,304
The floor in there is so slippery,
I nearly fell on my face.

589
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:46,883
Well, you should watch what you're doing.

590
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:48,713
Yes, Miss Enright. I'm sorry.

591
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:52,011
Look at these shirts, they're so messy.
I'll have to put them all in the wash again.

592
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:55,854
All right, get it done. It's so muggy in here,
I'm going to get a fresh blouse.

593
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,225
- I'll get it for you, Miss Enright.
- Thanks, I'll get it myself.

594
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:11,204
Get me out!

595
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:17,641
I've warned you, girls, over and over again.

596
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:22,575
- I hope it's not too badly burned.
- No, it'll be all right.

597
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:24,347
Gee, it hurts like blazes, though.

598
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:26,184
Go to the infirmary and get it treated.

599
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,986
Come on, girls, back to your jobs. Come on.

600
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,458
Hurry up, girls.

601
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:40,701
Exercise period. 15 minutes.
Fall in, you girls.

602
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:16,972
Where were you, Joan?
I didn't see you out in the yard.

603
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:21,033
Maybe you didn't, ma'am, but I was there.
It was a beautiful day.

604
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:33,951
Doctor, Mrs. Sturgess tells me
you took Jensen out of isolation

605
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:36,026
and put her back in the infirmary.

606
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:37,650
- I did.
- I see.

607
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:44,426
You know I can't maintain discipline here
with you changing my orders.

608
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:56,208
- All right, Jensen, get out of bed.
- No.

609
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:58,372
- You're going back to isolation.
- No.

610
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:00,916
- Take her away.
- No!

611
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:03,443
Don't come near me!

612
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:05,317
Knock her on her keister, Jensen.

613
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:14,662
Take your hands off her.

614
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:17,256
Doctor, I'm warning you, keep out of this,

615
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:20,162
unless you want your little patient
tried for assault

616
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:22,466
with intent to do bodily harm to the guards?

617
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:25,440
- What do you mean?
- lf you interfere again,

618
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:29,912
according to the rules of this institution,
I may prefer charges against Jensen.

619
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:33,142
That should extend her visit here
for quite some time.

620
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,081
Do I make myself clear?

621
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:37,983
- Very clear.
- Doctor, don't let them take me.

622
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:43,790
I'm afraid you'll have to go, Helene.
There's nothing I can do about it right now.

623
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:49,059
But I'm warning you, all of you,
if you lay a hand on this girl again...

624
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:50,724
Right, take her away.

625
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:54,432
Good night, Doctor.

626
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,864
Joan! She's fainted!

627
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:33,443
Get out of here.

628
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:40,307
Joan, are you okay? Come on.
Are you all right?

629
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:44,820
- What happened to you?
- I don't know. I guess I just fainted.

630
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:46,753
- It's so hot in here.
- Get some water.

631
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:49,121
It's the steam. It always bothers me.

632
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:50,750
Can you walk to the doctor's office?

633
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:54,095
I don't have to go to the doctor's.
I'll be all right.

634
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:59,599
Here, here, take her to her cell.
She can lie down till the noon break.

635
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:06,637
- What gives?
- It's nothing, just a dizzy spell. I'll be okay.

636
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,386
Now, look here, Quackenbush.

637
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:21,254
We've had difficulty with you ever since
you were admitted to this institution.

638
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:26,792
It's either a case of mental psychosis,
or you're just plain screwball.

639
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:31,864
A physio-chemical response
to unhealthy thinking.

640
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:36,235
A manifestation of such responses
of what we know as human behavior,

641
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:41,834
and your behavior, Quackenbush,
stinks out loud.

642
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:43,242
Very clever.

643
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,214
Very clever, indeed.

644
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:49,785
We mustn't waste this talent of yours.

645
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:52,447
You'll have to do
a little show for me sometime.

646
00:44:58,062 --> 00:45:01,862
Jeepers, a command performance.

647
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:03,694
Don't borrow no trouble, honey.

648
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:07,395
At least one of us is getting a break.
Sarah here's getting out soon.

649
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:21,011
Joan?

650
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,487
Feeling better?

651
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:27,121
I'll live. Who is that singing?

652
00:45:27,825 --> 00:45:30,919
Polly and some of her friends
are serenading Sarah Graham.

653
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:33,758
- She's getting out pretty soon.
- It's about time.

654
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:39,027
You haven't eaten in a couple of days.

655
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:42,734
You can't go on like this, you know.

656
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,899
Maybe you need a tonic or something.

657
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:48,505
What's the score, kid?

658
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:54,710
Brenda, I've got to tell somebody,
or I'll go nuts.

659
00:45:54,818 --> 00:45:56,149
Okay.

660
00:45:57,654 --> 00:45:59,087
Well, I'm here.

661
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:02,489
Come on, honey. You can tell me.

662
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,686
This is driving me crazy.

663
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:07,321
Brenda, I'm pregnant.

664
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:11,156
I don't know what to do.
That's what's killing me.

665
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:18,172
- Sooner or later, they'll find out.
- Yeah.

666
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,610
The doc'll have to know.

667
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:26,478
It'd be better if you went to him first
and told him.

668
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:28,744
It's the only thing I can do.

669
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:32,146
Everything running smoothly
over on your side?

670
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:34,450
About the same.

671
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:38,354
Hello, Doc.

672
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,327
If you'll excuse me, Warden,
I think I'll be going now.

673
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,660
Don't leave, Amelia.
I have some news for you, both of you.

674
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,861
Here's my report as of this date.
Congratulations, Warden.

675
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,904
You two are going to have a baby.

676
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,106
What are you talking about?

677
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:55,007
Well, it won't be exactly yours, Amelia,

678
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:58,206
but it will belong 100% to this institution.

679
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,283
What's new about that?

680
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:03,217
Yes, lots of women are in that condition
when they arrive here.

681
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,255
Was it the new girl
who was brought in the other day?

682
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:09,587
No. This woman's been here for two years.

683
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:15,187
That's ridiculous.
How could it possibly have happened?

684
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:17,992
Haven't you heard, Amelia?

685
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:22,367
It usually begins in the springtime.
There's a scent of flowers in the air.

686
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:25,468
The bees are buzzing,
the birds are twittering,

687
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:27,237
all nature's throbbing.

688
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:30,370
Burton. Joan Burton!
That's Glen Burton's wife!

689
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,469
Yes.

690
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:33,707
Tierney! Where's Glen Burton?

691
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:35,250
Why, he's in the chow line, Warden.

692
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:38,185
Pull him out. Get him in here on the double!

693
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:40,948
Joan Burton comes up for parole soon.

694
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:43,993
Recommend it. Get her out of here
as quickly as possible.

695
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:46,525
He's absolutely right.
We could keep her isolated

696
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:49,224
- until it's time for her to leave.
- That's not the problem.

697
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:53,167
If Burton got over there, others can do it.
Not to see women, but to crash out.

698
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:55,135
My job is to find out
how he got over that wall

699
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:57,036
and make sure it can never happen again.

700
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:00,576
I understand that, Warden,
but what are you going to do about his wife?

701
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:04,272
I'm not worried about her.
Look, Doc, this is my beef, not yours.

702
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:07,282
- All right, you, come on.
- Now, take it easy, Tierney.

703
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:10,649
You just stick to your pills, Doc,
and I'll handle this in my own way.

704
00:48:10,754 --> 00:48:12,517
Okay, Tierney. Wait outside.

705
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:16,353
Sit down.

706
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,831
Have a cigar, Glen?

707
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:25,468
Thanks.

708
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,894
You know, you should be giving me one.

709
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,871
Do you know why I sent for you?

710
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,074
No, sir.

711
00:48:38,215 --> 00:48:40,809
You don't know
you're about to become a father, huh?

712
00:48:45,188 --> 00:48:47,213
I don't know what you're talking about.

713
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:51,422
How did you get over on the women's side?

714
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:54,929
Look, Warden,
I tried it once on the paint detail,

715
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:57,728
but you were too smart for me.
I didn't make it, remember?

716
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:00,026
Stop conning me, Burton.

717
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:03,231
I might be able to help your wife
when she comes up for parole.

718
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:05,975
Well...

719
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:11,508
You know, Warden,
if I thought Joan would get a parole,

720
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:15,813
I might find out how a guy
could get over on the women's side,

721
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:19,346
and then, on the day she leaves here,

722
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:22,221
I'd show you how it could be done.

723
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:25,455
- Just like that, huh?
- Just like that, sir.

724
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:29,891
- I could make you talk.
- Sure, I know.

725
00:49:30,734 --> 00:49:35,171
You could kick me around,
bury me in the hole, beat me up, kill me.

726
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:37,739
Why don't you?

727
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,502
All I care about is my wife,

728
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:45,604
and if she doesn't make parole,
every stir-crazy con in this joint

729
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:48,378
will find how to get over on the other side.

730
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,546
Get out of here.

731
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,187
Thanks for the cigar, Warden.

732
00:50:04,134 --> 00:50:07,968
Amelia, you like your job here, don't you?

733
00:50:08,872 --> 00:50:10,305
Yes, of course I do.

734
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:13,843
Well, unless I get the information I want,
you'll be washed up.

735
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:15,104
Washed up?

736
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:17,077
Burton got over there in broad daylight,

737
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,648
which means you and your matrons
must have been asleep.

738
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,275
I'll give you one week
to find out how he made it.

739
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:25,321
And if you don't find out,
you'll be hunting a job,

740
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:27,788
and it's my hunch nobody will want you.

741
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,960
All visiting privileges are to be canceled
until further orders.

742
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:40,058
Yes, ma'am.

743
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:44,129
Outgoing mail is to be closely censored
for any reference to this Burton affair.

744
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:45,731
What about parolees?

745
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:50,211
Yes, 10 go before the board this weekend.
Only one stands a chance.

746
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:51,541
Sarah Graham.

747
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:55,517
I shall ask the board to defer her hearing
for six months.

748
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:59,486
Now, about Joan Burton,
here's what I want you to do.

749
00:51:12,502 --> 00:51:14,732
Joan Burton, up front.

750
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:16,567
- Again?
- Get her.

751
00:51:34,724 --> 00:51:37,192
Joan, Joan, you're wanted.

752
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:42,194
I can't go through that again.

753
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:45,130
Just your robe and slippers, same as before.

754
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:46,964
Why don't you leave her alone?

755
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:48,594
They know the girl's sick.

756
00:51:48,705 --> 00:51:51,196
This is the third night they've dragged her
out of a sound sleep.

757
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:52,434
Sorry, orders.

758
00:51:57,214 --> 00:52:00,945
What's that old bat van Zandt trying to do,
drive the girl crazy?

759
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:02,951
She knows Joan can't take it.

760
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:04,315
That dame isn't human.

761
00:52:04,421 --> 00:52:07,549
- Spit in her eye, Joan!
- For me, too, honey!

762
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,524
Joan, I hate to see this happen to you
every night.

763
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,188
I'll bet you do.

764
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:18,199
I'm a woman,
and I know what these sessions can do

765
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:20,201
to a girl in your condition.

766
00:52:21,004 --> 00:52:22,938
I don't like the way
Miss van Zandt's handling this,

767
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:25,098
but she's in a tough spot.

768
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:28,371
I can't tell her how Glen got over here,
because I don't know.

769
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:32,881
You must know, and she's got to find out.
It could mean her job.

770
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:36,917
Do you think I like being yanked out of bed
and brought here night after night?

771
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,818
Don't you think if I knew,
I'd tell her and I'd get it over with?

772
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:43,757
Joan, listen,
you're not helping your husband.

773
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:47,227
You're doing him harm,
and think of yourself, the future.

774
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,560
It can mean a parole, a quick one.

775
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:53,693
Mrs. Sturgess,
I can't tell you what I don't know!

776
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:10,052
- Well?
- She's just the same.

777
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,545
You can go, Sturgess.

778
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:28,163
I've given you every opportunity,
reasoned with you for hours.

779
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:31,140
You know,
there isn't a woman in this institution

780
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:34,233
who wouldn't answer my questions
to get herself out of here.

781
00:53:34,578 --> 00:53:36,341
But you have to be different.

782
00:53:36,746 --> 00:53:40,273
I suppose you think it's smart
to insult my intelligence with your lies.

783
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:44,176
Well, I'll give you one more opportunity.

784
00:53:44,287 --> 00:53:45,982
Are you going to tell me
what I want to know?

785
00:53:46,089 --> 00:53:48,455
I can't, Miss van Zandt.

786
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:55,058
I've told you over and over again,
I don't know. I wish I did!

787
00:53:59,002 --> 00:54:02,665
You know, I'm beginning to believe Joan.

788
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:13,677
Break her out!

789
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:15,616
- Stop acting!
- I'm not!

790
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:16,708
You're not fooling me!

791
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:18,082
- Please!
- Are you going to tell me the truth?

792
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:19,746
- I don't know.
- Come on, on your feet.

793
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:21,824
- I don't know!
- Are you going to tell me the truth?

794
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:26,519
- Please, I don't know...
- All right, I'll get it out of you!

795
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:31,292
All right. Get up.

796
00:54:42,379 --> 00:54:47,578
Get up, do you hear me?
Get up! Get up! Get up.

797
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:04,500
Doctor?

798
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:29,582
I heard her scream. What was it?

799
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:31,752
Doris, just keep quiet
and everything will be all right!

800
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:34,125
There's nothing wrong at all.

801
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:36,130
What's wrong with her?
What's wrong with her?

802
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:38,928
- Doctor, is she hurt bad? Is she all right?
- Will you please be quiet?

803
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:41,003
Answer me, Doctor! Is she all right?

804
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:45,230
It's that van Zandt woman again.
I knew she'd do this.

805
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:48,135
If I could get my hands on that woman...

806
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:06,389
Doctor, you'd better come
and have a look at Joan Burton.

807
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:09,863
She must have had a relapse.
There seems to be no pulse at all.

808
00:56:09,966 --> 00:56:12,992
Fix a hypo. Long needle. Adrenalin chloride.

809
00:56:52,976 --> 00:56:56,002
- There's a pulse now.
- Yes, but weak.

810
00:56:57,180 --> 00:57:00,377
I don't think she's going to make it.
Oxygen tent.

811
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:24,198
- Through for the day, Grace?
- Yes, ma'am.

812
00:57:24,307 --> 00:57:29,643
- Everything normal up front?
- Yeah, everything's normal.

813
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:33,014
Joan Burton may die.

814
00:57:56,539 --> 00:57:59,406
Dear God, help her.

815
00:58:00,777 --> 00:58:02,438
Give her strength.

816
00:58:03,213 --> 00:58:05,010
Don't let her die.

817
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,197
March to mess hall!

818
00:58:28,571 --> 00:58:29,765
What's the matter with you girls?

819
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:32,341
- We're not having any breakfast.
- Who said that?

820
00:58:33,977 --> 00:58:37,174
We're not doing anything in this joint
until a lot of things are changed!

821
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,542
Go back in your cells.

822
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:55,557
- Who's their ringleader?
- They don't seem to have one.

823
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,992
- Somebody must have spoken for them.
- They all spoke.

824
00:59:00,436 --> 00:59:02,904
They just won't go to breakfast.

825
00:59:03,006 --> 00:59:05,236
All right, send them to work without any.

826
00:59:06,175 --> 00:59:07,472
Yes, ma'am.

827
00:59:26,496 --> 00:59:29,431
Come on, girls, get on the job.
We've got a lot to do today.

828
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:59,725
Martin, you seem to have more intelligence
than most of these women here.

829
01:00:00,396 --> 01:00:02,193
What do you think you'll gain by this?

830
01:00:02,298 --> 01:00:05,734
We want the people outside
to find out what goes on in here.

831
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:07,969
- That's right!
- Quiet.

832
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:11,900
You think they'd be interested?

833
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:14,738
We want them to taste
the slop we get to eat!

834
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:17,244
- Yeah!
- The slop we get to eat.

835
01:00:17,513 --> 01:00:19,879
We want them to find out
what you call discipline,

836
01:00:19,983 --> 01:00:23,214
what you do to any girl
who can't do a full day's work.

837
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:25,446
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

838
01:00:25,888 --> 01:00:28,356
What happens to a girl
who won't be a stool pigeon,

839
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:31,450
to any one of us that won't bow down
and worship you!

840
01:00:31,561 --> 01:00:33,791
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

841
01:00:35,331 --> 01:00:36,355
Anything else?

842
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:42,503
Most of all, we want them to find out

843
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:46,300
what happened to Joan Burton.

844
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:48,741
- Yeah!
- Yeah, what happened to Joan Burton.

845
01:00:52,715 --> 01:00:55,650
In short,
you'd like to run this institution yourselves.

846
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:58,178
Well, I'm afraid we can't have that.

847
01:00:58,721 --> 01:01:01,849
Since you've all decided not to work
or to eat,

848
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:03,357
we'll just have to send you back
to your cells

849
01:01:03,459 --> 01:01:05,927
until you're hungry enough
to change your minds.

850
01:01:06,729 --> 01:01:10,426
- All right, lock them up.
- Fall in, girls. March.

851
01:01:22,078 --> 01:01:25,445
The matrons and I searched
every inch of the buildings, found nothing.

852
01:01:26,149 --> 01:01:28,310
I don't know how Burton got over there.

853
01:01:28,451 --> 01:01:30,612
Well, he did. There's no doubt about that.

854
01:01:31,788 --> 01:01:35,280
If anything happens to that girl,
it could be serious for you, Amelia.

855
01:01:35,825 --> 01:01:39,488
- I simply did what you ordered.
- I didn't order you to beat the woman.

856
01:01:39,595 --> 01:01:42,223
You gave me one week to get the facts.

857
01:01:44,734 --> 01:01:46,292
How is she, Doctor?

858
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:49,265
I'm glad I found the two of you together.

859
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:52,266
I haven't slept since I saw you last.

860
01:01:53,676 --> 01:01:56,304
As soon as I'm through
with the Burton case, I'm resigning.

861
01:01:56,412 --> 01:02:00,178
- We'll hate to lose you, Doc.
- Is she going to be all right?

862
01:02:00,283 --> 01:02:03,980
A little while ago, I thought I'd lost her.
She's under oxygen now.

863
01:02:05,154 --> 01:02:07,315
I don't know what you did to her
to cause an internal hemorrhage,

864
01:02:07,423 --> 01:02:09,118
but I'm glad I didn't see it.

865
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:11,489
Because if I had,
it might even be worse for you.

866
01:02:11,594 --> 01:02:14,290
- Now, wait a minute...
- You wait, and listen to me!

867
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:17,763
Doesn't it mean anything to you
that a pregnant girl was beaten,

868
01:02:17,867 --> 01:02:19,767
that two lives were endangered?

869
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:23,361
If I have to write a death certificate
for Joan Burton,

870
01:02:23,473 --> 01:02:27,933
I'll give the cause of death as murder,
and I'll name you both.

871
01:03:11,154 --> 01:03:14,317
- Sorry, I'm late.
- What's five minutes more or less?

872
01:03:14,423 --> 01:03:18,052
If it had been a half hour, I might be sore.
I want to catch the last show at the Bijou.

873
01:03:18,161 --> 01:03:19,753
- That prison movie?
- Yeah.

874
01:03:19,862 --> 01:03:21,591
They never get things right
in prison pictures.

875
01:03:21,697 --> 01:03:24,996
I know, but I like to pick out the flaws.
Well, good night.

876
01:03:25,101 --> 01:03:27,035
- Good night.
- Miss Saunders!

877
01:03:28,404 --> 01:03:29,666
Who is it?

878
01:03:31,174 --> 01:03:33,734
It's Mae in cell 54.

879
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:40,241
I feel real bad, Miss Saunders.
Something terrible.

880
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:45,248
- I've got to see a doctor!
- Go get her out.

881
01:03:55,631 --> 01:03:58,464
If it's her appendix,
maybe she'll need an operation.

882
01:03:58,935 --> 01:04:01,301
A scar on my body? Nothing doing!

883
01:04:02,538 --> 01:04:06,235
Saunders, don't move!
One yelp out of you, and I'll slit her throat.

884
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:09,311
Dottie! Okay, girls, quiet, everybody.

885
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:12,405
Shave and a haircut.

886
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:15,450
Mae, throw the master switch
that opens all the gates.

887
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:24,388
Quiet, girls.

888
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:27,959
Take it easy. Take it easy.

889
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:35,496
- Okay.
- Sarah, take the keys.

890
01:04:35,938 --> 01:04:37,303
The other matrons are having
their coffee now.

891
01:04:37,406 --> 01:04:39,374
Take five girls, go get them
and bring them back here.

892
01:04:39,475 --> 01:04:41,943
- Polly, Grace, Josie.
- Wait a minute.

893
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:43,170
Remember, be quiet.

894
01:04:43,279 --> 01:04:45,611
One yell out of a slaphappy dame
will blow the whole works.

895
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:47,205
Now, go on, beat it.

896
01:04:48,284 --> 01:04:50,616
- Come on, quiet.
- Come on.

897
01:05:16,345 --> 01:05:19,974
- Helene.
- What happened?

898
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:23,848
We're taking over. Go on, get in there.
Hurry, all of you.

899
01:05:23,953 --> 01:05:25,614
All matrons inside.

900
01:05:52,148 --> 01:05:56,278
- They look more like cons than we do.
- Lock up. Come on, Dottie.

901
01:06:01,891 --> 01:06:03,119
Hey, Bren.

902
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:08,054
- Mike's a nice guy. I wish we could...
- Well, we can't. Come on.

903
01:06:14,937 --> 01:06:17,804
- Yes?
- Miss van Zandt, this is Mrs. Sturgess.

904
01:06:17,907 --> 01:06:19,431
I'm very busy, Sturgess.

905
01:06:19,542 --> 01:06:22,170
I hate to bother you,
but we've got a little trouble.

906
01:06:22,278 --> 01:06:24,974
Nothing serious,
but I'd better talk to you about it.

907
01:06:25,081 --> 01:06:26,480
Very well, I'll see you.

908
01:06:42,932 --> 01:06:45,560
- Is that you, Sturgess?
- Yes, Miss van Zandt.

909
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:56,903
All right, what seems to be the trouble now?

910
01:07:01,217 --> 01:07:02,741
Don't you try that!

911
01:07:05,955 --> 01:07:08,822
One squawk out of you,
and I'll punch a hole right in your diagram.

912
01:07:08,924 --> 01:07:09,948
Diaphragm, honey.

913
01:07:10,059 --> 01:07:13,358
- Listen, you're making a terrible mistake.
- I don't think we are.

914
01:07:18,567 --> 01:07:19,534
Answer it.

915
01:07:22,171 --> 01:07:23,695
It's the Warden.

916
01:07:25,107 --> 01:07:29,134
Miss van Zandt speaking. Hello, Warden.

917
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:33,010
- Are you in your office?
- No, I'm home.

918
01:07:33,115 --> 01:07:35,811
- He's home.
- How's the Burton girl?

919
01:07:35,918 --> 01:07:40,048
- She's the same, Warden.
- Everything quiet over there?

920
01:07:40,156 --> 01:07:42,090
Everything's under control.

921
01:07:42,191 --> 01:07:45,251
If there's any change in her condition, I'll...
I'll call you.

922
01:07:46,028 --> 01:07:47,154
Good night.

923
01:07:48,364 --> 01:07:49,922
Where do you keep your gun?

924
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:52,697
All weapons are kept in the arsenal.

925
01:07:54,303 --> 01:07:56,601
Don't give me that. Where is it?

926
01:08:23,699 --> 01:08:24,927
Burton.

927
01:08:25,901 --> 01:08:28,995
- How is she, Doc?
- What are you doing here?

928
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:32,132
Give me the low down, Doc. Will she live?

929
01:08:33,509 --> 01:08:37,206
Take my advice, Glen. Get out of here.
Get back on the other side.

930
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:39,581
I'm doing everything I can for her.

931
01:08:49,758 --> 01:08:50,782
Joan.

932
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:54,224
Joan, honey.

933
01:08:57,399 --> 01:08:58,366
Joanie.

934
01:09:00,035 --> 01:09:01,502
It's me, baby.

935
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,107
Glen.

936
01:09:07,409 --> 01:09:09,377
Everything's going to be all right.

937
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:12,914
I should have made you tell me
how you got over here,

938
01:09:14,049 --> 01:09:15,846
and this wouldn't have happened.

939
01:09:16,018 --> 01:09:20,216
Don't worry about that. Just...
Just get well. You've got to.

940
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:22,051
I'll make parole.

941
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:27,956
I'll wait for you. You and the baby

942
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:32,827
and I will... We'll be together.

943
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:37,537
That's why I've... I've got to live.

944
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:43,242
- Don't cry, Glen.
- I'm not crying.

945
01:09:44,747 --> 01:09:50,185
- Just seeing you has made everything right.
- You shouldn't be over here.

946
01:09:51,787 --> 01:09:55,746
- I had to see you.
- The doctor will take care of me.

947
01:09:56,592 --> 01:09:58,184
Go back, Glen.

948
01:09:59,261 --> 01:10:00,694
Do your time.

949
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:04,029
Stay out of trouble.

950
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:10,902
A few years,
I'll be waiting for you at the gate.

951
01:10:13,676 --> 01:10:14,643
Glen,

952
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:19,145
promise me?

953
01:10:20,115 --> 01:10:23,016
- I promise.
- Go back.

954
01:10:24,019 --> 01:10:25,145
Glen,

955
01:10:26,789 --> 01:10:28,086
I love you.

956
01:10:44,006 --> 01:10:45,268
Doc?

957
01:10:56,685 --> 01:10:57,811
She's gone, Glen.

958
01:11:32,688 --> 01:11:35,680
- Doc!
- What are you doing in this uniform?

959
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:37,725
Quiet, we've taken over this joint.

960
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:41,422
You'll get hurt.

961
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:44,328
Not any more than they've hurt Joan.
What about her, Doc?

962
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:49,635
What about her, Doc?

963
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:53,608
She's dead.

964
01:11:58,013 --> 01:11:59,275
That does it.

965
01:12:07,356 --> 01:12:08,983
Okay, girls, bring her out.

966
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:22,128
Move.

967
01:12:25,274 --> 01:12:27,902
- Brenda, don't do this.
- You can't stop us now, Doc.

968
01:12:40,456 --> 01:12:41,821
Joan Burton is dead.

969
01:12:46,161 --> 01:12:49,494
Stop it! Wait! Listen to me!

970
01:12:49,598 --> 01:12:52,590
Listen! You started this
so people on the outside

971
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:54,362
would know what she's done to Joan.

972
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:58,406
But if you kill her, you'll be murderers, too.
She'll pay for what she's done.

973
01:12:58,507 --> 01:12:59,531
But not enough!

974
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:06,572
You've got a chance to win,
but if you do this, you'll fail.

975
01:13:07,149 --> 01:13:10,778
Brenda, you should know that.
I promise you she'll be punished.

976
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:12,581
We ain't waiting for no promises.

977
01:13:15,290 --> 01:13:18,384
Listen to me! Listen, listen!

978
01:13:18,494 --> 01:13:21,429
You know I'm on your side,
but if you kill this woman,

979
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:24,465
nothing will be changed,
and you'll all suffer for it.

980
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:26,033
We've suffered enough.

981
01:13:26,135 --> 01:13:27,693
Helene.

982
01:13:29,705 --> 01:13:31,969
Look what she's done to her.

983
01:13:36,745 --> 01:13:38,440
Where can I find van Zandt?

984
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:44,415
The girls have got her.
They've got this place sewed up.

985
01:13:45,187 --> 01:13:46,950
I don't know where they took her.

986
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:09,677
We've combed this whole joint
looking for that con.

987
01:14:09,778 --> 01:14:13,407
I tell you, he heard about his wife
and he's over on the women's side.

988
01:14:26,328 --> 01:14:29,786
- Don't come in here, Warden!
- You haven't got a chance, Burton.

989
01:14:29,898 --> 01:14:31,923
We've got van Zandt and all her matrons.

990
01:14:32,034 --> 01:14:33,592
If they got caught, it's their own fault.

991
01:14:33,702 --> 01:14:35,795
You've got a better angle. Try to get him.

992
01:14:39,608 --> 01:14:42,975
We're going in. Use your gas gun.
Smoke him out, boys.

993
01:14:43,078 --> 01:14:44,705
Steve, cover him with a shot.

994
01:15:07,369 --> 01:15:08,927
Go to your cells! Wet towels!

995
01:15:10,839 --> 01:15:12,966
Put blankets over the cell doors!

996
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:37,023
Cover the laundry, kitchen and mess hall!

997
01:15:45,607 --> 01:15:50,101
- Where's van Zandt? Where is she?
- She's in here someplace.

998
01:15:57,653 --> 01:16:01,419
Left or right? Where is she?
Do you know where she went? Where is she?

999
01:16:01,723 --> 01:16:03,190
I don't know!

1000
01:16:05,093 --> 01:16:09,257
- I don't know. She's not in here.
- Where's van Zandt?

1001
01:16:09,364 --> 01:16:10,388
I don't know!

1002
01:17:05,387 --> 01:17:07,821
- All right, now.
- No! No!

1003
01:17:07,923 --> 01:17:10,323
Doc, let me get her! Let me get her...

1004
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:17,027
Burton, Burton, I'll make you pay for this.
I'll make you pay.

1005
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:19,930
Your wife's coming up for parole.

1006
01:17:20,035 --> 01:17:21,866
Well, I'll see that she doesn't get it.

1007
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:24,268
Yes, I'll tell the board
that she was in this with you.

1008
01:17:24,373 --> 01:17:27,900
That's what I'll do.
I'll tell the board, and she won't get it.

1009
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:31,074
Doc, Joan's dead.

1010
01:17:32,314 --> 01:17:35,681
Don't you see? Her mind's gone.

1011
01:17:37,619 --> 01:17:40,452
There isn't anyone in this institution
who won't answer my questions

1012
01:17:40,555 --> 01:17:41,749
to get out of here.

1013
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:45,587
There isn't anyone.
But I'll get the truth out of them.

1014
01:17:45,727 --> 01:17:48,560
I'll get the truth out of them,
that's what I'll do!

1015
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:51,656
- I'll get the truth out of them!
- Get him out of here.

1016
01:17:51,867 --> 01:17:57,499
I hate them! I hate them all!
I hate them! I hate them all!

1017
01:17:57,606 --> 01:17:58,664
I hate them!

1018
01:17:58,774 --> 01:18:01,641
- What do we do with her, Doc?
- Get a straitjacket.

1019
01:18:01,743 --> 01:18:04,439
I hate them. I hate...

1020
01:18:26,168 --> 01:18:30,036
Warden, what else can you do
besides run a prison?

1021
01:18:30,138 --> 01:18:32,629
Why, I never gave it a thought.

1022
01:18:32,741 --> 01:18:37,041
You know, Doc,
I've been in this business all my life.

1023
01:18:37,145 --> 01:18:42,481
I've been a deputy sheriff, a prison guard,
a yard captain, an assistant warden,

1024
01:18:42,584 --> 01:18:44,916
warden, I don't know anything else.

1025
01:18:45,053 --> 01:18:48,545
- That's too bad.
- Why? What do you mean?

1026
01:18:48,657 --> 01:18:50,056
I mean that when the board meets tomorrow,

1027
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:52,649
the best you can hope for
is a chance to resign.

1028
01:18:54,529 --> 01:18:57,555
Goodbye, Warden. Nice to have known you.
