00:00:28,155 --> 00:00:35,355
* RED TOMAHAWK *

2
00:01:42,414 --> 00:01:46,980
General George Custer and his
gallant soldiers, of the7th Cavalry,

3
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:51,602
were massacred, on the morning
of June 25, 1876.

4
00:01:51,628 --> 00:01:54,562
At dawn of the following day,
while thousands of Sioux,

5
00:01:54,695 --> 00:01:57,682
still roamed
the Black Hills of Dakota,

6
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:02,307
the first to come Upon that
carnage was Captain Tom York,

7
00:02:02,435 --> 00:02:06,645
special agent
of the United States Army.

8
00:04:37,501 --> 00:04:39,785
Hi!
Is anyone there?

9
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,563
Good morning, young soldier

10
00:04:48,107 --> 00:04:49,286
Be welcome!

11
00:04:51,435 --> 00:04:52,841
My name is, Crone.

12
00:04:53,676 --> 00:04:54,902
Ned Crone.

13
00:04:56,577 --> 00:04:59,167
Tell me why you look so scared.

14
00:04:59,308 --> 00:05:01,180
The 7th Cavalry was slaughtered.

15
00:05:01,472 --> 00:05:03,058
You better get out
of here quickly.

16
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:06,910
Well, I'm sorry for the cavalry,

17
00:05:06,936 --> 00:05:08,816
but...
I will not leave this land.

18
00:05:09,264 --> 00:05:11,228
It is best to let,
the animal rest for a while.

19
00:05:11,254 --> 00:05:12,791
It looks like he's about
to suffocate.

20
00:05:12,817 --> 00:05:14,631
I don't have time,
I have to get to Deadwood

21
00:05:14,657 --> 00:05:15,915
and wire to Fort Bastion.

22
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,422
Are you saying that all
the Cavalry boys were killed?

23
00:05:19,568 --> 00:05:22,227
More soldiers are on the way.
They could be ambushed, like Custer.

24
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:26,255
So you better get going.
I will stay here.

25
00:05:26,296 --> 00:05:28,441
My partner and I discovered
wealth in this region.

26
00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:30,681
He's in town,
to legalize the land

27
00:05:30,707 --> 00:05:33,372
and if I leave here, someone could
come and take possession.

28
00:05:34,085 --> 00:05:37,660
Listen, friend.
These hills are full of Indians.

29
00:05:38,821 --> 00:05:42,794
Mr. the Indian was not born yet
that will get me out of here now.

30
00:06:27,644 --> 00:06:29,973
Hey, captain! And Custer?
How is he doing?

31
00:06:30,024 --> 00:06:31,545
Has he already wiped
out all the Indians?

32
00:06:41,287 --> 00:06:43,654
Are you the telegraph operator?
Myself

33
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:47,490
I have a message for Fort
Bastion I can't send,

34
00:06:47,596 --> 00:06:49,390
because the wires must have
been cut by the Indians.

35
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,383
When General Custer is finished with
them, we'll have the cables in order.

36
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:53,608
Custer is dead.

37
00:06:57,943 --> 00:06:59,140
I don't believe it, Captain!

38
00:07:00,074 --> 00:07:01,396
Dead Custer!

39
00:07:01,681 --> 00:07:04,251
The entire 7th Cavalry was slaughtered,
there was not a man left.

40
00:07:04,487 --> 00:07:06,768
What about the city?
We are going to be slaughtered.

41
00:07:06,912 --> 00:07:08,314
They were slaughtered.

42
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:10,713
Ten thousand Sioux
must be around.

43
00:07:10,876 --> 00:07:13,581
I have to send a message.
But there are no possibilities,

44
00:07:13,607 --> 00:07:15,800
Deadwood is isolated from
the rest of the world.

45
00:07:17,028 --> 00:07:18,533
Maybe we can send messengers.

46
00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:21,355
If Custer is dead,
there is no way to pass.

47
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,198
Did you hear that?

48
00:07:24,263 --> 00:07:27,386
Custer is dead.
Him and his entire army.

49
00:07:27,975 --> 00:07:29,952
Are you sure about that,
Captain.

50
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,349
I saw the bodies.

51
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:34,903
The Indians will leave
Deadwood in ash.

52
00:07:35,548 --> 00:07:36,661
Captain...

53
00:07:37,251 --> 00:07:39,568
I have a partner there,
Ned Crone, Sir, did you see him?

54
00:07:39,594 --> 00:07:41,126
You had a partner there.

55
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:44,466
What do you mean by that?
He is dead.

56
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,548
What did you do?
Did you leave him there to die?

57
00:07:49,955 --> 00:07:53,454
What are you doing?
What do you mean, what are we doing?

58
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,918
I saw you two!

59
00:07:54,944 --> 00:07:57,044
You are completely mistaken.
Fort Bastion...

60
00:07:57,298 --> 00:08:00,283
They were arrested, given amnesty
to accompany General Custer.

61
00:08:00,404 --> 00:08:01,684
Who are they, Captain?

62
00:08:22,531 --> 00:08:25,236
He must have tied himself up,
saw what was going to happen to him.

63
00:08:27,092 --> 00:08:30,442
I never thought of seeing a sniper
as with an arrow to the neck.

64
00:08:30,768 --> 00:08:32,199
Oh!...

65
00:08:32,225 --> 00:08:33,830
My God!
No, please! Not!

66
00:08:33,856 --> 00:08:35,759
It can not be. He is dead.

67
00:08:40,417 --> 00:08:42,571
Sal has been waiting
for him for months.

68
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:45,233
She used to come and wait.
all due diligence.

69
00:08:45,869 --> 00:08:48,316
I wonder if this will be
the last step to get here.

70
00:08:50,183 --> 00:08:53,181
All the Indians in the region will come
and they will remove our scalps.

71
00:08:53,612 --> 00:08:56,223
Yes!...
they will take off our scalps.

72
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,711
Because?

73
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,102
Because? Because soldiers
like that are in the city,

74
00:09:01,128 --> 00:09:03,168
instead of fighting the Indians.

75
00:09:04,212 --> 00:09:05,480
What happened?

76
00:09:06,152 --> 00:09:07,968
The fight has become so bloody

77
00:09:08,428 --> 00:09:11,900
did you run away to hide?
A coward! Traitor!

78
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,002
People like you caused this!

79
00:09:16,596 --> 00:09:20,461
This captain is, a deserter.
Look at him, without a scratch!

80
00:09:20,487 --> 00:09:22,594
Do you look like you were
fighting the Indians?

81
00:09:22,665 --> 00:09:23,753
Not!

82
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,810
Of course,
I was with General Custer,

83
00:09:25,836 --> 00:09:29,251
but he ran away from
the battlefield, the coward!

84
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,299
Is that so, Captain?

85
00:09:30,325 --> 00:09:33,044
Well, look at him, and the only man,
in uniform in this city.

86
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:36,110
That's right.
Are deserters! They are lying!

87
00:09:36,202 --> 00:09:39,981
The uniform doesn't lie.
He speaks like this,

88
00:09:40,007 --> 00:09:42,401
to save filthy skin!

89
00:09:42,427 --> 00:09:45,837
Hey!...
Hit hard! Lynch him!

90
00:10:00,481 --> 00:10:03,569
There will be no time for you
o go to court, Captain.

91
00:10:05,996 --> 00:10:08,101
You should have stayed
at Little Big House.

92
00:10:12,068 --> 00:10:14,277
Get your treats out of here!...

93
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:21,010
You are at an advantage,
don't you think guys?

94
00:10:21,036 --> 00:10:23,775
That's the advantage he gave
Custer, none.

95
00:10:26,806 --> 00:10:27,980
Smith!

96
00:10:28,298 --> 00:10:31,258
It will be like fighting 50 men
at the same time.

97
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,678
Smith! If I attack again
from Tom York,

98
00:11:29,704 --> 00:11:31,793
I'll make five holes in you.

99
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:35,601
Do you know the captain?
Of course yes.

100
00:11:36,044 --> 00:11:37,896
He abandoned General Custer.

101
00:11:37,973 --> 00:11:39,594
He does not belong
to the 7th regiment.

102
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,927
He is a government agent,
seconded to the US Army.

103
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:45,068
So, who were the guys who
accused him?

104
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,547
They were defectors,
as I told you.

105
00:11:55,321 --> 00:11:56,803
Excuse me, Captain.

106
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,239
Did you see the deserters well?

107
00:12:00,265 --> 00:12:02,678
Yes, I saw it,
I think I could recognize them.

108
00:12:02,815 --> 00:12:04,254
Some deserters in the city?

109
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,314
They must have been hiding,
after they put the crowd against you,

110
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:10,864
they set a beautiful trap for me.
We will take care of you.

111
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:15,579
Captain.

112
00:12:17,345 --> 00:12:19,926
If you see those two again,
tell me who they are.

113
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:24,510
Rest assured,
I'll be aiming for them a 45.

114
00:12:37,896 --> 00:12:39,123
You look awful.

115
00:12:41,474 --> 00:12:43,829
I didn't get to see you either,
two or three years ago.

116
00:12:43,855 --> 00:12:47,378
You used to give letters, in El Paso.
Yes, for a while.

117
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:50,835
Then I accepted the position
of Sheriff in Tombstane.

118
00:12:51,302 --> 00:12:54,686
I heard that you "cleaned"
the place in the blink of an eye.

119
00:12:54,712 --> 00:12:56,624
No. They always overreact
to the story, Tom.

120
00:12:56,649 --> 00:12:58,376
You know it.
Knowing him, I don't think so.

121
00:12:59,065 --> 00:13:01,614
And my feet, they itch.

122
00:13:02,205 --> 00:13:04,695
Did you come to Deadwood,
after gold like the others?

123
00:13:04,721 --> 00:13:07,516
I don't,
I'm carrying guns for Wells Fargo.

124
00:13:07,542 --> 00:13:08,905
They got here.

125
00:13:09,735 --> 00:13:12,351
Hmm! Well, unless we can get,
in touch with the army,

126
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:14,446
we are not going anywhere else.

127
00:13:15,018 --> 00:13:17,268
What you're saying is
that the cavalry has divided

128
00:13:17,293 --> 00:13:19,568
in two by Custer,
on the way to Little Big Hom?

129
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:22,226
That's right.
They came in two different directions.

130
00:13:22,671 --> 00:13:25,696
They came in a circle to reinforce
the 7th regiment.

131
00:13:27,436 --> 00:13:28,913
And Custer will not be present.

132
00:13:30,188 --> 00:13:32,879
The only thing that will be there,
are the Indians waiting for them.

133
00:13:32,905 --> 00:13:35,294
Therefore,
it is necessary to alert them.

134
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:39,551
You are very tired!
To help? Let me see!

135
00:13:40,258 --> 00:13:43,104
At least three fast messengers
will be needed.

136
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,207
Three horsemen
in two directions?

137
00:13:45,268 --> 00:13:47,104
One of them has to go
to Fort Bastion to pick up the soldiers.

138
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,612
It's ok. Three horsemen.

139
00:13:50,257 --> 00:13:53,460
I feel better.
Three horsemen without their scalps.

140
00:13:53,486 --> 00:13:55,974
Yes. We will have to try.

141
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:59,892
Do you have to try?
No not me!

142
00:14:00,228 --> 00:14:02,369
No sir. Listen, Tom,

143
00:14:02,395 --> 00:14:04,872
somewhere in the mountains,
the Indians are waiting,

144
00:14:04,898 --> 00:14:07,654
with bloody red axes
and thirsty for more.

145
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,181
This is not something to be done

146
00:14:09,238 --> 00:14:12,112
and no man in his right
mind should do so.

147
00:14:12,837 --> 00:14:15,760
Do you think they'll attack Deadwood?
I think so, don't you think?

148
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,993
What chances of survival
will we have then?

149
00:14:18,031 --> 00:14:19,629
What are the chances
of people in the city?

150
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:22,789
You have a chance to die,
in very good company, friend.

151
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:26,870
If we alert the soldiers,
they would be ambushed by the Indians.

152
00:14:26,984 --> 00:14:29,873
Which is true,
they go straight to the killing.

153
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:32,253
If they are prepared,
they will defeat the Indians.

154
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,770
The Indians are in great numbers.
But they will face them.

155
00:14:34,796 --> 00:14:36,617
Of course,
they will face them, right

156
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:39,437
but they will have a chance to defeat
them, which Custer had.

157
00:14:39,758 --> 00:14:43,185
No, Tom. There is no chance, unless
that has a much superior weapon

158
00:14:45,158 --> 00:14:48,661
Hey Tom, didn't you have some Gatling
guns at the Fort? There were four,

159
00:14:49,184 --> 00:14:52,030
but Custer didn't want to bring them.
He said they served to delay him.

160
00:14:52,163 --> 00:14:55,209
He wanted a quick victory
on the field.

161
00:14:55,815 --> 00:14:57,180
Quick win...

162
00:14:58,036 --> 00:15:00,605
I can understand,
President Grant

163
00:15:00,631 --> 00:15:03,473
and the generals just wanted,
a quick victory.

164
00:15:04,582 --> 00:15:06,248
It was a lot of anxiety,
I think.

165
00:15:07,242 --> 00:15:08,991
Why did you ask
for machine guns?

166
00:15:09,017 --> 00:15:11,004
I heard that there are two
of them here in the city.

167
00:15:12,325 --> 00:15:14,810
What?
Don't get excited, Tom.

168
00:15:14,836 --> 00:15:18,633
I don't know where they are or who has
them, or if they really exist.

169
00:15:19,021 --> 00:15:22,939
If that's true,
it would give soldiers a chance, right?

170
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:26,888
You won't like it, Tom.
Okay, I won't like it.

171
00:15:27,131 --> 00:15:29,202
Your friend, Columbus Smith

172
00:15:30,132 --> 00:15:33,119
That's what this bull is called.
who tried to pull my brains out?

173
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:36,184
He knows almost everything
is happening in this city.

174
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:37,722
Where can we find him?

175
00:15:38,715 --> 00:15:40,729
When he had that "date"
with you, he was

176
00:15:40,754 --> 00:15:42,617
taking the dirty laundry
must be at Chinaman.

177
00:15:42,643 --> 00:15:44,021
So, come on.

178
00:15:48,826 --> 00:15:52,136
Get out of here now!
What are you doing?

179
00:16:00,307 --> 00:16:03,506
The city went crazy.
They counted on Custer.

180
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:07,637
It seems that they will face
the problem with the barriers.

181
00:16:08,256 --> 00:16:09,985
The Indians break the barriers.

182
00:16:14,457 --> 00:16:17,222
Hey you there!
Put it here. Come on.

183
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:23,328
Hear me out! Wait!

184
00:16:24,223 --> 00:16:28,055
Wait!
You are fighting on the wrong side.

185
00:16:29,471 --> 00:16:32,674
The battle is within you.

186
00:16:33,758 --> 00:16:35,914
We will all die.

187
00:16:36,247 --> 00:16:40,405
Yes, we will die,
but can't we die with dignity?

188
00:16:40,615 --> 00:16:44,832
A doomsday speech.
Yes, the end of the world.

189
00:16:45,885 --> 00:16:47,702
The problem is that
he may be right.

190
00:16:48,971 --> 00:16:50,385
It could be the end of Deadwood.

191
00:16:50,478 --> 00:16:53,560
If we don't get the machine guns,
you can bet life that everything is lost.

192
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,981
Please,

193
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:00,758
Look at God before it's too late.
Seek God.

194
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,314
Apparently,
he tried to cross the mountains.

195
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:16,050
See what happens if we try.
We will not try.

196
00:17:27,906 --> 00:17:30,195
If he accuses us of defecting
the way he accuses us

197
00:17:30,221 --> 00:17:33,430
people will slaughter us
and spit us out.

198
00:17:33,514 --> 00:17:36,364
Let's stay hidden.
Perhaps the Captain will not see us.

199
00:17:36,484 --> 00:17:40,537
In a city this big?
There is nowhere to hide.

200
00:17:41,211 --> 00:17:43,931
Sooner or later, we meet.

201
00:17:45,037 --> 00:17:47,038
But you can't find us
if you're dead.

202
00:17:47,631 --> 00:17:49,401
A dead person cannot
see anything.

203
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:53,638
So, we have no alternative.

204
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:56,055
We `ll kill him.

205
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:04,798
Keep working! Keep walking!

206
00:18:06,277 --> 00:18:08,396
Hyah, hyah!...

207
00:18:11,907 --> 00:18:14,237
How can I wash this?

208
00:18:14,913 --> 00:18:16,970
It stinks! Nobody can wash.

209
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:21,177
Hiu!... It stinks a lot,
smell yourself, okay?

210
00:18:23,017 --> 00:18:25,071
It smells really bad,
but try again, okay?

211
00:18:25,097 --> 00:18:26,784
Try the Lord! You wash!

212
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:29,136
Hey, Captain!
Problems with staff?

213
00:18:29,162 --> 00:18:31,516
No. He thinks he's still,
in San Francisco.

214
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,634
Colombo won it,
playing cards over there.

215
00:18:33,825 --> 00:18:36,840
I wish I had lost it.
Captain, I'm very sorry.

216
00:18:37,139 --> 00:18:38,332
You already told me that.

217
00:18:38,395 --> 00:18:42,262
It's always like that, Columbus
knocks first and asks questions later.

218
00:18:42,297 --> 00:18:45,292
And as soon as I get into
fights that's how I do

219
00:18:45,318 --> 00:18:46,450
We need a favor.

220
00:18:46,944 --> 00:18:48,482
If you can,
I am at your disposal.

221
00:18:48,851 --> 00:18:51,659
There are rumors that machine
guns, are here in the city

222
00:18:52,723 --> 00:18:55,483
Exactly.
The army needs this. Quickly.

223
00:18:55,818 --> 00:18:58,197
I need volunteers
to carry them, Smith.

224
00:18:58,566 --> 00:19:01,446
They are hidden.
Can you take us to them?

225
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:06,779
No, I can't, because
I'm going to tell you something.

226
00:19:07,006 --> 00:19:08,935
Lil has them and she will give nothing
in this world.

227
00:19:08,993 --> 00:19:10,116
Smith?

228
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,522
Your skin,
mine and that of men is at stake.

229
00:19:12,548 --> 00:19:14,042
Will she hear the voice
of reason?

230
00:19:14,702 --> 00:19:18,168
Why don't you talk to her!
If she accepts, will I go with you?

231
00:19:20,143 --> 00:19:21,750
At least I have a volunteer.

232
00:19:21,776 --> 00:19:24,227
Two, if she delivers them!
Thank you, Smith.

233
00:19:29,713 --> 00:19:32,403
Lil's bar is over there.
Do you know her well?

234
00:19:33,126 --> 00:19:35,302
No one in this city
knows Dakota Lil well.

235
00:20:14,243 --> 00:20:16,402
Looks like you have
friends everywhere, Tom.

236
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,172
Are you one of the defectors?

237
00:20:20,736 --> 00:20:21,967
Yes he was!

238
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:27,251
Place your bets, gentlemen.

239
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,980
Please, make your bets.

240
00:20:36,793 --> 00:20:40,745
The bets are over.
Black number 25.

241
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,628
Place your bets, please.

242
00:20:48,621 --> 00:20:50,125
The bets are over.

243
00:20:53,275 --> 00:20:54,759
The bets are over.

244
00:21:11,135 --> 00:21:14,211
17 black and advantage.

245
00:21:16,671 --> 00:21:19,251
Hey, why didn't you tell me,
who knew her?

246
00:21:20,223 --> 00:21:21,439
Do not know.

247
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,577
The bets are over, gentlemen's.

248
00:21:25,981 --> 00:21:29,563
Lil, where did you meet?
Do not know!

249
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,653
I think it's time for you two
to get to know each other.

250
00:21:32,735 --> 00:21:34,881
I want to introduce you to a friend
of mine, Captain Tom York.

251
00:21:34,907 --> 00:21:37,128
Tom, I introduce Lil McCoy.
Captain!

252
00:21:37,466 --> 00:21:39,497
Finished bets,
please, gentlemen's

253
00:21:39,523 --> 00:21:41,480
Captain, are you on business,
or for fun?

254
00:21:41,524 --> 00:21:44,235
Business. And I think it's better
to get straight to the point.

255
00:21:44,709 --> 00:21:46,924
Someone could replace you.
Oh no!

256
00:21:47,234 --> 00:21:49,275
Never stop a game of chance.

257
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:52,088
Place your bets,
please, gentlemen's.

258
00:21:52,114 --> 00:21:54,508
The game of chance I'm here
for could be your life.

259
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:58,702
13, red and Advantage

260
00:21:59,501 --> 00:22:02,323
Place your bets, gentlemen's.
Lil...

261
00:22:02,722 --> 00:22:04,568
Could mean,
the lives of us all.

262
00:22:07,915 --> 00:22:09,724
Maybe we better die.

263
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:12,346
Place your bets, please.

264
00:22:12,525 --> 00:22:14,420
Place your bets, gentlemen's!

265
00:22:14,446 --> 00:22:17,340
Perhaps, madam,
but I fear that is not your decision.

266
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:22,201
And yours?
Can't we speak in private?

267
00:22:24,341 --> 00:22:26,561
This is my private place.

268
00:22:27,356 --> 00:22:30,684
If you want to speak, speak!
I wanted!...

269
00:22:31,872 --> 00:22:32,994
Speak!

270
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:37,401
The Army is in need
of machine guns.

271
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:43,825
Double zero.

272
00:22:44,823 --> 00:22:47,025
The game is over! Because?
I started just now.

273
00:22:47,051 --> 00:22:49,237
If you want to lose, your money,
they will accept you there.

274
00:22:49,761 --> 00:22:52,262
And the subject
of machine guns is closed.

275
00:22:52,515 --> 00:22:54,395
You know where they are, don't you?
Two of them.

276
00:22:55,013 --> 00:22:57,516
I don't know anything about it.
Where did you hide them?

277
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:01,609
Lil, can't we sit and talk?
What else is there to say?

278
00:23:05,222 --> 00:23:08,568
In this city its like that, nobody
get in your business life.

279
00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:10,423
I have to get into this.

280
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,479
Listen, Lil,

281
00:23:33,561 --> 00:23:35,896
the army is in dire need
of machine guns.

282
00:23:36,068 --> 00:23:39,001
If Custer had these weapons,
this story would have been different.

283
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:42,540
Nobody's going to get their hands
on those weapons.

284
00:23:43,052 --> 00:23:46,006
They can avoid,
a useless massacre of soldiers.

285
00:23:46,032 --> 00:23:48,672
Soldiers who can
fight thousands of Indians.

286
00:23:49,313 --> 00:23:50,603
I'm sorry!

287
00:23:53,624 --> 00:23:55,589
What kind of woman are you?

288
00:23:57,815 --> 00:24:02,628
I'm not the type you judge.
If I knew what I think.

289
00:24:02,834 --> 00:24:05,578
Listen, very carefully,
Captain.

290
00:24:06,463 --> 00:24:10,078
Some time ago,
no one knew me as Dakota Lil.

291
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:12,298
It was mother, wife...

292
00:24:12,324 --> 00:24:14,270
I don't want the story of your life,
I want the machine guns!

293
00:24:14,296 --> 00:24:17,177
Wait, Tom! Let's hear it.

294
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,137
Thanks!

295
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:25,929
My husband and I had a ranch,
around Deadwood.

296
00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:29,993
He was guarding,
machine guns for your partner,

297
00:24:30,589 --> 00:24:32,828
when the Indians came.

298
00:24:34,356 --> 00:24:37,314
They killed my husband,
my son and...

299
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,403
they took me with them.

300
00:24:41,973 --> 00:24:44,937
But I didn't tell them where
the weapons were hidden.

301
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:50,770
I knew they could be used
to kill innocent people.

302
00:24:52,619 --> 00:24:54,511
Listen, understand how you feel,

303
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:57,139
but the situation is
completely different now!

304
00:24:57,753 --> 00:25:02,462
These weapons cost the life,
to my husband, my son...

305
00:25:03,683 --> 00:25:05,802
and my reputation as a woman.

306
00:25:07,192 --> 00:25:11,423
I swore that no one else
will use them.

307
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,518
And, believe me, Captain...
No one will use them again.

308
00:25:18,981 --> 00:25:21,971
It's useless.
We will achieve nothing.

309
00:25:22,475 --> 00:25:26,510
I don't know, Tom.
I've never seen her like this.

310
00:25:27,946 --> 00:25:30,039
Perhaps it is better
to give him time to think.

311
00:25:30,065 --> 00:25:31,340
We do not have time.

312
00:25:32,821 --> 00:25:35,421
Let's look for them.
Where is the ranch?

313
00:25:35,447 --> 00:25:37,685
Columbus Smith must know.
Come on.

314
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:40,114
Mr. Elkins.

315
00:25:52,499 --> 00:25:55,372
Soon it will be dark.
Yes!

316
00:25:56,038 --> 00:26:00,111
With each passing hour,
soldiers are closer to Littte Big Hom.

317
00:26:00,443 --> 00:26:02,980
I can't forget
the way she looked at you.

318
00:26:03,006 --> 00:26:04,986
I don't forget the way you
refused to help us.

319
00:26:05,012 --> 00:26:08,102
You also looked at her,
in a strange way.

320
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,385
But there is nothing strange!

321
00:26:23,186 --> 00:26:26,519
Two Pairs!
Three of the same suit.

322
00:26:30,745 --> 00:26:34,457
He was trying to win himself!
Oh yes? Good luck.

323
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:42,254
Did you do it? Not here!
Smth!

324
00:26:42,686 --> 00:26:45,712
Do you know the lands that Lil
and her husband had?

325
00:26:46,483 --> 00:26:48,349
Of course I know the McCoy land.

326
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:49,847
They talked a lot,
about the projects they had,

327
00:26:49,873 --> 00:26:52,167
for them and suddenly,
he was killed.

328
00:26:54,169 --> 00:26:55,635
Very strange.

329
00:26:55,932 --> 00:26:58,438
Captain York looks like
Ben McCoy.

330
00:26:58,613 --> 00:27:00,618
It refers to the fact that he is dead,
this is how I feel.

331
00:27:00,678 --> 00:27:03,375
Did you ever see the McCoys' ranch?
The ranch?

332
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:05,218
It is a small hut outside the city.

333
00:27:05,243 --> 00:27:07,300
They wanted to make the place,
a big ranch.

334
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:10,090
Is very far?
It is very close to here.

335
00:27:10,116 --> 00:27:13,534
We think McCoy
hid his guns over there.

336
00:27:14,985 --> 00:27:16,530
Maybe you're right!...

337
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,046
Come on, practice playing
cards while I'm gone

338
00:27:26,428 --> 00:27:28,604
It looks like this is from
the salon.

339
00:27:29,629 --> 00:27:30,767
It could be Lil.

340
00:27:32,282 --> 00:27:34,582
Let it go!... Sheriff!

341
00:27:34,608 --> 00:27:38,060
We need the guns in Deadwood.
There are no weapons.

342
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,393
We all heard the Captain!

343
00:27:40,704 --> 00:27:42,784
It will tell us where
the machine guns are.

344
00:27:43,005 --> 00:27:44,701
Did you say machine guns?

345
00:27:45,236 --> 00:27:47,220
He doesn't know what
he's talking about.

346
00:27:47,281 --> 00:27:49,283
Are two.
One for each end of the city.

347
00:27:49,384 --> 00:27:51,772
Because. This will prevent
the Indians from entering.

348
00:27:51,899 --> 00:27:54,100
It will take us to arms,
or will be dead,

349
00:27:54,126 --> 00:27:56,318
when the Indians arrive. Let me!

350
00:27:58,417 --> 00:27:59,733
It's not going anywhere!

351
00:28:03,356 --> 00:28:05,234
All people out!

352
00:28:07,684 --> 00:28:08,824
Thanks.

353
00:28:09,225 --> 00:28:11,685
You were at a disadvantage.
Come on, captain!

354
00:28:12,718 --> 00:28:14,041
Take her out of here.

355
00:28:16,666 --> 00:28:18,904
We need these weapons
and plan to have them.

356
00:28:19,711 --> 00:28:21,285
It looks like
I got you in trouble.

357
00:28:21,691 --> 00:28:23,415
We will meet back at the hotel.

358
00:28:24,023 --> 00:28:25,091
Not!

359
00:28:25,124 --> 00:28:28,135
We stay here.
Listen take it. Come on!

360
00:28:28,264 --> 00:28:29,968
We can take care
of these clowns.

361
00:28:33,036 --> 00:28:34,800
Are you on the side of the army?

362
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:37,929
The Army is the only thing
that can save our skin.

363
00:28:37,955 --> 00:28:41,451
Yes it's true. How Custer
and his boys saved their skins.

364
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:44,239
If it is, we will kill
for these machine guns

365
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:46,549
Even if they kill each other,
you mean.

366
00:29:00,116 --> 00:29:01,317
Captain!

367
00:29:02,905 --> 00:29:06,871
When he entered the hall, it was not
my intention to look at him that way.

368
00:29:08,744 --> 00:29:10,276
I answered the look, didn't I?

369
00:29:10,887 --> 00:29:13,550
For a moment,
I thought I knew him.

370
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:19,272
There is a Chinese
in the laundry that said,

371
00:29:19,993 --> 00:29:22,034
that I look like
with your husband.

372
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:28,634
No, I don't think so.

373
00:29:31,324 --> 00:29:33,436
Do I look like someone you know?

374
00:29:34,124 --> 00:29:35,705
Nobody I remember.

375
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:39,691
Ah! Weird!

376
00:29:41,126 --> 00:29:42,292
Charming!

377
00:29:43,438 --> 00:29:45,002
Two strangers.

378
00:29:46,116 --> 00:29:49,067
Who think they know each other.
Captain.

379
00:29:49,093 --> 00:29:51,498
When, I said I needed,

380
00:29:51,524 --> 00:29:55,828
to of the machine
guns, I was confused,

381
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:59,615
but when I said I needed them
to fight the Indians,

382
00:30:00,034 --> 00:30:03,035
then I realized that
the Army really needs them.

383
00:30:04,285 --> 00:30:05,612
Will you tell us where they are?

384
00:30:05,736 --> 00:30:09,197
Yes. They are buried near
the house where we lived.

385
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:13,236
They must be rusty by now.

386
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:16,025
They are wrapped in oily fabric.

387
00:30:16,268 --> 00:30:18,275
There are even four tripods.

388
00:30:22,796 --> 00:30:24,652
The population is all agitated.

389
00:30:24,678 --> 00:30:27,900
They think that machine guns
will solve all their problems.

390
00:30:27,929 --> 00:30:29,598
They don't care, with the army.

391
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:31,850
She told me where they are.
Where?

392
00:30:31,876 --> 00:30:34,577
As we were thinking near
the McCoys' house.

393
00:30:35,019 --> 00:30:38,890
We better saddle the horses.
I will get a cart in the meantime.

394
00:30:38,916 --> 00:30:41,252
Listen, you two,
dig up the weapons.

395
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,343
Maybe it's a good idea,
if I'm going to hit the ground so,

396
00:30:44,369 --> 00:30:47,196
to give the Army clues about
the location of the Indians. Wait!

397
00:30:47,222 --> 00:30:50,122
You're not going to walk the hills alone,
are you? It is my obligation.

398
00:30:50,936 --> 00:30:52,858
The machine guns are dismantled.

399
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,837
Do any of you know how
to assemble them?

400
00:30:56,424 --> 00:30:59,426
I can not.
I could try, but that's it.

401
00:30:59,452 --> 00:31:01,338
York, he's an expert, in arms.

402
00:31:02,897 --> 00:31:04,855
Ep, what do you think about the two
of us going to check out the hills?

403
00:31:04,881 --> 00:31:06,414
It seems that there is nothing
more to do in the city.

404
00:31:06,903 --> 00:31:09,414
Stop worrying, we are not going
to get in the middle of the Sioux.

405
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,848
We still want to keep our scalp.

406
00:31:10,873 --> 00:31:13,054
You can see their fires
in the distance.

407
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,109
Okay, but I suggest that you
take different directions.

408
00:31:16,135 --> 00:31:18,859
Ep...
you are going south...

409
00:31:18,966 --> 00:31:22,096
Do not say. I know.
North Right! So!

410
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:24,511
Hide the horses and the cart when
they return to the city.

411
00:31:24,537 --> 00:31:26,284
By then, I will have
the weapons assembled.

412
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,768
Aren't you going with her
to the ranch?

413
00:31:28,182 --> 00:31:29,992
Hmm...
maybe it's a good idea.

414
00:31:33,144 --> 00:31:36,438
Those hooligans,
out there we better get out the back.

415
00:31:36,464 --> 00:31:39,014
And we better get together first, Tom.
I'll give you some time.

416
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:43,016
We will meet before nightfall,
God willing for all of us.

417
00:31:50,977 --> 00:31:52,768
Captain,
and Lil are already coming here?

418
00:31:55,421 --> 00:31:57,318
I didn't know they were
at the hotel.

419
00:31:57,344 --> 00:31:59,414
Did you know, Smith?
I didn't know, either.

420
00:32:00,449 --> 00:32:04,368
You leave the key.
Why don't you go and see?

421
00:32:07,715 --> 00:32:10,553
Come on. Elkins?

422
00:32:14,272 --> 00:32:17,621
You were right, they were there.
I saw them going out the back.

423
00:32:18,004 --> 00:32:20,947
If we run,
well get the machine guns.

424
00:32:20,973 --> 00:32:22,003
Come on!

425
00:32:27,772 --> 00:32:29,153
We have company!

426
00:32:50,289 --> 00:32:52,593
If someone follows us
to the machine guns

427
00:32:52,894 --> 00:32:55,380
the whole city will know,
their location.

428
00:33:15,811 --> 00:33:17,167
The door is open

429
00:33:31,349 --> 00:33:32,482
Elkins!

430
00:33:33,694 --> 00:33:34,798
Elkins!

431
00:33:35,234 --> 00:33:36,777
Yes.
Did you get to see them?

432
00:33:36,802 --> 00:33:38,965
Yes, they came out from behind,
when we show up.

433
00:33:38,991 --> 00:33:40,133
Very smart!

434
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,920
We can go after them,
I have no better idea.

435
00:33:43,606 --> 00:33:45,658
They will take us,
to machine guns.

436
00:33:45,684 --> 00:33:47,184
We will follow them.

437
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:49,639
Make sure they don't
follow us this time.

438
00:34:08,749 --> 00:34:10,399
One less.
The other is already going.

439
00:34:12,438 --> 00:34:15,026
Are you sure you know how
to assemble them?

440
00:34:15,052 --> 00:34:16,499
I'll try to mount.

441
00:34:17,473 --> 00:34:20,322
After all, how was it that your husband,
obtained these weapons?

442
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:23,321
He and his partner, Red Sawyer,

443
00:34:23,347 --> 00:34:26,396
decided to buy weapons
at very low prices.

444
00:34:26,422 --> 00:34:27,761
They thought.

445
00:34:27,787 --> 00:34:30,537
It is the same as buying
a white elephant at a low price.

446
00:34:30,563 --> 00:34:32,671
They intended to sell them
to the army.

447
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:35,604
The army does not buy
second-hand equipment.

448
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,366
They realized that.

449
00:34:38,636 --> 00:34:42,419
These weapons are not brand new.
They were made in 1865,

450
00:34:42,445 --> 00:34:44,440
which was the year
that Catling changed the cylinders.

451
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,959
They used to accumulate gases,

452
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:50,636
in the barrel cylinders
and explode in the sniper's face.

453
00:34:52,357 --> 00:34:54,626
When they were unable
to sell them to the army,

454
00:34:55,215 --> 00:34:57,971
Sawyer made a deal to sell
to the Indians.

455
00:34:58,386 --> 00:35:00,902
My command did not allow him
to carry on this business.

456
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:06,504
They had a horrible argument.
My husband buried them.

457
00:35:06,532 --> 00:35:08,253
And Sawyer told the Indians,
that if they wanted to

458
00:35:08,279 --> 00:35:09,872
the guns had to get them
at the ranch.

459
00:35:09,906 --> 00:35:11,841
They really left them to us,
didn't they?

460
00:35:16,219 --> 00:35:17,793
Perhaps it would be
better not to kill him?

461
00:35:17,819 --> 00:35:20,027
He has already dug his
grave without the weapons.

462
00:35:20,398 --> 00:35:24,174
Take the machine guns
and leave him alone

463
00:35:24,818 --> 00:35:26,685
It has already
caused many problems.

464
00:35:27,504 --> 00:35:29,694
Weapons are useless
if they don't have ammunition.

465
00:35:29,784 --> 00:35:31,287
Check for ammo.

466
00:35:31,958 --> 00:35:34,142
What kind of projectile is used?

467
00:35:34,588 --> 00:35:37,187
58 caliber, special!

468
00:35:37,295 --> 00:35:38,567
They have to be there.

469
00:35:38,593 --> 00:35:41,084
No, they were not
buried with weapons.

470
00:35:41,446 --> 00:35:43,828
It makes no sense.
Yes it's true.

471
00:35:44,844 --> 00:35:46,633
Because
if the Indians found them,

472
00:35:46,908 --> 00:35:49,801
there would be no ammunition
so they would be useless

473
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:53,067
She must be right.
There is no ammunition here.

474
00:35:54,582 --> 00:35:56,357
Your husband thought
of everything.

475
00:35:58,264 --> 00:35:59,839
I will make a deal with you.

476
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,742
Leave the Captain alone.

477
00:36:03,415 --> 00:36:05,736
And I will tell you where
the ammunition is.

478
00:36:06,014 --> 00:36:07,904
Will say anyway.

479
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:11,528
When I'm done with you
will tell me everything

480
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,503
The Indians thought that,
but I didn't say anything to them.

481
00:36:19,106 --> 00:36:21,039
You are quite insensitive.

482
00:36:22,341 --> 00:36:25,704
If you are lying, tell your
Captain that we will be back

483
00:36:26,418 --> 00:36:29,034
and not only will we kill you,
but you will also

484
00:36:29,566 --> 00:36:31,272
Where are the ammunition?

485
00:36:32,776 --> 00:36:37,012
They are buried beside
the Court on East Front Street.

486
00:37:02,618 --> 00:37:03,899
Captain...

487
00:37:06,356 --> 00:37:07,561
Captain.

488
00:37:10,524 --> 00:37:11,760
Tom?

489
00:38:55,892 --> 00:38:58,275
Who is it? Smith.

490
00:39:09,496 --> 00:39:12,375
I had never seen so many Indian
bonfires in my life.

491
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:13,774
Did you go north?

492
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,308
I don't need a compass
to know where the North is.

493
00:39:17,236 --> 00:39:20,026
I do not know.
I saw many fires in the south.

494
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:28,986
The city is living hell.
They are looking for riots.

495
00:39:30,837 --> 00:39:32,528
Open the door

496
00:39:32,735 --> 00:39:35,281
Columbus Smith,
I saw him come in.

497
00:39:35,774 --> 00:39:37,935
Who is it? And Kane.

498
00:39:44,723 --> 00:39:45,833
Ep!

499
00:39:47,254 --> 00:39:50,337
Tell me, Kane, were you
the one who fired the shot?

500
00:39:50,363 --> 00:39:54,486
I shot in the air, to scare them.
These guys are looting the city.

501
00:39:57,056 --> 00:39:58,817
You don't seem to have
scared them too much.

502
00:39:59,018 --> 00:40:03,313
If we don't act rigorously, Deadwood
will be adrift, lawless and out of control.

503
00:40:03,339 --> 00:40:05,056
We have to stop them.

504
00:40:05,247 --> 00:40:07,914
The only thing we should stop
is the Indians on the hills.

505
00:40:08,025 --> 00:40:10,848
You have a civic duty
to help the city.

506
00:40:10,882 --> 00:40:12,100
To hell with the city!

507
00:40:12,204 --> 00:40:14,025
I have a greater duty
to the army!

508
00:40:16,142 --> 00:40:18,028
I hope you know
what you're doing.

509
00:40:19,301 --> 00:40:20,756
We expect the same.

510
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:31,230
I hate to take this cart.
The weapons are heavy, Smith.

511
00:40:31,523 --> 00:40:34,156
Yes, I know it will slow us down.
But let's go.

512
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:36,156
I will help you load.
It's ok.

513
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:08,478
Thank God!

514
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:12,334
I thought I would never
open my eyes again...

515
00:41:13,277 --> 00:41:14,893
Uh, of course.

516
00:41:15,962 --> 00:41:19,481
The way my head is hurting,
I think I was dying.

517
00:41:20,673 --> 00:41:23,017
Elkins and the other men tried
to kill him.

518
00:41:25,607 --> 00:41:27,631
Yes,
it's a shame that they didn't.

519
00:41:28,434 --> 00:41:30,129
Do not say that.

520
00:41:32,543 --> 00:41:35,418
I don't even have to ask about
the machine guns...

521
00:41:36,898 --> 00:41:37,945
They took them.

522
00:41:41,315 --> 00:41:44,037
Ep and Columbus Smith.

523
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,268
Ah!...

524
00:41:45,456 --> 00:41:49,202
Ah!... have they arrived yet?
Not me...

525
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:52,511
I didn't see them.
They should be here by now.

526
00:41:54,158 --> 00:41:57,800
I told Elkins where
the ammunition is.

527
00:41:59,274 --> 00:42:00,399
Because?

528
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:03,407
Was necessary.

529
00:42:04,525 --> 00:42:06,463
You told them not, to kill me.

530
00:42:07,049 --> 00:42:11,287
Many people died,
uselessly because of these weapons.

531
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:14,282
There will be many more deaths
if you do not recover them.

532
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:17,019
Wait, your friends will
help you find them.

533
00:42:17,045 --> 00:42:20,363
With every minute that passes...
There is no more hurry.

534
00:42:20,449 --> 00:42:22,986
It's raining and the attack,

535
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:27,743
Deawood is not immediate.
I know the Indians.

536
00:42:32,397 --> 00:42:36,155
I know what you're thinking.
I was thinking.

537
00:42:37,269 --> 00:42:41,150
I still haven't thanked you
for saving my life. Oh no!

538
00:42:44,439 --> 00:42:45,870
Are you wondering

539
00:42:46,752 --> 00:42:49,903
if there is anyone who knows about
the Indians, I am that person.

540
00:42:49,929 --> 00:42:51,899
No, no, Lil.
Do not torment yourself.

541
00:42:51,925 --> 00:42:54,398
You are right, I know them well.

542
00:42:56,048 --> 00:42:59,226
I managed to escape, finally.

543
00:42:59,932 --> 00:43:03,467
But she was someone else,
no longer a wife or a mother.

544
00:43:03,554 --> 00:43:08,178
Or...
the simple Ohio girl who had

545
00:43:08,204 --> 00:43:11,841
been and who had married
my husband.

546
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:13,625
Your husband...

547
00:43:15,568 --> 00:43:18,686
was a man who had
a dream right?

548
00:43:21,768 --> 00:43:25,090
And when the dream died,
I died...

549
00:43:26,234 --> 00:43:28,198
But now its night,

550
00:43:28,224 --> 00:43:30,543
the inhabitants
of the city have gone mad,

551
00:43:30,569 --> 00:43:33,375
with the idea that the Indians
would massacre them.

552
00:43:35,975 --> 00:43:40,187
I don't think I'm her anymore.
And you are not!

553
00:43:41,811 --> 00:43:44,569
I don't know who
I am or what I am...

554
00:43:46,145 --> 00:43:47,994
not even life, after all.

555
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:54,500
Life is nothing,
but an endless game.

556
00:43:55,724 --> 00:43:58,849
And I spend all my time making
the wrong combinations.

557
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:03,694
It may be, but that's over.

558
00:44:09,117 --> 00:44:10,629
Why did you say that?

559
00:44:12,342 --> 00:44:15,203
Is there anyone else who can do it?
Do not.

560
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,475
I'm tired of missing
combinations.

561
00:44:20,501 --> 00:44:22,093
Everybody is.
you are not the only one

562
00:44:22,612 --> 00:44:25,996
I am tired of pretending
that I am insensitive.

563
00:44:26,022 --> 00:44:28,095
It is not insensitive at all.

564
00:44:30,989 --> 00:44:33,800
So who am I? No Lil...

565
00:44:34,035 --> 00:44:35,782
No, no.

566
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:39,556
If you're thinking about kissing me,
I don't even know what that is anymore.

567
00:44:39,946 --> 00:44:41,153
Lil...

568
00:45:08,316 --> 00:45:10,437
Has the Captain set up
the machine guns yet?

569
00:45:10,781 --> 00:45:13,223
Gone. They were stolen
a few hours ago.

570
00:45:13,308 --> 00:45:16,228
Were they ambushed?
There were four men.

571
00:45:16,427 --> 00:45:18,797
I recognized one of them,
it was Elkins.

572
00:45:19,709 --> 00:45:21,882
What about the captain?
Was he kidnapped or what?

573
00:45:21,908 --> 00:45:24,261
No. He...
he went out a while ago.

574
00:45:24,645 --> 00:45:27,976
She must turn the city
upside down to take up arms.

575
00:45:28,066 --> 00:45:31,470
The ammunition was
buried next to the court.

576
00:45:31,496 --> 00:45:33,255
He said he would go first.

577
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,144
Lil keeps an eye on
the horses, fine.

578
00:45:35,169 --> 00:45:37,523
The best you can do
is stick around.

579
00:45:37,549 --> 00:45:39,756
They blocked the two
entrances to the city.

580
00:45:40,202 --> 00:45:44,234
Damn you who don't realize that there
are many ways to get into the city.

581
00:45:44,385 --> 00:45:47,262
The Sitting Bull knows them all.
I'm sure of it.

582
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:49,335
I believe so.

583
00:45:49,676 --> 00:45:52,054
They don't know that the Sitting Bull
is going to get around the barriers.

584
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:56,267
And I'll tell you something, if you're
crazy enough to get back to roulette,

585
00:45:56,292 --> 00:45:59,213
you will enter a bar full of hyenas,
drunk and scared.

586
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:04,466
I think today,
we're all pretty scared.

587
00:46:39,175 --> 00:46:41,439
Lil told us the story of Elkins
and his friends.

588
00:46:42,057 --> 00:46:43,654
They even have the ammunition.

589
00:46:44,804 --> 00:46:47,826
Elkins has a freight company.
Maybe we can find him there.

590
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:50,417
Perhaps...

591
00:46:51,198 --> 00:46:53,094
but unless he knows,
what are you doing,

592
00:46:53,296 --> 00:46:56,790
or it will take a long time
to assemble the weapons.

593
00:46:57,161 --> 00:46:58,934
He doesn't know that we know.

594
00:46:59,426 --> 00:47:01,461
This means that he
is waiting for us.

595
00:47:01,597 --> 00:47:04,968
EIkins will regret not killing me.
Because?

596
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:07,835
We can mount machine guns,
we can't.

597
00:47:08,236 --> 00:47:10,413
What if he has already
assembled them?

598
00:47:10,996 --> 00:47:13,931
So, we have 58 Caliber
for breakfast.

599
00:47:24,587 --> 00:47:25,724
There he is!

600
00:47:27,141 --> 00:47:28,254
Ep!

601
00:47:28,556 --> 00:47:30,872
See if you can get there
and get in the back.

602
00:47:30,898 --> 00:47:34,051
Smith, come over there
and appear from the side.

603
00:47:34,077 --> 00:47:35,126
It's ok!

604
00:47:43,003 --> 00:47:45,954
Hey Elkins!
You better hurry up. Elkins.

605
00:47:46,569 --> 00:47:48,811
Want to try it yourself?

606
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:18,703
Don't shoot! Do not shot.
We surrender! Let's go out.

607
00:49:54,314 --> 00:49:55,406
Captain!

608
00:49:56,734 --> 00:49:59,161
We need the damn weapons
at Deadwood!

609
00:50:00,054 --> 00:50:01,928
If we take them,
to the Army in time,

610
00:50:02,995 --> 00:50:05,303
the Indians will
not approach Deadwood.

611
00:50:05,329 --> 00:50:06,597
That's what you say.

612
00:50:06,623 --> 00:50:10,155
We don't believe that.
The guns are here, in Deadwood!

613
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:25,891
Have you ever been in front
of a machine gun before?

614
00:50:27,194 --> 00:50:29,503
This weapon is not complete.

615
00:50:30,982 --> 00:50:33,456
It is mounted enough
to make holes in your body.

616
00:50:36,189 --> 00:50:37,835
As I already said, Captain.

617
00:50:38,427 --> 00:50:40,664
We will not allow to take
Deadwood machine guns lightly!

618
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:42,307
None of them!

619
00:50:43,267 --> 00:50:48,250
You, Ep Wyatt and Columbus Smith
are going to have to fight the city.

620
00:50:53,533 --> 00:50:56,792
I believe him.
I think you better believe that.

621
00:50:57,159 --> 00:50:59,538
He will return,
with a raging crowd.

622
00:51:01,252 --> 00:51:05,226
Maybe I can make a foul in time.
You mean, its not working?

623
00:51:06,121 --> 00:51:08,251
You should see him bluff
in a poker game.

624
00:51:08,345 --> 00:51:09,835
I'll get the horses.

625
00:51:10,929 --> 00:51:13,882
A weapon will not destroy,
the entire city.

626
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:17,045
They will not let you out
of town with machine guns.

627
00:51:17,497 --> 00:51:19,702
These weapons will have
no use for them.

628
00:51:19,819 --> 00:51:21,560
One at each end of the city,

629
00:51:21,731 --> 00:51:25,269
the Indians do not attack like
that they will surround the city.

630
00:51:25,657 --> 00:51:27,313
Don't get me wrong,
Captain.

631
00:51:27,339 --> 00:51:31,634
I'm on your side, I agree.
The Army that fights with the Indians.

632
00:51:31,848 --> 00:51:34,784
But can you take
the weapons in time?

633
00:51:35,354 --> 00:51:36,858
We will try, for sure.

634
00:51:40,266 --> 00:51:43,709
Why aren't you running away in fear?
I'm scared to death.

635
00:51:44,681 --> 00:51:46,516
I'm just not running away.

636
00:51:49,181 --> 00:51:53,496
We have to hurry, Captain.
I'll get the cart.

637
00:51:56,105 --> 00:51:58,872
You said that Gatling
had trouble marketing this model.

638
00:51:59,352 --> 00:52:00,807
After he invented it,

639
00:52:01,259 --> 00:52:03,732
the factory was destroyed by fire
and had to start over.

640
00:52:03,758 --> 00:52:05,175
That was in 1862.

641
00:52:05,491 --> 00:52:07,915
Then they produced machine guns,
in time for the war.

642
00:52:08,368 --> 00:52:11,964
It was never used even though Gatling
wrote to Lincoln.

643
00:52:12,833 --> 00:52:15,201
Old Abraham,
never made many mistakes.

644
00:52:15,227 --> 00:52:16,894
Several of his
generals committed.

645
00:52:17,582 --> 00:52:19,429
The Gatling machine gun
appeared in North Carolina.

646
00:52:19,455 --> 00:52:22,619
They feared that he might have
the sympathy of the Confederates.

647
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,536
They assumed that if they hired him,
to manufacture the machine guns,

648
00:52:26,915 --> 00:52:29,958
he would then organize
an attack to steal them.

649
00:52:30,291 --> 00:52:32,847
They would be in the line of fire,
with the weapons they bought and paid for.

650
00:52:32,873 --> 00:52:35,620
We have to get the machine guns back.
If we don't, we will be dead.

651
00:52:35,651 --> 00:52:38,628
Gather the Massev brothers
and evacuate the bars,

652
00:52:38,654 --> 00:52:41,590
we will gather a crowd.
We need to recover the weapons.

653
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:42,765
Let's get them!...

654
00:52:45,907 --> 00:52:48,430
Captain, the crowd is arriving
at any moment.

655
00:52:49,808 --> 00:52:52,269
Where are they?
Where are the what?

656
00:52:52,324 --> 00:52:54,257
Both weapons are missing
cylinders.

657
00:52:54,291 --> 00:52:56,329
We will reload them and pick
them up, on the way.

658
00:52:56,355 --> 00:52:57,766
It's no use.

659
00:52:58,003 --> 00:52:59,985
Without cylinders,
weapons will not work.

660
00:53:00,036 --> 00:53:02,042
There is no point fighting
for weapons that don't work.

661
00:53:02,488 --> 00:53:03,604
Tom!

662
00:53:09,813 --> 00:53:13,974
I looked for you everywhere.
I heard you were here.

663
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,742
Did you hear that they were after of us?
They are really coming.

664
00:53:17,767 --> 00:53:20,324
Well not only hid it,
the ammunition elsewhere,

665
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:23,081
but it also hid
the cylinders elsewhere.

666
00:53:25,727 --> 00:53:27,607
Wow! What a beautiful memory.

667
00:53:28,018 --> 00:53:31,059
Well, it's not worth having the guns,
if they don't work.

668
00:53:31,147 --> 00:53:33,796
You're absolutely right.
We are back in action.

669
00:53:34,232 --> 00:53:38,030
Is everything loaded? All ready.
Turn around. That's it.

670
00:53:41,998 --> 00:53:43,577
What a strange way
to say goodbye.

671
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:46,872
We had a strange arrival,
didn't we?

672
00:53:54,021 --> 00:53:56,917
Ep, if you ever go back,
to Deadwood.

673
00:53:57,501 --> 00:54:00,872
Try your luck at roulette.
Of course yes.

674
00:54:38,305 --> 00:54:39,907
There, in those woods.

675
00:54:40,191 --> 00:54:42,700
This is what the Sitting Bull calls
the first perimeter.

676
00:54:42,726 --> 00:54:46,485
I was there last night.
Warriors watch over the city.

677
00:54:46,664 --> 00:54:49,682
I found the same thing
on the other side.

678
00:54:50,232 --> 00:54:53,775
How did they get through?
There are only a few Indians here.

679
00:54:53,853 --> 00:54:57,072
The main battalion is miles away,
waiting for the army.

680
00:54:57,098 --> 00:54:58,905
I walked between the guard posts,

681
00:54:58,964 --> 00:55:00,971
but it was dark
and I was riding a horse.

682
00:55:00,997 --> 00:55:02,747
This is different.

683
00:55:02,989 --> 00:55:05,618
I'll go ahead and attract them,
on this path.

684
00:55:05,644 --> 00:55:06,804
I think I better go with you.

685
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,016
Wait a minute, they'll be in the middle
of a battle. This is the idea.

686
00:55:10,042 --> 00:55:12,051
Keep them busy so you
can go with the cart.

687
00:55:12,077 --> 00:55:14,608
They will attract many warriors.
If they took the machine guns.

688
00:55:14,634 --> 00:55:18,236
I can't take them on horseback.
So said Custer.

689
00:55:18,443 --> 00:55:20,349
Machine guns are holding us
back from the city.

690
00:55:20,863 --> 00:55:22,119
Besides that...

691
00:55:22,458 --> 00:55:26,804
when they fire they wake up, all the
Indians within a radius of kilometers.

692
00:55:26,838 --> 00:55:28,431
And I'm going to tell you
something, partner,

693
00:55:28,457 --> 00:55:30,118
it's better not to shoot unless
it's necessary.

694
00:55:30,146 --> 00:55:31,924
Good luck, Smith. Thanks!

695
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:27,454
I don't think I gave Columbus
enough time for him to pass.

696
00:57:31,872 --> 00:57:33,209
In fact, you didn't.

697
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:55,058
He belonged to Custer's regiment.
It belonged.

698
00:59:06,002 --> 00:59:09,355
I think it's as close as two people
can get in without losing their scalp.

699
00:59:09,381 --> 00:59:11,391
Well, at least we left
the perimeter.

700
00:59:11,417 --> 00:59:13,791
Now,
let's cross the Sioux Nation.

701
00:59:14,541 --> 00:59:16,737
How long does it take,
to put the wheel back?

702
00:59:16,763 --> 00:59:18,626
Depending
on the help you receive

703
00:59:23,965 --> 00:59:25,838
Bring the ammo box.
It's ok.

704
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:28,961
Are you ready?

705
00:59:30,078 --> 00:59:33,486
Wait a second. We can put it now.
It's all right...

706
00:59:35,366 --> 00:59:38,555
you can go down.
Now turn this over.

707
00:59:40,751 --> 00:59:45,079
You told Kane that whoever
invented this weapon was a rebel.

708
00:59:45,437 --> 00:59:47,459
No. Dick Catling
was totally neutral,

709
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:51,877
but when the Yankees generals
were convinced the war was over.

710
00:59:52,094 --> 00:59:54,458
Come on.
Come and help me, right?

711
00:59:57,734 --> 01:00:00,047
It's done!... Enough is in place.

712
01:00:00,174 --> 01:00:03,587
Oh well!...
Ep, help me with this gun.

713
01:00:09,169 --> 01:00:10,583
It seems to me
that all fractions,

714
01:00:10,609 --> 01:00:12,818
I would have needed those "girls".
Of course yes.

715
01:00:13,032 --> 01:00:16,100
Older models fired 50 bullets,
per minute.

716
01:00:17,038 --> 01:00:20,283
These are the 1865 models.
They fire more shots.

717
01:00:21,452 --> 01:00:24,741
What about the latest models! The ones
Custer didn't want to take with him?

718
01:00:24,767 --> 01:00:26,054
They're even better.

719
01:00:26,104 --> 01:00:29,655
But the old Yellow Hair was
too busy trying to be a hero.

720
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:32,309
And perhaps they would have been,
if he had taken the machine guns.

721
01:00:35,822 --> 01:00:39,248
I think everything is in order.
Let's move.

722
01:00:39,739 --> 01:00:42,433
In this type of terrain we will pass,
the time spoiling the wheels.

723
01:00:42,625 --> 01:00:44,470
Let's go as soon as possible!

724
01:00:45,581 --> 01:00:47,318
If you run aground,
it won't be too fast.

725
01:01:14,499 --> 01:01:16,759
This wheel will not take it,
much longer.

726
01:01:49,352 --> 01:01:50,571
Advance!

727
01:02:14,164 --> 01:02:15,339
A war group.

728
01:02:16,162 --> 01:02:18,691
We have reached
the crucial point of the Sioux.

729
01:02:19,655 --> 01:02:22,171
The secret is to go unnoticed.

730
01:02:23,402 --> 01:02:25,023
The secret is in getting,

731
01:02:25,182 --> 01:02:27,612
arriving is a broken wagon
to the Arrow Point Peninsula.

732
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:30,096
Unless the plans have changed,

733
01:02:30,122 --> 01:02:32,969
Battalions A and H must be
arriving in this Zone.

734
01:02:33,209 --> 01:02:36,957
Do you think you can convince them
to meet there and take a stand?

735
01:02:37,211 --> 01:02:40,197
With the help of a battalion
of soldiers from the fort.

736
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:44,722
Battalions A and H and soldiers from
the fort don't know about your plans.

737
01:02:45,248 --> 01:02:47,405
After we hid the weapons
at Arrow Point,

738
01:02:47,667 --> 01:02:50,437
Ep and I are going to meet with
the troop commanders to alert them.

739
01:02:51,243 --> 01:02:53,655
You go to Fort Bastion,
pick up soldiers.

740
01:02:53,681 --> 01:02:55,447
I hate to talk about it,
Captain!

741
01:02:55,473 --> 01:02:57,864
But Arrow Point, is in the middle
of Sioux territory.

742
01:02:58,267 --> 01:03:00,866
It is more or less the same
situation that Custer had to face.

743
01:03:02,315 --> 01:03:04,070
You know this is what I like,

744
01:03:04,567 --> 01:03:06,428
you always have something positive
on the tip of your tongue.

745
01:03:41,534 --> 01:03:44,553
It would be a shame to take this,
for a single war.

746
01:03:44,798 --> 01:03:46,941
Yes. We would have
the Sitting Bull, above us.

747
01:03:46,967 --> 01:03:49,250
Hopefully it is not necessary.
Come on.

748
01:03:49,276 --> 01:03:52,232
There is still much?
I'm afraid there are 8 or 9 km to go.

749
01:04:26,910 --> 01:04:27,993
Indians!

750
01:06:16,286 --> 01:06:17,458
Will they come back?

751
01:06:18,491 --> 01:06:22,322
Yes, a million friends with feathers.
Let's get out of here.

752
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:52,792
I went fishing
at Arrow Point once.

753
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:55,534
Hopefully thats what
were going to do,

754
01:06:55,641 --> 01:06:56,959
with Gatling machine guns.

755
01:07:09,312 --> 01:07:12,976
Both are ready to act.
The problem is in attracting the Indians.

756
01:07:13,186 --> 01:07:14,450
I hope this plan works.

757
01:07:14,476 --> 01:07:16,769
I would like to try
the machine guns on the Indians.

758
01:07:16,891 --> 01:07:18,175
It's ok. Go to the fort.

759
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:19,972
Do you know the way?
Yes I know.

760
01:07:20,003 --> 01:07:23,205
You go further.
Take my horse. It's ok.

761
01:07:23,238 --> 01:07:26,121
Battalion H must be very close by.
In the Southwest.

762
01:07:28,929 --> 01:07:31,514
What about battalion A?
South-west,

763
01:07:31,715 --> 01:07:34,079
across the river,
a few hills from here.?

764
01:07:34,191 --> 01:07:37,801
If you can stay high,
you can see them. Tom...

765
01:07:38,228 --> 01:07:40,893
You know, of course,
that there are Indians across the river

766
01:07:41,107 --> 01:07:42,575
and along those hills.

767
01:07:44,598 --> 01:07:46,385
What are you trying to say?
Bye!...

768
01:07:49,730 --> 01:07:51,799
Weve said goodbye before.

769
01:08:04,943 --> 01:08:06,556
Hey. Smith? Say it.

770
01:08:06,882 --> 01:08:08,892
When you return,
from the fort with the soldiers...

771
01:08:10,507 --> 01:08:11,688
Let's go fishing.

772
01:08:13,573 --> 01:08:16,035
It's the first time, that I'm going,
in a fishery where I am the bait.

773
01:12:35,247 --> 01:12:37,444
Hei today... Hei today!

774
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:42,667
Hei, today!...

775
01:12:43,731 --> 01:12:45,648
Company, loud!

776
01:12:55,993 --> 01:12:59,588
Captain York! Are you, sir?
What the hell are you doing here?

777
01:13:00,594 --> 01:13:03,137
Where's the rest of your battalion?
They camped farther away.

778
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:06,264
If they are further ahead,
what are they doing here?

779
01:13:06,290 --> 01:13:11,071
We are checking the terrain,
there are Indians everywhere.

780
01:13:11,922 --> 01:13:13,800
We are completely surrounded.

781
01:13:14,766 --> 01:13:17,954
Well, as General Custer once said,
"a man must die with his boots on".

782
01:13:19,135 --> 01:13:20,882
This is exactly what he did.

783
01:13:22,356 --> 01:13:23,740
That was not funny, Captain.

784
01:13:24,488 --> 01:13:27,303
I know it wasn't.
But it is the truth.

785
01:13:30,977 --> 01:13:32,915
The remaining hope is
that the 7th Cavalry

786
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:35,414
it would be enough to get us
out of this situation.

787
01:13:35,619 --> 01:13:38,976
So we were checking the terrain,
we were looking for General Custer.

788
01:13:39,012 --> 01:13:40,090
Lieutenant,

789
01:13:40,315 --> 01:13:42,862
take your men across
the river at Arrow Point.

790
01:13:43,104 --> 01:13:46,831
Captain, if we go in any direction,
the Indians are falling on us.

791
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:49,408
We have two Gatling guns
at Arrow Point.

792
01:13:51,671 --> 01:13:52,802
I understand!...

793
01:13:53,377 --> 01:13:55,127
The captain needs a horse,
you two ride

794
01:13:55,153 --> 01:13:56,574
on the same horse,
until we get to the battalion.

795
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:59,451
Let's get the men together, Captain
and let's go quickly to Arrow Point.

796
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:04,203
Company, move forward!...

797
01:14:16,690 --> 01:14:19,385
Let's move faster!...

798
01:14:34,580 --> 01:14:36,634
Attack, attack, attack!...

799
01:14:48,101 --> 01:14:50,690
Ahead, march!

800
01:16:09,109 --> 01:16:10,377
Disassemble!

801
01:16:10,491 --> 01:16:12,750
Take cover quickly!

802
01:16:15,351 --> 01:16:18,255
Hey, you two!
Hurry with that gun! Quickly!

803
01:16:20,303 --> 01:16:22,502
Captain, allow a civilian
to fight with us.

804
01:16:22,891 --> 01:16:25,402
And you better ask him,
if he will allow us to fight him.

805
01:16:27,975 --> 01:16:31,080
Hide behind the rocks!
Quickly! Quickly!

806
01:16:35,307 --> 01:16:36,576
Here they come!

807
01:16:53,696 --> 01:16:55,820
Hide, yes? Go there!

808
01:17:00,556 --> 01:17:03,063
Where are the soldiers in the fort?
Do not come.

809
01:17:03,167 --> 01:17:06,208
Colombus did not survive,
we saw his body on the way back

810
01:19:29,857 --> 01:19:32,412
And the most beautiful sight
I have ever seen.

811
01:19:33,036 --> 01:19:36,551
Yes, it is a pity that Custer
was unable to see her.

812
01:19:37,429 --> 01:19:39,134
Or Columbus Smith.

813
01:19:42,086 --> 01:19:45,479
You know, Captain, I just thought,
that you were a dead man.

814
01:19:45,513 --> 01:19:48,511
We all died!
Do you know what I think?

815
01:19:51,042 --> 01:19:55,389
This could be the starting point,
in the war against the Sioux tribe.

816
01:19:57,417 --> 01:19:58,800
I hope you're right.

817
01:20:17,610 --> 01:20:21,427
All right, gentlemen's,
place your bets.

818
01:20:22,267 --> 01:20:23,742
No one else!

819
01:20:25,028 --> 01:20:26,959
Number 17.

820
01:20:32,172 --> 01:20:34,295
Never stop a game of chance.

821
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:37,670
The game of chance
that can last a lifetime.

822
01:20:37,954 --> 01:20:39,838
I mean, the rest of your life.

823
01:20:42,527 --> 01:20:43,770
Gentlemen's...

824
01:20:44,569 --> 01:20:46,639
this game is over.

825
01:21:05,675 --> 01:21:08,016
You heard the lady,
this game is over.

826
01:21:11,157 --> 01:21:12,828
Come on, I'll buy you a beer.

827
01:21:17,355 --> 01:21:21,555
"FIM"
