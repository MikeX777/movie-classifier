1
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,710
You alive in there?

2
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,349
Yeah.

3
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,115
You're 15 minutes late, Lefty.

4
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,778
Dale's looking for you,

5
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,857
and he's more pissed than usual.

6
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,520
- You hear what I said?
- Yeah. I'm coming.

7
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:07,197
- Hey.
- What?

8
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,196
Thanks for making me late.

9
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:13,898
Gee, I'm sorry.
My boss, who pays me,

10
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,304
wanted me to do something.

11
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,706
Next time I'll tell him I work for Lefty.

12
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,907
Hey, princess.

13
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:57,277
When you're done putting your makeup on,

14
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:59,408
get your royal behind in my office.

15
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,326
Say, Dale, I'm gonna need
an extended lunch today,

16
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:22,094
seeing as I got a meeting
with my wife's lawyers.

17
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,669
You must be joking.

18
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:26,270
No, Dale, I'm not.

19
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,532
Now, I know that you're...

20
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,801
Come on, Lefty.
What's wrong with you?

21
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:33,401
Am I nuts, or did we have
a conversation yesterday?

22
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:36,448
What wasn't clear about what I said, Lefty?

23
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,609
Didn't I warn you
that was the last time?

24
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,209
We talked about it.

25
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,289
What else can I do for you?

26
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,050
I got you the promotion.

27
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:47,888
Nobody else thought it was a good idea,
but I pushed it,

28
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:50,258
and you thank me
by being late every day since.

29
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,593
Every day. How is that possible?

30
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,834
You think this is funny?

31
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,630
I can't believe I wasted my time on you.

32
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,503
Look, Dale...

33
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,133
I appreciate the promotion.

34
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,643
I do.

35
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,042
But you gotta understand.

36
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:08,807
Now that I'm making more money,

37
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:12,646
I'll admit I've been partying a little bit more.

38
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,811
But that will not...

39
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,388
affect my work.

40
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,885
Please tell me you're not that stupid.

41
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,320
I gave you a promotion.
You didn't get a raise.

42
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:27,492
Assistant Production Line
Supervisor?

43
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,897
It doesn't mean a thing.

44
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,333
It's just a name.

45
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,234
I did it for your custody case

46
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:35,705
because I knew it'd look good
for the judge and your kids.

47
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:38,436
But you... you take that...
that... that charity,

48
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,671
and you blow it up in my face.

49
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,248
I'm not blind. I know you're drinking again.

50
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,179
You're hopeless, Lefty.

51
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,914
Sucks to hear it, I know,
but somebody needs to tell you.

52
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,916
I'm sorry, man.

53
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,085
I gotta do it.

54
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,389
Now, Dale, before you go
and do something stupid,

55
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,193
you really ought to think about it.

56
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,464
I mean, this place would
shut down without me.

57
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,730
Who else is gonna go out there

58
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:08,102
and change all those belts on the line?

59
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,611
Anyone with opposable thumbs.

60
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,211
Playtime's over.
Clear out your locker and go home.

61
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,218
You're fired.

62
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,447
An escort will walk you to your car.

63
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:24,955
Now, Dale...

64
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,116
Go home, Lefty.

65
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,594
Hi, Jacob.
How you doing, buddy?

66
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:37,958
Hi, Mary.

67
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,588
- You doing okay?
- Fine, thanks.

68
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,462
- You?
- Seriously.

69
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:43,969
You doing all right?

70
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,300
As good as can be expected.

71
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,874
Seriously.

72
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,743
I love you, Jacob. You be good.

73
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:55,836
Love you.

74
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,609
His juice box is in his backpack.

75
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,446
He'll try to tell you
I forgot to give him one...

76
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,110
Got it.

77
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,051
Hey, you know
these seats are adjustable.

78
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,145
Oh, yeah.

79
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,122
This is the way Rick liked it, though,

80
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:09,217
so... I just, um...

81
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:10,295
you know.

82
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:11,988
Yeah.

83
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,065
Okay.

84
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,235
- See you at 3.
- I'll see you at 3. Bye.

85
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,241
Pump one.

86
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,867
This plus 20 bucks on 2.

87
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,436
21.05.

88
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:08,053
Problem?

89
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,187
No, it's really good, actually.

90
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:26,865
Where's Security?

91
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:29,567
The least they could do
is have Security take me out.

92
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,235
Security's got sensitivity training today.

93
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,075
Yeah, well, this isn't very sensitive.

94
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,546
Yes.

95
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:37,946
Go home, Lefty.

96
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,647
It's kinda hard when you're standing
in the middle of my living room.

97
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,650
Yes. Good luck, buddy.

98
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,039
Hey!

99
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,334
Got a fiver?

100
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,170
Just till payday?

101
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,021
I'll show you playtime, Dale.

102
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,328
<i>...to consider the feelings of the violator,</i>

103
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:33,564
<i>at least on par with</i>
<i>those of the violated.</i>

104
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,971
<i>We mustn't forget,</i>
<i>before they were perpetrators,</i>

105
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,872
<i>they were victims themselves.</i>

106
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,376
<i>So they are hurting individuals,</i>

107
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:41,139
<i>deserving of our empathy, concern,</i>

108
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,715
<i>and, yes, our love and compassion.</i>

109
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:45,579
<i>Perhaps you can ask, them, brother...</i>

110
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:46,811
<i>or sister...</i>

111
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,079
<i>if... if they're comfortable with that,</i>

112
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:49,779
<i>"Why is it that you felt compelled</i>

113
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,720
<i>to take what did not belong to you?"</i>

114
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:16,572
It's prepay only.

115
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:18,616
I don't care what day it is.

116
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:21,812
I guess that would explain the sign
right in front of my eyes

117
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,149
that says "Prepay only," huh?

118
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,093
It kind of sucks working today, huh?

119
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:32,095
Christmas Eve and all?

120
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,963
Working Christmas Eve. No fun.

121
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:38,730
Oh. Yeah. I guess.

122
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,271
Boss gave you the raw deal.

123
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:41,567
You're looking at him.

124
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:45,903
Then why the heck
are you working today?

125
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:48,845
Kid didn't show up today.
Called in sick this morning.

126
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,506
What else am I going to do?

127
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:51,981
Kids aren't the most
dependable creatures.

128
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:53,984
20 bucks on 2.

129
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:56,350
So you even have
to be open today?

130
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:57,854
Chug-a-Lug and Neighbor Mart
are closed.

131
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,687
It would be stupid to pass up
the Christmas Eve rush.

132
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,386
Oh. Yeah.

133
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,657
27.01.

134
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:11,961
Thank you.

135
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:14,397
Merry Christmas.

136
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:16,839
Yep.

137
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:20,442
Hello?

138
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:23,413
Uh, is, uh... I was...

139
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,814
Is this the walk-in clinic?

140
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:27,385
Oh, good.

141
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:29,920
I was afraid I had the wrong number
for a minute.

142
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:33,958
Um, um, l... I saw Dr. Lyndel yesterday,

143
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,459
and I'm... I'm a little confused

144
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,620
about some of the medications he gave me.

145
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,630
I think I need a little help w...

146
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:42,394
Uh, yeah, I can wait, okay.

147
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:47,197
Uh, hi. This is Eva Boyle.

148
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:49,934
Yeah, I saw Dr. Lyndel last week,

149
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:53,068
and I was wanting to...

150
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,209
I wasn't expecting you, Dr. Lyndel.

151
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,817
What...

152
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,443
No. Uh...

153
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,816
I know it was yesterday.

154
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,389
I told that woman that.

155
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,321
Anyway, I know you told me

156
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:08,916
to take some medications
in the morning

157
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:11,826
and some in the afternoon...

158
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,956
I did?

159
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:18,963
I did. I wrote it down right here.

160
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,768
Oh. Now I do feel silly.

161
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,673
Well, uh, which...

162
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:26,710
Uh-huh.

163
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:28,837
Yeah, the... Oh.

164
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,040
The red with the red

165
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:31,673
and the yellow with the yellow.

166
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:34,343
Thank you so much.

167
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:37,752
L... I know I wasted your time,

168
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,688
but I just remember
your telling me

169
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,123
that I need to be careful

170
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:44,196
which ones I took
with which and when.

171
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,690
Thank you.

172
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,961
Merry Christmas to you, too, Doctor.

173
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:51,468
Thank you.

174
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,561
Ah, Mitch. Putting the music together.

175
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:20,359
Hey, Pastor Mark.
Yeah, I'm almost done.

176
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,401
I put these packets together
for you to give out.

177
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:26,403
There's a card, a Christmas CD,

178
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:29,201
and 20 bucks in each one.

179
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,208
Isn't this kind of insulting?

180
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,641
No. I don't think so.

181
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,440
I want to give them
something they need

182
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,414
rather than some kind of tree ornament
or a candy cane or something.

183
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:39,984
I'm just not sure
how they're going to take it.

184
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:43,612
L... I gather you're not,
uh, excited about tonight?

185
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,656
Not tremendously, no.

186
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,783
I mean, we're talking about
high school students here.

187
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:50,623
The last thing they want to do
is go caroling for old people.

188
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:52,321
I mean, it's not 1948 anymore.

189
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:53,989
Fair enough, Mitch,

190
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:57,967
but maybe I'm not too concerned
about what they and you want to do.

191
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:02,370
Not every act of service is a joyride.

192
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,103
Is this about, uh, what day it is?

193
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:09,238
I know the accident
was a year ago tonight.

194
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,372
Maybe, I guess.

195
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,350
You know, this can be good for you.

196
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:18,014
Most of the people
you're visiting tonight are shut-ins.

197
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:20,853
You're the only person
they're going to see over the holidays.

198
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,258
Others, they haven't
been here for a while.

199
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,660
They're not sure if the church
still cares about them.

200
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:27,755
Yeah. We've been through this.

201
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,768
Well, let me put it in another way.

202
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,567
Not everything with the kids
has to be cool or hip.

203
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:37,972
It's good for them to just do
some ministry once in a while.

204
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,910
I don't... I don't know.
Man, I'm just feeling...

205
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:45,108
I feel like I'm up against a wall
with some of these kids.

206
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,775
I mean, they're all great. It's just...

207
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,717
They haven't decided
if I'm worth listening to,

208
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:51,619
and I'm afraid this sort of thing
is gonna push them over the line,

209
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,056
and... and once they're on the other side,

210
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,990
just bury me and hire
a new seminary grad.

211
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,393
At least you're overly dramatic.

212
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:00,328
I'm sure they can identify with that.

213
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:01,729
Okay.

214
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,166
You want them to decide
you're worth listening to?

215
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,135
Be worth listening to.

216
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,728
Show them a faith

217
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,367
that makes you want
to do stuff like this.

218
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,137
See you at the services later.

219
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,544
All right. Later.

220
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:19,447
Oh, and, Mitch...

221
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:23,419
technically, old people are still people.

222
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:24,921
I'm not sure that's true,

223
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:27,424
but I'll look it up on the Internet later.

224
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:28,686
Yeah, do that.

225
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,154
Lucio Boyle?

226
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,130
Don't get up.
I'm Gordon Macintosh.

227
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:09,791
I'll be working with Samantha

228
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,302
representing your ex-wife
from here on out.

229
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:13,735
I know you two have met,

230
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,739
and this is Greg, our file clerk.

231
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,001
Lefty.

232
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,509
Excuse me?

233
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:22,512
His nickname. Cute as it is,

234
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:24,047
we won't be using it today.

235
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,207
I'm sure you'll understand.

236
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,511
I'll call you back.

237
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,548
Everyone calls me Lefty.

238
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,459
Of course they do.

239
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:40,759
If my parents
had named me Lu...

240
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:43,027
I'm a lefty, too. Born that way.

241
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:48,638
Oh, in my case, it's a little weird
'cause I'm not even left-handed.

242
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:52,040
Uh, where is your representation?

243
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:53,202
My lawyer and I,

244
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:55,906
we don't see eye to eye
on a few things, so...

245
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,846
You don't have a lawyer.

246
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,542
Right.

247
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:01,881
Anyways, when I was growing up as a kid,

248
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:03,818
we didn't have a whole lot of money,

249
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:06,891
so every time I wanted to play ball,

250
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:10,484
I had to borrow my brother's
left-handed baseball glove,

251
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:13,929
and because of that
I really wasn't any good,

252
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,126
and all the kids that I played with,

253
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,703
they didn't know I was right-handed,

254
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:22,706
so they just thought that, uh...

255
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:25,333
well, they just thought
that I wasn't any good.

256
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,710
All rightie.

257
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:31,408
Greg, we need mochas.

258
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:32,814
Mr. Boyle,

259
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:36,251
you realize you have a right
to have representation with you,

260
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:40,724
and since you've chosen
not to have counsel at this hearing,

261
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:44,626
you waive all rights to such protection
as would be provided by state statutes

262
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,290
regarding said representation.

263
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,861
You're okay with not
having a lawyer here.

264
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,037
Right.

265
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:55,697
Good.

266
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:57,639
Then I'll speak my mind.

267
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,870
I advised the court against this.

268
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:01,809
I think you're a terrible father,

269
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:02,972
and I don't think...

270
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,245
I think what Miss Lewis is getting at

271
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:09,946
is that this agreement
is tenuous at best.

272
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:12,489
We know this,
your ex-wife knows this.

273
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,582
It's important that you know it, too.

274
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:18,129
So I strongly suggest you do
everything in your power

275
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:21,290
to retain your newly-acquired
visitation privileges.

276
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,664
I just got a promotion.

277
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,795
I'm going to be getting
a much nicer place very soon.

278
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:27,997
I still think...

279
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,665
Maybe we should just
fill out this paperwork

280
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:30,707
and be done.

281
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:33,300
We just need to verify a few things

282
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:34,674
and get some signatures.

283
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,272
Are you still at 4742 Alcott Avenue?

284
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,079
No.

285
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:46,714
What's your current address?

286
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:49,350
It's a little complicated.

287
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:53,557
Um, see, while I'm waiting
on the promotion money,

288
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:55,394
which is going to take a minute,

289
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,662
I got a landlord... he's like...

290
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:59,396
like a real Nazi landlord.

291
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:01,496
He, uh, he's just not willing

292
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:04,440
to let me slide
for a couple of weeks, so...

293
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:10,676
Are you saying you don't
have an apartment or a home

294
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:12,340
or any sort of shelter, Mr. Boyle?

295
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:14,783
No, I got shelter.

296
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,355
I just don't have
an address at the moment.

297
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:20,220
What are you, living in your car?

298
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,360
I don't believe this.

299
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,269
Mr. Boyle, no court in the world
is going to grant visitation privileges

300
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:35,203
to someone who's homeless.

301
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,832
We... We can't go through
with this today.

302
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:41,140
Uh, the court says
that I can have visitation.

303
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:43,146
I mean, that's a done deal.

304
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:45,239
Greg, call civils courtroom

305
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,580
and ask for a new hearing,
whatever it takes.

306
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,176
Unbelievable.

307
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:50,277
Please.

308
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:57,357
My kids should see me.

309
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:59,020
I'm going to get a new place

310
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,031
as soon as I get a new job.

311
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:05,860
A new job?

312
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,769
I thought you said
you just got a raise.

313
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:16,005
It's complicated.

314
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:19,946
I did get a promotion,

315
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:24,386
and I got fired right after that, so...

316
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:25,547
I'm sorry, Mr. Boyle,

317
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:27,124
but we're going to have to report

318
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,921
the information
you gave us to the court.

319
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:30,255
We'll be in touch with you

320
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,421
as soon as a new
hearing date is set.

321
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,829
But I'll get to see
my kids up until then?

322
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:36,525
I'm afraid that can't happen.

323
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:38,034
I'm sorry.

324
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,402
Try to have a good day.

325
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:42,496
This will make things easier.

326
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:29,419
Oh, you are getting so big.

327
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:30,818
I can barely hold you.

328
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:45,029
Hey, guy.

329
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,035
Hey.

330
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,264
How'd it go?

331
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:48,270
Good.

332
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:49,271
Yeah?

333
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:50,398
Yeah.

334
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,773
Hey, we're going to go visit Daddy.

335
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:54,505
I know.

336
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:56,205
So you ready?

337
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,282
Yeah.

338
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:58,849
Okay.

339
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:22,163
Hello. This is Eva Boyle.

340
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:24,572
Uh, I've got my checking account there,

341
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,837
and I'd like to close it, please.

342
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:32,750
My mother's name...
maiden name is, uh...

343
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,848
Slade. That's what it is.

344
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:38,354
Slade.

345
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,584
How much?

346
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,422
$9.52?

347
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:46,190
No, no. Don't send it back to me.

348
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:49,233
Uh, just, uh... uh...

349
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:50,995
send it to the Salvation Army.

350
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,936
I bet they'd be able to use it, don't you think?

351
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:56,836
I understand.

352
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:59,376
It's... yeah. Same address.

353
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:02,639
Merry Christmas to you, too.

354
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:03,942
Thank you.

355
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:23,358
Yes, sir. We got that on back order.

356
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:25,026
We'll get it right out to you.

357
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:26,468
Abso... Hello?

358
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,334
Dang it! Stupid cell phone.

359
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,237
Excuse me, sir? Buddy?

360
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:32,742
I just lost a very important
phone call.

361
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:35,677
Could I borrow a cell phone
just for one minute?

362
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:37,043
Thanks.

363
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:40,209
Absolutely, sir.

364
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:41,546
We'll get it right out to you.

365
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:42,950
We have it on back order right now.

366
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:44,351
Hello? Stupid...

367
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:46,788
Sir, I just lost a very
important business call.

368
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:49,417
You don't have a cell phone
I can borrow for a minute, do you?

369
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:50,927
Well, what happened
to your phone?

370
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:53,725
It just hasn't been the same
since I dropped it on my boat.

371
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:54,958
Your boat?

372
00:23:58,136 --> 00:23:59,603
What is this thing?

373
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:00,796
You were just on this?

374
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:02,032
- Right.
- Just now?

375
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,107
Yes, sir.

376
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,335
It's a very important business call.

377
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,412
All right. Well, just for a minute.

378
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:08,843
I have a 2:00.

379
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,915
Great. Me, too. Thanks.

380
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,910
Heather? It's me, Lefty.

381
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:17,113
I know it's you, Lefty.

382
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:18,883
- What's this number?
- A friend.

383
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,855
Whatever.

384
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:21,983
How'd the meeting go today?

385
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:23,287
Oh, you ought to know.

386
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:26,421
Everything was fine until those stupid
pit bull attack dogs lawyers of yours

387
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:27,498
screwed me over again.

388
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:28,998
I knew this was going to happen.

389
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,431
What are you talking about, Lefty?

390
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:32,594
All you had to do
was sign the papers.

391
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:34,695
Yeah, I know.
That's what the court said.

392
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,933
And then your freaking lawyer said

393
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,873
I've got to come back into the court

394
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,501
and have another meeting
with the judge.

395
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:42,170
I'm getting sick and tired, Heather.

396
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,908
Lefty, I honestly have no idea
what you're talking about.

397
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:46,449
Why wouldn't they let
you sign the papers?

398
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:48,178
Because you
and your new boyfriend

399
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:49,981
don't want me to see my kids.

400
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:52,420
You know that's not true.

401
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:54,651
As long as you're sober.
We've been through this.

402
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,317
Besides, it doesn't matter what I want.

403
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:59,192
The judge said you can see them,
so you can see them.

404
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:01,492
Tell that to your freaking lawyers!

405
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,330
Lefty, would you please calm down

406
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:05,698
and tell me what happened?

407
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,897
Look, all's I know is they told me

408
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,531
if I don't have an apartment,
I can't see the kids.

409
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:12,075
Listen, I really need my cell phone...

410
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,337
Just give me
one more second, buddy.

411
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:15,709
This is very important.
I'll be there in one minute.

412
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:17,577
Hello? What happened
to your apartment?

413
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,206
I don't want to talk
about it right now, okay?

414
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:20,944
So why don't we lay off it!

415
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:23,111
Whatever.

416
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:24,313
What else did they say?

417
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:26,720
They said I couldn't see the kids.

418
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:29,350
How many freaking times
do I have to tell you that?

419
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:30,553
Listen, I really,
I got to...

420
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:32,289
Buddy, just back off, fella!

421
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:33,329
Please.

422
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:36,366
I told you this is
a very important business... call.

423
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:37,992
I'm telling you right now, Heather,

424
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:39,365
this whole thing ain't right.

425
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:42,440
And if it don't get fixed,
I'm going off on somebody.

426
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,907
Where are you, Lefty?

427
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,808
All I know is I'm in the office
with your pit bulls.

428
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:50,279
One minute I slip
and tell them I got fired,

429
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,543
and they're out of there
like bats out of hell

430
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,141
with their cappuccinos
spilling all over themselves.

431
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:55,150
You got fired.

432
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:56,220
Hey!

433
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:57,413
Is that this gentleman's phone?

434
00:25:57,522 --> 00:25:59,319
One second, please. I got to go.

435
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:00,516
Buddy, you got to go.

436
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:02,320
- What's the matter with you?
- Get out of here.

437
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:03,519
What's the matter with you?

438
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:05,061
Are you across the street again?

439
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:09,424
Knock it off. Okay?

440
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:11,559
You... You got problems.

441
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:22,571
All right, guys.
Listen up. Here's the deal.

442
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:23,773
Are you listening?

443
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:30,550
Now, there's a rumor going around
that caroling is a dorky thing to do.

444
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:34,921
I just want you all to know
that unfortunately it's not a rumor.

445
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:36,653
Caroling is a dorky thing to do.

446
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:38,954
So don't sweat it.

447
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:41,362
We're in this thing together,
so let's make this fun.

448
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:42,626
- Got it?
- Yeah.

449
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,497
You with me?

450
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:45,968
- Yeah.
- Yes.

451
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:47,436
I said are you with me?

452
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:49,507
- Yes.
- Yes.

453
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,599
You're all very hip.

454
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,972
Come on. Let's go.

455
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:43,656
- Hi, Mary.
- Hi.

456
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:45,093
I'm glad you came in today.

457
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:47,289
Hey, little man. How's it going?

458
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:49,560
Merry Christmas.

459
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,329
We've been working on that one.

460
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:52,528
Can we go see him?

461
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:53,865
Of course you can, honey.

462
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:56,532
I'll call down and make sure
he's in the TV room.

463
00:27:56,641 --> 00:28:00,338
Oh. And, Mary, he had kind of
an angry spell this morning.

464
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:03,005
He had to be chemically
restrained again.

465
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:05,708
He's not going to be
very lucid tonight.

466
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,180
Okay.

467
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,450
<i>O Christmas Tree</i>

468
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:21,054
<i>Thy leaves are so unchanging</i>

469
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:22,895
<i>O Christmas Tree</i>

470
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:24,992
<i>O Christmas Tree</i>

471
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:29,369
<i>Thy leaves are so unchanging</i>

472
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:33,308
<i>Not only green</i>
<i>when summer's here</i>

473
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:37,404
<i>But also when 'tis cold and drear</i>

474
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:39,210
<i>O Christmas Tree</i>

475
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:41,649
<i>O Christmas Tree</i>

476
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:44,278
<i>Thy leaves are so unchanging</i>

477
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,720
Hi, baby.

478
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:48,588
How are you?

479
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:49,717
It's Christmas Eve.

480
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:50,954
I don't know if...

481
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,760
Jacob is here with me.

482
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:57,926
I knew that would mean a lot to you.

483
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:00,664
Say hi to Daddy, honey.

484
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:03,036
Hi, Daddy.

485
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:05,234
Why does he have a beard?

486
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:08,210
Well, I don't know. You like it?

487
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:11,111
Yeah. I like it.

488
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:16,881
Merry Christmas.

489
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:19,149
Honey, you don't have to get that close.

490
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,815
Daddy can hear you. He just...

491
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:24,156
He can't show you right now
because of the medicine.

492
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:31,000
Hey, why don't you give Daddy a kiss?

493
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,660
You tell him that you love him,

494
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,329
and then you can go over there

495
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,566
and play with those toys
for a few minutes.

496
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:40,567
I love you, Daddy.

497
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,108
His beard's tickly.

498
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:50,653
I'll come get you
in a couple minutes, okay?

499
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:51,722
Okay.

500
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,958
He's doing really well, Rick.

501
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:59,291
He's still quiet, holds it all in.

502
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:04,562
But he is so polite
and courteous and thoughtful.

503
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:08,002
So much like you,
it freaks me out sometimes.

504
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:13,605
Oh, he advanced another round
in the spelling bee this week.

505
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:15,542
He and Sammy Jarvis both get to go

506
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:19,310
to the district competition
right after New Year's.

507
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:21,908
I'm going to take work off
and go see it.

508
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,484
It's hard, Rick.

509
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:34,126
So hard.

510
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:39,761
There is no one I can
really talk to about this.

511
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,836
No one knows quite what to say,

512
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:44,966
and then I feel weird

513
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:47,271
because I know they're uncomfortable.

514
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,677
For the first time
in my life, I feel alone.

515
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:58,619
I need help, Rick.

516
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:08,025
I wish they wouldn't
dope you up so much.

517
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:11,132
This just isn't you.

518
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:18,901
Oh, we've got to get going.

519
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:21,570
Making the drive
to my parents' house tonight,

520
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,648
but we'll be back
tomorrow night, okay?

521
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:29,445
Please come back.

522
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,454
I love you so much.

523
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:35,583
Merry Christmas.

524
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:45,893
Two more minutes.

525
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:51,669
Mary!

526
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:55,070
Hey. I thought
I might see you here.

527
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:58,012
Yeah, well, he needs me
here, I think.

528
00:31:58,116 --> 00:31:59,583
Have you seen him lately?

529
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:02,312
Uh, no, no, no, not exactly.

530
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:06,083
Uh, my schedule's pretty full now
with the high-schoolers and all.

531
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,521
I do need to find time...

532
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:08,956
He needs to see people, Mitch,

533
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,084
people who love him.

534
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:11,821
I know that sometimes it's awkward,

535
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,261
but it's so good for him.

536
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:15,491
I know, Mary. You're right.

537
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,131
Hey. Tough guy.

538
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:21,671
Merry Christmas.

539
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:22,899
Merry Christmas.

540
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:24,440
Hey, you know what?

541
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:26,703
I'm going to stop by your house
sometime soon, okay?

542
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:28,278
And go to the swings park?

543
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:29,437
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

544
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:31,515
- We love the swings, don't we?
- Yeah.

545
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,943
I'm sorry I haven't been a good friend,

546
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:38,750
to Rick or to you.

547
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:41,154
I still don't know
what to do with all this.

548
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:42,419
It's not an excuse.

549
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:44,961
I'm just saying I'm really sorry.

550
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,894
Not that I should
feel sorry for myself.

551
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:49,694
I was back on my feet
a month after the accident.

552
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,632
You're the one who got the bad deal.

553
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:53,636
You got a bad deal, too, Mitch.

554
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:55,296
I know how close you were.

555
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:56,964
Yeah, but I'm not...

556
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:02,670
You know what? I'm going to stop talking now.

557
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,748
It's okay. You're right.

558
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:06,749
I really did get screwed
on this deal, huh?

559
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,146
Hey, why don't you
come to church tonight?

560
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:11,983
We haven't seen you there
since it happened.

561
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,819
Tonight might be
the right night for it.

562
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:14,949
I can't, Mitch.

563
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:16,253
Come on.
I'll make sure no one...

564
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:18,659
I can't. Okay? I just can't.

565
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:21,960
Well, we all love you
there, Mary, right?

566
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:23,226
Yeah.

567
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:26,468
Right? Mary?

568
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:29,802
Yeah. Right. I know.

569
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,003
Does everybody still love Rick?

570
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:41,110
I'm sorry, Mitch.

571
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:45,681
I really am glad I saw you.

572
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,152
Let's keep in touch, okay?

573
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,319
And I know that tonight
might be too tough,

574
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:53,056
but please see him.

575
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:54,688
I know.

576
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,323
Okay.

577
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:58,231
Merry Christmas.

578
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:03,000
Come on, honey.

579
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,378
Oh, and Rick has a beard now,

580
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:08,604
so if you kiss him,

581
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:09,839
his beard might be tickly.

582
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:11,505
Got it.

583
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,496
You shouldn't be here, Lefty.

584
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:37,574
Oh, hey, Gary. It's me, Lefty.

585
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:38,767
<i>I know it's you.</i>

586
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:41,037
<i>Why do you think I just called you Lefty?</i>

587
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:42,703
You got to get out of here.

588
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:45,874
<i>Can I just get the rest</i>
<i>of my stuff, please...</i>

589
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:48,850
Gary...

590
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,821
<i>You mean the rest of those paint cans?</i>

591
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:03,523
Well, all right, then.

592
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:06,432
<i>I'm going now...</i>

593
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:07,931
<i>Gary.</i>

594
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:18,582
Lefty?

595
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:48,944
Hey! Lefty, get back here!

596
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:56,280
Lefty!

597
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:27,181
What do you want to do?

598
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:29,116
Fix the thing, I guess.

599
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,188
Want me to call the cops?

600
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:33,814
No. Forget it.

601
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:35,825
I just want to be rid of him.

602
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:19,768
What?

603
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,394
What do you mean, what?

604
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:22,403
I got the stuff.

605
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:24,337
Get out here and give me a hand.

606
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:26,842
Just stop that honking.

607
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:28,206
It's Christmas Eve.

608
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:30,041
There's neighbors all around.

609
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:32,274
Back that piece of junk in here.

610
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:41,221
I'm coming out.

611
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:43,555
Come on, hurry up!

612
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:45,492
The whole neighborhood's watching.

613
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:48,064
Come on! Let's do this quickly.

614
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:51,032
Just open it up. We'll do it out here.

615
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:55,929
Move it, Lefty!

616
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,938
What you got?

617
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:57,939
Stuff.

618
00:37:58,042 --> 00:37:59,737
Let's see it.

619
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:01,106
Okay. Fine.

620
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:04,674
Get it into the garage.

621
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:13,721
Come on.

622
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,067
All right. That'll work.

623
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,615
This sucker is hot, Lefty.

624
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:40,240
That right?

625
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:41,648
Scorching.

626
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:44,152
I'm surprised you ain't blistering
just touching it.

627
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:46,587
What's with all the dramatics?

628
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:48,420
What, are we on TV?

629
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:53,088
The folks it belongs to
won't be happy they see you with it.

630
00:38:53,197 --> 00:38:55,165
Those folks,
they wear badges.

631
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:57,234
You know what I'm saying?

632
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,098
Where the heck did you get this?

633
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:01,569
Well, why don't you tell me
about these tools?

634
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:04,436
Then I'll see if I can remember
where I got the gun.

635
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:08,205
Well, this is just a little more
than what I was looking for.

636
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:09,836
What are you looking for?

637
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:14,009
It's a gun.
It goes bang-bang.

638
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:16,416
You want to be picky,
just get out of here.

639
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,578
I could care less.

640
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,519
Got any bullets?

641
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:21,022
Yeah.

642
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:24,319
Now get out of here.

643
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:25,725
One more thing.

644
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:26,797
What's that?

645
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,198
I'm real thirsty.

646
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:33,065
Geez.

647
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:37,874
Now go on!

648
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,002
Merry Christmas.

649
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:42,101
Yeah.

650
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:47,044
I seen that!

651
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,374
Merry Christmas.

652
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:47,171
Yep.

653
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:36,856
Son of a...

654
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:02,049
Can I help you find something?

655
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:03,449
I'm hungry.

656
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:05,818
You've come to the right place, then.

657
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:08,824
You like cranberries?

658
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:10,223
Cranberries?

659
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:12,727
It's Christmas Eve.

660
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:15,390
They taste different
on Christmas Eve?

661
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:17,524
I guess not.

662
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:21,464
You like turkey?

663
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:27,634
Yeah, sure, if it's not made up
to look like bacon and stuff.

664
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:34,745
Yeah. That'll do fine.

665
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:38,686
How much?

666
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:40,188
2.99.

667
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:42,648
Got a bag?

668
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:49,831
Merry Christmas.

669
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:51,561
Yep.

670
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,369
Genius.

671
00:42:58,008 --> 00:43:00,806
Excuse me. Do you know
anything about cars?

672
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,572
Uh, I know a bit, yes.

673
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,204
Well, it keeps stalling out on me.

674
00:43:04,315 --> 00:43:06,647
I got to drive another three hours
to my parents' tonight.

675
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,081
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

676
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:09,652
This isn't really a garage.

677
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,482
Do you know of any
that are open around here?

678
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,318
- I mean, it's Christmas Eve.
- I know.

679
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,686
And that's a problem.
Everything's closed.

680
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:16,191
Nothing?

681
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:18,523
I really doubt it.

682
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:19,994
Right.

683
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:23,491
Hi, Mom.

684
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,296
No, we're still here.

685
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:28,166
No, not home, just...

686
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,536
It doesn't look
like we'll be there tonight.

687
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:32,040
Well, the car's shot,

688
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:34,337
and I can't get anybody
to look at it right now.

689
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,804
Yeah, it's... I know. It's lousy.

690
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:39,177
I know.

691
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,979
What am I supposed
to do about it?

692
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:45,886
Mom, everything is closed.

693
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:48,117
I can't just rent a car tonight.

694
00:43:48,225 --> 00:43:50,386
I'm going to have to see
if anybody can drive

695
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:52,189
in the middle of nowhere
on Christmas Eve

696
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,854
and give us a ride back home.

697
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:56,023
Honey, come here.
Stay by me right now, okay?

698
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,623
Mommy's on the phone
with Grandma.

699
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:00,094
Okay. You know what?

700
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:01,865
I'm going to call you later.

701
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,303
Mom...

702
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:08,270
Yeah, I wish Rick was here, too.

703
00:44:08,379 --> 00:44:10,006
Thanks for sharing.

704
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:11,911
Right. Bye.

705
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:18,246
I guess I could look at it, but l... l...

706
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:19,447
What?

707
00:44:19,556 --> 00:44:23,549
Uh, I was just saying
that I could take a look at it, I guess.

708
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,720
I mean, I don't know
a whole lot, but...

709
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,194
Really? That would be great.

710
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:29,322
Anything you could
do would be great.

711
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:30,400
All right.

712
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:40,969
And a Happy New Year

713
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:42,739
Merry Christmas!

714
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:45,246
Thank you. Thank you so much.

715
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:48,284
Can we offer you a ride
to church tonight?

716
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:49,909
That's very nice,

717
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,545
but we need to get our sleep.

718
00:44:52,656 --> 00:44:54,419
Understood completely.

719
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:57,494
Oh, uh, can we offer you
this small gift

720
00:44:57,594 --> 00:44:58,526
from the youth group?

721
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:00,790
Two gifts: One for each of you.

722
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:02,798
Well, we really don't need...

723
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,027
We'd like for you to have them.

724
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:10,163
Just a reminder you, uh, haven't been, uh,
forgotten.

725
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:14,301
Thank you again.
Merry Christmas.

726
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:19,348
Moving right along.

727
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:28,382
Is that bad?

728
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:30,460
Yeah. I think it's pretty bad.

729
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:31,858
Can you fix it?

730
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:33,953
If I had an air filter,

731
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:36,191
but I don't carry
that sort of thing here.

732
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,494
It's a convenience store.

733
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:39,296
Well, that's not very
convenient, now is it?

734
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:42,736
I've heard that one a few times.

735
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,171
Sorry.

736
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:48,173
Oh, wow.

737
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:49,711
This is another problem.

738
00:45:49,813 --> 00:45:51,337
When was the last time
you had a tune-up?

739
00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:53,177
A what?

740
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:56,150
Oh, uh, that would be last Christmas.

741
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:59,154
Probably the fall before...
before that, actually.

742
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:00,883
Rick, my husband,

743
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:02,356
thought that a fall tune-up

744
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:04,393
would be just fine
for Christmas travel.

745
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:06,395
You're lucky it's running at all.

746
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:07,862
The points are trashed.

747
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:09,592
The filter's disgusting.

748
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,998
I can't imagine what
the oil must look like.

749
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:14,127
Last fall?

750
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:16,206
Why didn't you bring it in after that?

751
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:18,706
Rick always handled
things like that.

752
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:21,505
Why did he let it go so long?

753
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,274
Well, that's a loaded question.

754
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,751
Rick was in a car
accident last year.

755
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:34,153
He lives in a home now.

756
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:35,156
Sorry.

757
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:36,248
No, it's okay.

758
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,123
But it... it left him
brain damaged,

759
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:40,253
and they're not sure what kind
of recovery he could have,

760
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:43,265
if at all, so...

761
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:47,633
Anyway, he hasn't been in the mood
to take the car in for a tune-up this year.

762
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:49,171
I can tell you that.

763
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:55,877
I suppose you'd like to make it
to your folks' place tonight, huh?

764
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:58,277
You know what? I appreciate
you even trying. I do.

765
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:00,907
If you help me, we could jerry-rig
the points and plugs,

766
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:02,349
clean up the cap a bit.

767
00:47:02,452 --> 00:47:03,919
Um, we could change the oil.

768
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:07,013
I do have oil here.
How convenient is that?

769
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:09,183
Take the air hose. I'll blow out this filter.

770
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:11,056
Maybe we can get by
without a new one.

771
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:12,924
If all goes well, and that's a huge if,

772
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:15,191
we'll have you on the road
in a couple of hours.

773
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:17,267
I don't have to have a clue
what you said, right?

774
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:18,356
Not if I don't.

775
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:20,934
I'll show you what to do.

776
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:23,734
Oh, uh, Kirk?

777
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:24,739
Yeah.

778
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:27,106
I'm Mary, and this is Jacob.

779
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:29,372
Jacob. Hey, Jacob.

780
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:33,545
Why don't you go in
and read your book?

781
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:48,788
Yes.

782
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:50,264
Mrs. Boyle?

783
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,858
I'm Mrs. Boyle. And you are?

784
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:54,494
My name is Margaret,

785
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:56,470
and I'm with Meals On Wheels.

786
00:47:56,573 --> 00:48:00,236
Oh, I can't afford
to give anything this year.

787
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:02,175
Oh, no. We're not here
to collect money.

788
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:04,008
We're here with your Christmas dinner.

789
00:48:04,114 --> 00:48:05,604
Merry Christmas.

790
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:08,446
Oh, well, why would you do that?

791
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,918
Well, because it's Christmas Eve.

792
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:12,249
Well, I understand,

793
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:13,755
but I didn't ask for anything.

794
00:48:13,857 --> 00:48:16,087
Oh, no. Um, someone
gave us your name,

795
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:18,753
and we bring meals to people

796
00:48:18,862 --> 00:48:21,956
who may need a little extra...

797
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:23,532
assistance.

798
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:24,726
There must be some mistake

799
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:27,099
because I don't need a meal,

800
00:48:27,204 --> 00:48:28,865
and I don't need assistance.

801
00:48:28,972 --> 00:48:31,634
So please, just give it to somebody
who really needs it.

802
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:34,711
Are you saying that you
already prepared a meal?

803
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:38,372
No. I'm saying
that I don't need a meal.

804
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:39,676
How'd you get my name?

805
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:43,310
Well, we're not supposed to say, but...

806
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:51,061
I think it was from Dr. Lyndel
at the Jefferson County Walk-in Clinic.

807
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:52,321
He's your sponsor.

808
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:53,953
Uh, my notes say that you told him

809
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:56,897
you had a family of six coming
for Christmas dinner.

810
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,331
- Is that true?
- Oh...

811
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,926
I did talk to Dr. Lyndel about my family.

812
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:02,096
Yes, I did.

813
00:49:02,205 --> 00:49:04,969
So they are coming over for dinner?

814
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:09,006
Uh, yes, they are.

815
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:11,876
Oh, well, I guess Dr. Lyndel
was just trying to help out.

816
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:13,210
I mean, six people.

817
00:49:13,317 --> 00:49:17,276
Uh, well, uh, come on in
and bring it into the kitchen.

818
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:20,380
Here.

819
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:27,957
I was starting to think we'd
have to take Dr. Lyndel in for a checkup.

820
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:30,898
Oh, I don't think he needs that.

821
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:33,868
Okay. Now, this turkey is warm,

822
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:36,269
so it'll be good for the next couple of hours,

823
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:37,897
you know, if the dinner's tonight.

824
00:49:38,008 --> 00:49:40,067
Otherwise, in the morning,
you can heat it up

825
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:42,338
for an hour on 275.

826
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:43,970
Thank you so much.

827
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:46,982
Oh, and when you're done,
just toss the containers.

828
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:49,109
Oh, that's fine.

829
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:53,713
Thank you so much
for all this lovely food.

830
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,054
My family's going to be delighted.

831
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:58,093
They'll think I'm a wonderful cook.

832
00:49:58,195 --> 00:50:00,356
Well, I hope so.

833
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:02,455
Oh, and, Mrs. Boyle,

834
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:04,966
you have nothing to be ashamed of.

835
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:07,669
What do you mean?

836
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:09,466
You have cooked enough
meals in your life.

837
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:10,801
You can take a break now.

838
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:17,572
Well, I think I will
take a break tonight.

839
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:18,978
Well, I'm glad.

840
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:19,980
Merry Christmas.

841
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:23,280
Oh. Merry Christmas.

842
00:52:19,669 --> 00:52:21,330
You all right in there, buddy?

843
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,905
You alone in there?

844
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:28,644
Just me.

845
00:52:28,745 --> 00:52:30,440
What are you, some kind of pervert?

846
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:32,105
What?

847
00:52:32,215 --> 00:52:34,376
You get your thrills doing this?

848
00:52:36,286 --> 00:52:37,947
What do you mean, thrills?

849
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:41,319
I'm going to have to ask
you to get out of here.

850
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,458
Is there a problem, Officer?

851
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:52,263
You got about ten seconds,
or we go for a ride in my car.

852
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:53,836
It's up to you.

853
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:56,965
Yes, sir.

854
00:52:58,108 --> 00:52:59,700
I didn't do anything.

855
00:53:20,397 --> 00:53:21,329
Mom?

856
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:23,899
Ouch! Kirk, are you okay?

857
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,797
Yeah, I'm fine.

858
00:53:25,902 --> 00:53:28,302
I have to go to the bathroom.

859
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:30,430
It's, uh, not exactly homey.

860
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,770
I don't think Jacob
would mind, if you don't.

861
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:35,572
Uh... okay.

862
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:37,237
It's inside in the back.

863
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:39,372
You can use it, but it's really not...

864
00:53:39,482 --> 00:53:40,642
Uh, okay.

865
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:41,682
What do you say?

866
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:43,150
Merry Christmas.

867
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:45,788
That, too, but what else?

868
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,880
Oh. Thank you.

869
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:50,152
Sure.

870
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:42,061
Hark, the herald angels sing

871
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:47,228
Glory to the newborn king

872
00:56:47,337 --> 00:56:49,202
Merry Christmas!

873
00:56:49,305 --> 00:56:50,863
Oh, Merry Christmas to you.

874
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:53,738
Thank you kids so much.

875
00:56:53,843 --> 00:56:56,641
Can we offer you a ride
to the service tonight?

876
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:59,112
No, thank you. It's...

877
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:01,649
I'm feeling a little sick tonight.

878
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:04,845
We'd like to offer you this small gift
from the youth group.

879
00:57:04,954 --> 00:57:06,012
Thank you.

880
00:57:06,122 --> 00:57:08,181
I wish I had something to give you.

881
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:09,349
Nice to see you.

882
00:57:09,459 --> 00:57:10,824
You have yourself a good night.

883
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:12,224
And Merry Christmas, you hear?

884
00:57:12,328 --> 00:57:14,592
Okay, then. Bye-bye.

885
00:57:58,041 --> 00:58:00,168
Can I help you find something?

886
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:05,709
Some gas.

887
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:06,713
How much?

888
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:07,748
Whatever.

889
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:09,113
20 bucks.

890
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:43,482
Merry Christmas.

891
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:52,558
I said "Merry Christmas" to the man.

892
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:55,153
You did? Well, that was nice.

893
00:58:56,566 --> 00:58:57,533
Hello.

894
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:06,941
Hey. Look what I got for you.

895
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:08,340
Merry Christmas.

896
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:13,113
Thank you.

897
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,240
You're welcome.

898
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:20,813
Sir, do you have another...

899
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:33,258
Anyway.
We've got more work to do.

900
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:36,133
Yes. We do. Come on.

901
01:00:14,344 --> 01:00:16,403
Any of you boys hungry?

902
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:51,105
You're a godsend.

903
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:54,874
No one's ever accused me
of that before.

904
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:56,815
But let's see if I can fix your car first.

905
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:01,555
So, what about you?

906
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:04,456
Why are you open today
instead of being with your family?

907
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:07,061
Pretty pitiful, huh?

908
01:01:08,464 --> 01:01:10,489
The short answer is I've got
nothing better to do.

909
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,296
Oh, come on.
A nice, good-looking...

910
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:20,574
Sorry.

911
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:21,803
It's fine.

912
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:29,246
Look, um... I'm not
implying anything here,

913
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:31,047
but I do want to be upfront with you.

914
01:01:31,154 --> 01:01:32,280
I have a husband.

915
01:01:32,388 --> 01:01:33,582
Yeah.

916
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:35,824
You told me that already.

917
01:01:35,925 --> 01:01:36,983
- Remember?
- Yeah.

918
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,195
That was awkward, wasn't it?

919
01:01:43,299 --> 01:01:44,231
I'm sorry.

920
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:46,130
No. Of course not. I understand.

921
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:51,567
I haven't been hitting on you, by the way.

922
01:01:51,674 --> 01:01:52,732
Oh, I know.

923
01:01:52,842 --> 01:01:54,275
Of course.

924
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:55,935
And I'm sorry.

925
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:59,378
Don't sweat it. I just wanted you to know
that I'm not hitting on you.

926
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:31,102
Silent night

927
01:02:31,214 --> 01:02:33,307
Holy night

928
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:36,817
All is calm

929
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:38,819
All is bright

930
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:40,479
I'll be there in a minute!

931
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,558
Round yon Virgin

932
01:02:42,658 --> 01:02:45,320
Mother and Child

933
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:47,794
Holy Infant

934
01:02:47,897 --> 01:02:51,060
So tender and mild

935
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:57,299
Sleep in heavenly peace

936
01:02:57,406 --> 01:03:02,275
Sleep in heavenly peace

937
01:03:02,378 --> 01:03:04,312
Merry Christmas!

938
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:07,678
Oh... thank you all so much.

939
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:10,218
L... I would have
some cookies for you,

940
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:12,184
but my grandchildren
ate them all.

941
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:14,449
Oh, stop it. We just wanted to stop by,

942
01:03:14,557 --> 01:03:16,457
tell you we've missed you at church.

943
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:18,186
I've been traveling.

944
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:20,159
Uh, my family's all spread out.

945
01:03:20,263 --> 01:03:21,355
Really?

946
01:03:22,598 --> 01:03:24,031
Well...

947
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:26,033
Will we see you
at the service tonight?

948
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:28,569
10:45 sharp. Well, give or take.

949
01:03:28,671 --> 01:03:30,571
Service will last till midnight. We can stop by,

950
01:03:30,673 --> 01:03:32,163
- pick you up.
- I'm afraid not.

951
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:35,210
Um, I have, um, my family's
all coming tomorrow.

952
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:36,972
Maybe next week, then.

953
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:41,950
Well... you take care of yourself.

954
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:43,780
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

955
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,218
"O" for 7.

956
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:53,886
But the singing is getting better.

957
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:55,224
Really?

958
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:56,320
No.

959
01:03:56,432 --> 01:03:58,093
But... they probably
can't hear it anyway,

960
01:03:58,201 --> 01:03:59,395
so...

961
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:01,060
The packet.

962
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:02,899
You forgot to give her the packet.

963
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:04,233
Packet.

964
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:06,365
You know what?
I really don't think that she...

965
01:04:06,475 --> 01:04:08,238
- Oh, come on.
- Wants to...

966
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:10,471
She might need it.
It's what it's for.

967
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,649
Crap. Hold on.

968
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:25,319
I nearly forgot.

969
01:04:25,428 --> 01:04:27,521
A gift... from the youth group.

970
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:29,757
L... I don't need anything.

971
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:32,096
Just a small something.

972
01:04:34,437 --> 01:04:36,769
Let you know
how much you're loved...

973
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:38,238
and missed at the church.

974
01:04:38,341 --> 01:04:40,571
Oh, thank you very much.

975
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:44,843
You okay?

976
01:04:44,947 --> 01:04:46,039
I'm fine.

977
01:04:46,148 --> 01:04:47,206
You sure?

978
01:04:47,316 --> 01:04:49,250
- Is there anything I can do to...
- No.

979
01:04:49,352 --> 01:04:51,013
Please. I'm fine.

980
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:52,109
All right.

981
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:54,921
Merry Christmas.

982
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:56,548
Merry Christmas.

983
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:00,479
Are you okay, Mitch?

984
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:03,417
Yeah, I'm fine.

985
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:07,356
Hey, guys.

986
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:09,090
I think we're gonna call it a night.

987
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:29,276
So... tell me more about your husband.
What's he do?

988
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:31,954
Well, nothing.

989
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:34,554
Yeah.

990
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:37,125
Right. What did he do?

991
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:40,955
Oh, wow. What didn't Rick do?

992
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:44,891
When we were first married,
he was an engineer.

993
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:46,559
He always joked he'd never stop

994
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:48,569
until he'd built
the perfect mousetrap.

995
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:51,401
Then one day, he comes home
and tells me he's quitting.

996
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:52,735
Just like that?

997
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:54,742
Yeah, just like that. And he did!

998
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:57,677
The next thing I know,
he's working at a ranch for at-risk kids.

999
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:59,008
Wow.

1000
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:01,345
Talk about a pay cut.

1001
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:04,585
He also volunteered
at our church.

1002
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:06,177
Mostly with the youth group.

1003
01:07:06,288 --> 01:07:07,915
He'd help anybody who needed it.

1004
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:09,889
He sounds like a real jerk.

1005
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:15,095
Uh... um, that was supposed to be a joke.
I'm sorry.

1006
01:07:16,132 --> 01:07:17,190
Uh, it... it's okay.

1007
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:22,262
It's just that he can't
help anyone now.

1008
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:25,602
It's like his purpose has been...

1009
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:26,970
taken away.

1010
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:43,014
You know, my mom had a stroke
towards the end of her life.

1011
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:44,958
What's that?

1012
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:45,959
My mom.

1013
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:47,120
She had a stroke.

1014
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:48,628
She couldn't take care
of herself anymore.

1015
01:07:49,665 --> 01:07:50,962
I'm sorry.

1016
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:51,965
So you know.

1017
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:55,560
Well, it's not the same
as you and your husband... but,

1018
01:07:55,671 --> 01:07:58,663
uh, my sister and I did have to take care of her.

1019
01:07:58,774 --> 01:08:01,265
My dad... he just couldn't deal with it, I guess.

1020
01:08:01,377 --> 01:08:04,312
Yeah. A lot of people can't.

1021
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:05,846
It's funny, though.

1022
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:08,144
It...

1023
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:10,480
I'm grateful for that time.

1024
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:14,113
I mean... it's easy
to take care of someone

1025
01:08:14,223 --> 01:08:16,987
who gives back or says "Thank you."

1026
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:18,890
But taking care of someone

1027
01:08:18,994 --> 01:08:20,723
who doesn't even know
what you're doing...

1028
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:25,158
it... it makes you figure out
what kind of a person you really are.

1029
01:08:25,267 --> 01:08:26,666
You know?

1030
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:27,667
Yeah.

1031
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:29,237
I mean... uh...

1032
01:08:29,338 --> 01:08:32,136
I'm not saying that's
why... why this happens.

1033
01:08:32,241 --> 01:08:35,233
It's... just that's what I got out of it, anyway.

1034
01:08:35,344 --> 01:08:38,575
Huh. I wish other people
saw it that way.

1035
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:42,747
Other than the pastor of my old church,
no one visits him regularly.

1036
01:08:42,852 --> 01:08:44,843
They... They all just feel too awkward.

1037
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:46,421
They don't know how to talk to him.

1038
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,592
I'm embarrassed for him.

1039
01:08:58,234 --> 01:08:59,667
<i>You'll be giving those out</i>

1040
01:08:59,768 --> 01:09:01,759
<i>all the way to the new year.</i>

1041
01:09:01,871 --> 01:09:05,204
<i>It is 9:32 on the night before Christmas.</i>

1042
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:06,604
<i>Not a lot of traffic out there,</i>

1043
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:08,643
<i>but we do want you to drive careful</i>
<i>and be safe.</i>

1044
01:09:08,744 --> 01:09:10,905
<i>Please don't stay out too late tonight.</i>

1045
01:09:11,013 --> 01:09:12,878
Well, this was unexpected.

1046
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:14,540
How's that?

1047
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:16,811
Nothing. I just wasn't planning on...

1048
01:09:16,919 --> 01:09:18,750
Didn't think you'd have a meaningful
conversation

1049
01:09:18,854 --> 01:09:20,822
- with the gas station guy, huh?
- No. Not that.

1050
01:09:20,923 --> 01:09:22,049
- L...
- It's okay.

1051
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,284
I understand.

1052
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:26,719
I know what this place is.

1053
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:28,854
I'm not proud of it.

1054
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:31,799
So then what are you doing here?

1055
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:35,398
When I bought it, I was a genius.

1056
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:37,563
It's... out in the middle of nowhere,

1057
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:39,732
but the city limits
were headed this way.

1058
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:41,139
I was... I was gonna sell it.

1059
01:09:41,243 --> 01:09:42,141
Reinvest.

1060
01:09:42,244 --> 01:09:43,734
Make a fortune.

1061
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:46,371
But the city just never made it,
and I got stuck here.

1062
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:49,776
Uh, so l... I figured, uh,

1063
01:09:49,885 --> 01:09:51,546
maybe I'd have a chance if I made it

1064
01:09:51,654 --> 01:09:53,554
a different kind of a gas station...

1065
01:09:53,656 --> 01:09:56,090
a destination-type place, you know?

1066
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:57,682
Uh, gourmet coffee?

1067
01:09:57,793 --> 01:09:59,727
Good food? Great service?

1068
01:09:59,828 --> 01:10:01,921
Clean as I could get it?

1069
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:06,593
Problem was I did all that,
and no one gave a rip.

1070
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:08,795
So it's never gonna be
a destination for anyone.

1071
01:10:08,904 --> 01:10:10,997
It's just a stop along the way.

1072
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:14,176
I don't know.

1073
01:10:22,718 --> 01:10:24,948
You know...

1074
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:27,682
you think about that one thing
that you can contribute.

1075
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:31,117
What's my thing?
That I make a good pot of coffee?

1076
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:34,219
Most of my customers don't care
about gourmet coffee anyway.

1077
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:35,319
They want gas

1078
01:10:35,431 --> 01:10:37,456
and a Styrofoam cup of pennies
by the register.

1079
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:39,261
That's about it.

1080
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,165
Tonight's the anniversary.

1081
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:56,475
Of the accident?

1082
01:11:56,578 --> 01:11:57,875
Yeah.

1083
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:01,040
Oh, wow.

1084
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:02,777
Yeah.

1085
01:12:02,885 --> 01:12:04,876
He was a good man.

1086
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:06,386
He is...

1087
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:07,386
a good man,

1088
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:09,218
but he <i>was</i> a good man.

1089
01:12:11,393 --> 01:12:12,951
I still love him so much.

1090
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:17,231
I meant what I said.

1091
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,801
You know, in my vows...
"For better or for worse."

1092
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:21,233
All of it.

1093
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:22,497
Yeah.

1094
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:30,235
Are...

1095
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:31,313
you okay?

1096
01:12:31,413 --> 01:12:32,380
Yeah.

1097
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:35,778
I just... I haven't had a chance

1098
01:12:35,884 --> 01:12:37,511
to breathe about this for a while...

1099
01:12:37,619 --> 01:12:40,918
between fighting for him and...

1100
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:43,583
dealing with his friends
and staying strong for Jacob.

1101
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:44,659
I just...

1102
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:48,493
I haven't even cried in months, so...

1103
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:47,855
Hey, guys. Welcome back.

1104
01:13:47,956 --> 01:13:49,321
Brett. Gretchen.

1105
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:51,222
Hey, good to see you. How'd it go.

1106
01:13:51,326 --> 01:13:52,258
Not bad.

1107
01:13:52,361 --> 01:13:53,259
- Yeah?
- It was cool.

1108
01:13:53,362 --> 01:13:55,990
Hey, everybody, head upstairs.

1109
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:58,464
Bathroom break,
and then free time until the service.

1110
01:13:59,701 --> 01:14:00,668
So?

1111
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:04,599
What's to say?

1112
01:14:04,706 --> 01:14:05,832
We did our duty.

1113
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:08,409
We sang for some folks,
invited them to church.

1114
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:10,808
But they shut their doors
and went back to their lonely lives.

1115
01:14:10,913 --> 01:14:12,210
You... handed out the packets?

1116
01:14:12,314 --> 01:14:13,246
We did.

1117
01:14:13,348 --> 01:14:15,248
That's good.

1118
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:16,317
You know...

1119
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:20,080
I'm still not sure
what value all this had.

1120
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:23,883
Maybe you never will.

1121
01:14:23,992 --> 01:14:25,983
So, what's the point, then?

1122
01:14:26,094 --> 01:14:27,652
None of them are gonna be coming

1123
01:14:27,763 --> 01:14:29,162
to church tonight because of our visit.

1124
01:14:29,264 --> 01:14:30,663
They... They didn't care.

1125
01:14:30,766 --> 01:14:32,700
And the kids sure aren't gonna
get anything out of it.

1126
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:34,359
- I mean... I just...
- You know something, Mitch?

1127
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:36,961
You go out and serve God
with that attitude,

1128
01:14:37,072 --> 01:14:40,337
there's a good chance
that nothing will come of it.

1129
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:44,077
Maybe this is a test for you. I don't know.

1130
01:14:44,179 --> 01:14:49,242
Sometimes you do the right thing
because it's the right thing?

1131
01:14:49,351 --> 01:14:51,046
Geez, you sound like
a pastor or something.

1132
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:53,883
And, look, you don't know
what's gonna come of tonight.

1133
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:55,786
I got it. I got it.

1134
01:14:56,825 --> 01:14:58,656
It's just tonight...

1135
01:14:58,760 --> 01:14:59,954
of all nights.

1136
01:15:00,062 --> 01:15:01,222
You know?

1137
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:02,297
I mean...

1138
01:15:02,397 --> 01:15:04,058
before, a year ago,
when Rick was here,

1139
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:05,064
he mattered.

1140
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:06,498
He was important.

1141
01:15:06,602 --> 01:15:08,536
He had good ideas.
The kids thought he was exciting.

1142
01:15:08,637 --> 01:15:10,468
And now it's a year later,
and we've got him

1143
01:15:10,572 --> 01:15:12,403
tooling around, singing on porches.

1144
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:13,805
Badly, I might add.

1145
01:15:13,909 --> 01:15:15,843
I hear you, Mitch.

1146
01:15:15,944 --> 01:15:17,172
I do.

1147
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,080
I want to talk to you about this, okay?

1148
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:23,014
Can we talk after the service?

1149
01:15:23,118 --> 01:15:24,016
Yeah.

1150
01:15:24,119 --> 01:15:25,814
Great. Thank you.

1151
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:31,583
You know...

1152
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:33,251
there was something tonight...

1153
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:34,488
kinda odd.

1154
01:15:34,596 --> 01:15:36,587
Um...

1155
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:38,256
Eva Boyle.

1156
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:40,096
Is she a little off?

1157
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:41,499
Something didn't seem quite right,

1158
01:15:41,603 --> 01:15:43,264
and... and I don't know what it was.

1159
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:44,532
Yeah, Eva Boyle.

1160
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:45,834
I, uh...

1161
01:15:45,941 --> 01:15:49,877
She's kept a lot of our church ladies
on their knees for a long time now.

1162
01:15:49,978 --> 01:15:51,946
Her husband's been dead ten years.

1163
01:15:52,047 --> 01:15:53,105
He was terrible.

1164
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:55,046
Her family's scattered all over.

1165
01:15:55,150 --> 01:15:56,777
Some of them she hasn't seen for years,

1166
01:15:56,885 --> 01:16:00,616
and from what I hear,
that isn't necessarily a bad thing.

1167
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:03,121
You sure about that?

1168
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:04,954
She said they were all
coming to see her tomorrow.

1169
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:06,789
No. Not likely.

1170
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:08,055
That's great.

1171
01:16:08,163 --> 01:16:09,460
I'm glad I followed my instincts.

1172
01:16:11,967 --> 01:16:13,127
Listen.

1173
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:15,328
Why don't you follow up
with her sometime?

1174
01:16:15,437 --> 01:16:16,836
I can go with you.

1175
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:21,732
Mitch, I know you didn't want to,

1176
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:25,642
but you did the right thing tonight.

1177
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:27,874
It was good for the kids, too.

1178
01:16:28,917 --> 01:16:29,884
Yeah.

1179
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:44,330
<i>Long lay the world</i>

1180
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:48,893
<i>In sin and error pining</i>

1181
01:16:49,004 --> 01:16:51,495
<i>Till he appeared</i>

1182
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:55,805
<i>And the soul felt its worth</i>

1183
01:16:57,512 --> 01:17:00,970
<i>A thrill of hope</i>

1184
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:05,383
<i>The weary world rejoices</i>

1185
01:20:29,558 --> 01:20:30,525
Hello?

1186
01:20:38,166 --> 01:20:39,827
What are you doing here?

1187
01:20:40,869 --> 01:20:42,837
- It's me.
- I know who it is.

1188
01:20:44,172 --> 01:20:46,231
Why didn't you answer the door?

1189
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:51,972
Because I didn't want
to be bothered.

1190
01:20:55,617 --> 01:20:56,549
Right. I'll just, uh...

1191
01:20:56,651 --> 01:20:59,142
No. What... What
are you doing here?

1192
01:21:01,022 --> 01:21:03,991
I came by to, um, just get something.

1193
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:08,162
Well...

1194
01:21:09,965 --> 01:21:10,989
Give me your jacket.

1195
01:21:11,099 --> 01:21:13,693
I'll keep it on. I'm not staying.

1196
01:21:17,038 --> 01:21:18,130
How's Heather?

1197
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:22,339
She ran out on me two years ago, Ma.

1198
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,973
Well, how would I know that?

1199
01:21:30,051 --> 01:21:31,018
Right.

1200
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:36,183
Life doesn't always turn out
as we hoped, does it?

1201
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:39,793
You have no idea.

1202
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:41,362
The hell I don't.

1203
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:50,037
The kids. They okay?

1204
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:53,200
Heather won't let me see 'em.

1205
01:21:54,242 --> 01:21:55,800
Now what have you done?

1206
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:57,003
Ma.

1207
01:21:59,247 --> 01:22:00,305
All right.

1208
01:22:02,417 --> 01:22:03,782
What do you want?

1209
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:10,653
Lucio, l... You... You scared me half to death.

1210
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:13,990
Lefty, Ma.
Lefty.

1211
01:22:14,095 --> 01:22:15,027
Oh, for heaven's sakes.

1212
01:22:15,130 --> 01:22:16,825
You're not even left-handed.

1213
01:22:22,437 --> 01:22:23,734
All right, Lefty.

1214
01:22:25,106 --> 01:22:26,664
You came here...

1215
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:28,675
to this house...

1216
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:30,608
on this night...

1217
01:22:30,712 --> 01:22:32,475
- for no reason?
- I got a reason.

1218
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:33,740
Well, what is it?

1219
01:22:41,289 --> 01:22:42,722
I came to wish you a Merry Christmas.

1220
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:46,420
Actually, that ain't right.

1221
01:22:46,528 --> 01:22:47,586
I came here...

1222
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:52,761
so you could...
wish me a Merry Christmas.

1223
01:22:57,305 --> 01:23:00,206
You... You need me to wish you
a Merry Christmas?

1224
01:23:04,145 --> 01:23:06,204
Well, why would you...

1225
01:23:06,314 --> 01:23:07,212
Why...

1226
01:23:07,315 --> 01:23:08,748
'Cause you're my ma.

1227
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:11,077
That's all.

1228
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:18,789
Well, Merry Christmas.

1229
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:27,025
Okay.

1230
01:23:31,506 --> 01:23:32,734
I'll just be going.

1231
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:33,739
No. No, no. Wait.

1232
01:23:33,842 --> 01:23:35,036
Please. L... I'm sorry.

1233
01:23:35,143 --> 01:23:37,441
Um... it's just...

1234
01:23:38,513 --> 01:23:40,003
all so unexpected.

1235
01:23:41,049 --> 01:23:41,947
Yeah, I know.

1236
01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:43,847
Uh, let me make you some tea.

1237
01:23:43,952 --> 01:23:45,715
Uh, are you hungry at all?

1238
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:47,014
L... I've got leftovers.

1239
01:23:47,122 --> 01:23:48,487
- Ma...
- No, please.

1240
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:51,115
Come on. It'll just take a minute.

1241
01:24:20,221 --> 01:24:22,280
I gotta say...
you're the best thing

1242
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:24,449
that's happened to me all evening.

1243
01:24:24,559 --> 01:24:25,856
That right?

1244
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:31,195
You ever hear a group of teenagers
sing "Silent Night"?

1245
01:24:32,233 --> 01:24:33,962
Not silent enough, huh?

1246
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:35,730
Definitely not.

1247
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:39,904
- Lucio, no! Oh!
- What? Ma.

1248
01:24:41,409 --> 01:24:43,570
Oh, you didn't drink
any of that, did you?

1249
01:24:43,678 --> 01:24:44,576
No, Ma.

1250
01:24:44,679 --> 01:24:46,442
Oh... I'm sorry.

1251
01:24:46,548 --> 01:24:47,640
I've got a cold.

1252
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:49,114
I just don't want you to get sick.

1253
01:24:49,217 --> 01:24:51,048
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

1254
01:25:02,263 --> 01:25:03,491
Ma...

1255
01:25:03,598 --> 01:25:04,656
you all right?

1256
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:05,994
I'm fine.

1257
01:25:09,771 --> 01:25:11,830
It's Christmas Eve.
Are you going to church?

1258
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:15,842
Oh, those Christmas carolers
asked me that this evening.

1259
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:18,640
I told 'em I didn't think
I was gonna make it there this year.

1260
01:25:18,746 --> 01:25:19,713
How come?

1261
01:25:20,748 --> 01:25:23,410
Well... I don't have a car anymore.

1262
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,314
What about the bus?

1263
01:25:27,489 --> 01:25:29,354
They changed the route last year,

1264
01:25:29,457 --> 01:25:31,118
and now the closest stop
is all the way

1265
01:25:31,226 --> 01:25:32,853
on the other side of the four-lane.

1266
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:35,429
Oh. Here. Sit down!

1267
01:25:35,530 --> 01:25:37,259
Come on. It's just gonna be ready in a minute.

1268
01:25:37,365 --> 01:25:38,559
Get you a napkin. Get all ready.

1269
01:25:38,666 --> 01:25:40,258
It's just gonna be a minute.

1270
01:26:03,491 --> 01:26:04,924
- Hey.
- Hi.

1271
01:26:06,327 --> 01:26:08,056
So, tell me.

1272
01:26:08,163 --> 01:26:09,425
What were you gonna do
with your fortune?

1273
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:12,560
I don't know.

1274
01:26:12,667 --> 01:26:14,066
I didn't get that far.

1275
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:15,568
Does it really matter?

1276
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:17,638
That's the second time
you've said that.

1277
01:26:17,739 --> 01:26:21,072
I, for one, am glad
you didn't sell this place and move on,

1278
01:26:21,176 --> 01:26:23,736
'cause I'd be stuck out here
in the middle of nowhere tonight

1279
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:25,813
trying to get a new AAA account.

1280
01:26:26,848 --> 01:26:27,906
Yeah, that's true.

1281
01:26:28,016 --> 01:26:29,210
See?

1282
01:26:29,317 --> 01:26:31,308
It was all worth it.

1283
01:26:31,419 --> 01:26:33,910
Thanks.
That changes everything.

1284
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:36,013
Oh, anyway,

1285
01:26:36,124 --> 01:26:37,751
it was... it was good
to talk about it.

1286
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:39,258
So thanks.

1287
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:40,452
Yeah.

1288
01:26:42,363 --> 01:26:44,695
Why don't you hang
out with Jacob, okay?

1289
01:26:44,799 --> 01:26:46,994
I should be able to knock
the rest out myself, okay?

1290
01:26:54,008 --> 01:26:57,375
Your brother just won't have anything
to do with me anymore.

1291
01:26:58,580 --> 01:27:01,105
Think he blames me for your father.

1292
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:03,446
Kevin's too good for all of us now.

1293
01:27:03,551 --> 01:27:06,179
I wouldn't waste my time waiting on him.

1294
01:27:08,323 --> 01:27:10,450
You hear anything from your sister?

1295
01:27:10,558 --> 01:27:11,525
Nope.

1296
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:13,527
Me, neither.

1297
01:27:14,562 --> 01:27:15,756
Three years.

1298
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:21,062
Last I heard,
she was still... dancing.

1299
01:27:22,103 --> 01:27:23,161
The kids used to write me,

1300
01:27:23,271 --> 01:27:25,637
but now I don't know what's going on.

1301
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:26,798
Is that right?

1302
01:27:29,310 --> 01:27:31,471
That girl's had a death wish since junior high.

1303
01:27:31,579 --> 01:27:33,911
I don't know how she made it as far as she did.

1304
01:27:34,015 --> 01:27:36,313
Well, it wasn't really that far.

1305
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:42,223
I'm sorry about you and Heather.

1306
01:27:45,927 --> 01:27:48,487
I wasn't exactly Man of the Year.

1307
01:27:48,596 --> 01:27:51,565
Well, just don't you lose touch with those kids.

1308
01:27:51,666 --> 01:27:54,226
It's no fun when your kids stop talking to you.

1309
01:27:54,335 --> 01:27:56,064
Okay, Ma. I get it.

1310
01:27:57,171 --> 01:27:58,069
I'm just saying.

1311
01:27:58,172 --> 01:27:59,070
I get it.

1312
01:27:59,173 --> 01:28:00,162
All right.

1313
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:01,333
I get it.

1314
01:28:08,449 --> 01:28:11,350
Your cousin Jeff just had another baby.

1315
01:28:11,452 --> 01:28:12,350
What's that, two now?

1316
01:28:12,453 --> 01:28:13,750
That makes four.

1317
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:16,621
I don't know how he affords it.

1318
01:28:16,724 --> 01:28:17,713
I don't know.

1319
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:21,924
I haven't seen it, but I hear it's a beautiful baby.

1320
01:28:23,798 --> 01:28:25,766
You know, Ma, I got a car.

1321
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:30,938
Okay...

1322
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:35,439
If you wanted to go to church, I can take you.

1323
01:28:39,647 --> 01:28:41,114
You'd do that for me?

1324
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:44,212
Right.

1325
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:45,786
If you needed me to.

1326
01:28:48,156 --> 01:28:49,851
Well, that would be wonderful.

1327
01:28:51,059 --> 01:28:52,356
I would like it.

1328
01:28:53,394 --> 01:28:54,759
I really would.

1329
01:28:57,332 --> 01:28:58,799
Would you really do that?

1330
01:29:00,668 --> 01:29:02,135
If you needed me to.

1331
01:29:05,673 --> 01:29:07,470
Would you go inside with me?

1332
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:10,743
I don't know.

1333
01:29:10,845 --> 01:29:13,143
Oh, please. Go inside with me.

1334
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:17,078
If I walk in there, Ma,

1335
01:29:17,185 --> 01:29:19,983
the place might burst into flames.

1336
01:29:26,694 --> 01:29:28,662
I'm gonna go get dressed.

1337
01:29:43,711 --> 01:29:45,008
You look great.

1338
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:49,111
Here. Sorry for the spill.

1339
01:29:50,885 --> 01:29:51,852
Thanks.

1340
01:29:53,221 --> 01:29:55,712
- Your father called those his...
- Church shoes.

1341
01:29:59,894 --> 01:30:01,293
Thank you for this, Lucio.

1342
01:30:01,396 --> 01:30:02,988
You're welcome.

1343
01:30:04,031 --> 01:30:06,693
You'll... You'll take
some of this food, won't you?

1344
01:30:06,801 --> 01:30:09,668
Oh, I don't have
any room for it right now.

1345
01:30:09,771 --> 01:30:12,865
Oh, it's way too much for me. Please take it.

1346
01:30:14,742 --> 01:30:16,903
Maybe you could bring it to church.

1347
01:30:17,011 --> 01:30:18,444
Oh, that's a good idea.

1348
01:30:18,546 --> 01:30:20,537
I'm sure they'll know
somebody who needs it.

1349
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:23,808
Well...

1350
01:30:23,918 --> 01:30:26,318
we should...
we should get going.

1351
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:28,787
Ma, we got a problem.

1352
01:30:28,890 --> 01:30:32,485
I don't have any money.

1353
01:30:32,593 --> 01:30:37,155
If we're gonna go to church,
we'll need gas money.

1354
01:30:39,667 --> 01:30:41,157
I don't have any.

1355
01:30:50,411 --> 01:30:52,072
<i>...the snowman</i>

1356
01:30:52,180 --> 01:30:54,944
<i>Was a jolly, happy soul</i>

1357
01:30:55,049 --> 01:30:57,313
<i>With a corncob pipe and a button...</i>

1358
01:32:09,023 --> 01:32:10,991
Well... that should do it.

1359
01:32:11,092 --> 01:32:13,424
I don't know how to thank you.

1360
01:32:13,528 --> 01:32:15,257
How much do I owe you?

1361
01:32:15,363 --> 01:32:16,557
Come on.

1362
01:32:16,664 --> 01:32:18,291
Kirk, you've gotta let me
give you something.

1363
01:32:18,399 --> 01:32:20,765
Are we leaving?

1364
01:32:20,868 --> 01:32:22,392
Well, it looks that way, honey.

1365
01:32:22,503 --> 01:32:24,130
Why don't you go turn off the TV.

1366
01:32:29,810 --> 01:32:32,472
Just hold on. Hey.

1367
01:32:33,748 --> 01:32:36,273
Look, by law, I can't
give you that card back.

1368
01:32:36,384 --> 01:32:38,318
It's okay. I got cash.

1369
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:40,846
All right.

1370
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:43,789
Oh, you two are back, huh?

1371
01:32:43,891 --> 01:32:45,825
Yeah. Car broke down.

1372
01:32:45,927 --> 01:32:47,952
You've been stuck here
this whole time?

1373
01:32:48,062 --> 01:32:49,120
Yeah.

1374
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:51,596
But, actually, Kirk here just fixed it.

1375
01:32:51,699 --> 01:32:52,757
No charge.

1376
01:32:54,201 --> 01:32:55,361
Free.

1377
01:32:57,071 --> 01:32:58,538
On Christmas Eve.

1378
01:33:00,575 --> 01:33:03,544
Well, not your regular,
uh, gas station, huh?

1379
01:33:06,247 --> 01:33:07,839
Uh... look, if you're gonna make it

1380
01:33:07,949 --> 01:33:09,382
to your parents' place,
you should...

1381
01:33:09,483 --> 01:33:11,314
Oh! My parents.

1382
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:13,683
Oh, we... we were going
up north to my parents'

1383
01:33:13,788 --> 01:33:15,187
for a late dinner, but now...

1384
01:33:15,289 --> 01:33:16,847
Excuse me.
I have to call them.

1385
01:33:16,958 --> 01:33:18,892
- I'm hungry.
- Look, if he's hungry,

1386
01:33:18,993 --> 01:33:20,221
there's plenty in the freezer.

1387
01:33:20,328 --> 01:33:22,990
No, it's fine. We need to get outta your way.

1388
01:33:23,097 --> 01:33:24,064
Excuse me.

1389
01:33:26,734 --> 01:33:28,497
- Candy.
- No.

1390
01:33:32,607 --> 01:33:34,336
Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course.

1391
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:35,773
Pump two.

1392
01:33:36,944 --> 01:33:37,911
Sorry about before.

1393
01:33:42,383 --> 01:33:43,281
Merry Christmas.

1394
01:33:43,384 --> 01:33:44,373
Yep.

1395
01:34:22,990 --> 01:34:25,891
<i>It came upon</i>

1396
01:34:25,993 --> 01:34:29,292

1400
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:42,065
You... I'll be all right.

1401
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:43,973
You two talk about it
and call me back, okay?

1402
01:34:46,514 --> 01:34:48,414
Yes. I will tell him.

1403
01:34:48,516 --> 01:34:50,643
He loves you both, too. Okay.

1404
01:34:51,686 --> 01:34:52,914
Bye.

1405
01:34:54,355 --> 01:34:56,448
We're gonna stay here
for Christmas and be together.

1406
01:34:56,557 --> 01:34:58,923
Our little family, as it should be.

1407
01:34:59,026 --> 01:35:01,460
Good. I'm glad. I'm sure Rick will love that.

1408
01:35:01,562 --> 01:35:03,291
Hey, do me a favor, will you?

1409
01:35:03,397 --> 01:35:05,729
Close up the store and go home.

1410
01:35:05,833 --> 01:35:07,323
It's Christmas Eve.

1411
01:35:09,003 --> 01:35:09,935
Will do.

1412
01:35:10,037 --> 01:35:11,664
Let's go, honey.

1413
01:35:11,772 --> 01:35:13,399
Oh, hey, let... let me walk you out.

1414
01:35:13,507 --> 01:35:14,804
I need to clean up. Okay?

1415
01:35:18,612 --> 01:35:20,273
Merry Christmas, Kirk.

1416
01:35:22,483 --> 01:35:23,472
Merry Christmas, Mary.

1417
01:35:26,887 --> 01:35:27,854
Ready?

1418
01:35:35,062 --> 01:35:38,190
"From my mom and me.
It's really good."

01:39:20,287 --> 01:39:25,281
<i>From heaven's all-gracious King</i>

1428
01:39:27,061 --> 01:39:28,551
<i>The world</i>

1429
01:39:28,662 --> 01:39:33,759
<i>In solemn stillness lay</i>

1430
01:39:33,867 --> 01:39:38,998
<i>To hear the angels sing</i>

1431
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:49,872
<i>Yet with the woes</i>

1432
01:39:49,984 --> 01:39:53,215
<i>Of sin and strife</i>

1433
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:54,719
<i>The world</i>

1434
01:39:54,822 --> 01:39:59,555
<i>Has suffered long</i>

1435
01:39:59,660 --> 01:40:01,252
<i>Beneath</i>

1436
01:40:01,362 --> 01:40:06,163
<i>The angel-strain have rolled</i>

1437
01:40:06,266 --> 01:40:10,965
<i>Two thousand years of wrong</i>

1438
01:40:12,506 --> 01:40:17,500
<i>And man at war with man</i>

1439
01:40:17,611 --> 01:40:19,135
<i>Hears not</i>

1440
01:40:19,246 --> 01:40:21,305
<i>The love song</i>

1441
01:40:21,415 --> 01:40:24,145
<i>Which they bring</i>

1442
01:40:25,853 --> 01:40:29,050
<i>O hush the noise</i>

1443
01:40:29,156 --> 01:40:32,592
<i>Ye men of strife</i>

1444
01:40:32,693 --> 01:40:38,029
<i>And hear the angels sing</i>

1445
01:41:05,359 --> 01:41:07,020
<i>And ye</i>

1446
01:41:07,127 --> 01:41:11,689
<i>Beneath life's crushing load</i>

1447
01:41:11,799 --> 01:41:16,759
<i>Whose forms are bending low</i>

1448
01:41:18,405 --> 01:41:21,465
<i>Who toil along</i>

1449
01:41:21,575 --> 01:41:24,601
<i>The climbing way</i>

1450
01:41:24,711 --> 01:41:27,874
<i>With painful steps</i>

1451
01:41:27,981 --> 01:41:29,949
<i>And slow</i>

1452
01:41:31,085 --> 01:41:32,848
<i>Look now</i>

1453
01:41:32,953 --> 01:41:37,720
<i>For glad and golden hours</i>

1454
01:41:37,825 --> 01:41:39,884
<i>Come swiftly</i>

1455
01:41:39,993 --> 01:41:43,156
<i>On the wing</i>

1456
01:41:44,431 --> 01:41:47,628
<i>O rest beside</i>

1457
01:41:47,734 --> 01:41:50,931
<i>The weary road</i>

1458
01:41:51,038 --> 01:41:56,374
<i>And hear the angels sing</i>

1459
01:41:57,578 --> 01:42:00,911
<i>O rest beside</i>

1460
01:42:01,014 --> 01:42:04,347
<i>The weary road</i>

1461
01:42:04,451 --> 01:42:10,014
<i>And hear the angels sing</i>

1462
01:42:10,124 --> 01:42:13,093
