1
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:46,296
Somebody turned on a light.

2
00:01:47,465 --> 00:01:50,593
<i>It's a faraway light...</i>

3
00:01:50,701 --> 00:01:53,898
<i>but I don't have to be alone</i>
<i>in the dark anymore.</i>

4
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,031
<i>My head hurts.</i>

5
00:02:00,344 --> 00:02:03,142
<i>Somebody's here with me.</i>

6
00:02:03,247 --> 00:02:05,374
<i>Easy. Lie still.</i>

7
00:02:05,483 --> 00:02:07,451
<i>Tell him it hurts.</i>

8
00:02:08,652 --> 00:02:11,348
<i>Why can't I talk?</i>

9
00:02:11,455 --> 00:02:14,117
<i>Doc, look at me.</i>
<i>Look at me hard.</i>

10
00:02:14,225 --> 00:02:16,489
See it in my eyes.
I need somebody.

11
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:18,562
<i>It hurts me.</i>

12
00:02:20,631 --> 00:02:23,191
<i>Help me.</i>

13
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,428
He came to a little while ago.
Seems to be in a lot of pain.

14
00:02:26,537 --> 00:02:29,870
He'd be letting you know it, too,
if his jaw weren't bandaged so tightly.

15
00:02:29,974 --> 00:02:33,501
Let's control the pain. Quarter grain M.S.
every four hours, more often if necessary.

16
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:36,136
- Yes, sir.
<i>- What's happened to me?</i>

17
00:02:36,247 --> 00:02:39,148
<i>What am I doing here...</i>

18
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,718
<i>when I don't even know</i>
<i>where I am?</i>

19
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:45,118
- Is he gonna be all right, Doc?
- Taylor? Every chance in the world.

20
00:02:45,222 --> 00:02:47,122
It was a pretty tough
job though.

21
00:02:47,224 --> 00:02:50,557
- He must have been right on top
of that grenade when it blew.
- He was.

22
00:02:50,661 --> 00:02:53,494
- How's he gonna be, Doc?
- In time, as good as ever.

23
00:02:53,597 --> 00:02:57,556
That's good enough. Nothing but
clean sheets from here on in, Taylor.

24
00:02:57,668 --> 00:03:00,262
<i>- You're gonna be okay now.</i>
- Taylor. Who's Taylor?

25
00:03:00,371 --> 00:03:02,339
So he's okay now.
So what?

26
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:04,805
<i>What about me?</i>
<i>What about me?</i>

27
00:03:06,544 --> 00:03:09,274
<i>I don't know my name.</i>

28
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:15,114
<i>You. Talk to me. Act like I was alive,</i>
<i>notjust somebody with eyes and no name.</i>

29
00:03:15,219 --> 00:03:18,211
<i>Think of a name.</i>
<i>Taylor.</i>

30
00:03:18,322 --> 00:03:20,722
<i>Think of another name.</i>
<i>There must be other names.</i>

31
00:03:20,824 --> 00:03:23,418
<i>Taylor. No.</i>

32
00:03:24,562 --> 00:03:27,793
<i>Taylor. No.</i>

33
00:03:27,898 --> 00:03:30,230
Taylor. Taylor.

34
00:03:30,334 --> 00:03:32,962
<i>Taylor.</i>

35
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,038
<i>Taylor.</i>

36
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:36,574
<i>Taylor.</i>

37
00:03:36,574 --> 00:03:37,097
<i>Taylor.</i>

38
00:03:43,614 --> 00:03:45,582
Good morning.

39
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,790
Good morning.

40
00:03:54,892 --> 00:03:58,828
It is one too. One of Honolulu's
finest summer mornings.

41
00:03:58,929 --> 00:04:01,830
Why not take a look at it?

42
00:04:01,932 --> 00:04:03,900
Come on. Try.

43
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:11,169
See that tree? There's one just like it
outside my window back home.

44
00:04:11,275 --> 00:04:14,267
<i>I'll bet there's one</i>
<i>you remember too.</i>

45
00:04:14,378 --> 00:04:17,347
<i>The doctor said that you're to</i>
<i>sit up for a while today.</i>

46
00:04:17,448 --> 00:04:19,507
Your jaw's knitting
beautifully.

47
00:04:19,617 --> 00:04:22,484
The wires will come out
in a day or two.

48
00:04:22,586 --> 00:04:25,180
When you get tired,
rap on the nightstand.

49
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:28,190
It won't be long
before you'll be able to call for me.

50
00:04:28,292 --> 00:04:30,283
I'll bet that'll be
a relief.

51
00:04:31,762 --> 00:04:34,094
<i>I'll call all right. I'll yell.</i>

52
00:04:34,198 --> 00:04:36,792
<i>I'll want to know why</i>
<i>they call me George Taylor.</i>

53
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,993
<i>Who's George Taylor,</i>
<i>and who am I?</i>

54
00:04:39,103 --> 00:04:41,401
<i>For all I know,</i>
<i>that's the first tree I ever saw.</i>

55
00:04:41,505 --> 00:04:43,735
<i>Still, that's what it is.</i>
<i>That's what I call it.</i>

56
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:47,641
<i>They call me Taylor.</i>
<i>So for all I know, I am Taylor.</i>

57
00:04:48,946 --> 00:04:51,972
I've gotta take time, work on it.

58
00:04:52,082 --> 00:04:54,744
Time to think. Hard.

59
00:04:54,852 --> 00:04:56,820
Now I'm tired.

60
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,822
Where's the nurse?
The nightstand, rap on it.

61
00:05:04,662 --> 00:05:08,564
What's that? A wallet.

62
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:11,396
Must be my wallet.

63
00:05:11,502 --> 00:05:14,369
Yeah. There I am again.

64
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:16,405
That's me all right.

65
00:05:16,507 --> 00:05:19,305
Good old George Taylor.

66
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,503
How have you been, George?

67
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,718
"These are
my last words to you.

68
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:32,778
"That's why I write them. So that I can
always be sure that these were my last.

69
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:36,485
"But I despise you now,
and the memory of you.

70
00:05:36,593 --> 00:05:39,153
"But I'm ashamed
for having loved you.

71
00:05:39,263 --> 00:05:41,424
"And I shall pray
as long as I live...

72
00:05:41,532 --> 00:05:44,865
"for someone or something
to hurt and destroy you-

73
00:05:44,968 --> 00:05:46,993
"make you want to die...

74
00:05:47,104 --> 00:05:49,038
as you have me."

75
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:51,164
Who writes letters like this?

76
00:05:51,275 --> 00:05:53,175
Who do they write them to?

77
00:05:53,277 --> 00:05:56,075
Men they despise,
whose memories they despise.

78
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,080
The memory I haven't got.

79
00:05:58,182 --> 00:06:01,743
Won't be long, and I'll have to talk.
Think fast. Now they only know my name.

80
00:06:01,852 --> 00:06:03,911
If I tell 'em I don't remember,
they'll backtrack.

81
00:06:04,021 --> 00:06:06,387
They'll dig up that memory
and throw it in my face.

82
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:10,358
I've forgotten that man. Somebody's praying
for him to be hurt and want to die.

83
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:13,919
I won't let them know I can't remember.
I won't let them dig him up!

84
00:06:31,448 --> 00:06:33,678
Taylor, George W.

85
00:06:43,961 --> 00:06:47,021
Hello, Taylor.
Sit down.

86
00:06:47,131 --> 00:06:51,295
You're now in the process of being separated
from the armed forces of the United States.

87
00:06:51,401 --> 00:06:54,529
<i>You feel you have a right to know answers</i>
<i>to a lot of questions...</i>

88
00:06:54,638 --> 00:06:56,868
<i>about yourself</i>
<i>and how you'll fit into civilian life.</i>

89
00:06:56,974 --> 00:07:00,967
Those questions need not necessarily
be restricted to the G.I. Bill of Rights...

90
00:07:01,078 --> 00:07:03,740
employment, insurance
and such.

91
00:07:03,847 --> 00:07:06,645
Oh, by the way.
Before I forget.

92
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,877
<i>Your seabag,</i>
<i>it's been located.</i>

93
00:07:08,986 --> 00:07:13,013
- Any change in your civilian address?
- My civilian address.

94
00:07:13,123 --> 00:07:15,887
I could ask one of the boys
to drop it off.

95
00:07:15,993 --> 00:07:19,952
I'll, uh-
Maybe I'd better pick it up myself.

96
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:23,863
Well, why wait around? It might be
this afternoon, it might be a couple of days.

97
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:27,232
<i>I imagine you'll be wanting to</i>
<i>get back to Los Angeles.</i>

98
00:07:27,337 --> 00:07:29,737
We could have it
delivered to the, uh...

99
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,536
<i>Martin Hotel.</i>

100
00:07:32,643 --> 00:07:35,111
<i>Will you be going back there?</i>

101
00:07:35,212 --> 00:07:39,148
Martin Hotel.
In Los Angeles. Yes.

102
00:07:39,249 --> 00:07:41,217
I'll be going back there.

103
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,691
Can you give me
some information?

104
00:07:58,802 --> 00:08:02,932
- That depends.
- A man named George Taylor
lived here three years ago.

105
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,204
It must have been in January. Did he give
an address he had before he came here?

106
00:08:07,311 --> 00:08:09,211
Or did he leave
a forwarding address?

107
00:08:09,313 --> 00:08:11,406
- We're not supposed to-
- It's kind of important.

108
00:08:11,515 --> 00:08:13,483
Yeah?

109
00:08:18,522 --> 00:08:21,423
Summer, 1942.

110
00:08:23,193 --> 00:08:25,457
January, 1943.

111
00:08:25,562 --> 00:08:28,759
"T," "T," "T."
Taylor.

112
00:08:28,866 --> 00:08:31,596
- Did you say George Taylor?
- Yes.

113
00:08:31,702 --> 00:08:35,229
Afraid you have the wrong hotel, son.
There's no George Taylor in our books.

114
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:37,330
Well, maybe it was November
or February.

115
00:08:37,441 --> 00:08:40,239
This runs through from July to July,
and there's no George Taylor.

116
00:08:40,344 --> 00:08:42,505
I'm sorry, son.

117
00:08:42,613 --> 00:08:44,706
What's the matter?
Aren't you feeling all right?

118
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:47,545
Yeah. I... I guess
I just made a mistake.

119
00:08:47,651 --> 00:08:51,781
I thought, uh-Well, I see you got
the Purple Heart, and I thought that maybe-

120
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:53,789
No, no. It's okay.

121
00:08:53,891 --> 00:08:57,691
- I don't suppose you've got a vacancy, have you?
- We're all filled.

122
00:08:57,794 --> 00:09:00,388
- Always one or two.
- Thank you.

123
00:09:00,497 --> 00:09:03,159
Our, uh- Our bellboys
are all out of the army...

124
00:09:03,267 --> 00:09:07,533
but they still ain't convinced
they won't get jobs as bank presidents.

125
00:09:07,638 --> 00:09:11,938
- It's, uh, 618, straight ahead
as you get off the elevator.
- Thank you.

126
00:09:12,042 --> 00:09:15,478
And, uh, I'm sorry about
not finding your friend.

127
00:09:28,091 --> 00:09:30,457
Yeah. This is it all right.

128
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,085
That'll be 13.60
storage charges.

129
00:09:33,196 --> 00:09:36,029
Three years and seven months
it's been laying here.

130
00:09:36,133 --> 00:09:38,795
Another five months,
and it'd have been sold for the charges.

131
00:09:38,902 --> 00:09:42,030
That's the longest I ever heard of
anybody checking a briefcase.

132
00:09:44,474 --> 00:09:47,307
Even a trunk-
Unless it had a body in it.

133
00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:51,606
Hey.

134
00:11:08,658 --> 00:11:10,626
Larry Cravat?

135
00:11:11,895 --> 00:11:14,295
"Your pal,
Larry Cravat."

136
00:11:54,237 --> 00:11:56,637
Thank you very much, sir.
Come again.

137
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,436
And I'll be sure
and send that uniform.

138
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:26,901
I'm George Taylor. I just got out of
the marines. I've got an account here.

139
00:12:27,003 --> 00:12:28,971
Here's my identification.

140
00:12:29,072 --> 00:12:31,097
I'd like some money.

141
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:34,644
Of course. I'll check the account
and have it for you in a moment.

142
00:12:36,847 --> 00:12:38,781
Larry Cravat.

143
00:12:38,882 --> 00:12:42,545
My friend who opened the account for me.
Could you give me his present mailing address?

144
00:12:42,652 --> 00:12:46,110
Cravat.
Larry Cravat. Sure.

145
00:12:54,564 --> 00:12:57,465
- If you'll pardon me a minute, Mr. Taylor.
<i>- Anything the matter?</i>

146
00:13:10,347 --> 00:13:12,338
What's going on?
Isn't the account all right?

147
00:13:12,449 --> 00:13:14,383
It's perfectly all right,
Mr. Taylor.

148
00:13:14,484 --> 00:13:16,884
If you need any more identification,
I have my discharge-

149
00:13:16,987 --> 00:13:19,956
- If you'll just wait a minute.
- Wait? For what?

150
00:13:20,056 --> 00:13:22,684
If you don't mind, there's some questions
we'd like to ask you.

151
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:25,955
- Questions? I don't get it.
<i>- It'll just take a minute, Mr. Taylor.</i>

152
00:13:26,062 --> 00:13:28,257
It'll have to be
some other time.

153
00:14:03,366 --> 00:14:06,267
Maybe I can help you.

154
00:14:06,369 --> 00:14:10,499
I was looking for Cravat,
Larry Cravat.

155
00:14:10,607 --> 00:14:13,337
What made you think
he was hiding in the desk?

156
00:14:13,443 --> 00:14:15,968
Well, I got a letter
from Cravat on your stationery.

157
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,742
Lots of people use our paper.
Nobody here by such a name.

158
00:14:22,619 --> 00:14:25,588
The letter was written three years ago.
Maybe he worked here then.

159
00:14:25,689 --> 00:14:28,556
I was working here then.
I don't know no Larry Cravat.

160
00:14:28,658 --> 00:14:33,459
- Maybe he used to come in a lot.
Maybe somebody else knows him.
- Nobody else is here but me.

161
00:14:35,565 --> 00:14:39,126
He might come in again. Will you tell him to
get in touch with me? It's very important.

162
00:14:39,236 --> 00:14:41,136
George Taylor
at the Martin Hotel.

163
00:14:41,238 --> 00:14:43,399
George Taylor,
the Martin Hotel.

164
00:14:43,506 --> 00:14:45,667
Thanks.

165
00:14:45,775 --> 00:14:49,711
<i>Hey, uh, maybe you oughta</i>
<i>try around the corner.</i>

166
00:14:49,813 --> 00:14:52,646
- What's around the corner?
- Café. Called the Cellar.

167
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:54,683
Because it's in a cellar.

168
00:14:54,784 --> 00:14:58,151
Lots of guys get loaded there
and then come over here to sweat it out.

169
00:14:58,255 --> 00:15:01,053
- Maybe you oughta ask there about your pal.
- What time's it open?

170
00:15:01,157 --> 00:15:03,284
How do I know?
When it gets dark.

171
00:15:03,393 --> 00:15:05,361
Thanks. I'll try it.

172
00:15:30,787 --> 00:15:33,187
- Larry Cravat come in yet, honey?
- Larry Cravat?

173
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,282
- I'm sorry. I wouldn't know.
- Thanks anyway.

174
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:41,997
- Good evening, sir.
- Mr. Cravat's table.

175
00:15:42,098 --> 00:15:46,432
- Mr. Cravat. With a "C" or a "K"?
- "C."

176
00:15:46,536 --> 00:15:49,471
I'm very sorry. Mr. Cravat has
no reservation this evening.

177
00:15:49,572 --> 00:15:53,008
- Well, he might have forgot.
I'll wait for him at the bar.
- Thank you.

178
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,384
Thank you, Mr. Mitchell.

179
00:16:02,952 --> 00:16:04,852
Mr. Mitchell
anybody special?

180
00:16:04,954 --> 00:16:07,980
- He's a customer.
- You must know a lot of customers.

181
00:16:08,091 --> 00:16:10,651
- You must know a lot of names.
- Enough. What'll you have?

182
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,729
You name it.

183
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:17,391
- Been around here a long time?
- Ever since they took the bars off the door.

184
00:16:19,135 --> 00:16:22,002
Friend of mine used to come in a lot.
Maybe you know him.

185
00:16:22,105 --> 00:16:24,835
Larry Cravat?

186
00:16:24,941 --> 00:16:30,709
I, uh, used to know a Larry Cashman,
but that ain't Cravat.

187
00:16:30,814 --> 00:16:33,442
Well, maybe you could ask around.

188
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:36,144
Maybe some of the other boys
would know him.

189
00:16:37,787 --> 00:16:41,587
Could be.
I'll, uh, ask around, Mr. -

190
00:16:41,691 --> 00:16:43,716
Taylor. George Taylor.

191
00:16:43,827 --> 00:16:46,728
I'll ask around, Mr. Taylor.

192
00:18:16,853 --> 00:18:18,821
You forgot to knock.

193
00:18:18,922 --> 00:18:20,685
I can explain
if you'll let me.

194
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,884
Out.

195
00:18:23,993 --> 00:18:26,052
Not right now.

196
00:18:27,964 --> 00:18:29,864
- Get out of here.
- I'm sorry.

197
00:18:29,966 --> 00:18:33,629
- Suppose I yell the roof off.
- Then I'd have to stop you.

198
00:18:33,736 --> 00:18:36,261
I bet you'd try,
at that.

199
00:18:36,372 --> 00:18:40,399
You know, I can't make up my mind whether
this is a pitch or you're some kind of a nut.

200
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:44,310
- But if this is your idea of a
pitch, then I know you're a nut.
- Who owns this place?

201
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,314
- Who wants to know?
- I do.

202
00:18:48,318 --> 00:18:53,085
This and a half a dozen other spots are owned by
a very nice guy named Mel Phillips.

203
00:18:53,189 --> 00:18:56,181
He keeps me working.
Have you got a match?

204
00:18:56,292 --> 00:18:58,453
He must keep
a lot of people working.

205
00:18:58,561 --> 00:19:00,495
All kinds of people.

206
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:03,498
Sure. Busboys, waiters,
captains, cooks.

207
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,501
Characters that sit around
on barstools waiting for me.

208
00:19:08,938 --> 00:19:11,930
- Is that supposed to make sense?
- What do you think?

209
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:19,571
In about two minutes, a bouncer is
coming back in here with no sense of humor.

210
00:19:19,682 --> 00:19:23,709
He's a foot bigger than you in all directions.
That's what I think.

211
00:19:42,005 --> 00:19:45,736
"Christy darling,
by the time you get this, I'll be Mrs. Larry Cravat.

212
00:19:45,842 --> 00:19:47,810
Mary."

213
00:20:37,093 --> 00:20:40,494
Thank you.
How terribly gauche of me.

214
00:20:40,597 --> 00:20:44,260
- Not at all.
- Do you happen to know when Larry will be back?

215
00:20:44,367 --> 00:20:47,564
- Larry who?
- Thompson. Larry Thompson.

216
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:50,696
He's my uncle.
He lives just down the hall.

217
00:20:50,807 --> 00:20:53,674
- Sorry. I don't.
- I couldn't be more fâchée.

218
00:20:53,776 --> 00:20:57,371
After all, a lady shouldn't have to wait
at all for a gentlemen - even her uncle.

219
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,847
Much less in a public hallway
with no place to sit down...

220
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,043
to wait for Larry.

221
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:07,389
There's a place to sit down
in my room.

222
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:10,823
How nice of you
to suggest it.

223
00:21:23,139 --> 00:21:26,506
This is rather exciting.
Unconventional, to say the least.

224
00:21:26,609 --> 00:21:29,772
Haven't you got
a French word for it?

225
00:21:29,879 --> 00:21:33,645
Should we just abandon convention
and introduce ourselves?

226
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,741
- My name's Phyllis.
- Phyllis what?

227
00:21:39,922 --> 00:21:42,117
Oh, I imagine
it's one of those things.

228
00:21:42,225 --> 00:21:44,216
Rich, high-class family
wouldn't want it known...

229
00:21:44,327 --> 00:21:46,261
their daughter waited
around crummy hotel halls.

230
00:21:46,362 --> 00:21:50,765
<i>- Is that it?</i>
- Well, that's putting it a little crudely.

231
00:21:55,304 --> 00:21:57,864
Not too rich
and high-class.

232
00:21:57,974 --> 00:22:01,375
A compact that cost three bucks tops,
a torn hem on your skirt...

233
00:22:01,477 --> 00:22:03,570
a matchfolder that says
you eat at a cheap cafeteria...

234
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:07,241
and you weren't waiting
for anybody but me.

235
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:11,218
Unless you can see through a door.
You should have thought of that when I closed it.

236
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,220
So, what goes?

237
00:22:13,322 --> 00:22:16,519
You know, there's been
a terrible shortage of men.

238
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,526
Yeah. So we heard
in the Pacific.

239
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,892
This war must have been
murder on you poor women.

240
00:22:20,997 --> 00:22:22,897
We used to cry
our eyes out about it.

241
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:25,160
So, when I heard there was
a man in 618-

242
00:22:25,268 --> 00:22:27,361
- You thought he might know where Larry was.
- Yeah.

243
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:31,133
Only there isn't any Larry. It's just a name
that you made up to start me talking.

244
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,108
- About what?
- Oh, just this and tha. Quelque chose.

245
00:22:35,211 --> 00:22:38,374
Maybe I just thought
you ought to know about me and that...

246
00:22:38,481 --> 00:22:40,449
I ought to know about you.

247
00:22:46,956 --> 00:22:51,620
- Did you have fun?
- I've had more fun drinking a bromo seltzer.

248
00:23:03,606 --> 00:23:07,975
- Hello.
- This is the barkeep at the Cellar.

249
00:23:08,077 --> 00:23:11,945
I got that information you wanted about...
that certain party.

250
00:23:12,048 --> 00:23:14,744
- About Larry Cravat?
- We're closing up now.

251
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:17,411
You come down here,
I can answer some questions.

252
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,422
- You can answer one right now.
Who told you where to reach me?
- I'll wait for ya.

253
00:23:21,524 --> 00:23:24,584
- Come in the front way.
- Yeah, but I never told you where I...

254
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:18,647
Taylor.

255
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:22,817
Somebody wants to see ya.

256
00:24:44,407 --> 00:24:46,341
How do you do,
Mr. Taylor?

257
00:24:46,442 --> 00:24:48,410
Nice of you to come.
Please get in.

258
00:24:48,511 --> 00:24:51,446
Hubert, open the door
for Mr. Taylor.

259
00:24:52,481 --> 00:24:54,540
I didn't come here
to meet you.

260
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:57,585
True. But I came here
to meet you.

261
00:24:57,687 --> 00:24:59,814
Professor Einstein
to the contrary...

262
00:24:59,922 --> 00:25:01,890
there is just so much time.

263
00:25:01,991 --> 00:25:04,459
Every moment gone
is a moment gone.

264
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,528
Please. Step in.

265
00:25:08,731 --> 00:25:11,222
- Why?
- Get in the car.

266
00:25:11,334 --> 00:25:13,234
<i>The bartender was paid</i>
<i>to call you...</i>

267
00:25:13,336 --> 00:25:15,497
to arrange
this rendezvous.

268
00:25:15,605 --> 00:25:19,541
He has long since gone home to his wife,
his bed and his racing form.

269
00:25:19,642 --> 00:25:23,806
<i>- You and I have much to talk about.</i>
- What, for instance?

270
00:25:23,913 --> 00:25:26,313
Are you being stupid, Mr. Taylor,
or stubborn?

271
00:25:26,415 --> 00:25:29,509
- What, for instance?
- I can't believe you're stupid.

272
00:25:30,553 --> 00:25:33,351
Larry Cravat then,
for instance.

273
00:25:33,456 --> 00:25:36,653
- What about Larry Cravat?
- That was going to be my question to you.

274
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:39,818
- You tell me.
- Come.

275
00:25:39,929 --> 00:25:42,397
Sit beside me,
and we tell each other.

276
00:25:42,498 --> 00:25:44,557
I'll listen from here.

277
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:46,828
Not stupid...

278
00:25:46,936 --> 00:25:48,904
but stubborn.

279
00:26:07,223 --> 00:26:10,681
<i>Mr. Taylor, are you ready to tell me</i>
<i>the whereabouts of Larry Cravat?</i>

280
00:26:15,631 --> 00:26:17,599
Then will you tell me...

281
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,725
why you want to know?

282
00:26:22,605 --> 00:26:26,268
I'm just looking for him.
He's my friend.

283
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:28,502
Larry Cravat has no friends...

284
00:26:28,611 --> 00:26:31,079
and you are to stop looking for him,
Mr. Taylor.

285
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:34,206
Do you understand?
You are to stop looking for him!

286
00:26:36,585 --> 00:26:40,817
- Take him out of here. Dump him someplace.
- Where, boss?

287
00:26:40,923 --> 00:26:42,948
There was an address
in his pocket.

288
00:26:45,428 --> 00:26:48,056
"723 Gramercy Place."

289
00:26:49,165 --> 00:26:51,133
Take him there.

290
00:27:20,062 --> 00:27:22,724
Okay. Okay. I quit.

291
00:27:35,511 --> 00:27:37,570
Now what?

292
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,148
How does the inside
of your mouth feel?

293
00:27:40,249 --> 00:27:42,513
Like it's full of
raw hamburger.

294
00:27:42,618 --> 00:27:44,586
That's just what
it looked like.

295
00:27:44,687 --> 00:27:47,247
- What did they hit you with?
- Rubber hose.

296
00:27:49,392 --> 00:27:53,158
- I can't figure you out.
- You're not an open book, exactly.

297
00:27:53,262 --> 00:27:55,230
Why did you steal
Mary's picture?

298
00:27:55,331 --> 00:27:58,061
Well, for one thing,
she's married to a man I'm looking for.

299
00:27:58,167 --> 00:28:00,067
She's Mrs. Larry Cravat.

300
00:28:00,169 --> 00:28:02,660
If you even knew Mary,
then what you just said...

301
00:28:02,772 --> 00:28:05,707
is as dirty and rotten
as anything I've ever heard.

302
00:28:05,808 --> 00:28:08,242
I don't know her, but if she's
Mrs. Larry Cravat, I want to.

303
00:28:08,344 --> 00:28:10,574
- You can't.
- I've got to.

304
00:28:16,719 --> 00:28:19,950
Mary was my closest friend.
She was my partner.

305
00:28:20,056 --> 00:28:23,423
I went home one Christmas,
and she wrote to me.

306
00:28:23,526 --> 00:28:25,619
In one letter,
she met Larry Cravat.

307
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:28,253
In the next,
she was in love with him.

308
00:28:28,364 --> 00:28:30,389
The third had
that picture in it.

309
00:28:32,735 --> 00:28:36,296
I received one more letter
from her after that.

310
00:28:36,405 --> 00:28:40,364
She waited three hours at the city hall,
but he never showed up.

311
00:28:40,476 --> 00:28:43,912
When I came back, she was dead.
An accident.

312
00:28:45,514 --> 00:28:49,848
She didn't look where
she was going when she crossed the street.

313
00:28:49,952 --> 00:28:52,477
She couldn't see.
She had her heart in her eyes.

314
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:00,128
I'd like to meet
Larry Cravat someday.

315
00:29:01,497 --> 00:29:04,159
Quite a character.

316
00:29:04,266 --> 00:29:06,166
I'd like to meet him too.

317
00:29:06,268 --> 00:29:09,499
So would the boys in the back room.
They didn't believe I didn't know where he was.

318
00:29:09,605 --> 00:29:11,505
Why do you
want to meet him?

319
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:16,335
I think I'll go now.

320
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,841
<i>How far do you think</i>
<i>you'll get?</i>

321
00:29:19,949 --> 00:29:23,976
The nearest foxhole maybe. They'll be
watching my hotel - all sorts of people.

322
00:29:24,086 --> 00:29:26,111
What's your name?

323
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,417
Taylor. George Taylor.

324
00:29:28,524 --> 00:29:31,049
It's all over town.
I may run for dogcatcher.

325
00:29:33,562 --> 00:29:35,826
Look, I've gotta
talk to somebody.

326
00:29:35,931 --> 00:29:38,422
I'll go crazy
if I don't talk to somebody.

327
00:29:38,534 --> 00:29:40,525
I'm somebody.

328
00:29:40,636 --> 00:29:42,604
I think you are.

329
00:29:43,939 --> 00:29:45,907
What do you know
about amnesia?

330
00:29:47,042 --> 00:29:49,476
Not much. Something
that happens to you.

331
00:29:49,578 --> 00:29:52,741
You forget who you are
or where you belong.

332
00:29:52,848 --> 00:29:55,476
- Isn't that it?
- Yeah.

333
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:58,519
Every now and then you read about it
in the newspaper-

334
00:29:58,621 --> 00:30:01,385
a guy named John Doe
was picked up in a fog.

335
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:04,220
Never happens
to anybody you know.

336
00:30:04,326 --> 00:30:06,692
It happened to me.

337
00:30:06,795 --> 00:30:10,526
Yeah. For all I know,
I might have been born six months ago.

338
00:30:10,633 --> 00:30:13,761
That's a joke because six months ago
I woke up in a hospital.

339
00:30:13,869 --> 00:30:16,633
That's where babies
are born, in a hospital.

340
00:30:16,739 --> 00:30:21,472
Only this was different. It was in the South Pacific,
and it wasn't the maternity ward.

341
00:30:23,012 --> 00:30:24,946
My jaw was wired.
I couldn't talk.

342
00:30:25,047 --> 00:30:28,380
I couldn't ask who I was.
I... I nearly went nuts.

343
00:30:28,484 --> 00:30:31,146
Then I found my wallet.

344
00:30:31,253 --> 00:30:35,747
There was a letter in it. No name. No signature.
Just a letter.

345
00:30:35,858 --> 00:30:37,849
It-

346
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,520
It told me about myself.
It told me good.

347
00:30:40,629 --> 00:30:43,120
From then on I lived
with that letter.

348
00:30:43,232 --> 00:30:47,032
It went around in my head like a crazy squirrel
on a hopped-up treadmill.

349
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,104
I was scared,
and I was sick.

350
00:30:49,205 --> 00:30:51,730
Sick to my heart at what
the letter said I was like...

351
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,774
and scared of anybody
finding it out.

352
00:30:53,876 --> 00:30:57,573
Scared I'd find it out myself.
I didn't want to know anymore.

353
00:30:58,681 --> 00:31:00,876
So I kept my mouth shut.

354
00:31:00,983 --> 00:31:04,441
I got away with it,
got my discharge.

355
00:31:05,988 --> 00:31:09,981
And I thought maybe I could start
with a brand-new scorepad.

356
00:31:10,092 --> 00:31:12,219
But you can't just
throw away-

357
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:17,597
How many years of living?
I don't even know.

358
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:21,466
Do you know what it's like, Christy,
to be alone in the world?

359
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:23,470
Really alone
in the whole world.

360
00:31:23,572 --> 00:31:26,564
A billion people,
and every one of them a stranger.

361
00:31:28,077 --> 00:31:30,136
Or what's worse,
not a stranger.

362
00:31:30,246 --> 00:31:33,841
Somebody maybe
who knows you, hates you...

363
00:31:33,949 --> 00:31:35,917
wants you to die.

364
00:31:36,018 --> 00:31:39,476
Then last night I found
another letter.

365
00:31:39,588 --> 00:31:42,022
This one was from
Larry Cravat.

366
00:31:42,124 --> 00:31:44,092
It said he was my pal.

367
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:47,219
Imagine, I had a pal.

368
00:31:48,497 --> 00:31:51,159
So I started
looking for him.

369
00:31:51,267 --> 00:31:53,963
That was this morning.

370
00:31:54,069 --> 00:31:57,232
Since then, I've been
chased by hoodlums, beaten up.

371
00:31:59,742 --> 00:32:01,937
That's quite a pal
you're looking for.

372
00:32:02,044 --> 00:32:04,604
I can't be choosy.
He's the only one I've got.

373
00:32:04,713 --> 00:32:08,740
It's like that joke about the crooked
gambling house. He's the only one in town.

374
00:32:10,185 --> 00:32:12,244
So why don't I go find
another town?

375
00:32:12,354 --> 00:32:14,618
- You mean run away and hide?
- Why not?

376
00:32:14,723 --> 00:32:16,748
Sure. Why not?

377
00:32:16,859 --> 00:32:19,692
So I'll be alone for a while.
It won't be for long.

378
00:32:19,795 --> 00:32:21,729
I'll make up a story
for myself.

379
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:24,298
I got away with it before.
I can do it again.

380
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,335
I'll go where people will believe me,
where they'll leave me alone.

381
00:32:27,436 --> 00:32:29,734
Where I won't have to answer questions
and ask 'em.

382
00:32:29,838 --> 00:32:33,706
As long as you believe yourself and leave
yourself alone and not ask yourself questions.

383
00:32:33,809 --> 00:32:36,437
I'm tired of being pushed around.
The war's over for me.

384
00:32:36,545 --> 00:32:39,378
- I don't have to live afraid anymore.
- Except when you're by yourself.

385
00:32:39,481 --> 00:32:41,642
And alone.

386
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:45,151
I've got to find that guy.
Even if he's the heel of the world...

387
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:47,415
I've got to find him,
because he knows about me.

388
00:32:50,092 --> 00:32:52,720
What am I gonna do,
Christy?

389
00:32:53,996 --> 00:32:56,294
You'll keep swinging.

390
00:32:56,398 --> 00:32:57,866
Something's got to break.

391
00:32:57,866 --> 00:32:58,491
Something's got to break.

392
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,500
Who's that?

393
00:33:00,602 --> 00:33:03,230
Take it easy.
Maybe this is the break.

394
00:33:03,339 --> 00:33:06,433
I forgot to tell you. I phoned
Mel Phillips while you were out...

395
00:33:06,542 --> 00:33:08,908
- and asked him to come over.
- Why?

396
00:33:10,112 --> 00:33:12,945
Because I want him to
beat you up some more.

397
00:33:16,685 --> 00:33:18,846
- Hi, Mel.
- Hello, Chris. What's the trouble?

398
00:33:18,954 --> 00:33:20,922
It's in there.

399
00:33:24,727 --> 00:33:26,786
George Taylor,
Mel Phillips.

400
00:33:26,895 --> 00:33:28,920
This is the character
I phoned you about...

401
00:33:29,031 --> 00:33:32,364
the one that keeps falling through doors
with me on the other side.

402
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:34,402
- Hello, Taylor.
- Hello.

403
00:33:34,503 --> 00:33:36,403
Some hot coffee, Mel?

404
00:33:36,505 --> 00:33:38,530
- Thanks, Chris. No sugar.
- I know.

405
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,041
I understand your trouble started
at one of my places. The Cellar.

406
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:45,170
- Do you want to tell me what happened?
- It's all right.

407
00:33:46,849 --> 00:33:49,443
You may have heard
I don't like that sort of thing.

408
00:33:49,551 --> 00:33:52,452
I've kept the hoodlums out of my clubs,
and they're gonna stay out.

409
00:33:52,554 --> 00:33:55,455
- I'd appreciate your telling me what happened.
- It's all right. Forget it.

410
00:33:55,557 --> 00:33:59,186
I called Mel before
you told me about things.

411
00:33:59,294 --> 00:34:01,387
Thank you, Chris.

412
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:04,830
If you make up your mind to stay around,
I'm sure he can help you.

413
00:34:07,703 --> 00:34:10,171
All right, Taylor.
Will you help me?

414
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,974
There's a reason
I was so late getting here, Chris.

415
00:34:14,076 --> 00:34:15,976
The police called
just after you did.

416
00:34:16,078 --> 00:34:18,808
<i>One of my bartenders</i>
<i>was found in the vacant lot.</i>

417
00:34:18,914 --> 00:34:21,644
- They figure he was dumped out of a car.
- Which bartender?

418
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,843
<i>- John.</i>
- Was he the one I talked to?

419
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:30,858
I asked him if he knew
a man I was looking for.

420
00:34:30,959 --> 00:34:34,360
After that, he set me up with the two characters
that chased me to Christy's room.

421
00:34:34,463 --> 00:34:36,488
Who was the man
you were looking for?

422
00:34:36,598 --> 00:34:40,864
Name's Larry Cravat.
He's beginning to bore me.

423
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:45,736
Larry Cravat. That's funny.
I think I know it, but I can't place it.

424
00:34:45,841 --> 00:34:48,639
- What does he do?
- I don't know.

425
00:34:48,744 --> 00:34:51,679
Whatever he does,
he seems to keep pretty busy.

426
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:54,510
Why are you
looking for him?

427
00:34:54,616 --> 00:34:58,484
- I just want to find him.
- Private reasons?

428
00:34:58,587 --> 00:35:00,680
They're good enough.

429
00:35:00,789 --> 00:35:03,417
Well, anyway, there are two of us
looking for him now.

430
00:35:03,525 --> 00:35:06,722
- There are more than two of us, Mr. Phillips.
- The police, for instance?

431
00:35:06,829 --> 00:35:10,321
- Maybe.
- Any reason why we can't go ask them?

432
00:35:10,432 --> 00:35:13,299
They might want to know
who's asking and why.

433
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:17,168
Which takes us back
to the private reasons.

434
00:35:17,272 --> 00:35:20,469
Look, Taylor.
If I go to the police, and I probably will...

435
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:23,704
<i>- don't worry about my bringing you into it.</i>
- I appreciate that.

436
00:35:25,781 --> 00:35:29,046
I could put you in touch with a friend of mine.
He's a police lieutenant.

437
00:35:29,151 --> 00:35:32,245
His name is Kendall. He's an all right guy.
He'd keep it off the record.

438
00:35:32,354 --> 00:35:34,788
Thanks just the same.

439
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:36,915
Do what you can though,
will you, Mel?

440
00:35:37,025 --> 00:35:39,619
- You know I will, Chris.
- That's my boy.

441
00:35:39,728 --> 00:35:41,696
You'll have me believing that.
Look out.

442
00:35:41,797 --> 00:35:43,890
So long, Taylor.

443
00:35:43,999 --> 00:35:45,967
<i>So long, Mr. Phillips.</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>

444
00:35:46,068 --> 00:35:48,969
Not at all.
Good luck.

445
00:35:49,071 --> 00:35:51,039
Good night, Chris.

446
00:35:55,177 --> 00:35:57,805
- Well?
- He's a nice guy.

447
00:35:57,913 --> 00:36:00,108
That's the only kind
I know.

448
00:36:01,416 --> 00:36:03,384
Except me.

449
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:07,921
- I'll go get some sheets for that couch.
- I can't stay here.

450
00:36:08,023 --> 00:36:10,014
Why not?

451
00:36:12,861 --> 00:36:15,853
I, uh, won't need any sheets.
This'll do fine.

452
00:36:17,733 --> 00:36:19,598
Well, then,
I'll see you in the morning.

453
00:36:19,701 --> 00:36:22,795
Don't forget to look under your bed,
lock your door.

454
00:36:24,306 --> 00:36:26,274
I'll do that.

455
00:36:58,907 --> 00:37:02,138
- All right. Suppose we take
a good look at each other.
- Let go of me.

456
00:37:02,244 --> 00:37:04,712
Who told you to watch me?
Who sent you here? Who?

457
00:37:04,813 --> 00:37:07,680
Sent me here?
I've lived three blocks away for 17 years.

458
00:37:07,783 --> 00:37:11,310
Just because I stopped under a tree
to light a cigar. What are you, crazy?

459
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:14,981
Funny it had to be that tree.
And it's pretty late to be taking a walk.

460
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:18,491
What's so funny about that tree?
Suppose I work nights, and when I come home-

461
00:37:18,594 --> 00:37:20,494
What business is it
of yours anyway?

462
00:37:20,596 --> 00:37:23,156
Why don't we call a cop
and let him ask the questions?

463
00:37:23,265 --> 00:37:25,859
Sure. Let go of me,
or I'll call a cop.

464
00:37:33,609 --> 00:37:36,043
Now what?

465
00:37:36,144 --> 00:37:39,807
I can't play alone like this anymore.
I'm getting the jumps.

466
00:37:39,915 --> 00:37:43,078
Chasing shadows.
I'll be hearing noises next.

467
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,711
Christy, call up Phillips,
will ya?

468
00:37:46,822 --> 00:37:50,485
Tell him I want to talk to
that police lieutenant. Kendall.

469
00:38:03,939 --> 00:38:08,171
Ah. In case you don't know it, George,
this is why you fought the war.

470
00:38:08,276 --> 00:38:10,608
The four freedoms
and fried shrimps for Christy.

471
00:38:10,712 --> 00:38:14,045
That was the battle cry
at Iwo Jima. Thank you.

472
00:38:15,917 --> 00:38:18,181
<i>Here he comes.</i>

473
00:38:19,321 --> 00:38:21,221
- Hello, Mel.
- Hiya, Don.

474
00:38:21,323 --> 00:38:24,486
Sorry I'm late. Looked for a while
like I wouldn't get away at all.

475
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,493
Go on.
Sit down. Sit down.

476
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,825
Yeah, we're a little
shorthanded over at the office.

477
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:31,057
Big postwar boom
in homicide.

478
00:38:31,166 --> 00:38:33,191
We went ahead and ordered.
What'll you have?

479
00:38:33,301 --> 00:38:37,237
Oh, I never eat lunch.
No. It keeps me sleepy all afternoon.

480
00:38:37,339 --> 00:38:40,069
- You've seen Christy around the Cellar.
- Yeah. Sure. How are ya?

481
00:38:40,175 --> 00:38:42,871
And this is the friend I called you about.
Tom Carter.

482
00:38:42,978 --> 00:38:45,708
<i>- Tom, meet Lieutenant Kendall.</i>
- Hello, Lieutenant.

483
00:38:45,814 --> 00:38:47,907
Hiya, Carter.

484
00:38:48,016 --> 00:38:50,280
Hey. That stuffll kill ya.

485
00:38:50,385 --> 00:38:52,683
Say, I know what's
strange about you.

486
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:56,087
You've got your hat off.
It's hard for me to believe you're a detective.

487
00:38:56,191 --> 00:38:59,490
You're kidding,
but I get that on the level all the time.

488
00:38:59,594 --> 00:39:02,290
It's almost impossible to make a pinch
without your hat on.

489
00:39:02,397 --> 00:39:05,457
They just won't believe ya.
Well, that's the movies, I guess.

490
00:39:05,567 --> 00:39:08,900
If they'd only make pictures where detectives
would take their hats off indoors...

491
00:39:09,004 --> 00:39:11,336
just like anybody else.

492
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,069
I was wondering, Don, whether you could
give Tom here some information.

493
00:39:15,177 --> 00:39:18,112
Tom Carter, wasn't it?
What about?

494
00:39:18,213 --> 00:39:21,512
Would you know anything
about a fella named Larry Cravat?

495
00:39:21,616 --> 00:39:23,709
- Quite a bit. Would you?
- Not a thing.

496
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:27,277
Pal of mine in the service asked me
to look him up about a personal matter.

497
00:39:27,389 --> 00:39:29,323
This, uh, pal of yours
in the service-

498
00:39:29,424 --> 00:39:32,621
I suppose he was killed
before he could tell you very much about Cravat.

499
00:39:32,728 --> 00:39:34,628
- That's right.
- Oh, that's too bad.

500
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:37,221
- You know where he can be reached?
- If we did, lady...

501
00:39:37,332 --> 00:39:39,300
maybe we'd reach for him.

502
00:39:39,401 --> 00:39:41,460
No, he dropped out of sight
quite a while ago.

503
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:44,505
We did a lot of lookin',
but since it was impossible to believe...

504
00:39:44,606 --> 00:39:47,973
that he was any smarter than us,
we decided he'd been bumped off.

505
00:39:48,076 --> 00:39:51,512
Now, if you'd have asked me that
two days ago, I'd have guaranteed that.

506
00:39:51,613 --> 00:39:53,604
What happened since two days ago
to change it?

507
00:39:53,715 --> 00:39:56,946
<i>Yesterday an ex-soldier,
named George Taylor...</i>

508
00:39:57,052 --> 00:39:59,987
<i>showed up at a bank</i>
<i>with a letter from Cravat.</i>

509
00:40:00,088 --> 00:40:02,579
That's why I asked you
whether your pal was dead.

510
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:05,319
He acted like-

511
00:40:05,427 --> 00:40:08,191
He acted like he didn't
want any part of the place.

512
00:40:08,296 --> 00:40:11,925
Hasn't been back to his hotel room since.
It's interesting, you know?

513
00:40:12,033 --> 00:40:15,491
You said if you knew where Cravat was
you might reach for him.

514
00:40:15,604 --> 00:40:19,199
- Is it all right to tell us why?
- Oh, sure. It's no secret.

515
00:40:19,307 --> 00:40:23,368
When Cravat faded out,
two million dollars faded with him.

516
00:40:23,478 --> 00:40:25,810
It was all over town at the time.
Didn't you know about it?

517
00:40:25,914 --> 00:40:28,109
<i>I never knew anybody that could
count that high.</i>

518
00:40:28,216 --> 00:40:30,241
That pal of yours,
the one that got killed...

519
00:40:30,352 --> 00:40:32,684
he didn't have
a couple million dollars stashed away?

520
00:40:32,788 --> 00:40:36,246
Sure. Lots of us did.
We save it out of our 60 a month.

521
00:40:36,358 --> 00:40:40,317
I'm not impressed. I make that much
in tips on Monday night.

522
00:40:40,428 --> 00:40:42,623
- But may I ask one tiny question?
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

523
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:45,029
Who was Larry Cravat?

524
00:40:45,133 --> 00:40:47,328
Well, to begin with,
he was a private eye.

525
00:40:47,435 --> 00:40:50,404
<i>- He came out</i>-
- Pardon me. It sounded like you said "eye."

526
00:40:50,505 --> 00:40:52,473
A private eye
is a private detective.

527
00:40:52,574 --> 00:40:56,840
<i>- Oh.</i>
- Yeah. He came out here maybe
five years ago from the East.

528
00:40:56,945 --> 00:41:01,211
He got a license, painted his name
on the window and put his feet on the desk.

529
00:41:01,316 --> 00:41:05,753
Then for about two years, he investigated
husbands that played golf when it rained...

530
00:41:05,854 --> 00:41:08,880
<i>and wives that didn't come back from</i>
<i>the public library till midnight.</i>

531
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:10,890
<i>But he paid his rent</i>
<i>on time.</i>

532
00:41:10,992 --> 00:41:14,018
And then somebody dropped
two million clams right in his lap.

533
00:41:14,129 --> 00:41:16,029
Coffee?

534
00:41:16,131 --> 00:41:18,031
- Please.
- Tom?

535
00:41:18,133 --> 00:41:20,533
I never touch it.
It keeps me awake.

536
00:41:20,635 --> 00:41:24,036
You better have some.
You're going to be pretty sleepy this afternoon.

537
00:41:24,139 --> 00:41:27,404
That was some drop- two million bucks.
How's a thing like that happen?

538
00:41:27,509 --> 00:41:31,878
Well, it's a long story.
Don't ask for details, but here's most of it.

539
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:37,077
It started over in Germany when one of the Nazi
hotshots saw the handwriting on the wall.

540
00:41:37,185 --> 00:41:39,085
He sent the two million
over here.

541
00:41:39,187 --> 00:41:41,212
And then before he could
come over after it...

542
00:41:41,323 --> 00:41:44,292
he got knocked off by one of
the fellow members of the lodge.

543
00:41:44,392 --> 00:41:47,759
<i>And here was this big chunk of dough</i>
<i>floatin'around loose in this country...</i>

544
00:41:47,863 --> 00:41:49,922
<i>like a pair of dice</i>
<i>at a firemen's ball.</i>

545
00:41:50,031 --> 00:41:52,591
It moved east to west.

546
00:41:52,701 --> 00:41:56,398
Each time it moved, it left a stiff
behind it with his fingers stretched out.

547
00:41:56,504 --> 00:41:59,302
The boys play rough for
that kind of lettuce, you understand.

548
00:41:59,407 --> 00:42:02,865
<i>Somehow it got to Los Angeles.</i>
<i>Somehow Cravat got mixed up with it.</i>

549
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:04,912
<i>I don't know much more</i>
<i>than that.</i>

550
00:42:05,013 --> 00:42:08,881
Except that when Cravat blew,
so did the jackpot.

551
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:12,044
- Sounds like one of those "to be
continued next issue" stories.
- Yeah.

552
00:42:12,153 --> 00:42:16,783
Well, I gotta get back. I shouldn't have come,
but I did it instead of my lunch hour.

553
00:42:16,892 --> 00:42:20,123
You shouldn't go without eating like that.
It's not good for you.

554
00:42:20,228 --> 00:42:22,128
- Lieutenant.
- Yeah? Something else?

555
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:25,324
- How does this other fella tie
in? This, uh-What's his name?
- Taylor.

556
00:42:25,433 --> 00:42:27,367
George Taylor.
I don't know yet.

557
00:42:27,469 --> 00:42:30,734
Maybe not at all.
Maybe he has as little to do with it as any of us.

558
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:34,104
I should think you'd have picked him up.
You must have a description.

559
00:42:34,209 --> 00:42:37,474
Oh, those eyewitness descriptions.
Right now he could be anything...

560
00:42:37,579 --> 00:42:40,070
from a jockey
to a Siamese twin.

561
00:42:40,181 --> 00:42:45,175
Later on you narrow 'em down. No. He'll, uh-
He'll probably come in by himself sometime.

562
00:42:45,287 --> 00:42:48,017
If not, we'll go out
and pick him up.

563
00:42:48,123 --> 00:42:51,991
These-These fortunes. They kill me.

564
00:42:53,128 --> 00:42:55,028
This ain't bad.

565
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:57,098
Well, I'll, uh, see you
some more, huh? Bye.

566
00:42:57,198 --> 00:42:59,098
- Bye.
- Bye, Don.

567
00:43:06,775 --> 00:43:09,005
Not bad at all.

568
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:13,479
"Confucius say,
"When something smell bad, keep nose clean."'

569
00:43:13,581 --> 00:43:15,811
Boy, I certainly fooled him.

570
00:43:15,917 --> 00:43:17,851
I told you he was
a smart cop.

571
00:43:17,953 --> 00:43:21,411
He was a hungry cop.
I'll say that much.

572
00:43:21,523 --> 00:43:26,961
You know, anybody that dug up Cravat
would be digging up a couple of million with him.

573
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:31,192
That's a good reason for trying.
That's even a good private reason.

574
00:43:31,299 --> 00:43:34,393
It's not mine, if that's what you mean.
I've got no interest in the money.

575
00:43:34,502 --> 00:43:37,266
Well, I'm a businessman, and frankly,
I'm interested right now.

576
00:43:38,306 --> 00:43:40,240
Maybe we can
work something out...

577
00:43:40,342 --> 00:43:43,573
where you wind up with Cravat,
and I wind up with what I can get.

578
00:43:43,678 --> 00:43:47,341
- Help yourself.
- And I wind up with a pair of nylons, I suppose.

579
00:43:47,449 --> 00:43:50,111
You name it, Chris.
All or any part of what I've got.

580
00:43:50,218 --> 00:43:52,118
Speaking as kind of
a partner now...

581
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:55,621
I'd like to know a little more about
what happened at my place last night.

582
00:43:55,724 --> 00:43:58,318
You might ask around
about a character named Anzelmo.

583
00:43:58,426 --> 00:44:01,691
- Anzelmo?
- Very polite man with a very wet face.

584
00:44:01,796 --> 00:44:05,357
He shut his eyes every time Hubert hit me,
then he told him to hit me again.

585
00:44:05,467 --> 00:44:08,368
I've heard tell of Anzelmo.
They say it in whispers.

586
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:10,904
I'm sure he's just
a misunderstood boy.

587
00:44:14,209 --> 00:44:16,268
<i>Well, of all the nerve. A ticket.</i>

588
00:44:16,378 --> 00:44:18,278
<i>And I had lunch with a cop.</i>

589
00:44:20,548 --> 00:44:22,709
Seems somebody left a note.

590
00:44:22,817 --> 00:44:25,581
For you.

591
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:36,763
"L.C. 42111/2 North Summit.
San Pedro."

592
00:44:36,865 --> 00:44:39,356
Isn't that a little childish
for a detective lieutenant?

593
00:44:39,467 --> 00:44:41,367
Leaving notes around
like Easter eggs.

594
00:44:41,469 --> 00:44:44,927
- What makes you so sure it was Kendall?
<i>- Who else?</i>

595
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:49,170
- Who else, Taylor?
- I've gotten beyond caring. L.C.
is only one name in my book...

596
00:44:49,277 --> 00:44:52,303
and it means I've got someplace
in particular to go this afternoon.

597
00:44:54,449 --> 00:44:56,508
<i>- Maybe I oughta go with you.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

598
00:44:56,618 --> 00:44:58,586
- No, thanks.
- But I've got my own reasons now.

599
00:44:58,686 --> 00:45:01,382
They come after mine.
Cravat and I gotta be alone when we meet.

600
00:45:01,489 --> 00:45:03,889
- All right if Phillips drops you at the hairdresser?
- Sure.

601
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:06,392
Good.

602
00:45:06,494 --> 00:45:09,622
Things don't happen like this, you know.
It's too easy, too pat.

603
00:45:09,731 --> 00:45:12,825
- Practically an invitation.
- It might be smarter not to go alone.

604
00:45:12,934 --> 00:45:14,959
- Probably would be.
- But you're going anyway.

605
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:16,970
What would you
want me to do?

606
00:45:17,072 --> 00:45:20,132
Will you call me? Will you promise
to call me by 6:00 at the latest?

607
00:45:20,241 --> 00:45:22,732
- I'll be at the Cellar.
- Are you going to worry, Chris?

608
00:45:22,844 --> 00:45:25,278
This is my car you're driving,
with four new tires.

609
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:28,042
- They don't grow on trees, you know.
- Tough guy.

610
00:45:28,149 --> 00:45:30,640
Sure. I'll call ya.

611
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:49,162
So, what's on your mind?

612
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:52,233
I got a message that Larry Cravat
was at this address.

613
00:46:52,333 --> 00:46:54,267
Oh, you sure
that's the name?

614
00:46:54,369 --> 00:46:58,703
- You sure it ain't John Smith
or Joe Blow or No-Hit Hennessey?
- I said Larry Cravat.

615
00:46:58,806 --> 00:47:02,606
Yeah. That's what you said. You remembered it.
You got a head on your shoulders.

616
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:04,701
Now take it out of here
before I bust it.

617
00:47:04,812 --> 00:47:07,872
You're getting a little too excited, mister.
Maybe you're Larry Cravat.

618
00:47:07,982 --> 00:47:10,507
How do you
like this guy?

619
00:47:10,618 --> 00:47:13,314
Here, look.
It didn't work. Now beat it.

620
00:47:13,421 --> 00:47:16,584
You thought that she was home
and I wasn't. So I am home.

621
00:47:16,691 --> 00:47:18,852
So I answer the door.
So you quickly ask...

622
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,020
"Does Oscar Fink live here?"
or, "Do you want to buy a canary?"

623
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:24,860
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.
- That's all, brother.

624
00:47:24,966 --> 00:47:26,900
What's going on out here?

625
00:47:27,001 --> 00:47:28,866
<i>What's he selling?</i>

626
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:31,598
What's he selling?
You wouldn't know, of course.

627
00:47:31,706 --> 00:47:33,606
You never seen him before,
of course.

628
00:47:33,708 --> 00:47:36,802
If it's insurance, I'll take a little on him.
Double indemnity.

629
00:47:36,911 --> 00:47:40,938
- What's that mean?
- It means if I beat your brains in, I get paid double.

630
00:47:41,049 --> 00:47:44,109
Whatever it is, mister, we don't want any,
and we haven't got any.

631
00:47:44,219 --> 00:47:47,279
- I'm looking for Cravat.
- Whoever he is.

632
00:47:47,388 --> 00:47:50,289
- Well, look somewhere else.
- Yeah. Look someplace else.

633
00:47:53,795 --> 00:47:56,161
Maybe she could
suggest where.

634
00:47:56,264 --> 00:47:59,427
Gotta have
a special place, huh?

635
00:47:59,534 --> 00:48:02,560
He wants to know,
can you suggest someplace he can look?

636
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:04,570
<i>Doesn't he know I'm a lady?</i>

637
00:48:04,672 --> 00:48:08,301
<i>Tell him I busted my crystal ball,</i>
<i>and he'll have to find one for himself.</i>

638
00:48:08,409 --> 00:48:11,810
She busted her crystal ball.
You'll have to find one for yourself.

639
00:48:11,913 --> 00:48:13,813
- Crystal ball?
- A fortune-teller.

640
00:48:13,915 --> 00:48:16,315
Ask her which one
she goes to.

641
00:48:16,417 --> 00:48:20,046
Which one do you go to?
Crystal ball is a fortune-teller?

642
00:48:20,154 --> 00:48:23,214
<i>Tell him I never use 'em,</i>
<i>and he can go look on Terminal Dock...</i>

643
00:48:23,324 --> 00:48:25,758
<i>and ifhe doesn't find one,</i>
<i>he can jump off it.</i>

644
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:28,420
She says go look
on Terminal Dock...

645
00:48:28,529 --> 00:48:30,929
and then jump off it!

646
00:50:11,399 --> 00:50:15,460
There seems to be a feeling
of mistrust in the air.

647
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:19,062
- I wonder why.
- Have you come for revenge, Mr. Taylor?

648
00:50:19,173 --> 00:50:22,370
Do you perhaps have a revolver
or some other lethal weapon with you?

649
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:25,002
I turned all those in
when I got this button, Anzelmo.

650
00:50:25,113 --> 00:50:27,741
I'm as surprised as you are,
<i>if</i> you are.

651
00:50:27,849 --> 00:50:30,044
I am. Believe me.

652
00:50:30,151 --> 00:50:33,382
As for you, what would you do
if I were to call Hubert?

653
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:35,752
I'm not a hero, Anzelmo.
I'd run like a deer.

654
00:50:35,857 --> 00:50:38,985
Then you have my word.
He will not molest you.

655
00:50:39,093 --> 00:50:42,221
A mere figure of speech.
My word is worthless.

656
00:50:43,264 --> 00:50:45,198
What are you doing here?

657
00:50:45,299 --> 00:50:47,290
<i>- I was told to come.</i>
- By whom?

658
00:50:47,402 --> 00:50:49,131
Phyllis.

659
00:50:50,238 --> 00:50:52,502
Phyllis.

660
00:50:52,607 --> 00:50:55,337
We were closely
associated at one time.

661
00:50:55,443 --> 00:50:57,411
Professionally, of course.

662
00:50:57,512 --> 00:51:00,072
<i>Dear, loyal, sentimental</i>
<i>little Phyllis.</i>

663
00:51:00,181 --> 00:51:03,446
Come sit here,
Mr. Taylor.

664
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:06,611
There is a vast difference in comfort
between these chairs...

665
00:51:06,721 --> 00:51:10,521
and those upon which
our clients wait for a consultation.

666
00:51:10,625 --> 00:51:12,991
Besides, the lighting effect
will set the proper mood...

667
00:51:13,094 --> 00:51:17,190
of mystery and intrigue
as we talk.

668
00:51:17,298 --> 00:51:20,995
What about the lighting effect in my eyes
last night? What about the beating I took?

669
00:51:21,102 --> 00:51:23,866
I wish with all my heart
that I could take it back.

670
00:51:23,971 --> 00:51:26,906
- Another figure of speech. You haven't got a heart.
- True.

671
00:51:27,008 --> 00:51:31,138
But I've got a brain.
And it was stupid of me. I apologize.

672
00:51:31,245 --> 00:51:33,145
Please, sit down.

673
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:35,579
What do I get?
My palm read or my horoscope?

674
00:51:35,683 --> 00:51:40,586
Let us use cards, Mr. Taylor.
Let us place them face up on the table.

675
00:51:40,688 --> 00:51:43,452
In this case,
an imitation crystal ball.

676
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,459
I'll listen
for a while.

677
00:51:48,262 --> 00:51:52,392
At the present time, young man,
I am nothing more than a small-time chiseler.

678
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:56,834
I say this frankly and bitterly
because I do not wish to be a small-time chiseler.

679
00:51:56,938 --> 00:51:58,838
It's a humiliating position.

680
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:02,569
Still, it's better than being an honest man,
which I would find intolerable.

681
00:52:02,677 --> 00:52:05,942
I was once a great thief
and a magnificent scoundrel.

682
00:52:06,047 --> 00:52:08,277
I had my reverses.
Who has not?

683
00:52:08,382 --> 00:52:12,079
And I will omit the story of my descent
to my present squalid condition.

684
00:52:12,186 --> 00:52:15,246
It would only bore you
and incriminate me.

685
00:52:16,958 --> 00:52:20,860
I waited and worked day and night
for a chance to come back.

686
00:52:20,962 --> 00:52:25,490
Three years ago
I had that chance in my hands.

687
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,625
I had-

688
00:52:27,735 --> 00:52:30,431
Name a fantastic sum of money,
Mr. Taylor.

689
00:52:31,539 --> 00:52:33,837
Two million dollars.

690
00:52:33,941 --> 00:52:37,377
You've put one of your cards
alongside mine.

691
00:52:37,478 --> 00:52:39,412
Thank you.

692
00:52:39,514 --> 00:52:43,644
As my hands closed on it,
the money disappeared like that.

693
00:52:43,751 --> 00:52:46,447
And with it,
a Mr. Larry Cravat.

694
00:52:46,554 --> 00:52:49,250
So, understand my position.

695
00:52:49,357 --> 00:52:53,054
For three years
I have lived in this stink...

696
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,890
waiting for some hope,
some word.

697
00:52:56,998 --> 00:52:59,796
And yesterday it came.

698
00:52:59,901 --> 00:53:02,597
From a Turkish bath,
from a nightclub.

699
00:53:02,703 --> 00:53:05,228
I approached you.
You were reluctant.

700
00:53:05,339 --> 00:53:08,900
You wouldn't say
why you were looking for him.

701
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:11,274
You didn't know
why he wrote to you...

702
00:53:11,379 --> 00:53:14,837
why the $5,000 deposit-
not even where he was.

703
00:53:14,949 --> 00:53:18,885
Mr. Taylor, I had to make you understand
that there was nothing I would not do...

704
00:53:18,986 --> 00:53:20,920
to find Larry Cravat!

705
00:53:21,022 --> 00:53:23,923
I got the idea.
I understood it the second time I passed out.

706
00:53:24,025 --> 00:53:27,927
But I can't help you, Anzelmo. I don't know
any other answers than the ones I gave.

707
00:53:28,029 --> 00:53:31,021
That I do not believe.

708
00:53:31,132 --> 00:53:33,999
Is this where we send for Hubert
and his rubber shillelagh?

709
00:53:34,101 --> 00:53:39,300
Mr. Taylor, I do not even
have to know where Cravat is.

710
00:53:39,407 --> 00:53:43,434
- I want you just to communicate with him for me.
- I can't. I wouldn't know how.

711
00:53:43,544 --> 00:53:45,569
That I do not believe either.

712
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:49,776
Since your arrival there has been
considerable activity connected with him.

713
00:53:49,884 --> 00:53:52,546
You cannot be
unconcerned with it.

714
00:53:52,653 --> 00:53:57,181
You cannot be without some contact,
some connection.

715
00:53:59,627 --> 00:54:03,859
Supposing I could reach Cravat.
What would the message be?

716
00:54:05,967 --> 00:54:09,994
<i>Phyllis, darling.</i>

717
00:54:10,104 --> 00:54:13,505
You look like a couple of witches.
What cooks?

718
00:54:13,608 --> 00:54:17,066
How thoughtful of you, little one,
to send dear Mr. Taylor to me.

719
00:54:17,178 --> 00:54:19,305
Stop talking
like Bela Lugosi.

720
00:54:19,413 --> 00:54:21,347
How did you know
where to find me?

721
00:54:21,449 --> 00:54:23,383
I didn't know
I was going to find you.

722
00:54:23,484 --> 00:54:26,578
I got a note that said Larry Cravat was
at 42111/2 Summit.

723
00:54:26,687 --> 00:54:28,780
- I don't get it.
- From whom was the note?

724
00:54:28,889 --> 00:54:32,552
I don't know.
And don't try to beat it out of me. I don't know.

725
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:35,686
Why would anybody want to
tie me in with Larry Cravat?

726
00:54:35,796 --> 00:54:40,130
Anybody. I can think of somebody
who would have every reason in the world.

727
00:54:40,234 --> 00:54:42,634
Mr. Cravat himself.

728
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:45,103
- Did you know him?
- I... We just met.

729
00:54:45,206 --> 00:54:47,640
I was going to know him
a lot better. Anzelmo-

730
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:50,404
The professional relationship
which I mentioned earlier.

731
00:54:50,511 --> 00:54:55,005
We are still partners,
Phyllis. Are we not?

732
00:54:55,116 --> 00:54:57,846
Don't start that now.
Don't try to mix me up.

733
00:54:57,952 --> 00:55:01,217
Till you called me yesterday,
Cravat was a name in an old phone book.

734
00:55:01,322 --> 00:55:03,256
You sent me after Taylor.
All right. I went.

735
00:55:03,357 --> 00:55:07,657
After all, I'm smart, Anzelmo. You think I'd
bring him down to that dump if I were on my own?

736
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:11,163
- You think I'd send him to you?
- Sit down and listen.

737
00:55:12,633 --> 00:55:16,160
I was about to give Mr. Taylor
a message for Larry Cravat.

738
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:18,670
- Then you do know-
- I said listen!

739
00:55:25,246 --> 00:55:27,271
This is what
I want you to tell him.

740
00:55:27,381 --> 00:55:31,112
That even two million dollars is of no use
to a man in the electric chair.

741
00:55:31,218 --> 00:55:34,881
Suppose he doesn't
understand the message.

742
00:55:34,989 --> 00:55:37,082
- He will.
<i>- Suppose he says he doesn't.</i>

743
00:55:37,191 --> 00:55:40,558
Suppose he wants to know
where you fit in.

744
00:55:40,661 --> 00:55:43,630
A reasonable question,
which I will answer.

745
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:51,303
Mr. Cravat is wanted by the police
for a murder which occurred on Terminal Dock.

746
00:55:51,405 --> 00:55:54,169
<i>This very dock,</i>
<i>three years ago.</i>

747
00:55:54,275 --> 00:55:58,405
The murdered man was a gentleman
from the East. Mr. Steele, I believe.

748
00:55:58,512 --> 00:56:01,447
The police have evidence
that Mr. Cravat and another man...

749
00:56:01,549 --> 00:56:03,642
<i>were on the dock</i>
<i>that night.</i>

750
00:56:03,751 --> 00:56:05,776
They do not know
who the other man was.

751
00:56:05,886 --> 00:56:10,220
However, Mr. Cravat's immediate
and prolonged absence...

752
00:56:10,324 --> 00:56:14,090
has strengthened their belief
that Mr. Cravat was the murderer...

753
00:56:14,195 --> 00:56:16,789
and that the identity
of the other man...

754
00:56:16,897 --> 00:56:19,388
is relatively unimportant.

755
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:22,992
Let's say Cravat knows all that.
He still doesn't know where you fit in.

756
00:56:23,104 --> 00:56:27,336
For a considerable amount of money,
subject to negotiation, of course...

757
00:56:27,441 --> 00:56:31,104
I will present the police with
the other man on the dock that night.

758
00:56:31,212 --> 00:56:34,773
He will confess to the murder
and free Cravat of suspicion.

759
00:56:34,882 --> 00:56:38,318
- How do you happen to know who he is?
- If he's reluctant to confess...

760
00:56:38,419 --> 00:56:40,580
the police will find
a suicide...

761
00:56:40,688 --> 00:56:42,588
and a signed confession...

762
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:44,590
complete in every detail.

763
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:46,626
That might be better
in any case.

764
00:56:46,727 --> 00:56:51,323
- What makes you think Cravat'll
go for a crummy deal like that?
- Because it's to his advantage.

765
00:56:51,432 --> 00:56:56,096
- Because it's probably to your advantage as well.
- What do you mean by that?

766
00:56:56,203 --> 00:57:00,196
Mr. Cravat deposited
$5,000 to your account. Why?

767
00:57:00,307 --> 00:57:02,241
He was not a charitable man.

768
00:57:02,343 --> 00:57:06,643
It is more likely
that he was paying for services rendered.

769
00:57:06,747 --> 00:57:08,942
What were you
being paid for?

770
00:57:09,049 --> 00:57:13,281
There is every likelihood that the unidentified
gentleman on the dock that night...

771
00:57:13,387 --> 00:57:15,981
was you, Mr. Taylor!

772
00:58:41,206 --> 00:58:43,606
Sit down and
play for the boss.

773
00:58:43,709 --> 00:58:47,577
Do you want to be sent, brought,
or do you have something particular in mind?

774
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:50,842
How about "Where's
My Wandering Boy Tonight"?

775
00:58:50,949 --> 00:58:53,474
Where, indeed?

776
00:58:55,687 --> 00:58:58,485
Christy,
who is George Taylor?

777
00:58:58,590 --> 00:59:02,287
Just a boy,
a wandering boy.

778
00:59:02,394 --> 00:59:05,056
- Kendall was in to see me
about him this afternoon.
- So?

779
00:59:05,163 --> 00:59:07,791
He asked a lot of questions
I couldn't answer.

780
00:59:07,899 --> 00:59:10,732
Kendall doesn't work out of
the missing persons bureau, you know.

781
00:59:10,836 --> 00:59:13,999
- He's homicide.
- He steals fried shrimps.

782
00:59:14,106 --> 00:59:17,542
He wants to help, and so do I.
You asked me to, remember?

783
00:59:20,278 --> 00:59:22,576
What kind of trouble
is Taylor in?

784
00:59:23,682 --> 00:59:26,082
It won't make
any difference to me.

785
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:29,053
Maybe it will.

786
00:59:29,154 --> 00:59:31,054
Because maybe it's murder.

787
00:59:33,425 --> 00:59:37,327
He called me.
It's a murder that happened three years ago.

788
00:59:37,429 --> 00:59:40,421
Cravat was mixed up in it,
and George thinks maybe he was too.

789
00:59:40,532 --> 00:59:43,695
- Thinks maybe?
- He's not sure. He's got no way of knowing.

790
00:59:43,802 --> 00:59:47,863
- I don't understand that.
- Well, don't try, but believe me, he hasn't.

791
00:59:49,574 --> 00:59:52,737
I'll believe you.
Where is he now?

792
00:59:52,844 --> 00:59:54,744
He phoned me
a few minutes ago.

793
00:59:54,846 --> 00:59:58,009
He's been down at the harbor
trying to find out all he could about it.

794
00:59:58,116 --> 01:00:03,383
There was a witness to the murder,
a man who used to work on Terminal Dock.

795
01:00:03,488 --> 01:00:07,822
- A man named Conroy.
- Conroy.

796
01:00:07,926 --> 01:00:10,554
Nobody's quite sure
what happened to him.

797
01:00:10,662 --> 01:00:14,154
- George found out where Conroy
lived. He's gone to his house.
- Why?

798
01:00:14,266 --> 01:00:17,099
To get some answers
to some questions.

799
01:00:18,136 --> 01:00:21,537
- Makes sense to me.
- Not to me.

800
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:25,201
Taylor doesn't make much sense to me. Taking
a beating to find somebody he doesn't know...

801
01:00:25,310 --> 01:00:27,210
running down
a three-year-old murder.

802
01:00:27,312 --> 01:00:30,713
Christy, who is he? What's his angle?
Where do you stand?

803
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:35,745
Like always, my two feet
firmly planted in the air.

804
01:00:35,854 --> 01:00:38,186
Take my advice
and stay away from him.

805
01:00:38,290 --> 01:00:41,316
Don't get involved...
in any way.

806
01:00:41,426 --> 01:00:44,156
Confucius say, "When something
smell bad, make new friends"?

807
01:00:44,262 --> 01:00:48,289
When something smells bad, believe me,
it's in the air like an earthquake.

808
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,062
Don't stand too close,
Christy. Don't get hurt.

809
01:00:51,169 --> 01:00:56,129
In any way?
I'm the girl with the cauliflower heart.

810
01:00:56,241 --> 01:00:59,836
You think. You're as
tough as a love song.

811
01:00:59,945 --> 01:01:03,904
You've got your face turned up
and your eyes closed, waiting to be kissed.

812
01:01:04,015 --> 01:01:08,042
Might not be a kiss, baby.
Open your eyes and look around.

813
01:01:11,757 --> 01:01:14,783
That's mighty fine advice, Mel,
and I'm beholden to you.

814
01:01:17,095 --> 01:01:19,154
There's only one thing
wrong though.

815
01:01:19,264 --> 01:01:21,164
What?

816
01:01:21,266 --> 01:01:24,531
I'm nuts about the guy.

817
01:01:58,970 --> 01:02:02,838
Good evening.
I wonder if I could talk to Mr. Conroy.

818
01:02:02,941 --> 01:02:04,966
Come in.

819
01:02:20,425 --> 01:02:22,484
My name is George Taylor.

820
01:02:22,594 --> 01:02:25,859
Please forgive me.
It was so dark.

821
01:02:25,964 --> 01:02:28,831
I wasn't expecting-

822
01:02:28,934 --> 01:02:32,768
For a moment,
I didn't know you, George.

823
01:02:32,871 --> 01:02:35,635
You've met me before?

824
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:38,834
I said I was sorry.

825
01:02:38,944 --> 01:02:42,038
Oh, sure.
That's all right.

826
01:02:43,081 --> 01:02:46,847
Well, won't you
sit down?

827
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:50,920
Could I get you something?

828
01:02:51,022 --> 01:02:54,321
No, thanks. Really, I...
What about Mr. Conroy?

829
01:02:56,228 --> 01:02:58,321
You're being very formal,
I must say.

830
01:02:58,430 --> 01:03:01,297
Father's better,
thank you.

831
01:03:01,399 --> 01:03:04,891
- Better?
- At least, the doctors keep telling me so.

832
01:03:05,937 --> 01:03:08,565
I haven't asked
for some time.

833
01:03:08,673 --> 01:03:12,507
I went for so long,
and they kept saying the same thing.

834
01:03:12,611 --> 01:03:15,637
There are signs
of improvement.

835
01:03:15,747 --> 01:03:18,841
- But it's been so long.
- How long?

836
01:03:18,950 --> 01:03:21,384
Ever since his accident.
Three years.

837
01:03:21,486 --> 01:03:25,013
His accident,
three years ago?

838
01:03:25,123 --> 01:03:27,990
I... I keep forgetting.

839
01:03:29,027 --> 01:03:31,655
You haven't been here.

840
01:03:31,763 --> 01:03:33,788
It was on his way to work.

841
01:03:33,899 --> 01:03:36,925
So strange,
nobody saw it.

842
01:03:37,035 --> 01:03:39,196
They found him
lying there.

843
01:03:39,304 --> 01:03:41,204
He'd been hit
by an automobile.

844
01:03:41,306 --> 01:03:43,206
He didn't know.
He couldn't remember.

845
01:03:43,308 --> 01:03:45,208
They've been trying
to help him.

846
01:03:45,310 --> 01:03:47,972
- He's been there ever since.
- Been where?

847
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:53,039
Lambeth Sanatorium.
Oh, it's very nice.

848
01:03:53,151 --> 01:03:56,746
They're very kind.
I've often wished that I...

849
01:04:03,728 --> 01:04:07,459
Memories have a way of
getting stuck together...

850
01:04:07,565 --> 01:04:11,763
like pages in a book,
haven't they?

851
01:04:11,870 --> 01:04:16,432
The story in the paper that morning-
A man had been murdered.

852
01:04:16,541 --> 01:04:19,339
Father read it aloud to me.

853
01:04:19,444 --> 01:04:24,006
I thought that very odd.
He seemed pleased and happy.

854
01:04:24,115 --> 01:04:28,848
There was someone, he said, who'd make us rich,
and I would have a new dress.

855
01:04:32,023 --> 01:04:34,014
I'm afraid this one
isn't very pretty.

856
01:04:34,125 --> 01:04:37,356
The man who was gonna make you rich,
what was his name?

857
01:04:40,031 --> 01:04:41,965
- I don't remember.
- Was it Larry Cravat?

858
01:04:45,303 --> 01:04:47,999
It was so long ago.

859
01:04:48,106 --> 01:04:51,041
I don't remember things
well, really.

860
01:04:51,142 --> 01:04:54,270
Only certain things.
It's so funny.

861
01:04:54,379 --> 01:04:57,212
They seem to shine
like little lights.

862
01:04:57,315 --> 01:04:59,215
And everything
around them is dark.

863
01:04:59,317 --> 01:05:02,878
You said
the Lambeth Sanatorium.

864
01:05:02,988 --> 01:05:05,650
- Did I?
- Well, didn't you?

865
01:05:05,757 --> 01:05:08,783
You're going away now.

866
01:05:08,893 --> 01:05:12,488
Well, I've got-
I've got to see your father.

867
01:05:12,597 --> 01:05:15,361
- You've acted very strangely.
- I didn't mean to. It's just-

868
01:05:15,467 --> 01:05:17,867
You haven't even
called me once by my name.

869
01:05:17,969 --> 01:05:20,699
It's Elizabeth,
in case you've forgotten.

870
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:25,175
I'm sorry, Elizabeth.

871
01:05:25,276 --> 01:05:27,176
But it's been
such a long time.

872
01:05:27,278 --> 01:05:29,769
Yes, it has.

873
01:05:29,881 --> 01:05:34,215
And things change,
don't they, in time?

874
01:05:35,453 --> 01:05:38,013
But time doesn't change.

875
01:05:38,123 --> 01:05:42,184
It goes on and on...
and doesn't change.

876
01:05:42,293 --> 01:05:45,126
I know,
because I've watched it.

877
01:05:45,230 --> 01:05:50,725
The nights, the days, the nights,
always the same.

878
01:05:50,835 --> 01:05:56,774
Dawns are always gray, and the days...
can have different colors.

879
01:05:56,875 --> 01:06:01,141
But the nights are black.
And they're all empty.

880
01:06:02,347 --> 01:06:06,113
No.
Only people change.

881
01:06:07,485 --> 01:06:10,386
They grow old
and ugly...

882
01:06:10,488 --> 01:06:13,457
and... pitiful.

883
01:06:15,026 --> 01:06:18,052
Don't stare at me
like that.

884
01:06:18,163 --> 01:06:21,098
I'm no concern of yours.
Really, I'm not.

885
01:06:21,199 --> 01:06:24,760
You don't know me.
Don't worry.

886
01:06:24,869 --> 01:06:27,997
I never saw you before.
I lied.

887
01:06:28,106 --> 01:06:30,006
I made believe.

888
01:06:34,612 --> 01:06:38,207
Please, don't be
angry with me.

889
01:06:39,484 --> 01:06:45,389
You see, I've made believe
so much for so long-

890
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:49,426
That I wasn't alone,
that I had friends...

891
01:06:50,528 --> 01:06:53,429
that I wasn't afraid...

892
01:06:53,531 --> 01:06:56,864
that I wasn't dead,
that I was alive.

893
01:06:58,203 --> 01:07:02,196
I wanted so to make believe that-

894
01:07:02,307 --> 01:07:06,300
somebody loved me.

895
01:07:10,782 --> 01:07:14,980
I know a little bit about being lonely.

896
01:07:19,591 --> 01:07:22,685
I'll come back to see you
soon again, Elizabeth.

897
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:04,528
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

898
01:09:04,629 --> 01:09:07,325
- I'd like to see Michael Conroy.
- Conroy?

899
01:09:07,432 --> 01:09:09,992
- Oh, I'm afraid you can't see him.
- Why not?

900
01:09:10,101 --> 01:09:12,592
For one thing,
it's after visiting hours.

901
01:09:12,704 --> 01:09:14,604
I'm his nephew.
It's very important.

902
01:09:14,706 --> 01:09:16,765
We consider
our rules important too.

903
01:09:16,874 --> 01:09:19,399
For another thing,
Mr. Conroy doesn't have visitors.

904
01:09:19,510 --> 01:09:22,308
Well, he wants to see me.
I've been away in the Marine Corps.

905
01:09:22,413 --> 01:09:24,381
He doesn't know I'm back.
It'll be good for him.

906
01:09:24,482 --> 01:09:27,645
I'm sorry, but I'm not authorized
to make exceptions.

907
01:09:27,752 --> 01:09:31,119
- Then, who is?
- Perhaps if you'd apply in writing.

908
01:09:31,222 --> 01:09:34,385
I want to see him now.
Who do I have to convince?

909
01:09:34,492 --> 01:09:36,585
I'll speak
to Dr. Grant.

910
01:10:30,448 --> 01:10:33,383
I wonder if you could help me.
I'm looking for Michael Conroy's room.

911
01:10:33,484 --> 01:10:35,975
- Who?
- Michael Conroy.

912
01:10:36,087 --> 01:10:38,055
Dr. Grant's given me
permission to visit him.

913
01:10:39,424 --> 01:10:42,655
Nobody ever visits him.

914
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:46,753
Look. Just tell me where his room is.
I'm a very good friend of his.

915
01:10:56,007 --> 01:10:58,669
You're a friend
of Michael Conroy?

916
01:10:58,776 --> 01:11:02,007
- I'm more than that.
- 214! 214!

917
01:11:05,616 --> 01:11:08,585
How dare you wander about the corridors
of this sanatorium by yourself.

918
01:11:08,686 --> 01:11:10,654
The door was open.
I was just curious.

919
01:11:10,755 --> 01:11:12,746
That's not true, Doctor.
The door was closed.

920
01:11:12,857 --> 01:11:15,724
Tom. See that this man
leaves here at once.

921
01:11:17,128 --> 01:11:19,096
What about Conroy?
Why can't I see him?

922
01:11:19,197 --> 01:11:21,358
- Because his condition does not warrant it.
- Why not?

923
01:11:21,466 --> 01:11:23,900
What is his condition?
I'm his nephew. I have a right to know.

924
01:11:24,001 --> 01:11:27,630
You are not his nephew.
And if you know Michael Conroy at all...

925
01:11:27,739 --> 01:11:31,869
you must also know that for the past
three years, he has been insane.

926
01:11:37,615 --> 01:11:40,345
Out.

927
01:14:48,439 --> 01:14:50,339
Conroy?

928
01:15:20,338 --> 01:15:26,140
The truck. I didn't see it.
It came out of nowhere.

929
01:15:26,243 --> 01:15:29,007
My head-
My head hurts.

930
01:15:29,113 --> 01:15:31,013
Are you Conroy?

931
01:15:31,115 --> 01:15:33,675
Michael Conroy.

932
01:15:33,784 --> 01:15:39,723
My daughter, she'll worry.
Will someone-

933
01:15:39,824 --> 01:15:44,318
Her name is Elizabeth.
And we live at-

934
01:15:44,428 --> 01:15:47,955
We live at-
It's-

935
01:15:48,065 --> 01:15:52,968
It's on my draft
registration card.

936
01:15:53,070 --> 01:15:54,970
Your draft registration?

937
01:15:55,072 --> 01:15:56,972
Yeah.

938
01:15:57,074 --> 01:16:02,102
Imagine, an old duffer like me.

939
01:16:02,213 --> 01:16:07,378
Still, you can't tell.
The war's very young yet.

940
01:16:07,485 --> 01:16:11,717
Sure. Sure.
It's only 1942, isn't it?

941
01:16:11,822 --> 01:16:16,384
My back- Now my back's
beginning to hurt.

942
01:16:16,494 --> 01:16:21,056
Conroy, the other night,
a couple of nights ago, maybe...

943
01:16:21,165 --> 01:16:23,065
a man was murdered
on the dock.

944
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:26,295
- You saw it.
- Yes. I saw it.

945
01:16:26,404 --> 01:16:29,464
Do you remember who did it?
Was it Larry Cravat?

946
01:16:31,709 --> 01:16:35,645
I heard the shot
and then another shot.

947
01:16:35,746 --> 01:16:39,443
And I was afraid. And I hid.

948
01:16:41,886 --> 01:16:46,516
There was some running.
And then- then it was quiet.

949
01:16:46,624 --> 01:16:51,994
Just a man lying there,
and he was dead.

950
01:16:52,096 --> 01:16:54,997
And-And there was
a suitcase.

951
01:16:55,099 --> 01:16:57,363
- He dropped it.
- Who dropped the suitcase?

952
01:16:57,468 --> 01:16:59,561
- One of the men who ran away.
- Larry Cravat?

953
01:16:59,670 --> 01:17:03,504
I hid it under-
under the dock...

954
01:17:03,607 --> 01:17:05,871
up in between the pilings.

955
01:17:05,976 --> 01:17:10,970
Nobody ever goes there.
He'd have to pay me for it.

956
01:17:11,082 --> 01:17:15,951
I'd be rich.
That was clever of me.

957
01:17:16,053 --> 01:17:19,022
You said Cravat was there.
Which was he?

958
01:17:20,958 --> 01:17:22,892
Did the three men
arrive together?

959
01:17:22,993 --> 01:17:25,427
The one with the suitcase,
did he do the shooting?

960
01:17:25,529 --> 01:17:27,963
Conroy, look at me.

961
01:17:28,065 --> 01:17:31,000
Was I the man with the suitcase?
Did I do the shooting?

962
01:17:31,102 --> 01:17:33,070
Look at me.

963
01:17:34,238 --> 01:17:36,206
I...

964
01:19:15,573 --> 01:19:18,167
Hello, there.

965
01:19:18,275 --> 01:19:20,436
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

966
01:19:20,544 --> 01:19:23,479
Well, it is a little late,
but come in.

967
01:19:28,986 --> 01:19:31,386
You fixed the bed for me.

968
01:19:31,488 --> 01:19:34,286
As a matter of fact,
what with the housing shortage and all...

969
01:19:34,391 --> 01:19:37,588
I left my name at the U.S.O.
in case any soldiers or sailors-

970
01:19:37,695 --> 01:19:40,425
You've been waiting up for me...
to come home.

971
01:19:41,832 --> 01:19:44,699
I just thought-

972
01:19:44,802 --> 01:19:48,203
Anyway, there's some sandwiches over there
with their toes curled up.

973
01:19:48,305 --> 01:19:50,205
They're for you too.

974
01:19:53,878 --> 01:19:56,369
I guess I missed my dinner.

975
01:19:59,984 --> 01:20:02,145
Well, what are you
waiting for?

976
01:20:02,253 --> 01:20:05,051
- Nothing, I guess. I can't wait anymore.
- I don't understand that.

977
01:20:05,155 --> 01:20:07,623
- It's no good, Chris. I've gotta get out of here.
- Now? This minute?

978
01:20:07,725 --> 01:20:10,888
Now. This minute. I found Conroy.
He'd been stabbed. He died in my arms.

979
01:20:10,995 --> 01:20:13,987
- I had to fight my way out.
- Why? Why didn't you stay and tell the truth?

980
01:20:14,098 --> 01:20:17,727
- With a dead man in my arms?
- Well, it was the truth, wasn't it? Why run away?

981
01:20:17,835 --> 01:20:20,963
Because that's all I can think of to do.
Because I live running away.

982
01:20:22,573 --> 01:20:24,905
Was Conroy able to talk?
Did he say anything before-

983
01:20:25,009 --> 01:20:28,376
Yeah, everything I wanted to hear,
all about a suitcase he hid under Terminal Dock.

984
01:20:28,479 --> 01:20:32,108
- What about Larry Cravat?
- Could have been a couple of other fellas.

985
01:20:34,618 --> 01:20:36,643
And it could have been you,
Anzelmo said.

986
01:20:36,754 --> 01:20:39,222
Why don't you say it too?

987
01:20:39,323 --> 01:20:41,223
It's what you're thinking.
Why don't you say it too?

988
01:20:41,325 --> 01:20:44,158
I don't know what I'm thinking.
I've got my eyes closed.

989
01:20:44,261 --> 01:20:47,856
I'm trying to open them
and look around.

990
01:20:47,965 --> 01:20:51,332
You were running away
the night you ran into my life.

991
01:20:51,435 --> 01:20:53,733
A man was killed because
you asked him some questions.

992
01:20:53,837 --> 01:20:56,169
<i>You were beaten up.</i>
<i>You wanted to run away again.</i>

993
01:20:56,273 --> 01:21:00,676
All you knew about yourself
was in a mysterious letter you found.

994
01:21:00,778 --> 01:21:03,975
Then you lost your head
and went after an innocent man in the street.

995
01:21:04,081 --> 01:21:07,209
Innocent?
That's the one that killed Conroy.

996
01:21:25,369 --> 01:21:27,269
- Hello.
- Hello.

997
01:21:27,371 --> 01:21:29,271
I've come for George Taylor.

998
01:21:29,373 --> 01:21:32,035
You must be
a little mixed up.

999
01:21:32,142 --> 01:21:34,633
This is my house,
and I'm not George Taylor.

1000
01:21:34,745 --> 01:21:37,873
You haven't even
got the right sex.

1001
01:21:37,982 --> 01:21:39,973
- Nobody can say you haven't.
- Thanks.

1002
01:21:40,084 --> 01:21:42,450
You know, it's a little late
at night for playin' games.

1003
01:21:42,553 --> 01:21:46,853
I'm kinda dopey when I get waked up.
I guess I'm gettin' old.

1004
01:21:46,957 --> 01:21:51,223
I don't see how you do it.
Still dressed, even your shoes, the lights still on.

1005
01:21:51,328 --> 01:21:55,628
What do you say we don't try to
mix each other up? Is Taylor here?

1006
01:21:55,733 --> 01:21:58,224
They're both in the kitchen-
he and Adolf Hitler.

1007
01:21:58,335 --> 01:22:01,600
- You'll get promoted for this, Lieutenant.
- Ah.

1008
01:22:01,705 --> 01:22:05,402
Yeah, that's a good one.
I guess I was a little stupid about that Taylor.

1009
01:22:05,509 --> 01:22:08,137
I figured he was gettin' pushed around,
didn't know who by.

1010
01:22:08,245 --> 01:22:10,145
That's why I left that note
in your car.

1011
01:22:10,247 --> 01:22:14,741
<i>I thought that he'd take one good look at</i>
<i>Phyllis and get off the merry-go-round.</i>

1012
01:22:14,852 --> 01:22:17,082
- I'll tell him if I see him.
- No. No, don't.

1013
01:22:17,187 --> 01:22:19,314
It'd just make him feel bad.

1014
01:22:19,423 --> 01:22:22,324
See, it looks like he killed a man tonight-
a man named Conroy.

1015
01:22:22,426 --> 01:22:24,860
<i>I'm sure glad he isn't here.</i>
<i>I'd hate to pick him up here.</i>

1016
01:22:24,962 --> 01:22:26,862
<i>That way, you'd be</i>
<i>mixed up in it.</i>

1017
01:22:26,964 --> 01:22:30,661
Newspapers, all that.
Those maniacs with the flashbulbs.

1018
01:22:30,768 --> 01:22:35,899
Well, if you do see him, tell him I'll be
down at the station for a couple of hours yet.

1019
01:22:36,006 --> 01:22:38,531
- If I see him.
- Yeah. Good night.

1020
01:22:38,642 --> 01:22:41,634
- Good night.
- Oh, uh, one more thing.

1021
01:22:41,745 --> 01:22:44,543
You know, you ought to
keep your car in the garage.

1022
01:22:44,648 --> 01:22:48,982
It isn't good to leave it out all night
like that... with the motor so hot.

1023
01:22:57,361 --> 01:23:00,023
I was coming out when he stopped me
by talking about you.

1024
01:23:00,130 --> 01:23:02,030
He knew it.
He knows everything.

1025
01:23:02,132 --> 01:23:04,225
He's the original
seeing eye.

1026
01:23:04,334 --> 01:23:09,271
Two hours.
That's not much time. Or is it?

1027
01:23:09,373 --> 01:23:12,433
It's enough.
Turn out the lights while I get a coat.

1028
01:23:18,315 --> 01:23:23,412
- Where are we going?
<i>- On a treasure hunt after</i>
<i>a suitcase under Terminal Dock.</i>

1029
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,613
You're not.
You're staying out of this.

1030
01:23:25,722 --> 01:23:28,054
<i>- Remember what Confucius said.</i>
- Now, you listen to me.

1031
01:23:28,158 --> 01:23:32,390
If it turns out that in your whole life
you ever killed anything bigger than a horsefly...

1032
01:23:32,496 --> 01:23:34,862
then I'm crazy,
and I wanna be locked up.

1033
01:23:34,965 --> 01:23:38,264
Tell that to Confucius.

1034
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:40,268
Chris.

1035
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:18,365
Chris.

1036
01:24:18,475 --> 01:24:22,343
This looks a little bit rugged.
Maybe you better take the car and go home.

1037
01:24:22,446 --> 01:24:24,346
Come on.

1038
01:24:37,728 --> 01:24:40,925
Must be a ladder along here somewhere.
This is where the boats tie up.

1039
01:24:41,031 --> 01:24:42,931
There's one.

1040
01:25:09,426 --> 01:25:13,726
If I were hiding a suitcase under here,
I'd put it as high and as far in as possible.

1041
01:25:13,830 --> 01:25:17,163
- What do you think?
- I think we should stay very close together.

1042
01:25:54,338 --> 01:25:57,273
Look! I think I see something.

1043
01:26:00,010 --> 01:26:01,910
I'll go see.

1044
01:26:33,877 --> 01:26:36,778
- Looks as though someone has been at it.
- Rats, probably.

1045
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:40,213
There's some things I'd rather not know,
if you don't mind.

1046
01:26:47,691 --> 01:26:51,559
Thousand-dollar bills-
The two million!

1047
01:26:51,662 --> 01:26:55,098
They've come a long way.
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

1048
01:26:56,433 --> 01:26:58,333
Light a match.

1049
01:27:08,712 --> 01:27:10,680
Light another one,
quick.

1050
01:27:13,417 --> 01:27:17,217
"W. George, tailor."

1051
01:27:20,324 --> 01:27:23,691
George... Taylor.

1052
01:27:27,397 --> 01:27:30,264
George Taylor,
meet Larry Cravat.

1053
01:27:30,367 --> 01:27:33,234
Larry Cravat,
George Taylor.

1054
01:27:36,106 --> 01:27:38,165
I won't bother
trying it on.

1055
01:27:38,275 --> 01:27:40,175
I don't need a memory
to figure this one out.

1056
01:27:40,277 --> 01:27:45,681
A murder, a couple of quick changes-
clothes and name- and then the hideout.

1057
01:27:45,782 --> 01:27:49,309
With a brand-new war on,
what better place than the service?

1058
01:27:53,123 --> 01:27:55,887
This doesn't prove anything, you know.

1059
01:28:00,030 --> 01:28:01,930
Then maybe you ought to
read this letter now.

1060
01:28:02,032 --> 01:28:05,559
The one I found in the hospital,
the one that told me-

1061
01:28:05,669 --> 01:28:07,728
Here. Read it.

1062
01:28:23,053 --> 01:28:26,887
Your friend, Mary- the one who couldn't see
because she had her heart in her eyes.

1063
01:28:26,990 --> 01:28:28,890
Was that her handwriting?

1064
01:28:30,193 --> 01:28:33,651
- Don't lie to me, Chris!
- Yes. Mary wrote that.

1065
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,059
To me.

1066
01:29:22,078 --> 01:29:25,878
Wait a minute. That was six.
Might be an automatic.

1067
01:29:28,685 --> 01:29:30,653
Now.

1068
01:29:41,431 --> 01:29:44,025
Don't hold onto me.
That way, we're one target.

1069
01:29:44,134 --> 01:29:46,034
Come on.

1070
01:30:21,471 --> 01:30:26,670
That's something else I've gotta get used to:
jumping out of my skin every time a door opens.

1071
01:30:28,044 --> 01:30:31,207
Try to remember.
Try to remember, George.

1072
01:30:31,314 --> 01:30:35,512
Larry. I've got a tailor named George.
I can remember that much.

1073
01:30:35,619 --> 01:30:37,985
- Darling, look.
- Don't call me that either.

1074
01:30:38,088 --> 01:30:40,386
That's something else
I remember too.

1075
01:30:40,490 --> 01:30:42,856
Even if it didn't happen to me,
but to a guy named Taylor.

1076
01:30:42,959 --> 01:30:46,861
- That's who you are, that guy.
- I'm Larry Cravat.

1077
01:30:46,963 --> 01:30:49,454
And I killed a man
on that dock three years ago.

1078
01:30:49,566 --> 01:30:53,832
I don't know who he was, but I killed him,
and I dropped the suitcase and ran away.

1079
01:30:53,937 --> 01:30:56,997
But supposing the other man killed him.
Supposing you just ran away.

1080
01:30:57,107 --> 01:30:59,769
- The other man?
- The one you thought you might have been.

1081
01:30:59,876 --> 01:31:02,606
Who is he?

1082
01:31:02,712 --> 01:31:05,545
I haven't got time
to start that all over again.

1083
01:31:05,649 --> 01:31:10,814
- My two hours are nearly up.
- Do you think you could ever have killed anybody?

1084
01:31:10,921 --> 01:31:16,416
I know about George Taylor. No.
But I can't speak for Larry Cravat, for me.

1085
01:31:16,526 --> 01:31:19,188
I can.
The answer is no.

1086
01:31:19,296 --> 01:31:23,824
- Thanks for your vote.
- Just because you've got another name.

1087
01:31:23,934 --> 01:31:25,834
Even if you wipe out
a man's memory...

1088
01:31:25,936 --> 01:31:28,734
doesn't it stand to reason
that his brain is the same?

1089
01:31:28,838 --> 01:31:31,432
That his- his standards
are the same?

1090
01:31:31,541 --> 01:31:34,476
- You didn't think much of him.
- I never thought of him as a murderer.

1091
01:31:35,879 --> 01:31:38,006
And he could have changed
for the better too.

1092
01:31:38,114 --> 01:31:40,639
Three years of war
can change a man.

1093
01:31:40,750 --> 01:31:43,548
You're making a nice try,
Chris, but that isn't the way I've heard it.

1094
01:31:43,653 --> 01:31:47,749
- They say I killed a man.
- And they say you killed Conroy too.

1095
01:31:47,857 --> 01:31:52,021
- Did you?
- No, but I can remember that.
I can't remember anything else.

1096
01:31:52,128 --> 01:31:55,894
Don't make me try anymore, Chris. I'm too tired.
Don't make me try anymore.

1097
01:32:03,707 --> 01:32:06,005
I'll get you
a cup of coffee.

1098
01:32:34,237 --> 01:32:36,933
Here. Hold on
to this cup.

1099
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:39,668
Let's see if we can't
make some sense for once.

1100
01:32:39,776 --> 01:32:42,301
Now, George, everything that
happened to you happened...

1101
01:32:42,412 --> 01:32:45,245
because they thought you could
lead them to Larry Cravat.

1102
01:32:45,348 --> 01:32:47,976
- Why?
- Because they figured Cravat had the money.

1103
01:32:48,084 --> 01:32:51,281
Right. And when Anzelmo told you
Cravat was a murderer...

1104
01:32:51,388 --> 01:32:53,288
he said that because
he wanted to make a deal.

1105
01:32:53,390 --> 01:32:57,156
- For some of the money, he'd clear Cravat.
- Yeah.

1106
01:32:57,260 --> 01:32:59,751
And he didn't even insist
on seeing Cravat.

1107
01:32:59,863 --> 01:33:02,195
If I'm the only contact between them
and two million dollars...

1108
01:33:02,298 --> 01:33:04,198
they certainly want to
keep me alive.

1109
01:33:04,300 --> 01:33:07,201
Yet, twice tonight
somebody tried to kill me. Why?

1110
01:33:07,303 --> 01:33:11,000
Because you were getting close to something
more important than two million dollars.

1111
01:33:11,107 --> 01:33:14,599
You were getting close to whoever murdered
that man on the dock three years ago.

1112
01:33:14,711 --> 01:33:16,611
Shh!

1113
01:33:16,713 --> 01:33:19,978
Chris, honey.
Honey, listen.

1114
01:33:20,083 --> 01:33:21,983
Conroy was crazy
for three years.

1115
01:33:22,085 --> 01:33:25,612
They staked out a man to watch him,
to wait for him to be well enough to talk.

1116
01:33:25,722 --> 01:33:28,384
Then I got to him.
They tried to kill me before I could.

1117
01:33:28,491 --> 01:33:31,324
When that missed, they had to kill Conroy.
They couldn't take the chance.

1118
01:33:31,428 --> 01:33:34,522
They sacrificed the money
to shut his mouth for good.

1119
01:33:34,631 --> 01:33:39,568
The way it turned out, they brought
the poor guy to his senses long enough.

1120
01:33:39,669 --> 01:33:41,728
What are we going to
do about it?

1121
01:33:41,838 --> 01:33:45,069
We're going to go trade in Larry Cravat
on a murderer. Come on.

1122
01:33:51,347 --> 01:33:54,111
- Going so soon?
- We just came in to be saved.

1123
01:33:54,217 --> 01:33:56,117
There's more to it
than that, young lady.

1124
01:33:56,219 --> 01:34:00,451
- I, uh, wonder if you could do me a favor, sir.
- Gladly, my boy.

1125
01:34:00,557 --> 01:34:04,254
This suitcase, could you call a messenger
and have him deliver it to police headquarters?

1126
01:34:04,360 --> 01:34:06,260
- Police headquarters?
- It's important.

1127
01:34:06,362 --> 01:34:09,092
It's the personal property
of Detective Lieutenant Donald Kendall.

1128
01:34:09,199 --> 01:34:11,099
He's the one
with his hat off.

1129
01:34:11,201 --> 01:34:13,431
I know Lieutenant Kendall,
young lady.

1130
01:34:13,536 --> 01:34:18,098
In that case, my boy, I'd be very glad
to take it over myself right now.

1131
01:34:18,208 --> 01:34:21,302
And, uh, please
accept this as a donation.

1132
01:34:21,411 --> 01:34:25,142
Ten dollars? Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1133
01:34:29,586 --> 01:34:31,486
Chris...

1134
01:34:33,556 --> 01:34:37,788
how long do you think before you can forget
the guy that Mary wrote about in her letter?

1135
01:34:37,894 --> 01:34:42,024
Funny you should bring that up.
I haven't thought of him once.

1136
01:34:42,132 --> 01:34:46,159
I keep remembering what
it must have been that she was in love with.

1137
01:34:46,269 --> 01:34:48,965
Come on.

1138
01:34:52,709 --> 01:34:55,803
- Where are we going?
- To a fortune-teller.

1139
01:34:55,912 --> 01:34:57,812
Why a fortune-teller?

1140
01:34:59,549 --> 01:35:01,449
To get
our fortunes told.

1141
01:35:03,153 --> 01:35:05,883
Well, if it isn't Hubert.

1142
01:35:05,989 --> 01:35:09,152
- Can we drop you anywhere, Hubert?
- We're gonna walk.

1143
01:35:09,259 --> 01:35:11,853
Walk? Which way?

1144
01:35:11,961 --> 01:35:14,293
Straight ahead.

1145
01:35:26,876 --> 01:35:29,037
Come in.

1146
01:35:34,417 --> 01:35:38,410
Well, it, uh- It looks
a lot more cheerful in here.

1147
01:35:38,521 --> 01:35:40,785
What's happened to
the Fu Manchu lighting effects?

1148
01:35:40,890 --> 01:35:45,759
I think the time has come to throw all the light
we can on the matters concerning us.

1149
01:35:53,336 --> 01:35:55,236
And who is the character
with the hair?

1150
01:35:55,338 --> 01:35:57,306
This is a Miss Smith.

1151
01:35:57,407 --> 01:36:01,104
- I get it.
- If it's around, I'm sure you will.

1152
01:36:01,211 --> 01:36:04,044
- Oh, we're having repartee, are we?
- We are not.

1153
01:36:05,715 --> 01:36:07,979
- Now that we are all here-
- But we are not.

1154
01:36:08,084 --> 01:36:10,552
Aren't you confused,
Mr. Taylor?

1155
01:36:10,653 --> 01:36:13,918
Not anymore.
Sit down, Chris.

1156
01:36:14,023 --> 01:36:18,426
The reason for this informal gathering
was the news on the radio tonight-

1157
01:36:18,528 --> 01:36:21,793
- that you are wanted for murder.
- That's not news.

1158
01:36:21,898 --> 01:36:24,230
You might say the police
have a priority on you.

1159
01:36:24,334 --> 01:36:29,601
It is, therefore, necessary
that we conclude our business at once.

1160
01:36:29,706 --> 01:36:31,606
Mr. Taylor,
where is Larry Cravat?

1161
01:36:33,176 --> 01:36:36,668
Shouldn't that be,
"Mr. Cravat, where is George Taylor?"

1162
01:36:36,779 --> 01:36:39,270
- What do you mean?
- You wanted to see Cravat.

1163
01:36:39,382 --> 01:36:41,282
All right.
You're looking at him.

1164
01:36:41,384 --> 01:36:43,011
You're crazy!

1165
01:36:43,119 --> 01:36:46,088
Remember, I had my face pushed around
at Okinawa. The docs patched me up.

1166
01:36:46,189 --> 01:36:49,022
- Well, Phyllis?
- I don't know. It- It could be.

1167
01:36:49,125 --> 01:36:51,059
I don't know for sure.
After all, I only met him once.

1168
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:54,220
I'm Larry Cravat.
You can take my word for it.

1169
01:36:54,330 --> 01:36:57,629
- I do.
- Then he knows where it is.

1170
01:36:57,734 --> 01:37:00,066
Don't let him waste
no more time, boss.

1171
01:37:00,169 --> 01:37:03,570
- He'll talk.
- Well, what do you know?

1172
01:37:03,673 --> 01:37:05,641
Hubert said
three whole sentences.

1173
01:37:05,742 --> 01:37:07,642
Hubert!

1174
01:37:07,744 --> 01:37:08,745
<i>Open up! I know they're here,</i>
<i>and I want in. Open up!</i>

1175
01:37:08,745 --> 01:37:10,542
<i>Open up! I know they're here,</i>
<i>and I want in. Open up!</i>

1176
01:37:22,258 --> 01:37:24,158
Hiya, kids.

1177
01:37:27,397 --> 01:37:31,925
- I haven't had the pleasure.
- The name is Phillips, Mr. Anzelmo.

1178
01:37:32,035 --> 01:37:34,026
And your name is Phyllis.
I've heard about you too.

1179
01:37:34,137 --> 01:37:36,071
She's a well-known
society girl.

1180
01:37:36,172 --> 01:37:40,802
I called your house when I got the news, Christy.
I've been all over town since looking for you.

1181
01:37:40,910 --> 01:37:43,105
It's a good thing I remembered
your mentioning Anzelmo.

1182
01:37:43,212 --> 01:37:46,739
Now that you are here,
Mr. Phillips, why are you here?

1183
01:37:46,849 --> 01:37:48,817
Because you wouldn't have
a quorum without me.

1184
01:37:48,918 --> 01:37:52,285
And because I'm an important
stockholder in two million dollars.

1185
01:37:52,388 --> 01:37:55,516
- Are you gonna stand for that?
- Perhaps.

1186
01:37:55,625 --> 01:37:58,719
At any rate, before any
more partners arrive...

1187
01:37:58,828 --> 01:38:02,696
I suggest you continue
what you were saying, Mr. Cravat.

1188
01:38:02,799 --> 01:38:04,824
Cravat?

1189
01:38:07,637 --> 01:38:10,299
Bring him
up to date, Chris.

1190
01:38:10,406 --> 01:38:12,772
Secrets.

1191
01:38:14,344 --> 01:38:17,108
I'll take the proposition
you offered me, Anzelmo...

1192
01:38:17,213 --> 01:38:19,545
- with one slight change.
- And that is?

1193
01:38:19,649 --> 01:38:22,379
I don't want a fall guy.

1194
01:38:22,485 --> 01:38:28,117
One of you, or one of your hired help,
killed Steele on that dock three years ago.

1195
01:38:29,158 --> 01:38:31,422
I want the one
that did it.

1196
01:38:31,527 --> 01:38:35,554
- Do you maintain that you,
yourself, were not the one?
- I know it.

1197
01:38:37,333 --> 01:38:40,200
Well...

1198
01:38:40,303 --> 01:38:45,002
In that case, I cannot tell you
how sorry I am, Phyllis.

1199
01:38:45,108 --> 01:38:49,044
- Sorry? For what?
- I did my best during all this time.

1200
01:38:49,145 --> 01:38:52,046
I saw to it that
the finger of suspicion never touched you.

1201
01:38:52,148 --> 01:38:54,048
What are you driving at?

1202
01:38:54,150 --> 01:38:59,053
Everyone knows that you were with Cravat
the night before the murder.

1203
01:38:59,155 --> 01:39:01,680
But where were you
on the night of the murder?

1204
01:39:01,791 --> 01:39:04,521
- With you! I was with you!
- With me?

1205
01:39:04,627 --> 01:39:07,755
Phyllis, you shouldn't.
You're among friends.

1206
01:39:07,864 --> 01:39:11,027
Hubert was with me
all that night.

1207
01:39:11,134 --> 01:39:13,432
- Was she here too, Hubert?
- No, boss.

1208
01:39:14,971 --> 01:39:16,871
What is this?
Some kind of a gag?

1209
01:39:16,973 --> 01:39:19,237
You're smart. You can tell a cheap frame.
This is a laugh.

1210
01:39:19,342 --> 01:39:21,242
Then laugh this off.

1211
01:39:21,344 --> 01:39:25,872
That you were seen on the dock the next morning,
that you were nervous and upset.

1212
01:39:25,982 --> 01:39:29,611
That you threw something into the harbor,
something that glinted in the sun.

1213
01:39:29,719 --> 01:39:31,914
People will swear
it was a gun, Phyllis.

1214
01:39:32,021 --> 01:39:36,048
Well, here's one you can swear to,
you and that big tub of lard.

1215
01:39:36,159 --> 01:39:38,184
Baby don't get framed
by your kind.

1216
01:39:38,294 --> 01:39:40,262
<i>Your kind</i>
<i>come a dime a dozen.</i>

1217
01:39:40,363 --> 01:39:43,230
That accent don't score with me,
and I'm not payin' your bills.

1218
01:39:45,034 --> 01:39:46,934
Look it up in
one of your books, Anzelmo.

1219
01:39:47,036 --> 01:39:49,061
There's a dead bartender
the cops wanna know about.

1220
01:39:51,874 --> 01:39:53,774
Hold it.

1221
01:39:56,412 --> 01:39:58,846
Get over there.

1222
01:39:58,948 --> 01:40:00,848
You too.

1223
01:40:02,485 --> 01:40:05,147
I want the money too,
but not that bad.

1224
01:40:05,254 --> 01:40:07,950
My car's right in front
of the door. Get in it.

1225
01:40:13,830 --> 01:40:15,730
Give me the key.

1226
01:40:31,414 --> 01:40:35,748
No, gentlemen, no. There's no time for that.

1227
01:40:35,852 --> 01:40:39,083
I doubt whether there is
even time enough to get out of town.

1228
01:40:41,057 --> 01:40:43,116
Phyllis, darling.

1229
01:40:46,162 --> 01:40:48,630
The jig is up.

1230
01:40:51,934 --> 01:40:54,960
- My car! We forgot it.
- We'll get it later.

1231
01:40:55,071 --> 01:40:57,904
We're practically at the Cellar.
I'll open it up, and we'll have a drink.

1232
01:40:58,007 --> 01:41:00,407
- I could use one.
- I wouldn't say no.

1233
01:41:02,145 --> 01:41:04,875
Be careful. Don't trip over any of
the customers they forgot to clean up.

1234
01:41:07,250 --> 01:41:09,741
It's a long time
since I've worked behind the bar.

1235
01:41:09,852 --> 01:41:11,786
You gotta promise
not to tell the union.

1236
01:41:11,888 --> 01:41:14,254
I'm 12 years behind on my dues.

1237
01:41:14,357 --> 01:41:16,257
Sit down.

1238
01:41:20,463 --> 01:41:22,363
Stop me if
I'm repeating myself...

1239
01:41:22,465 --> 01:41:24,899
but you're a very nice guy,
Mr. Phillips.

1240
01:41:25,001 --> 01:41:27,299
- Forget it.
- I guess I owe you quite a bit.

1241
01:41:27,403 --> 01:41:30,895
You owe me nothing
Whatever I did, I did for Christy.

1242
01:41:31,007 --> 01:41:33,032
You've acted like an idiot
from the beginning.

1243
01:41:33,142 --> 01:41:35,542
And the prize was walking
into that setup back there.

1244
01:41:35,645 --> 01:41:37,840
- He couldn't help it.
- I didn't want to.

1245
01:41:37,947 --> 01:41:41,883
You see, I figure that all of them
except one wanted nothing but the money.

1246
01:41:41,984 --> 01:41:44,885
And that one wanted me
dead even more.

1247
01:41:44,987 --> 01:41:46,921
'Cause if and when
I get my memory back...

1248
01:41:47,023 --> 01:41:50,254
I'll know that he killed Steele that night.

1249
01:41:50,359 --> 01:41:55,023
I figured he'd make some move, some attempt
to get me alone, even to get me...

1250
01:41:56,065 --> 01:41:58,465
out of there.

1251
01:41:58,568 --> 01:42:01,196
He had to get you alone,
didn't he?

1252
01:42:01,304 --> 01:42:03,864
Away from the others
so he wouldn't show his hand.

1253
01:42:03,973 --> 01:42:06,703
So they wouldn't know
that he-

1254
01:42:09,378 --> 01:42:11,437
- I'm sorry you're in this, Christy.
<i>- She's not in it.</i>

1255
01:42:11,547 --> 01:42:14,539
Did you know all along
that George was Larry Cravat?

1256
01:42:14,650 --> 01:42:17,517
Not until tonight.
I never met Cravat.

1257
01:42:19,055 --> 01:42:21,580
Steele had come up from Arizona
to bring me the two million.

1258
01:42:21,691 --> 01:42:24,660
I'm in a good spot to slip big bills like that
into circulation.

1259
01:42:24,760 --> 01:42:28,287
Steele didn't know me.
We were to meet on the dock.

1260
01:42:28,397 --> 01:42:32,766
Cravat heard about it somehow. He met Steele,
convinced him he was me and got the money.

1261
01:42:34,203 --> 01:42:36,398
Steele was alone
when I got there.

1262
01:42:37,773 --> 01:42:40,799
I thought he double-crossed me,
and I killed him.

1263
01:42:40,910 --> 01:42:44,471
Then I saw Cravat. I shot once and missed.
I never saw him again.

1264
01:42:44,580 --> 01:42:47,743
Conroy saw it, and you tried
to have him killed with a truck.

1265
01:42:47,850 --> 01:42:49,750
Same thing you tried
with me tonight.

1266
01:42:49,852 --> 01:42:52,412
Wasn't very effective.
It missed you completely.

1267
01:42:52,521 --> 01:42:55,922
And he wound up with his mind affected.
He doesn't worry me now.

1268
01:42:56,025 --> 01:42:59,256
No. The little man with the glasses
took care of that, didn't he?

1269
01:42:59,362 --> 01:43:02,388
The one you staked outside
Christy's house to watch me.

1270
01:43:02,498 --> 01:43:05,467
Did you send him after us
tonight, under the dock?

1271
01:43:05,568 --> 01:43:07,502
I didn't know
you were under the dock.

1272
01:43:07,603 --> 01:43:10,538
His orders were to get you
wherever and whenever.

1273
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:12,540
I've thought about you
a lot, Cravat.

1274
01:43:12,642 --> 01:43:16,476
For three years.
About you and the money you stole from me.

1275
01:43:16,579 --> 01:43:20,071
You're gonna be a poor man now, Cravat.
A dead man's a poor man.

1276
01:43:20,182 --> 01:43:22,673
- I got you into this.
- Stop it.

1277
01:43:22,785 --> 01:43:25,253
Little Miss
Know-The-Right-People.

1278
01:43:25,354 --> 01:43:27,686
I couldn't leave you alone.

1279
01:43:27,790 --> 01:43:29,690
Had to call in that
good, kind character.

1280
01:43:29,792 --> 01:43:32,090
I never did anything
to you, Christy.

1281
01:43:32,194 --> 01:43:35,925
- You're doing all right now.
- Why didn't you stay out of it?
I told you to. I warned you.

1282
01:43:36,032 --> 01:43:38,694
- The answer still goes.
- I know. You're nuts about the guy.

1283
01:43:38,801 --> 01:43:41,668
- But it's too late now.
- She's got no part of this, and you know it.

1284
01:43:41,771 --> 01:43:45,434
- It's too late.
- But... maybe it isn't.

1285
01:43:45,541 --> 01:43:48,408
- I'm sorry.
- You don't know why we were under the dock.

1286
01:43:48,511 --> 01:43:51,309
Do you want me to tell it? Or Christy.
Maybe you'd rather believe her.

1287
01:43:51,414 --> 01:43:54,383
- Is it that important?
<i>- I thought it was.</i>

1288
01:43:54,483 --> 01:43:57,611
Finding out whether the two million I hid there
three years ago was still there.

1289
01:43:57,720 --> 01:43:59,711
Was it?

1290
01:43:59,822 --> 01:44:03,758
- Every brand-new thousand-dollar bill.
- I thought you got away with it.

1291
01:44:03,859 --> 01:44:07,386
And you thought a lot of it must be gone.
Not a cent. It's all there.

1292
01:44:07,496 --> 01:44:10,829
Two million dollars. Nobody in the world
will know you've got it, except Christy.

1293
01:44:10,933 --> 01:44:12,833
That's the deal.

1294
01:44:12,935 --> 01:44:15,529
<i>- Christy for two million dollars.</i>
- No sale.

1295
01:44:15,638 --> 01:44:18,607
Well, what can she do to a smart operator like you?
Go to the police?

1296
01:44:18,708 --> 01:44:20,608
It's her word against yours.
I'll be gone.

1297
01:44:20,710 --> 01:44:23,110
They think I did it anyway.
Conroy too.

1298
01:44:23,212 --> 01:44:26,113
All she can do is repeat herself
and pretty soon nobody's listening.

1299
01:44:26,215 --> 01:44:28,308
- It's no use, and I won't have it.
- Two million dollars.

1300
01:44:28,417 --> 01:44:32,547
<i>- Two million dollars.</i>
- Where is it?

1301
01:44:32,655 --> 01:44:35,681
I'll take you near it.
Then Christy goes free and I'll take you to it.

1302
01:44:35,791 --> 01:44:38,191
This can't be a phony.
I'm in no position to work one.

1303
01:44:38,294 --> 01:44:41,058
I couldn't have planted it.
I didn't know this was going to happen.

1304
01:44:41,163 --> 01:44:43,324
- Where do we have to go?
- Back near the dock.

1305
01:44:45,634 --> 01:44:47,534
Okay.

1306
01:45:03,986 --> 01:45:07,046
- Where do we go?
- A couple of doors down.

1307
01:45:07,156 --> 01:45:09,852
Leave the motor running.

1308
01:45:21,470 --> 01:45:23,370
Okay. Okay.

1309
01:45:27,243 --> 01:45:29,143
- Back in the car.
- But the money's inside.

1310
01:45:29,245 --> 01:45:31,145
- Do as you're told!
- What about Christy?

1311
01:45:31,247 --> 01:45:33,147
- She goes too.
- You won't get the money!

1312
01:45:33,249 --> 01:45:35,444
Yes, I will.
I know where it is now.

1313
01:45:35,551 --> 01:45:38,952
I'll come back for it later.
Get in the car, both of you.

1314
01:45:47,363 --> 01:45:49,388
Don't anybody move.

1315
01:45:59,708 --> 01:46:02,541
- What's it look like, Mac?
- He's still with us.

1316
01:46:02,645 --> 01:46:05,273
- Hey, keep these people back in there!
- Get back, folks.

1317
01:46:05,381 --> 01:46:07,372
- Better get an ambulance.
- Right.

1318
01:46:12,755 --> 01:46:16,054
- Get that stuff copied as soon as possible.
- Yes, sir.

1319
01:46:16,158 --> 01:46:18,058
Did Phillips tell you
everything you wanted to know?

1320
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:21,254
Yeah. With full details. It'll make
better reading than Forever Amber.

1321
01:46:21,363 --> 01:46:23,263
And will he live, as if I care?

1322
01:46:23,365 --> 01:46:25,595
Well, if I could only learn
how to shoot straight...

1323
01:46:25,701 --> 01:46:28,169
maybe I could save you taxpayers some dough.

1324
01:46:28,270 --> 01:46:30,932
- But I always close my eyes.
<i>- For you, Lieutenant. It's Mac.</i>

1325
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:32,940
Yeah.

1326
01:46:33,976 --> 01:46:36,103
Hello, Mac.

1327
01:46:36,212 --> 01:46:38,112
Oh, the little man
with the glasses...

1328
01:46:38,214 --> 01:46:40,580
uh, he used to work as an attendant
at the Lambert Sanatorium.

1329
01:46:40,683 --> 01:46:43,652
- Lambeth.
- Lambeth Sanatorium, make that.

1330
01:46:43,752 --> 01:46:47,483
You can start from there.
You got all the others. That's good.

1331
01:46:47,590 --> 01:46:49,854
Okay.
I'll see you.

1332
01:46:51,460 --> 01:46:54,520
Say, you know, that was a pretty sharp
piece of thinking you did...

1333
01:46:54,630 --> 01:46:56,530
bringing Phillips
back to that mission.

1334
01:46:56,632 --> 01:46:58,657
You knew I'd backtrack
on that suitcase, didn't you?

1335
01:46:58,767 --> 01:47:01,235
The spot we were in,
I had to think sharp and talk fast.

1336
01:47:01,337 --> 01:47:04,500
Aha. You must have been
a pretty good shamus, Cravat.

1337
01:47:04,607 --> 01:47:07,974
- Shamus?
- Shamus is a private eye.

1338
01:47:08,077 --> 01:47:10,511
Well, at least it looks like
I kept my nose clean, anyway.

1339
01:47:10,613 --> 01:47:13,207
Yeah. You think
you'll go back to it?

1340
01:47:13,315 --> 01:47:16,614
No, thanks. See, three years of war
can change a man.

1341
01:47:16,719 --> 01:47:18,744
That's what
I always say.

1342
01:47:18,854 --> 01:47:21,015
Well, if I can be of any help to you,
just let me know.

1343
01:47:21,123 --> 01:47:23,182
Thanks. I'd like to drop around
if you don't mind.

1344
01:47:23,292 --> 01:47:25,522
There's still a lot of questions
I want answers for.

1345
01:47:25,628 --> 01:47:29,496
I know the answer to one.
But you haven't asked it yet.

1346
01:47:39,174 --> 01:47:44,840
You know, Moskowitz, have you ever wondered
why a detective keeps his hat on all the time?

1347
01:47:44,947 --> 01:47:48,212
- Can't say I ever thought about it, Lieutenant.
- I found out why tonight.

1348
01:47:50,553 --> 01:47:55,889
You see, if you have to shoot a man,
you don't wanna be holding a hat in your hand.

1349
01:47:56,926 --> 01:47:58,826
Seems that
the movies are right.
