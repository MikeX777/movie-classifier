00:03:56,652 --> 00:03:57,983
Johnny...

2
00:03:59,288 --> 00:04:02,155
...you really sweeten me this morning.

3
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,928
You sweeten me so good.

4
00:04:08,965 --> 00:04:10,557
And I love you for it.

5
00:04:11,767 --> 00:04:12,961
You know that?

6
00:04:17,707 --> 00:04:19,971
Honey, I gotta get movin'.

7
00:04:21,677 --> 00:04:23,008
You!

8
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:26,071
John Wintergreen,
you ain't no superman.

9
00:04:26,148 --> 00:04:29,140
You ain't.
You ain't got it in you!

10
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,050
You ain't got it in you.

11
00:04:33,956 --> 00:04:35,480
John!

12
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:37,487
Bullshit.

13
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:40,024
You do got it in you.

14
00:04:55,177 --> 00:05:00,410
"Contemporary Sexual Behavior
and Morality

15
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:04,510

16
00:05:04,587 --> 00:05:08,216

00:05:12,762 --> 00:05:14,127
Oh, my.

19
00:05:14,196 --> 00:05:16,926
I'll bet it ain't no better
than <i>Valley of the Dolls.</i>

20
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:18,432
- Big John?
- Yeah.

21
00:05:18,501 --> 00:05:20,731
Did you ever see <i>Valley of the Dolls?</i>

22
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:25,502
My dove, I got
my valley of the dolls right here.

23
00:05:32,748 --> 00:05:34,238
Hello, easy street.

24
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:38,348
Johnny, don't you ever get tired?

25
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,651
I do, but the important part don't.

26
00:05:41,724 --> 00:05:44,249
I gotta go right now. Bye!

27
00:09:11,534 --> 00:09:12,694
Sergeant, sir?

28
00:09:12,768 --> 00:09:15,134
Excuse me, I was just wondering
if there was any word

29
00:09:15,204 --> 00:09:17,434
on my application
for transfer, Sergeant?

30
00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:18,996
Negative, Wintergreen.

31
00:09:19,074 --> 00:09:21,634
See, it's my
third application this month,

32
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:24,076
and I know there is
an opening in Homicide.

33
00:09:25,981 --> 00:09:28,415
Would you let me know
if there's any word on it, would you?

34
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:31,419
- Fall in, Wintergreen.
- Yes, sir.

35
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,433
Attention!

36
00:09:48,637 --> 00:09:50,901
Dress right! Dress!

37
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,006
Parade rest!

38
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,669
Good morning, pigs.

39
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,250
Good morning, you fascists.

40
00:10:03,319 --> 00:10:05,219
You honkies!

41
00:10:06,555 --> 00:10:07,954
You killers!

42
00:10:08,991 --> 00:10:10,253
You bigots!

43
00:10:12,661 --> 00:10:13,787
You fags!

44
00:10:15,264 --> 00:10:16,891
You pinkos.

45
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,495
You creeps!

46
00:10:20,569 --> 00:10:21,968
You bastards!

47
00:10:25,174 --> 00:10:26,368
Fuzz.

48
00:10:30,012 --> 00:10:32,173
This indoctrination of vocal harassment

49
00:10:32,248 --> 00:10:34,375
was compiled
by our own juvenile division

50
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:37,442
in preparation
for the concert this weekend.

51
00:10:38,153 --> 00:10:40,621
Now, men, I'm going to
talk to you this morning

52
00:10:40,689 --> 00:10:44,147
about self-control
and law enforcement.

53
00:11:31,507 --> 00:11:33,532
- Good morning, sir.
- Hi there, fella.

54
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,634
Where'd you come from?
Out of a crater?

55
00:11:36,145 --> 00:11:37,203
I guess I did.

56
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,042
Could I see
your driver's license, please?

57
00:11:39,114 --> 00:11:40,843
Speed limit's 60 miles an hour, right?

58
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:43,316
This little horse kinda gets
away from me once in a while.

59
00:11:43,385 --> 00:11:45,216
You're gonna have to take a tighter rein

60
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:48,279
'cause I did clock you
doing almost 90 a ways back there.

61
00:11:48,357 --> 00:11:50,689
- Could I see the license?
- Sure.

62
00:11:55,764 --> 00:11:58,062
There we are.
All right.

63
00:11:58,133 --> 00:11:59,395
Morning, ma'am.

64
00:12:00,502 --> 00:12:02,231
A police officer.

65
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,433
- A detective.
- Yes. Los Angeles.

66
00:12:07,142 --> 00:12:10,077
Well, that's a coincidence, you see,

67
00:12:10,145 --> 00:12:13,273
because l... I hope to change
this uniform for a suit myself

68
00:12:13,349 --> 00:12:14,646
just any day now.

69
00:12:14,717 --> 00:12:17,049
Well, luck to you then, fella.

70
00:12:17,119 --> 00:12:18,108
Thank you very much.

71
00:12:18,187 --> 00:12:19,814
Could you take the license
out for me, please?

72
00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:21,886
You gotta be kiddin'.

73
00:12:21,957 --> 00:12:24,892
- You're gonna give me a ticket?
- I'm afraid so, sir.

74
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,120
Thank you.

75
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,357
Take a good look at this, fella.

76
00:12:29,431 --> 00:12:32,798
It says Los Angeles
Police Department Detective, right?

77
00:12:32,868 --> 00:12:36,235
Well, I'm John Wintergreen,
Stockman Motors,

78
00:12:36,305 --> 00:12:39,468
and I have to write you up,
if you'll just be patient for one minute.

79
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,441
- Just one minute.
- You're a joke, fella.

80
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,535
I don't know what cracker barrel
you crawled out of,

81
00:12:43,612 --> 00:12:45,341
but I wish you'd crawl back in it.

82
00:12:45,414 --> 00:12:48,645
I'm going back over to L.A.,
and I'm gonna instruct my traffic man

83
00:12:48,717 --> 00:12:51,652
to tag every Arizona plate
that comes into that state, right?

84
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,086
They're gonna give them
your badge number and your name.

85
00:12:54,156 --> 00:12:56,681
Then all them son of a bitches
are gonna come back here

86
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:59,421
and climb your ass.
You got that, officer?

87
00:13:03,098 --> 00:13:05,089
- Can you sign that, please?
- Yeah.

88
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,272
Have a nice day.

89
00:13:33,762 --> 00:13:35,855
You boys are gonna have to
turn this rig around

90
00:13:35,931 --> 00:13:38,365
and get it all the way back up
on Buckeye Road.

91
00:13:38,434 --> 00:13:41,892
Buckeye Road? That'd be another
three, four more hours anyway.

92
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:45,633
Well, you know, there's
no five-axle vehicles on this highway.

93
00:13:45,707 --> 00:13:47,368
I think you know that.

94
00:13:47,443 --> 00:13:49,104
You got a weigh slip?

95
00:13:52,314 --> 00:13:54,248
Thank you.
Excuse me just a minute.

96
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:01,384
There goes another job.

97
00:14:03,158 --> 00:14:04,455
Hey, son?

98
00:14:05,894 --> 00:14:09,489
See there? John Wintergreen.
That's my name.

99
00:14:09,565 --> 00:14:12,591
And I always write down
John Wintergreen first

100
00:14:12,668 --> 00:14:16,627
whenever I run into a fellow
that I think has got a story to tell me.

101
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,608
And I think you're one of them fellas.

102
00:14:22,077 --> 00:14:24,443
Why don't you go ahead
and tell me your story?

103
00:14:25,647 --> 00:14:27,478
Well, it's... it's nothing, really.

104
00:14:27,549 --> 00:14:29,676
It's just that since I got back,

105
00:14:29,751 --> 00:14:32,584
it seems like the only natural talent
I got is for screwing up.

106
00:14:32,654 --> 00:14:36,249
It's been two months since I got back
from Nam and I've blown two jobs.

107
00:14:39,228 --> 00:14:41,219
What the hell?
It's no excuse.

108
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,861
It's just a question
of adjustment, you know?

109
00:14:43,932 --> 00:14:45,365
Yeah, I know what you mean.

110
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:47,527
Listen, I wanna give you a little advice.

111
00:14:47,603 --> 00:14:51,198
Don't look for favors, 'cause that's
the wrong foot to get started on.

112
00:14:51,273 --> 00:14:53,264
You're talkin' to a fella who knows.

113
00:14:53,342 --> 00:14:55,401
You sound like
you made the trip yourself.

114
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:59,140
Marines. Fourth Recon.
I got back in '68.

115
00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:02,041
It's good to find you, brother.

116
00:15:02,117 --> 00:15:05,245
- I can't tell you how good.
- You don't know how good it is.

117
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,288
You see, you've been back
only six weeks,

118
00:15:07,356 --> 00:15:10,814
and I'm gonna do for you what it took
somebody six months to do for me.

119
00:15:10,893 --> 00:15:13,157
- Yes, sir. What's that?
- Nothin'.

120
00:15:15,531 --> 00:15:17,590
- Are you gonna give me a ticket?
- I'm gonna give you a ticket.

121
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,224
And you're gonna make me
go back to Buckeye Road?

122
00:15:19,301 --> 00:15:21,360
Gonna make you go back
to Buckeye Road.

123
00:15:22,738 --> 00:15:25,206
And you don't even
have to thank me for it.

00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,860
Boy, I hope that's you, Big John.

140
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,638
Well, that's one for you.

141
00:17:14,983 --> 00:17:16,314
Read me some.

Nope. I'm gonna sit right here
in the shade.

Maybe I'll go check it myself.

I just came from over there.

Excuse me.
How about Camelback?

Ain't no action over there, either.

Is that a fact?

Zipper, that's the story of your life.

165

Ain't no action, no place, at no time.

I'll see ya later.

00:19:03,525 --> 00:19:05,254
What'll you have, sweetheart?

173
00:19:10,298 --> 00:19:11,788
Put me down.

174
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,508
- Hi.
- Hi.

175
00:19:22,577 --> 00:19:26,638
Did you know that me and Alan Ladd
were exactly the same height?

176
00:19:26,715 --> 00:19:29,206
Right down to the quarter inch?

177
00:19:30,986 --> 00:19:32,248
Did you know that?

178
00:19:34,356 --> 00:19:36,483
It's just something you know, you know?

179
00:19:38,293 --> 00:19:41,660
Like sometimes you read a lot
and you just remember a little bit?

180
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:44,095
Then there's sometimes
you read a little bit

181
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,134
and you remember a whole lot.

182
00:19:47,803 --> 00:19:50,237
I remember one time
I heard somebody say,

183
00:19:50,305 --> 00:19:53,866
"Do you know what was Alan Ladd
and William Bendix's first movie?"

184
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:56,706
And just like that,
I said <i>The Blue Dahlia</i>.

185
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,678
And I never even saw the movie.

186
00:19:58,747 --> 00:20:01,113
But I bet five dollars and I won it.

187
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:14,057
Did you know that he was so short
that they used to have to dig a ditch

188
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:16,757
for the girls to stand in to kiss him?

189
00:20:19,734 --> 00:20:21,292
You didn't know that, huh?

190
00:20:22,504 --> 00:20:25,200
Let me have a couple boxes of popcorn,

191
00:20:25,273 --> 00:20:27,241
two of those Whoppers,

192
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,709
four bags of those
sunflower fritees,

193
00:20:29,778 --> 00:20:33,043
and give me one
of those giant Joy Colas.

194
00:20:38,587 --> 00:20:39,918
What are you gonna get?

195
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,623
A fudge bar.

196
00:20:44,793 --> 00:20:45,953
How about you?

197
00:20:47,562 --> 00:20:49,427
I lost my interest.

198
00:20:53,268 --> 00:20:55,202
My friend will take care of you.

199
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:03,235
I'd like to have a grilled cheese
sandwich and a Cherry Coke.

200
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,383
- Morning.
- Morning.

201
00:21:45,453 --> 00:21:47,614
Can I see
your driver's license, please?

202
00:21:47,689 --> 00:21:49,179
Why don't you step out here?

203
00:21:52,961 --> 00:21:55,225
- Take it out for me, okay?
- Sure.

204
00:21:57,966 --> 00:21:59,263
Thank you.

205
00:22:01,937 --> 00:22:03,063
You guys are early, man.

206
00:22:03,138 --> 00:22:05,766
I only counted on getting stopped
once every 50 miles

207
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,171
between here and Arcadia.

208
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:10,541
You guys are 20 miles early.
Incredible. A first.

209
00:22:10,612 --> 00:22:13,843
Looks like we got ourselves
a wiseass here, John.

210
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:16,884
- Hey. David?
- Yeah.

211
00:22:16,952 --> 00:22:19,648
- I'm John. Are you a wiseass?
- Not at all, man.

212
00:22:19,721 --> 00:22:21,086
That a boy.

213
00:22:21,156 --> 00:22:26,184
Can't you just give me my ticket for
doing 40 in a 45 and let me split?

214
00:22:26,661 --> 00:22:30,256
- Just what is it you got to hide?
- Man, I'm not hiding nothing, man.

215
00:22:30,332 --> 00:22:33,130
Just tired of getting cracked
for the way I look. It's a drag.

216
00:22:33,201 --> 00:22:34,498
- It gets to be a drag.
- Yeah?

217
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:36,628
Why don't you change
the way you look?

218
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,172
As a matter of fact,
all you gotta do is just stand there.

219
00:22:43,244 --> 00:22:44,404
I'll change it for you.

220
00:22:44,479 --> 00:22:47,175
What do you say
I get those slicers out, Big John?

221
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,419
Just what is it
you're carrying in here anyway?

222
00:22:51,486 --> 00:22:56,480
Posters, beads, general hippie regalia.
You know, the whole routine.

223
00:22:56,558 --> 00:22:59,550
Yeah, let's get it all out there
so we can see it.

224
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,789
Man. Come on, man.
Like, what a drag.

225
00:23:01,863 --> 00:23:04,354
I don't want to have to
unload my bus, man.

226
00:23:04,432 --> 00:23:07,026
- You told me you weren't a wiseass.
- I'm not.

227
00:23:07,102 --> 00:23:08,364
He asked to see everything.

228
00:23:08,436 --> 00:23:11,064
Why don't you just take it out
and put it down here on the highway?

229
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:13,733
You're gonna be a lot better off.
Will you take my advice?

230
00:23:13,808 --> 00:23:15,241
- Fine.
- That a boy.

231
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,299
Fine. Great.

232
00:23:38,533 --> 00:23:41,764
What do we have here, Big John?
A picture of us?

233
00:23:42,604 --> 00:23:45,937
- You look a little heavy there, Zipper.
- That looks like you.

234
00:23:46,608 --> 00:23:48,098
I'm what you might call the distributor.

235
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,872
I distribute to all the head shops
between Santa Fe and Albuquerque.

236
00:23:50,945 --> 00:23:52,537
All this stuff.

237
00:23:52,614 --> 00:23:54,946
Son, you're what I might call a dealer.

238
00:23:56,451 --> 00:23:59,420
Hey, Dave.
Come here a minute.

239
00:24:04,225 --> 00:24:06,955
Now, just...
just between you and me,

240
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:10,054
are you holding
anything you shouldn't be?

241
00:24:10,131 --> 00:24:11,689
No way, man.
I'm totally clean, man.

242
00:24:11,766 --> 00:24:14,234
I'm telling you, it's my gig.
I sell this stuff to people.

243
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:19,672
- Okay. Pack it up.
- Outta sight, outta sight.

244
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,473
Wanna remove them hubcaps
for inspection?

245
00:24:26,247 --> 00:24:28,613
Go ahead. It'll take you five minutes,
you'll be outta here.

246
00:24:28,683 --> 00:24:30,344
- Go on.
- Fine.

247
00:24:35,356 --> 00:24:37,847
- Hey, Big John?
- Yeah, Zipper.

248
00:24:37,926 --> 00:24:41,123
Why don't you check out
that shopping bag there?

249
00:24:41,696 --> 00:24:43,254
See what he's got in there.

250
00:24:45,667 --> 00:24:47,999
You already checked that bag, Zipper.

251
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,559
I know it.

252
00:24:50,538 --> 00:24:51,698
Check it again.

253
00:24:52,674 --> 00:24:54,539
Could be there's something I missed.

254
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:59,103
I'm gonna get a make on that VW.

255
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:02,411
Then we're gonna pack all this shit up
and get out of here.

256
00:25:02,484 --> 00:25:04,714
I said check out that shopping bag.

257
00:25:10,525 --> 00:25:13,289
That kid is a smartass,
and I'm gonna bust him.

258
00:25:13,361 --> 00:25:15,522
- I'll bet you are, Zipper.
- That's right.

259
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:18,361
Now, you get on the right side of it.

260
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:21,095
And don't you
look at me like that, either.

261
00:25:27,909 --> 00:25:30,605
Hey, David.
Come over here.

262
00:25:33,181 --> 00:25:35,649
- What is this you got here?
- Forget it, man.

263
00:25:35,717 --> 00:25:38,242
You planted that shit on me,
and you know it, man.

264
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:40,981
You hassled my ass
for an hour and a half here, man.

265
00:25:41,055 --> 00:25:42,420
I'm gonna lose bread
on all my shit, man.

266
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:44,321
And you hassled me, and now
you're planting this shit on me.

267
00:25:44,392 --> 00:25:45,757
You're gonna take me in
and crack me, right?

268
00:25:45,827 --> 00:25:47,886
The law. The long arm
of the law, man. Right.

269
00:25:47,962 --> 00:25:50,362
Helping people out, right?
That's really great.

270
00:25:50,431 --> 00:25:53,730
That's really top drawer.
Outta sight.

271
00:25:55,336 --> 00:25:58,203
Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you...

272
00:26:06,948 --> 00:26:08,381
Turn it on!

273
00:26:27,902 --> 00:26:30,837
I guess you're just
getting tired of old Zip, huh?

274
00:26:34,976 --> 00:26:36,944
Nah, I ain't getting tired of old Zip.

275
00:26:37,011 --> 00:26:38,945
Don't you lie to me.

276
00:27:47,849 --> 00:27:50,010
- Call it.
- Tails.

277
00:27:50,084 --> 00:27:51,108
Got it.

278
00:27:51,686 --> 00:27:54,655
- Shoot stick.
- You're in trouble already, son.

279
00:28:03,965 --> 00:28:06,900
Big John, what you wanna
go over to Homicide for?

280
00:28:08,736 --> 00:28:13,639
Zip, I just can't spend
the rest of my life on a motorcycle.

281
00:28:13,708 --> 00:28:16,404
Out there in that desert
getting heat stroke,

282
00:28:16,477 --> 00:28:20,345
listening to you pass air
outta both ends at the same time.

283
00:28:20,415 --> 00:28:23,043
That just ain't my idea
of being a cop, partner.

284
00:28:23,117 --> 00:28:25,608
Hey, we got a good life
on these motors.

285
00:28:25,687 --> 00:28:28,713
You put in your time, you go home,
and you get your money.

286
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,519
What could be more simple?

287
00:28:30,591 --> 00:28:31,990
Can't argue.

288
00:28:32,994 --> 00:28:34,928
It just ain't my dream.

289
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,821
Dreaming's part of the game, Zip.

290
00:28:38,666 --> 00:28:41,032
- Ain't you got a dream?
- Sure.

291
00:28:41,102 --> 00:28:42,763
I dream...

292
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,836
...for a Stroker.

293
00:28:46,908 --> 00:28:49,638
About 1400cc's worth,

294
00:28:49,711 --> 00:28:54,273
tucked into a '74 straight legged
chrome frame kicked.

295
00:28:54,916 --> 00:28:57,908
Sixteen-inch Ricon mag rear wheels.

296
00:28:59,153 --> 00:29:02,589
With a chrome sprocket,
chrome chain, chrome spokes,

297
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:06,093
a chrome tranny, a chrome puddy...

298
00:29:07,028 --> 00:29:11,021
...and an eight-inch
extended sportster fork

299
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:13,932
with a chrome dog bone.

300
00:29:14,602 --> 00:29:17,435
T.T. Pipes, brass rocker boxes,

301
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:20,167
couple of quartz-eyed
dyed running lights.

302
00:29:21,376 --> 00:29:23,970
And a full Farron
you can really get behind.

303
00:29:24,045 --> 00:29:25,706
Excuse me.

304
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:30,183
Contoured seat
with a two-foot poor boy cissy bar.

305
00:29:30,251 --> 00:29:31,548
Hit it on.

306
00:29:34,822 --> 00:29:38,485
And no squawk box, but a telephone.

307
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:43,553
And an AM/FM and an insulated
cocktail bar in the left pocket.

308
00:29:43,631 --> 00:29:46,259
To me, Big John,
that's a real motor scooter.

309
00:29:46,768 --> 00:29:49,168
What you wanna go
over to Homicide for?

310
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:53,496
- Got the money for it, Zip?
- Not a dime.

311
00:29:54,242 --> 00:29:55,573
I'm just dreamin'.

312
00:29:56,978 --> 00:30:00,470
Well, see, my dream
don't cost a nickel.

313
00:30:01,516 --> 00:30:04,815
All I want is that brown suit
and that Stetson hat...

314
00:30:05,853 --> 00:30:08,549
...and four wheels under me
instead of two.

315
00:30:09,524 --> 00:30:13,551
And that badge that says "Boy,
you're getting paid to think,

316
00:30:13,628 --> 00:30:16,290
not get calluses on your ass

317
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:21,432
You're just hungry to be
one of them glamour boys, ain't you?

318
00:30:22,336 --> 00:30:23,428
Yes.

319
00:30:44,258 --> 00:30:47,318
Hey, Zipper, what the hell
is that out there?

320
00:30:51,499 --> 00:30:52,989
Let's get him, Zip!

321
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:58,538
Okay. Let's round him up!

322
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,506
Stay with him, cowboy.

323
00:31:23,431 --> 00:31:24,591
Where the hell did he go?

324
00:31:24,665 --> 00:31:27,600
I don't know. The last time
I saw him, he was right there.

325
00:31:27,668 --> 00:31:29,295
Well, he ain't there now.

326
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:31,565
That's brilliant, John.

327
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,698
You stay here, I'll flush him out.

328
00:31:33,774 --> 00:31:35,071
Okay!

329
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,320
Hey! Come here, John!

330
00:32:01,969 --> 00:32:03,095
It's okay, Willie.

331
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,570
Hey, Zip, it's old Willie.

332
00:32:04,639 --> 00:32:06,300
- Jesus, why?!
- It's all right.

333
00:32:06,374 --> 00:32:08,433
Oh, Jesus! Why?!

334
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:10,272
- Jesus, why?
- Hold it, Willie.

335
00:32:10,344 --> 00:32:12,403
- Why?
- It's okay, Willie.

336
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,916
- Jesus, why?
- It's me. John Wintergreen.

337
00:32:19,253 --> 00:32:20,845
It's okay, Willie.

338
00:32:26,127 --> 00:32:28,288
What are you doing
out here, Willie?

339
00:32:28,362 --> 00:32:30,922
- What are you doing out here?
- Frank.

340
00:32:30,998 --> 00:32:32,329
Frank. I know Frank.

341
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,732
Frank killed himself!

342
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,673
Where is he, Willie?
Where is Frank?

343
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,264
Where is Frank?

344
00:32:42,577 --> 00:32:44,636
In the shack! Oh, God!

345
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,544
Stay with him, now, Zip.
Stay with him, Zip!

346
00:32:48,616 --> 00:32:50,140
And get a call in, you hear?

347
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,083
You'll be all right, Willie.

348
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,054
Hey, Big John, why can't you wait?

349
00:32:57,124 --> 00:32:58,716
You just stay here with him.

350
00:34:25,913 --> 00:34:29,007
Take notes, John.
Gotta take notes.

351
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:31,781
Gotta take notes, John.

352
00:34:33,587 --> 00:34:35,282
Take notes, John.

353
00:34:41,128 --> 00:34:42,459
Take notes.

354
00:34:50,604 --> 00:34:51,866
Body...

355
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:58,003
Point number four... yes.

356
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:01,173
See, there are pork chop bones
in the garbage can.

357
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:03,045
Now, if we get
those bones to the lab,

358
00:35:03,117 --> 00:35:05,779
we can determine exactly when
those pork chops were cooked.

359
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:07,377
You got that, Doc?

360
00:35:07,455 --> 00:35:10,686
Except we're not interested
in when the pork chops died.

361
00:35:10,758 --> 00:35:13,727
We're interested in
when Frank here kicked the bucket.

362
00:35:13,794 --> 00:35:15,284
Yeah, right.

363
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:18,855
You see, some of the buckshot
embedded itself in this loaf of bread

364
00:35:18,933 --> 00:35:20,594
and when we cut
the loaf of bread open,

365
00:35:20,668 --> 00:35:23,933
we're gonna make an exact judgment
on the trajectory of the buckshot.

366
00:35:24,004 --> 00:35:26,996
Doc, don't do that.
Hold it! What are you doing?!

367
00:35:27,074 --> 00:35:28,302
What are you doing?

368
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,571
You're touching the gun,
you're touching the body.

369
00:35:30,644 --> 00:35:32,976
Yeah, I'm touching the gun,
and I'm touching the body.

370
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:35,311
'Cause this is the gun
that shot the man.

371
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,407
Right.

372
00:35:36,484 --> 00:35:39,578
This body is the man
that pulled the trigger.

373
00:35:39,653 --> 00:35:40,779
He shot himself.

374
00:35:40,855 --> 00:35:44,951
No, no, no. That's a suicide.
If it's a suicide, we don't have a case.

375
00:35:45,025 --> 00:35:46,959
That's it.
We don't have a case.

376
00:35:47,027 --> 00:35:50,554
That's no good, Doc, because,
you see, I got a whole theory here.

377
00:35:50,631 --> 00:35:52,622
The pork chop... that's nothin'.

378
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,998
My notes here, I can give you a whole--

379
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:57,629
We haven't got anything.

380
00:35:57,705 --> 00:36:00,697
There hasn't been a murder,
the man shot himself,

381
00:36:00,775 --> 00:36:03,107
and we're not interested
in your pork chops,

382
00:36:03,177 --> 00:36:05,145
your loaves of bread,
or your notes.

383
00:36:05,212 --> 00:36:06,941
Get that through your head.

384
00:36:11,952 --> 00:36:14,853
No. No.

385
00:36:16,824 --> 00:36:18,621
It ain't gonna be that way, Doc.

386
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:24,496
Say, I am the officer in charge here.

387
00:36:24,565 --> 00:36:27,557
Now, that is my body,
and that's my gun,

388
00:36:27,635 --> 00:36:30,502
and you keep your hands off
of them, you got it?!

389
00:36:30,571 --> 00:36:32,300
Who do you think you're talking to?

390
00:36:32,373 --> 00:36:33,840
Hey, cool it.
Ryker's here.

391
00:36:33,908 --> 00:36:35,569
Don't be messing around now, Zip.

392
00:36:35,643 --> 00:36:37,736
You know what this guy is doing?
He's trying to steal my case.

393
00:36:37,812 --> 00:36:39,279
He can hear everything
you're saying in here.

394
00:36:39,346 --> 00:36:40,506
I don't give a damn!

395
00:36:40,581 --> 00:36:43,778
You listen to me, hatchet artist.
You're tampering with evidence.

396
00:36:43,851 --> 00:36:46,911
And if you put your finger
on one more thing in this room,

397
00:36:46,987 --> 00:36:48,511
I'm gonna bust your ass.

398
00:36:48,589 --> 00:36:51,080
That's right, the officer in charge
is talking to you,

399
00:36:51,158 --> 00:36:53,422
and he's saying
that you're gonna be arrested

400
00:36:53,494 --> 00:36:56,930
as an accessory after the fact
in a murder case!

401
00:36:56,997 --> 00:37:00,125
Will you listen to me, son?
I've had a lot of patience with you.

402
00:37:00,201 --> 00:37:04,399
You want to be a policeman.
You wanna stay on the force.

403
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:07,498
You just get the hell out of here
and get on that motorcycle

404
00:37:07,575 --> 00:37:09,133
and start tagging automobiles,

405
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:12,668
because if I hear one more peep
out of that goddamn yap of yours,

406
00:37:12,746 --> 00:37:14,907
I'm gonna see that you go to Siberia!

407
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:19,248
- I'm the coroner here!
- Well, I am the officer in charge!

408
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,118
Wintergreen is the name.
John Wintergreen.

409
00:37:22,189 --> 00:37:24,214
Get him out of here.

410
00:37:24,291 --> 00:37:26,555
Knock it off! Come on, man.
Get out of here.

411
00:37:26,627 --> 00:37:29,152
Get on that motorcycle
and get outta here!

412
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:35,025
- What do we got, Doc? Suicide?
- Jesus Christ!

413
00:37:35,102 --> 00:37:37,866
I just got through with him,
I gotta put up with you?!

414
00:37:37,938 --> 00:37:39,235
Get the hell out of here.

415
00:37:39,306 --> 00:37:42,673
You goddamn boys in blue
are driving me up the wall!

416
00:37:56,123 --> 00:38:00,219
Why did you have to shoot yourself
in my jurisdiction?

417
00:38:00,294 --> 00:38:03,320
It don't fit, Zipper.
I tell ya, there's something wrong here.

418
00:38:03,397 --> 00:38:05,297
There's something wrong here,
and that's a fact.

419
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:09,393
There is no man... nobody goes
and takes a shotgun

420
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:11,131
and shoots themself in the chest

421
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:14,038
when there's a chance that
they're gonna bleed to death for hours.

422
00:38:14,108 --> 00:38:16,303
No, sir!
They go right for the head.

423
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,402
Everything above the neck comes off.

424
00:38:18,479 --> 00:38:19,673
That's it.

425
00:38:19,747 --> 00:38:21,510
This was my chance, Zipper.

426
00:38:21,582 --> 00:38:24,483
I could've made it this time,
and I'm ready for it, too.

427
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,110
I tell ya, this is a murder.

428
00:38:26,186 --> 00:38:28,552
I know it, and they're gonna
make it look like a suicide,

429
00:38:28,622 --> 00:38:30,146
and they're gonna
blow my chance for me.

430
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:32,089
I coulda proved it, too, Zipper.

431
00:38:43,137 --> 00:38:44,968
- Officer?
- Yes, sir.

432
00:38:46,507 --> 00:38:49,840
- What's your name?
- Wintergreen, sir.

433
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:54,904
Ryker, you think there's any need
for an investigation?

434
00:38:54,982 --> 00:38:57,007
Well, no, sir, I don't think so.

435
00:38:57,985 --> 00:38:59,247
You don't, huh?

436
00:39:00,187 --> 00:39:01,347
Doc.

437
00:39:07,461 --> 00:39:09,326
- Hi, Doc.
- Harve.

438
00:39:09,396 --> 00:39:11,830
You think there's any need
for an investigation?

439
00:39:11,899 --> 00:39:15,801
Harve, my office is already over-budget
and the council's on my back.

440
00:39:15,869 --> 00:39:19,361
You want me to blow another thousand
for an autopsy on some old bastard

441
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,032
Nobody gives a damn about?

442
00:39:22,309 --> 00:39:26,040
Well, psychologically,
I'd like to know why the old guy

443
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:29,446
shot himself in the chest
instead of the head. Wouldn't you?

444
00:39:32,052 --> 00:39:34,782
All right. I'll cut him up for you.

445
00:39:36,023 --> 00:39:38,253
Glad you feel that way about it, Doc.

446
00:39:51,905 --> 00:39:54,738
Incompetence is
the worst form of corruption.

447
00:39:54,808 --> 00:39:57,641
Glad there's somebody around here
who understands that.

448
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:15,223
The pericardial sac is not filled
with a great deal of blood.

449
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:20,328
That's really surprising.
You'd think he probably bled a lot.

450
00:40:21,535 --> 00:40:22,968
Well, it's hard to say.

451
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:28,908
I can aspirate about two
or three hundred cc's

452
00:40:28,976 --> 00:40:30,841
from the left plural cavity.

453
00:40:32,246 --> 00:40:34,680
About 150 from the right.

454
00:40:37,384 --> 00:40:38,715
Okay.

455
00:40:40,487 --> 00:40:44,753
I'm going to do
the standard evisceration here.

456
00:40:48,162 --> 00:40:49,527
All right.

457
00:40:50,297 --> 00:40:56,463
The posterior aspect of the chest
is riddled with shotgun pellets.

458
00:40:57,438 --> 00:41:01,033
Hello. What have we here?

459
00:41:02,142 --> 00:41:04,576
There's a larger object.

460
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:15,355
Irregular lump of metal
about five, six millimeters in diameter.

461
00:41:15,422 --> 00:41:18,653
Come off it, Doc.
It's a.22 slug.

462
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,159
Yeah.

463
00:41:25,299 --> 00:41:28,894
That's where it went in.
There's virtually no external trace.

464
00:41:28,969 --> 00:41:31,096
This guy was shot
in the back of the head.

465
00:41:32,005 --> 00:41:35,168
It looks like he was dead
before he decided to commit suicide.

466
00:41:39,613 --> 00:41:41,672
You sure have a nose for it, Harve.

467
00:41:42,349 --> 00:41:45,785
We might've put this guy in a box
and buried him and nobody'd ever know.

468
00:41:45,853 --> 00:41:47,844
Have to hand it to you, Harve.

469
00:41:48,655 --> 00:41:50,623
- Wintergreen.
- Yes, sir.

470
00:41:55,696 --> 00:41:57,425
I need a new driver.

471
00:41:59,733 --> 00:42:01,928
We got a murder on our hands.

472
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,502
Yes, sir.

473
00:45:00,547 --> 00:45:03,209
Excuse me,
do you know Harve Poole?

474
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:04,614
Sure.

475
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,181
Well, you see, I'm his new driver.

476
00:45:09,256 --> 00:45:10,917
Harve's in the can.

477
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:16,152
Well, could you tell him
his car's waiting outside for him?

478
00:45:16,229 --> 00:45:18,390
Come on over here, friend.
Sit down here.

479
00:45:19,333 --> 00:45:20,891
Come on, come on, come on.

480
00:45:22,035 --> 00:45:23,798
So, I get this call, see,

481
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:26,395
it says I got trouble
with a coon on my roof.

482
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:29,965
Hey, Big John. You playin'
with the big boys today?

483
00:45:30,043 --> 00:45:31,670
You look so good.

484
00:45:31,745 --> 00:45:33,736
You finally graduated, huh?

485
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:36,681
Well, I'll be over tonight
and give you your diploma.

486
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:38,741
- I'll be there.
- You better be.

487
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,980
- Are you still split up?
- She's after me.

488
00:45:41,054 --> 00:45:42,282
Is she?

489
00:45:42,356 --> 00:45:43,550
Gin.

490
00:45:43,623 --> 00:45:44,954
Deal me out.

491
00:45:46,093 --> 00:45:48,220
Any of you juicers play gin?

492
00:45:49,262 --> 00:45:52,459
Hey, kid. Wanna play in this game?
A quarter a hand.

493
00:45:52,532 --> 00:45:54,591
No. No, thanks.
I don't play cards.

494
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:56,158
I always lose.

495
00:45:56,236 --> 00:45:58,704
This here's
a winner's circle, Wintergreen.

496
00:45:58,772 --> 00:46:00,706
Your beer's on the table, Harve.

497
00:46:00,774 --> 00:46:05,108
Only losers I deal in
are in the jail or in the morgue.

498
00:46:05,178 --> 00:46:07,043
They all don't belong there.

499
00:46:10,784 --> 00:46:12,149
Well, well, well.

500
00:46:12,219 --> 00:46:13,914
John Wintergreen.

501
00:46:16,189 --> 00:46:19,124
Al here, he's our griper.

502
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:25,830
He complains about the brass.

503
00:46:25,899 --> 00:46:28,197
He complains about the system.

504
00:46:28,802 --> 00:46:29,894
And you know what?

505
00:46:30,404 --> 00:46:33,840
He'll probably end up being the first cop
we carry out in a box.

506
00:46:33,907 --> 00:46:36,068
Everybody doesn't hate you
for helping them.

507
00:46:36,143 --> 00:46:39,635
Nine cops gunned down in two years?
You call that casual statistics?

508
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:41,772
A goddamned open season.

509
00:46:43,316 --> 00:46:46,808
The conspiracy's reaching out
national proportions.

510
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:50,914
This country is undergoing
a precisely formulated conspiracy

511
00:46:50,991 --> 00:46:52,925
of police genocide.

512
00:46:52,993 --> 00:46:55,928
A carefully organized plan
of civilian brutality,

513
00:46:55,996 --> 00:46:57,896
and it's just around the corner.

514
00:46:59,032 --> 00:47:01,523
And the sooner we get
to dealing with it,

515
00:47:01,601 --> 00:47:04,331
the sooner I get
to save your precious ass

516
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:07,669
from some nigger waiting
in the bushes ready to nail ya.

517
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:10,403
You want to be
a detective, Wintergreen?

518
00:47:10,477 --> 00:47:12,672
What you need is a hook, my man.

519
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:16,079
And right now, I am your hook.

520
00:47:21,888 --> 00:47:23,549
Let's eat, gentlemen.

521
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:33,229
Come and around me stand

522
00:47:39,372 --> 00:47:41,670
All right, wait a second.

523
00:47:41,741 --> 00:47:43,072
Hi, Willie.

524
00:47:44,644 --> 00:47:45,906
Remember me?

525
00:47:45,979 --> 00:47:47,970
John Wintergreen.
Remember?

526
00:47:48,682 --> 00:47:50,343
This is Harve Poole.

527
00:47:50,417 --> 00:47:52,749
He's gonna help.
He's a detective.

528
00:47:52,819 --> 00:47:53,979
See there?

529
00:47:55,021 --> 00:47:57,854
Don't touch.
Don't touch the badge.

530
00:47:58,425 --> 00:48:00,825
Willie, can you tell Harve

531
00:48:00,894 --> 00:48:04,261
about when you came down
off of the Superstition Mountain?

532
00:48:04,331 --> 00:48:06,856
And you went to the shack, remember?

533
00:48:07,701 --> 00:48:09,225
Superstition.

534
00:48:09,302 --> 00:48:12,794
Just that day,
I come off the Superstition.

535
00:48:12,873 --> 00:48:16,206
And just that day,
I opened the door to the shack.

536
00:48:16,276 --> 00:48:19,245
And that's when I saw him.

537
00:48:19,312 --> 00:48:21,303
Who's got the Batman?
Who's got the Batman?

538
00:48:21,381 --> 00:48:25,010
Who got the Batman, huh?
Who got the Batman?

539
00:48:25,085 --> 00:48:26,677
How long were you up there, Willie?

540
00:48:29,623 --> 00:48:31,784
How long were you up
on the mountain?

541
00:48:34,427 --> 00:48:36,486
Two, three months, maybe.

542
00:48:36,563 --> 00:48:38,258
Can you prove
you were up there that long?

543
00:48:42,469 --> 00:48:44,061
I don't carry no time clock.

544
00:48:44,137 --> 00:48:46,401
What in the hell he think
I go up there for?

545
00:48:46,473 --> 00:48:48,703
All right, you came down
from the mountain,

546
00:48:48,775 --> 00:48:50,402
you went to Frank's.

547
00:48:50,477 --> 00:48:52,342
Is that your story, Willie?

548
00:48:54,281 --> 00:48:56,681
I only got two friends in the world.

549
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:59,844
Frank and Superstition.

550
00:49:01,888 --> 00:49:04,049
You fellas lock the door to the cabin?

551
00:49:04,124 --> 00:49:05,716
Sure, Willie. Promise.

552
00:49:05,792 --> 00:49:06,986
Thanks.

553
00:49:08,828 --> 00:49:12,764
There have been
a lot of strange, funny people

554
00:49:12,832 --> 00:49:14,800
hanging around there
the last year.

555
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:16,529
What do you mean funny people?

556
00:49:17,771 --> 00:49:20,706
L... I guess I don't mean people.

557
00:49:20,774 --> 00:49:22,765
What, Willie?
What do you mean?

558
00:49:25,345 --> 00:49:27,905
- Kids.
- Kids?

559
00:49:29,015 --> 00:49:32,178
Did you... why?

560
00:49:32,252 --> 00:49:34,914
Why did Frank kill himself?

561
00:49:34,988 --> 00:49:36,785
He didn't kill himself, Willie.

562
00:49:36,856 --> 00:49:38,483
We're talking about murder.

563
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:41,118
See, somebody killed Frank, Willie.

564
00:49:41,194 --> 00:49:44,254
He didn't kill himself.
Somebody killed him.

565
00:49:44,331 --> 00:49:45,559
Somebody killed him.

566
00:49:48,134 --> 00:49:49,624
5,000.

567
00:49:49,703 --> 00:49:52,570
5,000. What 5,000, Willie?

568
00:49:53,807 --> 00:49:56,605
Frank had 5,000 stashed in that shack.

569
00:49:56,676 --> 00:49:58,337
Where, Willie?
Where?

570
00:49:58,411 --> 00:50:00,106
I don't know.

571
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:05,208
You find the 5,000,
and you find out why.

572
00:50:05,285 --> 00:50:06,616
What does that mean?

573
00:50:10,824 --> 00:50:12,621
What does that mean?

574
00:50:14,494 --> 00:50:17,156
Greed, you asshole!
Greed!

575
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:18,390
Here's the Batman.

576
00:50:18,465 --> 00:50:20,695
Let it go, let it go!
You give it back!

577
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:23,668
Give it back!
Let my friend alone.

578
00:50:23,737 --> 00:50:25,500
Let my friend alone!

579
00:50:43,823 --> 00:50:48,089
- You hear anything, Wintergreen?
- Sir? No.

580
00:50:49,529 --> 00:50:51,520
The night is talking to us, Wintergreen.

581
00:50:52,732 --> 00:50:54,393
Sit down and listen.

582
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:56,466
Okay.

583
00:51:00,507 --> 00:51:03,738
When the night talks to you,
you gotta listen, Wintergreen.

584
00:51:06,413 --> 00:51:07,710
Look at that moon.

585
00:51:09,549 --> 00:51:11,210
Listen to that desert.

586
00:51:12,519 --> 00:51:14,987
That desert's gonna help me
solve a murder.

587
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:18,154
Does that sound strange
to you, Wintergreen?

588
00:51:20,026 --> 00:51:24,224
Well, there's college as education,
there's learning, there's knowledge,

589
00:51:24,297 --> 00:51:27,858
and then... there's wisdom.

590
00:51:28,501 --> 00:51:32,096
And that's what
old Harve has got... wisdom.

591
00:51:36,376 --> 00:51:39,709
Wisdom is like religion.

592
00:51:41,281 --> 00:51:43,010
What's your religion, Wintergreen?

593
00:51:44,918 --> 00:51:49,218
Well, I don't go too much
with that Jesus and things like that,

594
00:51:49,289 --> 00:51:53,953
but I do... I do kind of believe
a little bit in reincarnation.

595
00:51:55,628 --> 00:51:58,529
My religion is myself.

596
00:52:00,233 --> 00:52:05,193
When I talk to myself, I'm talking
to the whole world, Wintergreen.

597
00:52:05,271 --> 00:52:08,604
And right now the whole world
is answering me.

598
00:52:08,675 --> 00:52:11,007
Right inside that house
are the answers to a murder,

599
00:52:11,077 --> 00:52:13,272
but you know where
I'm gonna find my answers?

600
00:52:13,346 --> 00:52:16,543
Right inside here, Wintergreen.
Inside here.

601
00:52:16,616 --> 00:52:18,811
A man's gotta listen to his inner voice.

602
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:22,446
It's a God-given gift.
And don't you forget it.

603
00:52:27,427 --> 00:52:30,089
Well, let's go on inside
and see what's going on.

604
00:52:30,797 --> 00:52:35,325
Wintergreen, I wanna make you
the best damn detective in Arizona.

605
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:08,499
We looking for the 5,000, Harve?

606
00:53:09,803 --> 00:53:10,861
No.

607
00:53:12,705 --> 00:53:16,038
If we were looking for a million,
it wouldn't solve the murder, would it?

608
00:53:18,244 --> 00:53:19,302
No.

609
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:26,318
We're... we're not looking
for the 5,000, Wintergreen.

610
00:53:43,436 --> 00:53:45,370
What are we looking for, Harve?

611
00:53:47,106 --> 00:53:54,444
Well, we're looking for something
that... that don't belong.

612
00:53:57,917 --> 00:54:00,408
Jesus is talking to me, Wintergreen.

613
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:05,318
I think I hear Jesus talking to me.

614
00:54:11,965 --> 00:54:18,268
Now... what do you suppose
a 70-year-old man would be doing

615
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:20,272
with a lot of reds?

616
00:54:22,442 --> 00:54:24,137
Eatin' 'em or...

617
00:54:25,144 --> 00:54:26,441
Sellin' 'em.

618
00:54:30,483 --> 00:54:32,144
I gotta hand it to ya, Harve.

619
00:54:32,218 --> 00:54:34,618
You sure knew
you were looking for something.

620
00:54:36,656 --> 00:54:39,648
Yeah, Wintergreen,
and I'm looking for something now.

621
00:54:39,726 --> 00:54:42,126
Robert W. Zemko.

622
00:54:43,096 --> 00:54:45,394
You figure Zemko's the one, huh?

623
00:54:47,467 --> 00:54:51,096
Well, Wintergreen,
when you find a load of dope

624
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:53,638
and fingerprints of a convicted dealer,

625
00:54:53,706 --> 00:54:58,370
it don't take a brain like Harve Poole
to know you got a prime suspect.

626
00:54:58,444 --> 00:54:59,843
Right, Harve.

627
00:55:05,118 --> 00:55:07,780
I never would've figured
old Frank to be a dealer.

628
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:09,685
You wouldn't, huh?

629
00:55:12,091 --> 00:55:14,025
You just watch me, Harve.

630
00:55:14,093 --> 00:55:16,823
If Zemko's around here,
I'm gonna find him.

631
00:55:17,864 --> 00:55:19,126
You will, huh?

632
00:55:22,602 --> 00:55:25,662
Well, go to it, Wintergreen.

633
00:55:25,738 --> 00:55:27,137
Okay, Harve.

634
00:56:34,374 --> 00:56:36,706
- Good morning.
- Morning.

635
00:56:36,776 --> 00:56:41,736
I'm Officer John Wintergreen,
and I don't mean to harass you any,

636
00:56:41,814 --> 00:56:44,749
but I'd like to get some information.

637
00:56:46,552 --> 00:56:48,952
- I got some information.
- Good.

638
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:52,419
You're standing in pig shit.

639
00:56:58,064 --> 00:57:01,090
- That's all you wanna know?
- Yes. Thank you very much.

640
00:57:02,869 --> 00:57:05,394
- Don't you wanna meet my pigs?
- No, no. No, thank you.

641
00:57:32,265 --> 00:57:33,391
See you later.

642
00:57:42,308 --> 00:57:44,469
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

643
00:57:45,278 --> 00:57:48,076
- Do you know Bob Zemko?
- No, I don't.

644
00:57:50,283 --> 00:57:51,477
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

645
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:54,213
Are you on a Bob Zemko hunt?

646
00:57:54,287 --> 00:57:56,380
Yeah, I guess... I guess I am.

647
00:57:56,456 --> 00:57:58,253
Come on.
We'll help you find him.

648
00:57:59,425 --> 00:58:00,687
Thank you very much.

649
00:58:03,296 --> 00:58:04,991
This is very nice of you people.

650
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:07,032
Hey, people!
Gather around.

651
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:10,263
The little chief would like to say
a few words to us.

652
00:58:11,637 --> 00:58:12,865
Thank you.

653
00:58:20,713 --> 00:58:23,876
My name is John Wintergreen,
Officer John Wintergreen,

654
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:29,817
and we're looking for a fellow
named Bob Zemko.

655
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:32,121
Anybody know him?

656
00:58:32,191 --> 00:58:34,887
Bob Zemko?
Anybody know him?

657
00:58:34,961 --> 00:58:36,019
Thank you.

658
00:58:40,133 --> 00:58:42,533
Okay. Bob Zemko.

659
00:58:43,703 --> 00:58:44,965
No...

660
00:58:46,939 --> 00:58:49,874
Well, all right.

661
00:58:55,081 --> 00:58:56,480
Thank you very much.

662
00:58:57,183 --> 00:59:01,210
Now, in the interest of police
community relations,

663
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:04,154
if any of you know him
or hear from him,

664
00:59:04,223 --> 00:59:06,783
I would like for you
to get in touch with me.

665
00:59:06,859 --> 00:59:08,349
For sure.

666
00:59:08,427 --> 00:59:11,362
You've been very cooperative.
Thank you.

667
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:14,024
- Bye-bye, little chief.
- Bye.

668
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:16,830
- See you later, man.
- Good-bye, now.

669
00:59:16,903 --> 00:59:19,167
- Thank you very much.
- Watch your step, officer.

670
00:59:19,238 --> 00:59:21,672
Okay. Harve.

671
00:59:21,741 --> 00:59:24,437
I checked the whole place out
and Zemko isn't there,

672
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:25,772
and they don't know him.

673
00:59:25,845 --> 00:59:27,437
So we can go if you want to.

674
00:59:32,051 --> 00:59:35,384
Looks like you stepped in
a little community relations.

675
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:53,571
In the interest of community relations,
as my partner suggests...

676
00:59:55,408 --> 00:59:58,070
I don't wanna shoot anybody today.

677
01:00:03,883 --> 01:00:09,549
Now, the little fella tells me
you don't know where Bob Zemko is.

678
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:12,519
He's broken the law.

679
01:00:13,926 --> 01:00:15,860
We're making an effort to find him.

680
01:00:17,897 --> 01:00:19,956
We only wanna do our job

681
01:00:20,032 --> 01:00:23,195
and keep our friendly relations
with the community.

682
01:00:24,103 --> 01:00:29,439
Now, once more, has anyone seen him
or know anything about him?

683
01:00:33,279 --> 01:00:34,769
What'd you say, son?

684
01:00:40,119 --> 01:00:42,280
Have we improved
communications yet?

685
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:45,213
Are you listening to me?

686
01:00:47,026 --> 01:00:48,994
I don't think he's listening to me.

687
01:01:02,808 --> 01:01:05,140
You know, officer,
we're not hassling you.

688
01:01:06,445 --> 01:01:09,608
We don't know anything
about Bob Zemko or where he is.

689
01:01:09,682 --> 01:01:10,740
Really.

690
01:01:10,816 --> 01:01:12,443
Do you understand?

691
01:01:13,219 --> 01:01:15,551
Yeah, I guess I was out of line, huh?

692
01:01:15,621 --> 01:01:17,282
I want you all to excuse me.

693
01:01:17,356 --> 01:01:18,550
Yes, sir.

694
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,669
I'm getting impatient!

695
01:01:35,741 --> 01:01:37,072
Somebody talk to me.

696
01:01:38,744 --> 01:01:40,336
I know Bob Zemko.

697
01:01:46,519 --> 01:01:47,611
Come on.

698
01:03:00,826 --> 01:03:04,922
I got a Coke and Fresca and a Tab.
I didn't know which one you'd like.

699
01:03:04,997 --> 01:03:06,294
- Wintergreen.
- Yes, sir.

700
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:07,662
Come here a minute, please.

701
01:03:10,803 --> 01:03:13,101
Harve, did you find out
anything about Zemko?

702
01:03:13,172 --> 01:03:16,232
Yeah, she told me the last time
she saw him, he was heading north.

703
01:03:16,308 --> 01:03:17,866
We got an APB out on him.

704
01:03:17,943 --> 01:03:21,276
Her old man's coming over
from Crown Drive... be here any minute.

705
01:03:21,347 --> 01:03:23,611
Make sure she gets in the car.

706
01:03:23,682 --> 01:03:25,582
- Yes, sir.
- Wintergreen.

707
01:03:25,651 --> 01:03:27,380
Let me tell you something...

708
01:03:27,453 --> 01:03:30,513
a little something
about police work and women.

709
01:03:30,589 --> 01:03:34,685
If you mix the two,
you can't do justice to either one.

710
01:03:35,628 --> 01:03:38,222
- You get my point?
- Yes, sir.

711
01:03:42,301 --> 01:03:46,863
I like to find myself here about
this time every evening, Wintergreen.

712
01:03:47,873 --> 01:03:50,865
There's a fine young lady
I'd like to introduce you to.

713
01:03:50,943 --> 01:03:52,535
Fine young lady.

714
01:03:53,245 --> 01:03:55,679
Brought a lot of happiness
into my life.

715
01:04:22,608 --> 01:04:26,408
Well, well, well!
My two knights in shining armor.

716
01:04:26,479 --> 01:04:29,971
Mr. Tall and Mr. Small.

717
01:04:30,049 --> 01:04:32,210
I'm sorry, but the place is closed.

718
01:04:33,219 --> 01:04:37,519
That don't matter,
because you're both very special.

719
01:04:38,257 --> 01:04:40,487
Come on in, gentlemen.

720
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:41,890
You ready to leave?

721
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:44,657
Harve, you're always on duty.
Run, run, run, run.

722
01:04:44,730 --> 01:04:46,493
You can't relax.

723
01:04:47,266 --> 01:04:49,826
But you know how to relax,
don't you, Johnny?

724
01:04:53,038 --> 01:04:55,871
Drinks for the gangbusters!

725
01:04:55,941 --> 01:04:58,102
Zap, zap! You're dead!

726
01:04:58,744 --> 01:05:02,805
And I'm offering you my hospitality,
and it ain't nice to say no.

727
01:05:03,682 --> 01:05:07,118
So close the door, Harve.
I ain't gonna bite ya.

728
01:05:13,626 --> 01:05:18,256
One drink, Jolene.
Then I'm gonna take you home.

729
01:05:18,330 --> 01:05:20,059
Well, I wanna hear music, Harve.

730
01:05:20,132 --> 01:05:22,532
Don't you wanna hear music?

731
01:05:23,569 --> 01:05:25,400
You like music, don't you, Johnny?

732
01:05:25,471 --> 01:05:27,803
I know you like music.

733
01:05:31,110 --> 01:05:32,270
Let's see, now.

734
01:05:32,344 --> 01:05:35,905
You got your hat, and you got
your badge, and you got your boots.

735
01:05:35,981 --> 01:05:38,677
You got it all, don't you, Johnny?
You got everything.

736
01:05:39,285 --> 01:05:42,743
You got it all, don't ya?
You're happy, aren't you, Johnny?

737
01:05:43,355 --> 01:05:45,823
Well, I know just the tune that'll fit ya.

738
01:05:53,632 --> 01:05:55,156
You like to dance, Johnny?

739
01:05:57,336 --> 01:05:59,702
Harve doesn't like to dance.
Do you, Harve?

740
01:05:59,772 --> 01:06:02,036
You don't like anything, do you?

741
01:06:02,107 --> 01:06:03,802
But I like to dance.

742
01:06:04,610 --> 01:06:07,272
Do you know I used to
be a dancer, Harve, huh?

743
01:06:07,346 --> 01:06:09,974
Do you know I used to be a dancer?

744
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:14,042
I used to be a Rockette
for a year in New York.

745
01:06:14,119 --> 01:06:17,111
I really ground them out.
Yeah.

746
01:06:17,189 --> 01:06:19,054
Oh, yeah.

747
01:06:19,124 --> 01:06:24,255
Did you know that I had
my very own dance team?

748
01:06:24,330 --> 01:06:25,592
I sure did.

749
01:06:26,565 --> 01:06:28,499
By God, I sure did.

750
01:06:30,169 --> 01:06:32,160
Right there I am.

751
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:34,297
My very own dance team

752
01:06:36,008 --> 01:06:37,168
Yeah.

753
01:06:39,878 --> 01:06:42,244
There I am
just before I left for Hollywood.

754
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:46,142
Miss Peaches and Cream,
Miss Nice, Miss Naive.

755
01:06:47,786 --> 01:06:49,048
Hollywood.

756
01:06:50,522 --> 01:06:53,457
Just saying that word
means magic time to me.

757
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,819
I can remember when I was a little girl.

758
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:58,863
I used to sit in a movie all by myself.

759
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:01,589
I used to watch those movie stars,

760
01:07:01,667 --> 01:07:04,500
and they just looked
like they was having the best time.

761
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:08,206
I couldn't imagine it,
being a movie star.

762
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:12,335
I just wanted to jump up out of my seat,
step into that picture,

763
01:07:12,411 --> 01:07:14,106
just touch 'em and be with them

764
01:07:14,179 --> 01:07:16,647
like they were surrounded
by a big rainbow.

765
01:07:16,715 --> 01:07:18,615
Like nothing could get to 'em.

766
01:07:19,652 --> 01:07:23,486
I just wanted my life
to be one long, beautiful movie.

767
01:07:25,891 --> 01:07:28,086
But I never got to Hollywood.

768
01:07:29,261 --> 01:07:30,353
No, I never did.

769
01:07:30,429 --> 01:07:31,828
I never did.

770
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:35,297
And then I met my salesman.

771
01:07:37,102 --> 01:07:40,162
Oh, God, how I loved my salesman.

772
01:07:41,573 --> 01:07:43,473
His name was Jim.

773
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:46,241
We got married.

774
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:49,614
He wanted kids.

775
01:07:51,617 --> 01:07:54,609
I didn't want any,
I wanted my career.

776
01:07:56,555 --> 01:07:58,284
And I lost him.

777
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:03,350
I lost everything.

778
01:08:09,835 --> 01:08:11,826
And I ended up here.

779
01:08:13,772 --> 01:08:20,268
And that's... that's when I had
my first wild affair with a policeman.

780
01:08:22,448 --> 01:08:25,906
John Wintergreen, you were not
my first policeman.

781
01:08:25,984 --> 01:08:28,919
No way. No way.

782
01:08:32,124 --> 01:08:34,649
You weren't supposed to
hear that, Harve.

783
01:08:36,562 --> 01:08:40,054
You just make believe
that you didn't even hear that, okay?

784
01:08:40,232 --> 01:08:45,693
Because I'm still your sweet,
little innocent Jolene.

785
01:08:45,771 --> 01:08:49,935
Why, you know
that I'm still the girl next door.

786
01:08:50,008 --> 01:08:51,703
And you know what, Harve?

787
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:55,142
There ain't a cop in town
who'll tell you any different.

788
01:08:56,115 --> 01:08:58,777
Right, Johnny?
Tell him.

789
01:08:58,851 --> 01:09:01,251
Tell him all about it.

790
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:03,345
Come on, Johnny.
Come on.

791
01:09:03,422 --> 01:09:05,583
Let the good times roll.

792
01:09:05,657 --> 01:09:07,887
Don't worry about old Harve.

793
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:12,227
Maybe we can
teach him something, huh?

794
01:09:12,297 --> 01:09:14,356
Maybe we can
teach old Harve something.

795
01:09:14,433 --> 01:09:17,027
Come on, Johnny.
Come on, baby.

796
01:09:17,102 --> 01:09:18,569
Show him how you do it!

797
01:09:18,637 --> 01:09:20,468
Show him what you do to me!

798
01:09:20,539 --> 01:09:22,268
Come on, Johnny.

799
01:09:22,341 --> 01:09:24,036
Show him how you do it.

800
01:09:44,329 --> 01:09:46,092
It's all right, Harve.

801
01:09:47,132 --> 01:09:48,690
Come on, Harve.

802
01:09:49,635 --> 01:09:52,160
Come on, baby.
It's gonna be okay.

803
01:09:52,237 --> 01:09:53,431
Come on.

804
01:09:54,306 --> 01:09:56,001
Everything's gonna be all right.

805
01:09:56,074 --> 01:09:57,939
I still like ya, Harve.

806
01:09:58,010 --> 01:09:59,739
I'll always like ya.

807
01:10:00,712 --> 01:10:04,512
Big John... I love Big John.

808
01:10:04,583 --> 01:10:07,108
'Cause he makes me feel so good.

809
01:10:07,986 --> 01:10:10,477
But you're king
of the mountain, Harve!

810
01:10:10,556 --> 01:10:12,990
You'll always be king
of the mountain, Harve.

811
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:15,317
Sure you will.

812
01:10:20,098 --> 01:10:24,467
It's just that Johnny can do it
three times in the morning, Harve.

813
01:10:25,137 --> 01:10:28,334
And you can't do it at all.

814
01:11:20,592 --> 01:11:21,923
Wintergreen.

815
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:29,763
Jolene's a colorful girl.
She's... she's Ionely.

816
01:11:29,835 --> 01:11:32,133
Sometimes she drinks a little too much.

817
01:11:33,372 --> 01:11:35,806
Likes to play her little games...

818
01:11:35,874 --> 01:11:37,535
make her daddy angry.

819
01:11:38,644 --> 01:11:41,238
But I want you to know...
and I know that you do...

820
01:11:42,681 --> 01:11:49,177
...that not one word of what
she said back there is the truth.

821
01:11:50,322 --> 01:11:58,195
Jolene and I have had
a long, wonderful relationship.

822
01:11:58,964 --> 01:12:03,264
And it should not have been
interfered with by you.

823
01:12:03,335 --> 01:12:08,967
What I'm trying to say is...
is Jolene is...

824
01:12:09,041 --> 01:12:13,137
is my woman, and you shoulda
kept your hands off her!

825
01:12:14,246 --> 01:12:19,513
There was no reason
for you two to... to... to...

826
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:21,780
Because she's contented!

827
01:12:21,853 --> 01:12:24,185
You know what that means,
Wintergreen?

828
01:12:24,256 --> 01:12:25,917
It's contented!

829
01:12:25,991 --> 01:12:27,219
Jolene's...

830
01:12:30,062 --> 01:12:31,393
You...

831
01:12:33,265 --> 01:12:35,062
Goddamn you!

832
01:12:36,568 --> 01:12:38,433
You ever touch her again, I'Il...

833
01:12:39,938 --> 01:12:42,099
Don't... don't you tell anybody.

834
01:12:42,774 --> 01:12:44,264
You hear me, Wintergreen?

835
01:12:44,977 --> 01:12:47,002
Don't you tell anybody!

836
01:12:47,079 --> 01:12:49,343
You tell anybody, I'll kill you!

837
01:13:00,025 --> 01:13:02,755
Hey, Big John,
what you want to read?

838
01:13:03,595 --> 01:13:06,393
I got Buck Rogers, Plastic Man.

839
01:13:06,465 --> 01:13:08,262
Hey, I even got ol' Pogo.

840
01:13:09,134 --> 01:13:12,365
Nah. No Pogo today.

841
01:13:13,905 --> 01:13:17,739
John, you gotta get
a better attitude towards things.

842
01:13:18,443 --> 01:13:21,503
Look at us.
Look what a sweet life we got.

843
01:13:22,547 --> 01:13:24,037
Yeah, look at us.

844
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:28,976
What am I looking at?

845
01:13:29,821 --> 01:13:31,049
See up there?

846
01:13:36,628 --> 01:13:38,220
Bikes, it looks like.

847
01:13:45,570 --> 01:13:47,800
Gee, Ge-monettie!

848
01:13:49,541 --> 01:13:52,772
Wonder Woman.
You ever read that?

849
01:13:54,946 --> 01:13:57,608
I hate that motorcycle
they make me ride.

850
01:13:58,617 --> 01:14:01,552
I'm here to tell ya there ain't
nothing in the world I hate worse

851
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:03,918
than that elephant under my ass.

852
01:14:03,989 --> 01:14:07,481
Boy. Look at this
meat and potatoes, John.

853
01:14:08,794 --> 01:14:11,524
Man. That Wonder Woman
is really built.

854
01:14:13,231 --> 01:14:15,131
Them kiddies are coming this way.

855
01:14:18,003 --> 01:14:19,971
You want some sunflower fritees?

856
01:14:20,939 --> 01:14:22,998
Zipper, you got a blast furnace for a gut.

857
01:14:23,075 --> 01:14:25,600
You could live off
beer cans and horseshoes.

858
01:14:26,078 --> 01:14:27,739
It's my attitude.

859
01:14:27,813 --> 01:14:29,610
You got an attitude.

860
01:14:29,681 --> 01:14:32,775
Look here. Ain't she about
the prettiest thing you ever saw?

861
01:14:39,658 --> 01:14:42,559
Hey, Zipper!
Let's take a little ride.

862
01:14:42,627 --> 01:14:45,960
- I ain't leavin' the shade.
- They got some ladies with 'em.

863
01:16:08,613 --> 01:16:11,411
- Wanna go get 'em?
- Let's do it.

864
01:16:27,599 --> 01:16:31,330
Zipper! That's Zemko!
That's the guy I'm looking for!

865
01:16:34,206 --> 01:16:36,231
Hey, it's the cops.
Let's go!

866
01:16:37,509 --> 01:16:39,340
Let's go get him, Zipper!

867
01:16:40,445 --> 01:16:42,436
Cops, cops!
Move out!

868
01:17:32,697 --> 01:17:34,062
Shit!

869
01:17:47,779 --> 01:17:49,610
Hey! Wait a minute!

870
01:18:32,991 --> 01:18:35,585
No! Goddamn you, Zipper!

871
01:18:36,561 --> 01:18:38,461
Damn your ass!

872
01:19:17,369 --> 01:19:18,859
You little shit!

873
01:19:54,873 --> 01:19:58,138
Where would a freak like you
get $3,700, Zemko?

874
01:19:59,778 --> 01:20:02,975
Busting gumball machines?
Cashing the pennies in?

875
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:06,908
Or did you find the money in the shack?

876
01:20:28,673 --> 01:20:32,268
We found three sets
of your prints in that shack,

877
01:20:32,343 --> 01:20:34,811
which makes me think
that you're not too bright.

878
01:20:34,879 --> 01:20:37,404
But I suppose you're gonna tell me
you dropped in for a cup of tea,

879
01:20:37,482 --> 01:20:38,540
is that right?

880
01:20:38,616 --> 01:20:40,607
- No, sir.
- You bet it isn't!

881
01:20:40,685 --> 01:20:43,779
Because we found
a half a bushel of dope in that shack.

882
01:20:57,836 --> 01:20:58,996
We...

883
01:21:01,306 --> 01:21:03,968
We also know you were
busted for dope in Vietnam,

884
01:21:04,042 --> 01:21:08,809
and you got a track record here
as long as the Gettysburg Address.

885
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:11,872
Now, what does that add up to?
Well, I'll tell ya, son.

886
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:15,181
We ain't talking about dope.
We're talking about murder!

887
01:21:15,253 --> 01:21:18,245
Cold-blooded, premeditated,
first degree murder!

888
01:21:20,358 --> 01:21:22,326
What do you want me to tell you, sir?

889
01:21:22,393 --> 01:21:24,156
You better think of something, son!

890
01:21:24,229 --> 01:21:25,821
Because I'm moved to work you over.

891
01:21:25,897 --> 01:21:28,161
I'm moved to bust your kidneys!

892
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,628
And I won't leave a trace.
Not a mark on you!

893
01:21:31,703 --> 01:21:33,603
You hear what I'm saying to you?!

894
01:21:33,671 --> 01:21:37,129
I'll work you over till you wished
you died last year, you hear me?!

895
01:21:45,884 --> 01:21:47,476
Get outta here, Wintergreen!

896
01:23:17,242 --> 01:23:18,436
Hey, now, get back.

897
01:23:18,576 --> 01:23:21,044
Get off the stage.
Come on, back up.

898
01:24:05,156 --> 01:24:09,115
Yeah, well, the truth of the matter is,
John Wintergreen,

899
01:24:09,193 --> 01:24:13,061
you don't your ass
from a row of rat shit in a wind storm.

900
01:24:13,131 --> 01:24:14,462
Hi, there.

901
01:24:15,833 --> 01:24:19,166
I'm talking to myself.
But I ain't listening.

902
01:24:19,237 --> 01:24:21,535
You're supposed to listen
to your inner voices.

903
01:24:21,606 --> 01:24:23,471
They tell you what to do.

904
01:24:25,610 --> 01:24:29,444
Ain't that funny how people
do all kind of things,

905
01:24:29,514 --> 01:24:32,108
and most of it's just a lot of bullshit?

906
01:24:34,185 --> 01:24:35,379
You know what?

907
01:24:36,220 --> 01:24:38,688
Ninety percent of the things
I've done in my life

908
01:24:38,756 --> 01:24:41,316
ain't as important
as you sweeping that floor...

909
01:24:42,093 --> 01:24:44,960
...or sitting there eating your sandwich.
You know why?

910
01:24:45,797 --> 01:24:48,129
'Cause you listen to yourself.

911
01:24:49,167 --> 01:24:53,035
Me, I listen to everybody
in the whole damn world except me.

912
01:24:54,939 --> 01:24:57,203
I'd like to start all over again.

913
01:24:58,176 --> 01:25:00,440
Ain't that the damnedest thing?

914
01:25:00,511 --> 01:25:03,309
My old man used to listen to himself.

915
01:25:03,381 --> 01:25:06,976
And when he died,
they told me it was a thrombosis.

916
01:25:08,953 --> 01:25:11,114
But I know it was suicide.

917
01:25:13,725 --> 01:25:15,056
Loneliness.

918
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:21,763
Do you know that Ioneliness'll kill you
deader than a.357 Magnum?

919
01:25:22,633 --> 01:25:23,964
Did you know that?

920
01:25:26,337 --> 01:25:29,932
Old Frank is dead.
Boy, blowed in half. I saw him.

921
01:25:34,345 --> 01:25:36,176
And I know who killed him.

922
01:25:37,248 --> 01:25:39,944
Now, ain't that the damnedest thing?

923
01:25:42,653 --> 01:25:45,850
I just listen to myself,
and I know who killed him.

924
01:25:48,893 --> 01:25:51,157
Ain't that the damnedest thing?

925
01:26:03,875 --> 01:26:11,543
Come and around me stand

926
01:26:11,616 --> 01:26:18,681
Oh, bear me away
on your snowy wings

927
01:26:18,756 --> 01:26:24,456
To my immortal home

928
01:26:25,062 --> 01:26:31,797
Oh, bear me away
on your snowy wings

929
01:26:31,869 --> 01:26:38,832
To my immortal home

930
01:26:39,444 --> 01:26:46,247
Come, come, angel band

931
01:26:46,317 --> 01:26:49,252
- You listen to me, Willie.
- Come

932
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:52,016
You're not gonna sit out here
all alone and die.

933
01:26:52,523 --> 01:26:53,888
I ain't gonna let you.

934
01:26:55,393 --> 01:27:00,057
Now, I figured it out.
It was you that killed Frank.

935
01:27:00,131 --> 01:27:02,691
I know that.
It couldn't have been nobody else.

936
01:27:02,767 --> 01:27:07,261
But it's all right, 'cause
we're gonna get you some help.

937
01:27:08,072 --> 01:27:12,133
And you'll do some time,
but you won't be Ionely anymore, Willie.

938
01:27:12,243 --> 01:27:13,574
No more.

939
01:27:14,445 --> 01:27:17,642
I wasn't lonely when Frank was here.

940
01:27:18,816 --> 01:27:21,478
I was lonely years ago...

941
01:27:21,552 --> 01:27:25,249
but Frank and me and the Superstition,

942
01:27:25,323 --> 01:27:28,121
we hit it off real good.

943
01:27:28,192 --> 01:27:30,057
But Frank left me.

944
01:27:30,928 --> 01:27:33,556
He left me long before I killed him.

945
01:27:34,098 --> 01:27:37,590
He left me and he went off
with them young kids and...

946
01:27:39,036 --> 01:27:45,134
We used to sit in the shack together,
but Frank, he wasn't there no more.

947
01:27:45,209 --> 01:27:48,906
No. He was off with them young kids,

948
01:27:48,980 --> 01:27:52,780
laughing and joking
and being different.

949
01:27:54,619 --> 01:27:59,886
I remember back in '42,
when Frank and me found each other.

950
01:28:01,192 --> 01:28:03,660
Frank used to get mad at me,

951
01:28:03,728 --> 01:28:07,186
but I'd just go on up
in the Superstitions.

952
01:28:07,865 --> 01:28:11,699
I'd dig up some rocks,
and I'd go back.

953
01:28:11,769 --> 01:28:14,329
He wouldn't be mad no more.

954
01:28:14,405 --> 01:28:17,238
But then he went off with them kids.

955
01:28:18,376 --> 01:28:20,901
And he wouldn't listen to me.

956
01:28:20,978 --> 01:28:22,969
I tried to make him listen,
but he wouldn't.

957
01:28:23,047 --> 01:28:24,639
He wouldn't believe me.

958
01:28:24,715 --> 01:28:28,651
And now I gotta go back
to the Superstition.

959
01:28:28,719 --> 01:28:29,879
No, you don't, Willie.

960
01:28:29,954 --> 01:28:31,785
No, you don't.
It's gonna be okay.

961
01:28:31,856 --> 01:28:34,689
You won't be Ionely no more.
Nobody's gonna get mad at you.

962
01:28:34,759 --> 01:28:36,386
- Nothing matters.
- I promise you.

963
01:28:36,460 --> 01:28:38,291
- It does too matter.
- No, it doesn't.

964
01:28:38,362 --> 01:28:40,023
Nothing matters no more.

965
01:28:40,097 --> 01:28:42,827
It does, Willie.
You matter, Willie.

966
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:45,698
What? Are you one of them?

967
01:28:46,470 --> 01:28:49,064
Are you one of them
who Frank went off with?

968
01:28:49,140 --> 01:28:51,165
No, no, Willie.

969
01:28:51,242 --> 01:28:53,767
I'm one of them
who's gonna stay here with you.

970
01:28:55,947 --> 01:28:57,278
You get your bird, Willie.

971
01:28:57,348 --> 01:29:01,751
Come, come, angel band

972
01:29:01,819 --> 01:29:06,119
Come and around me stand

973
01:29:07,391 --> 01:29:11,327
Bear me away
on your snowy wings

974
01:29:12,930 --> 01:29:15,330
To my immortal home

975
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:18,368
Please bear me away

976
01:29:18,436 --> 01:29:19,926
You sing, Willie.

977
01:29:20,004 --> 01:29:24,600
- Come, Come
- To my immortal home

978
01:29:24,675 --> 01:29:27,371
You stay here just for a minute, Willie.

979
01:29:27,445 --> 01:29:29,845
- You stay there now, Willie.
- No.

980
01:29:29,914 --> 01:29:33,714
I'll be right back, now.
I'll be right back, Willie.

981
01:29:33,784 --> 01:29:35,149
You sing, Willie.

982
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:45,651
No, it's okay.
Just leave him alone, please?

983
01:29:45,730 --> 01:29:48,221
...angel band...

984
01:29:48,299 --> 01:29:49,789
Get in the car, Willie.

985
01:29:51,902 --> 01:29:54,200
Now, you remember
what I promised you, Willy.

986
01:29:54,271 --> 01:29:58,537
Wherever they take you tomorrow,
I'm gonna come and see you.

987
01:29:58,609 --> 01:30:00,133
You watch for me.

988
01:30:00,211 --> 01:30:03,703
You ever been up
in the Superstition Mountains, boy?

989
01:30:03,781 --> 01:30:08,047
L... I know places there
that nobody's ever seen.

990
01:30:08,919 --> 01:30:10,409
I wanna see 'em, Willie.

991
01:30:11,589 --> 01:30:13,250
You watch for me, now.

992
01:30:29,807 --> 01:30:30,967
Wintergreen.

993
01:30:38,749 --> 01:30:40,080
What's the story?

994
01:30:42,353 --> 01:30:44,617
Well, Frank was dealing, all right.

995
01:30:47,091 --> 01:30:50,083
Must've been 'cause he liked
having young folks around.

996
01:30:51,629 --> 01:30:53,563
I guess old people get that way.

997
01:30:56,567 --> 01:30:58,728
Kids would come
and have a good time.

998
01:30:58,803 --> 01:31:00,703
I suppose Frank did, too.

999
01:31:02,740 --> 01:31:04,230
Willie got jealous.

1000
01:31:05,843 --> 01:31:07,401
And that's the way it was.

1001
01:31:08,312 --> 01:31:11,304
Zemko didn't have nothing to do
with the killing.

1002
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:14,177
Just like that, huh?

1003
01:31:14,251 --> 01:31:16,219
That's right, Harve.

1004
01:31:16,287 --> 01:31:18,755
Somebody died over Ioneliness.

1005
01:31:18,823 --> 01:31:21,417
Sometimes it's just that simple.

1006
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:24,891
What about the murder weapon?

1007
01:31:24,962 --> 01:31:27,123
I don't know nothing about that.

1008
01:31:27,198 --> 01:31:32,033
All I know is that Willie killed Frank
'cause he was old and scared,

1009
01:31:32,103 --> 01:31:34,162
tired and Ionely.

1010
01:31:36,607 --> 01:31:38,541
We ripped up his house, didn't we?

1011
01:31:40,244 --> 01:31:43,008
Why don't you go out there
and dig up the whole world?

1012
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:44,707
Maybe you can find the gun.

1013
01:31:46,784 --> 01:31:49,344
What about the $3,700
we found on the kid?

1014
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:53,186
It was his own.
Saved it, something.

1015
01:31:53,257 --> 01:31:54,281
That simple?

1016
01:31:54,358 --> 01:31:56,292
That's right, Sarge.
Just that simple.

1017
01:31:56,360 --> 01:31:59,295
- Why didn't he tell anyone?
- He told somebody.

1018
01:32:01,165 --> 01:32:03,190
But old Harve didn't believe him.

1019
01:32:08,405 --> 01:32:09,895
Suppose that's right.

1020
01:32:11,375 --> 01:32:13,206
What happened to Frank's 5,000?

1021
01:32:13,277 --> 01:32:15,006
I don't know.

1022
01:32:15,079 --> 01:32:17,980
Maybe there never was any 5,000.
I don't even care.

1023
01:32:18,048 --> 01:32:20,016
You haven't got a case, Wintergreen.

1024
01:32:20,084 --> 01:32:22,575
I don't care
about having a case, Harve.

1025
01:32:22,653 --> 01:32:25,213
All I care about
is that you were wrong.

1026
01:32:25,289 --> 01:32:27,280
You beat up them kids
down at the commune,

1027
01:32:27,358 --> 01:32:29,918
they didn't do nothing to you,
and you were wrong for that.

1028
01:32:29,994 --> 01:32:31,791
And you beat up Zemko,
and he was telling you the truth,

1029
01:32:31,862 --> 01:32:33,989
and you were wrong for that,
and Willie told you the truth.

1030
01:32:34,064 --> 01:32:35,998
You've been wrong all along, Harve.

1031
01:32:37,001 --> 01:32:41,335
And you can take that cigar
and that suit and the badge,

1032
01:32:41,405 --> 01:32:44,135
and you can give 'em
to some other scared little mouse

1033
01:32:44,208 --> 01:32:45,937
who'll believe your horse shit.

1034
01:32:51,315 --> 01:32:53,306
You're full of horse shit, Harve.

1035
01:34:12,630 --> 01:34:14,621
You old drunken toad.

1036
01:34:25,709 --> 01:34:27,438
Detective Wintergreen.

1037
01:34:28,979 --> 01:34:30,378
Come over here.

1038
01:34:59,076 --> 01:35:00,976
Oh, no, Zipper.

1039
01:35:01,045 --> 01:35:03,741
It was just laying there, Big John.

1040
01:35:03,814 --> 01:35:05,372
I had to take it.

1041
01:35:06,784 --> 01:35:09,116
What was he gonna do
with all that money?

1042
01:35:12,856 --> 01:35:16,451
If it hadn't been just laying there,
I wouldn't have taken it.

1043
01:35:17,594 --> 01:35:19,186
You believe that, don't you?

1044
01:35:23,968 --> 01:35:27,665
That kid Zemko was going over.
Zipper, you were gonna let him.

1045
01:35:27,738 --> 01:35:30,400
You know what that makes you?
Do you?

1046
01:35:30,474 --> 01:35:32,772
We only get what's coming to us.

1047
01:35:34,945 --> 01:35:37,505
What I got coming to me...

1048
01:35:42,686 --> 01:35:46,383
Sweet Jesus, I'm scared!

1049
01:35:50,627 --> 01:35:52,458
Don't be scared now, Zipper.

1050
01:35:52,529 --> 01:35:54,997
Now, now, we'Il... we'll fix it.

1051
01:35:55,065 --> 01:35:56,657
We'll talk to Ryker.

1052
01:35:56,734 --> 01:35:59,601
That's what we'll do.
Come on, now.

1053
01:35:59,670 --> 01:36:01,467
I'm scared, John.

1054
01:36:03,340 --> 01:36:05,570
They're gonna know me.

1055
01:36:05,642 --> 01:36:07,439
Oh, Daddy!

1056
01:36:10,214 --> 01:36:12,375
They're all gonna know me now!

1057
01:36:13,984 --> 01:36:16,919
Daddy.
What should I do, Daddy?

1058
01:36:18,789 --> 01:36:20,916
Everybody's gotta know me.

1059
01:36:23,193 --> 01:36:25,718
All you proper coppers.

1060
01:36:25,796 --> 01:36:27,821
I'm Zipper the Slipper.

1061
01:36:29,133 --> 01:36:31,499
So everything goes.

1062
01:36:31,568 --> 01:36:36,130
The Electra Glide goes,
my police motor goes,

1063
01:36:36,206 --> 01:36:40,302
my badge goes,
my gun goes, my uniform.

1064
01:36:40,377 --> 01:36:42,868
My pension goes.

1065
01:36:42,946 --> 01:36:44,607
Everything goes.

1066
01:36:45,315 --> 01:36:48,284
But that's supposed to be
all right with me.

1067
01:36:48,352 --> 01:36:50,946
Because that's
proper police procedure.

1068
01:36:58,729 --> 01:37:02,130
No. No, no, no!

1069
01:37:06,804 --> 01:37:09,534
You do
what you gotta do, Big John.

1070
01:37:11,008 --> 01:37:12,999
I mean, you do what's right, man.

1071
01:37:15,412 --> 01:37:16,902
P.P.P.

1072
01:37:17,948 --> 01:37:19,779
Proper Police Procedure.

1073
01:37:25,322 --> 01:37:26,914
Officer Wintergreen!

1074
01:37:26,990 --> 01:37:29,322
I'm gonna blow
your rotten little heart out!

1075
01:37:29,393 --> 01:37:30,724
No!

1076
01:37:30,794 --> 01:37:33,126
Zipper.
Now, come on, Zipper.

1077
01:37:33,263 --> 01:37:34,821
Come on, now, Zip!

1078
01:37:35,799 --> 01:37:37,164
Cut it out, Zipper!

1079
01:37:38,435 --> 01:37:41,927
No, Zipper! Stop it! Damn you!
You're killing people, Zipper!

1080
01:37:42,005 --> 01:37:43,336
Will you quit it?!

1081
01:37:56,286 --> 01:37:58,117
Don't die, Zipper.
Come on, man.

1082
01:37:58,755 --> 01:38:00,052
Don't die!

1083
01:38:00,124 --> 01:38:01,716
Get up, Zipper.

1084
01:38:01,792 --> 01:38:03,282
Get up, Zipper.

1085
01:38:04,161 --> 01:38:06,994
Oh, God.
Don't die, Zip.

1086
01:38:07,064 --> 01:38:08,463
Don't die.

1087
01:38:14,605 --> 01:38:17,597
Zipper. Don't die, Zipper.

1088
01:38:22,346 --> 01:38:23,836
Oh, God.

1089
01:40:42,853 --> 01:40:45,151
Oh, man!
We're getting cracked, man.

1090
01:40:45,222 --> 01:40:47,213
We're getting cracked.
I'm freaking out, man.

1091
01:40:47,291 --> 01:40:50,124
Just take it easy, Hank.
Just take it easy.

1092
01:41:08,912 --> 01:41:12,177
Sweet talk him good.
Just sweet talk him.

1093
01:41:54,858 --> 01:41:57,349
- Can I see your license, please?
- Good morning.

1094
01:41:57,427 --> 01:41:58,758
Yeah.

1095
01:42:01,765 --> 01:42:04,290
You know,
you need a front bumper here.

1096
01:42:05,168 --> 01:42:06,294
Morning.

1097
01:42:16,580 --> 01:42:17,740
Don't I know you?

1098
01:42:27,858 --> 01:42:29,348
I owe you one, don't I?

1099
01:42:30,761 --> 01:42:31,921
Go on, get out of here.

1100
01:42:31,995 --> 01:42:36,329
Hey. Get a bumper on that thing
before you get a ticket, will you?

1101
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:37,799
Outta sight.
