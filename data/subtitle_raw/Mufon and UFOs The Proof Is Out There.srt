1
00:00:00,765 --> 00:00:02,947
- Ever since I was a little kid,

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,107
I've been obsessed with the idea

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,597
of extraterrestrial life in outer space.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,787
It's like it was born in me.

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,647
- To me, it's not about belief at all.

6
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,247
It's about the truth and
it's about being open to

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,197
all the different hypotheses,

8
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,137
all of the different data
and just trying to learn

9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,517
as much as we can.

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,467
- I've always been interested in UFOs.

11
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,731
It's just sort of been
a lifelong obsession.

12
00:00:26,814 --> 00:00:30,397
- When I became a MUFON field investigator

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,667
and I started investigating
the phenomena for myself,

14
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,647
it was like a fish to water.

15
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,177
It was what I was meant to do,

16
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,079
what I was born to do.

17
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,363
I view it as a mystery.

18
00:00:43,832 --> 00:00:45,546
I think it's
ridiculous to think that

19
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,853
there's not other life out there.

20
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,807
I like investigating things.

21
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,423
It's just in my nature.

22
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,567
So if this is all coming out soon,

23
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,367
you can't even talk about this.

24
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,820
You know the
old saying I want to believe.

25
00:01:03,903 --> 00:01:04,983
That's me.

26
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,755
- Here we are with Jeff Krauss

27
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:14,737
outside of the MUFON headquarters here

28
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,906
in Newport beach. - We made it.

29
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:16,680
- We made it.

30
00:01:16,763 --> 00:01:17,977
- In one piece. - Two pieces.

31
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,921
- One, two.

32
00:01:20,004 --> 00:01:23,587
I think that MUFON's creed says it all.

33
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,007
The scientific investigation of UFOs

34
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,013
for the benefit of humanity.

35
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,317
- Well, it's the mutual UFO network.

36
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,727
They take in reports of
sightings and experiences

37
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,247
and put it all together
and sort of research

38
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,237
the entire subject.

39
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,037
- MUFON started out as a
midwestern UFO network.

40
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,887
1969, when project blue book,

41
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,970
the air force's official
investigation into UFOs closed,

42
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,087
that's when MUFON became
the mutual UFO network

43
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,507
and we've been doing the
air forces job ever since.

44
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,217
It's a private group.

45
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,077
We're all volunteers.

46
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,077
I've got a little team of
eight people that work,

47
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,891
ya know, under me at MUFON.

48
00:02:09,974 --> 00:02:13,747
- Specifically, I'm
interested in astrobiology,

49
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,497
which is the search
for life on other planets.

50
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,097
Now, interestingly enough, most people

51
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,857
who are in the field of astrobiology

52
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,487
would not necessarily be interviewed

53
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,167
on a UFO documentary.

54
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:33,757
- Mostly, we do this out
of love for the phenomenon

55
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,173
and just a quest for
understanding this phenomenon.

56
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,822
The way I will do a UFO investigation,

57
00:02:42,905 --> 00:02:47,287
if it's through MUFON,
I'll have a report come in.

58
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,927
People will, ya know, if you see a UFO,

59
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,417
you don't wanna call
the air force or the police

60
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,337
or ya know,

61
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,397
I mean, you could but
usually, they'll shuffle that

62
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,051
under the doormat.

63
00:02:59,134 --> 00:03:01,717
But if you go to MUFON. Com,

64
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,027
it'll say report a UFO.

65
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,687
Ya click on that and
it'll ask you questions.

66
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,297
What area of the sky you saw it in,

67
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:13,515
what time of day or evening it was,

68
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:15,697
they'll wanna know where you were at,

69
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,557
ya know, what your city was.

70
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,097
I'll first sent the witness an email

71
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,487
and tell them who I am
and that I'm responding

72
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,607
to their MUFON report
and find out a good time

73
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,707
when we can talk on the phone

74
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,837
and schedule an interview with them.

75
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,407
- Part of it is a bit of a hunger.

76
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,292
Okay, I gotta figure out what this is.

77
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:40,417
I'm gonna do my best to
research and find it out.

78
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,537
I'm gonna go through newspaper reports.

79
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,137
I'm gonna search the
Internet for sighting reports

80
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,207
from other organizations or from ya know,

81
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,526
even social media, anything like that.

82
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,267
I'm gonna do everything I can.

83
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,877
I'm gonna look at local flight paths.

84
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,211
I'm gonna look at
everything I possibly can find

85
00:03:57,294 --> 00:04:00,877
to try to determine what it might've been.

86
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,753
- If more people see the same thing,

87
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:09,247
then that's good too especially
because you have more

88
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,137
perspectives to go off of.

89
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,797
And you can find it which details match

90
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,597
in every account.

91
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,277
- When I start to get that going

92
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,493
where I'm not sure what it is yet,

93
00:04:20,576 --> 00:04:23,197
so that sort of feeds itself.

94
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,283
The more exciting it is,
the more work I have to do.

95
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,830
Then there comes that moment when

96
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,197
I can't say and I sit on it for a while.

97
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,577
It bothers me.

98
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,617
It eats away at me 'cause I don't want to

99
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,450
close that report.

100
00:04:36,533 --> 00:04:38,617
I don't wanna tell that witness

101
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,647
and I don't wanna tell the
other people in the organization

102
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,437
for sure that's an unknown.

103
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,957
I sit on it and I worry on it for a while.

104
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,567
And I think, I'm like I'll
leave it and I'll come back

105
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,400
to it the next day.

106
00:04:50,483 --> 00:04:52,327
I'm like no, I gotta know what this is.

107
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:55,027
I gotta say what it is or what it's not.

108
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,617
And that gets even more exciting

109
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,100
but it's also nerve racking.

110
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,007
- Okay, if somebody
has just a UFO sighting,

111
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,447
just, right?

112
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,487
I mean, it's always a huge thing

113
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,257
when you see a UFO.

114
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,077
It depends on how distant it is.

115
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,387
If it's something that
was really in the distance,

116
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,777
then it's just like a visual thing

117
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,527
and ya know, it's like if
you saw anything else

118
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:24,877
in the distance, but sometimes,
when somebody sees

119
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,667
a UFO in the distance,
a weird thing happens.

120
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,207
It seems like this telepathic
connection happens.

121
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:34,477
Suddenly, the UFO is right on them.

122
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,337
- And usually, the last thing I do is

123
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,387
before I close the case, I
contact the state director

124
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,207
and our chief state
investigator and I say hey guys,

125
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,907
I think I might have something here.

126
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,076
Will you look at what I've got?

127
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,540
Look at my notes, look at my report,

128
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,527
and tell me what you think?

129
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:55,610
- In my mind, the holy
grail of UFO investigation

130
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,257
would be if you could
actually get some kind of

131
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:03,247
a material fragment
from the UFO, an artifact.

132
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,037
That's assuming that
they are physical objects

133
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,760
but let's say that they are for a second.

134
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,083
If you could get an actual piece of one,

135
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,177
that would be a game changer

136
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,217
because then you could take it to a lab.

137
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,707
You could look at its isotope ratios.

138
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,627
You can look at what
elements it's made out of

139
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:24,710
and ya know, you could see
if it matches what we know

140
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:29,407
could come from the earth.

141
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,917
And that would tell you
something pretty substantial

142
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,737
about where these things are actually from

143
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,136
or what their origin is.

144
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,897
- It's fun, it's exciting.

145
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,102
A lot of the basic day
to day investigations

146
00:06:43,185 --> 00:06:45,157
can easily be done by remote.

147
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,937
Phone, video chat, email, that kinda thing.

148
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,727
Depends on the type of report it is.

149
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,473
Your basic day to day
hey, I saw something weird,

150
00:06:54,556 --> 00:06:57,487
I can do that over the phone
when I conduct an interview

151
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:01,027
and I can go through
the investigation that way.

152
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,587
I'll research the locations,

153
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:05,827
go through, look at
the air traffic in the area,

154
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,746
check news reports,
everything that corresponds

155
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:08,850
on the date of the sighting

156
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,467
just so I can get an idea
of what that person did

157
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,167
or did not see or what may
or may not have happened.

158
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,807
As the type of sightings level up,

159
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:19,357
those would merit an
in person investigation.

160
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,227
Say to investigate an actual landing sight

161
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,207
or a face to face interview with somebody

162
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,487
who's actually had a
face to face experience

163
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,737
with something else.

164
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,317
All the way up to MUFON has a division

165
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,097
that does underwater research
with trained scuba divers.

166
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,987
They have a 24 hour response team.

167
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,347
So, ya know, if there's
another Roswell incident,

168
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:44,062
we can have people out there
within 24 hours on the ground.

169
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:47,616
I think the public would be surprised

170
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,217
to find out there's quite a few scientists,

171
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,827
ex military, police officers,

172
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,897
a lot of very highly credentialed people

173
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,017
involved in MUFON but
there's also housewives.

174
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,027
Just anybody who's
interested who wants to help.

175
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,313
- I think it helps.

176
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,607
If you're a pure skeptic, that's not good.

177
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:09,547
If you're like everybody is space brothers

178
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,937
and everything's a UFO,
that's not good either.

179
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,607
Ya know, you have to
be able to look at stuff

180
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:18,397
and try to be skeptical
and try to figure out

181
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,877
what prosaic thing that object might be

182
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,197
or what the person saw
and what it might've been

183
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,627
that's other than a UFO.

184
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,757
It's almost like you check everything off

185
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,057
and you just keep on
but at the end of the day,

186
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:38,257
if I can't find a scientific
explanation for that ya know,

187
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,467
sighting, there's your UFO.

188
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,777
Doesn't mean that it's
from an alien planet.

189
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,257
I mean, it might be a
black project of our own

190
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,807
that I'm not aware of yet.

191
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:52,147
But it's still unidentified

192
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:57,230
and that is what a UFO is,
an unidentified flying object.

193
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,497
- It's pretty easy actually.

194
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,877
You can go to MUFON's website

195
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,186
and you can read up on them
and see what they're all about.

196
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,747
You can become a member.

197
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,846
There's a little membership
fee and you get a newsletter

198
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,767
and there's different levels of membership.

199
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,747
After a couple years, I decided I wanted to

200
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:14,407
get more involved and I
applied to be an investigator.

201
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,297
There's a whole training process to that.

202
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,057
You sign up, you do the training,

203
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,887
you take tests and eventually,

204
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,377
you get certified as a field investigator.

205
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,980
- But that's pretty much how we do it.

206
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,267
We have generally three months limit

207
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,367
to how long we can take on a case.

208
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,247
I had somebody ya know, put in a UFO report

209
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:37,177
that was a rocket launch from
Vandenberg the other night.

210
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,597
He happened to be in
a boat off Catalina island

211
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,547
and it looked really strange.

212
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,547
Ya know, the space-x
launches do look strange.

213
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,247
Ya know, now the whole
ya know, bottom stage

214
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:52,327
will go and land back
on the landing platform.

215
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,127
So you've got all kinds of activity

216
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,497
and you can see that all in the sky.

217
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,477
I can understand why this person

218
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,127
thought it was a UFO.

219
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,377
I wrote the guy a really
nice email and told him

220
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,997
what it was he saw.

221
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,367
I said if you want, you can still talk.

222
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,717
We can talk.

223
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,276
Just let me know.

224
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,386
Send me a email back and I'll ya know,

225
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,667
explain it a little better
to you but, you know,

226
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,317
we knew about this rocket launch

227
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,737
and we were expecting people to report it.

228
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,292
- The vast majority of
the people I've spoken to

229
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,757
are excited about it.

230
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,200
They wanna know, like what was it?

231
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,030
What did I see?

232
00:10:24,113 --> 00:10:25,025
What is it?

233
00:10:25,108 --> 00:10:25,858
Did anybody else see it?

234
00:10:25,941 --> 00:10:27,336
They wanna know what did you think it was?

235
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,440
I've talked to a couple
people who were just thrilled

236
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:30,937
that they even had the opportunity,

237
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,317
that the thing happened to them,

238
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,347
that they saw this or
that they had this contact.

239
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:38,469
Some people do ask me
directly, what was this?

240
00:10:38,552 --> 00:10:40,296
Because they feel like
when they speak to me,

241
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,257
they speak to someone from MUFON,

242
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,366
they think we're the experts.

243
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,390
We should know.

244
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,547
But we don't always know.

245
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:49,237
And that's kinda the point.

246
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,797
We don't know.

247
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,657
We want to know.

248
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,260
We're trying to gather the information

249
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,476
from all these different sources,

250
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,887
from all these reports,

251
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:01,477
so that we can say
it is this or it is this.

252
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,917
We can't always say that.

253
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,677
My favorite reports are the ones

254
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,503
that we classify as unknowns.

255
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:12,637
An unknown is basically when
you can not definitively say

256
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,013
what it was or was not.

257
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,756
You know, there's a situation
where somebody saw something,

258
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,327
maybe they might even have photographs.

259
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:22,207
And you can within a certain percentage

260
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:26,857
of reasonable doubt say that
was an airplane of some kind.

261
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,176
I can't tell you what kind it was.

262
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,907
I can't identify it, but it
was a man-made vehicle

263
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:35,407
of some sort or it was a
satellite or it was whatever,

264
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:38,077
a planet, a star, that's one thing.

265
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,887
An unknown is where you can't say for sure.

266
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,372
I can say I'm looking at this picture and

267
00:11:44,455 --> 00:11:46,297
that could be an airplane.

268
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,130
That's my favorite.

269
00:11:47,213 --> 00:11:49,026
Those, to me, are the
most exciting ones because

270
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:49,897
it really makes you think.

271
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,216
You have to really do the research.

272
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,687
You have to talk to the people.

273
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,697
You have to look into all parts of it

274
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,977
and you really have to be sure

275
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,013
you can not say what it is or is not.

276
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:03,007
They're probably the
more rare cases that we get

277
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,746
but for me, they're the most exciting ones.

278
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,366
They're the ones that keep me interested.

279
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:10,477
- Yeah, a lot of them could
be secret craft or ya know,

280
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,843
atmosphere plasma
phenomenon or misperceptions.

281
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,977
Again, most of them are.

282
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:21,940
But there are still those cases
where you have something

283
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,347
flying in really aerodynamically
bizarre ways, right?

284
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:29,407
It's suddenly stopping
at some insane g-force.

285
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,383
It's reversing direction.

286
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,653
- I do my best to not,

287
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,537
I don't wanna burst someone's bubble.

288
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,017
If someone really believes
hard they saw something

289
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,837
and they're excited about it,

290
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,017
I don't wanna break up that for them.

291
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,597
I will do my best to
explain that I can't say

292
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,337
for sure what that is.

293
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,387
I can't tell you that is an
alien or UFO or whatever.

294
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,847
I can only say what I think it might be

295
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,167
or what it wasn't.

296
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,447
- The answer is that in most cases,

297
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,777
you can't ever know
that anything is for sure.

298
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:09,367
But what ya can do is you can at least

299
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:14,450
try to rule out any
conventional explanation.

300
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,377
- There's times where
I absolutely have to say

301
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,018
man, it's balloons man, I'm sorry.

302
00:13:20,101 --> 00:13:22,657
There was a birthday party down the street

303
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,237
and those are balloons that got away.

304
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,947
I try and make that as easy as possible.

305
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,197
For me, it's not a
matter of disappointment.

306
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,167
I'm there to just figure
out to my best ability

307
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,700
what it is or what it is not.

308
00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:36,516
- Ya know, there's a lot
of different ideas out there

309
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,127
about what UFOs could be.

310
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,772
Classified technology from
this country or that country,

311
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:46,177
drones, could they be just sort of people

312
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,580
misperceiving things, well
yeah, they are most of the time.

313
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:53,017
Could they be some kind of
new atmospheric phenomenon?

314
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,847
Could it be some kind of a plasma,

315
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,497
like ball of lightning or something?

316
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,947
Could it be extraterrestrial?

317
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:03,850
I would say something
like 98% of UFO sightings

318
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:07,417
have a complete prosaic explanation

319
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,360
and are completely explainable as

320
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,827
people misperceiving
things and optical illusions.

321
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:19,735
Sift out the minority of UFO
reports that are interesting

322
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:23,317
from the majority that
are just sort of people

323
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,747
seeing the international space station.

324
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,967
What you really have to do is go in,

325
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,262
look for every explanation,

326
00:14:30,345 --> 00:14:33,517
and rule it out one by one.

327
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,356
It's really all about
skepticism in a lot of ways.

328
00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:43,439
If you can't debunk it,
then by definition, it's a UFO.

329
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,167
So it's one thing that I
would say a lot of people

330
00:14:46,191 --> 00:14:48,097
kind of mistake.

331
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,637
A UFO isn't just an unidentif, or UAP,

332
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,797
it's not just an unidentified flying object

333
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,197
or unexplained aerial phenomenon.

334
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,958
It's something that's
unidentified or unexplained

335
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:03,247
after you've done everything
in your power to explain it.

336
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:06,697
Does that mean it's necessarily aliens?

337
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,167
- I know what I want it to be.

338
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,257
I want it to be contact from other planets,

339
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,397
from other civilizations.

340
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,017
That's what I really want it to be.

341
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,366
I think it's ridiculous to think that

342
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,647
there's not other life out there.

343
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,827
- There's this idea that
they call the fermi paradox

344
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:24,637
which is like the sort of
statement in astronomy

345
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,617
of like, where is everyone?

346
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,297
Where are all of the aliens

347
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,513
if there's so many
stars out there that could

348
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,707
host life and so forth?

349
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:35,467
Classic argument against UFOs being alien

350
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,537
is it's too, stars are too far away.

351
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,147
It takes too much energy to get here

352
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,187
from another star system.

353
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,497
So, how are they doing that?

354
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,327
Why are they doing that?

355
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:51,127
How could they possibly have
enough time to do that anyway

356
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,557
because it's just really and it is true.

357
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,727
Stars are really far away.

358
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:57,850
It'd take the voyager
which is the furthest thing

359
00:15:58,881 --> 00:16:00,246
we've ever sent out of the solar system,

360
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:03,076
something like 50,000 years

361
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:06,247
to leave the solar system.

362
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:09,157
The other side of it is
that space is very big.

363
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,957
It's also very, very,
very, very, very, very old.

364
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,368
So if you took the age
of the universe and put it,

365
00:16:17,451 --> 00:16:19,987
scaled it down to a calendar year,

366
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,837
all of human history happened in the last

367
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,747
60 seconds of January 31st.

368
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:29,554
Yes, there's the stars very far away

369
00:16:29,637 --> 00:16:31,837
and it'd take a very long time.

370
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,877
But there has been enough time.

371
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:38,257
So, let's say an alien
civilization wanted to spread out

372
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,327
throughout the galaxy, right?

373
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:43,747
The way they would do it is
they would send out one craft

374
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:46,357
to a neighboring star system.

375
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,257
It would get there.

376
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,137
It would arrive in the
equivalent of the asteroid belt

377
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,727
or whatever, consume some matter,

378
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,577
and then it would maybe 3D print out

379
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,967
a dot or probes and send
those every which way

380
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,947
to different solar systems.

381
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,237
And keep doing that.

382
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,657
Now, you'd get kinda the snowball effect

383
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,347
where within a few million years,

384
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:12,367
you could blanket the
entire galaxy with probes

385
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,587
and it's possible to do it in a timescale

386
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:19,447
that is much, much less
than the age of the galaxy

387
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:22,087
which is somewhere
around 10 billion years old.

388
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:25,507
Is it kinda crazy if they're
driving their spaceship

389
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:27,817
from Zeta Reticuli every Monday

390
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,767
to go hover over Billy Bob's farm?

391
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:30,850
Sure it is.

392
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:35,816
But it's not ludicrous
to say that their probes

393
00:17:35,899 --> 00:17:38,530
could've passed through the solar system,

394
00:17:38,613 --> 00:17:41,467
ya know, waves of traffic from that kind of

395
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:45,607
colonization scenario,
could be in the solar system.

396
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,727
They could be hiding
somewhere in the asteroid belt

397
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:52,927
or the Kuiper belt, the edge
of the solar system, wherever,

398
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:57,907
and maybe if they are, they
periodically send their probes

399
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,767
to observe the earth.

400
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:03,937
And that is within
physics, within astronomy,

401
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,567
within astrobiology, a
completely reasonable thing

402
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:11,310
to speculate about and
it's completely possible.

403
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,497
- When I was five years old,

404
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:18,697
my mom did disclosure for me.

405
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,467
Now it wasn't a family secret.

406
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:23,467
We all knew that mom worked
as one of Howard Hughes'

407
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,077
two private personal secretaries

408
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,597
but when I was five, for whatever reason,

409
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,657
my mom got talkative and she just told me

410
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,087
about what she, about a story,

411
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,427
about what she'd gone through.

412
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,857
That when she was working for Hughes,

413
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,547
that they took her out to this,

414
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,587
to the middle of nowhere, she said it was

415
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,117
a great American desert.

416
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,217
She had a little security detail with them

417
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,677
and there was this bunker or this shack

418
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,274
is the way that she put it, a shack,

419
00:18:52,357 --> 00:18:57,357
and made outta concrete and
kind of low slung to the ground

420
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,777
and it looked like nothing.

421
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,697
She said that she wondered why they were

422
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,037
taking her out to where
it looked like maybe

423
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:08,107
they kept tools or ya know,
machinery or something.

424
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,177
But they opened up the doors.

425
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,067
Everything's locked and secured.

426
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,150
There was an elevator.

427
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,757
So, she got into the elevator with a couple

428
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,127
of security guys and she
thought that it was gonna

429
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,197
go down a couple of floors.

430
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,327
But it kept going down.

431
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:25,777
And she said it just kept
going and it seemed to have

432
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,617
a bit of speed to it and she
felt butterflies in her stomach

433
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,597
but when it finally stopped moving,

434
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,877
she said that the doors opened up

435
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,510
and there was a little
city there under the desert.

436
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,177
She said that they had this one,

437
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,577
that they had little cafes and places

438
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,277
where you could get food and movie theaters

439
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,077
and bowling alley

440
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,837
and she talked about how it was funny,

441
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,437
there was this one cafe that
had these yellow umbrellas

442
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,877
over all the little tables,

443
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,857
like a French cafe.

444
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,657
She seemed to get a kick outta the fact

445
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,267
that they had umbrellas in a cave.

446
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,907
But it is apparently to
make people feel comfortable

447
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,647
with their surroundings.

448
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:09,247
My mom said that there were a lot of German

449
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:12,391
rocket scientists that work down there.

450
00:20:12,474 --> 00:20:13,867
Now I tried, I would ask my mom

451
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,087
what were you guys working on down there?

452
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,427
She would never answer that question.

453
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,407
I still don't know.

454
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,297
I still have no idea.

455
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,297
In my investigations, there was one guy

456
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:30,367
who was a RAF pilot whose
mom was another secretary

457
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:34,267
for Hughes and she told him the same story.

458
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,397
I heard this from a friend of his.

459
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,277
She was more detailed
when she talked about the lab.

460
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,947
She said it was Howard Hughes' lab.

461
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:44,917
They had a little cat walk
that went over everything

462
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,377
so you could see what they
were working on down there.

463
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,897
It was a quite elaborate set up.

464
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,437
It was like something out
of James Bond, but real.

465
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,757
- I would say that I was
always really fascinated by

466
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,327
just the question of
other life in the universe.

467
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:05,317
I grew up very into science fiction.

468
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,407
Basically just my young
imagination kinda got captured

469
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:12,727
by this idea of other life
out there in the universe

470
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,977
and when we find it, what would happen

471
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,567
if we made first contact.

472
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,057
- The first time I really
heard her talk about it

473
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,827
and she would kind of say in general,

474
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,117
well, we're not alone.

475
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,827
We're not alone in the universe.

476
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,927
There's too many stars, too many planets,

477
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,247
it's impossible.

478
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:29,767
So, she didn't say that she had

479
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:32,827
learned that anywhere exotic.

480
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:34,897
There was one incident where my cousins

481
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,327
were out visiting and my aunt brought

482
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:40,717
a copy of look magazine and
it had the Betty and Barney hill

483
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,243
story on the cover.

484
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,167
While my aunt was very
skeptical about the Betty

485
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,847
and Barney hill case,

486
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:51,967
she was ya know, saying
that well how would this happen

487
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:54,487
and how wouldn't everybody
else have seen this,

488
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:56,655
ya know, a space ship coming down?

489
00:21:56,738 --> 00:21:59,523
Wouldn't the air force have known about it?

490
00:21:59,606 --> 00:22:01,867
Blah, blah, blah.

491
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:04,184
My mom said to her,

492
00:22:04,267 --> 00:22:07,784
"from what I know, what I've learned,

493
00:22:07,867 --> 00:22:10,747
"this could very well
have actually happened."

494
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,077
We aren't alone and the
government knows this.

495
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,714
My aunt, at that point
said, "oh well, this is crazy.

496
00:22:17,797 --> 00:22:19,657
"It's like a bad science fiction film."

497
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,957
It says that they stuck
a needle into her naval.

498
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,775
That was the first time I
heard my mom say that,

499
00:22:25,858 --> 00:22:27,298
ya know, that this was a real thing,

500
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,557
that UFOs were real and that the phenomena,

501
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,207
there was something to it.

502
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:34,177
- When I was very little,
I thought I was being

503
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:39,260
visited by monsters or devils or something

504
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,360
when I was a little kid.

505
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,997
The whole like frozen in place thing,

506
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,467
the bed lifting off the ground,

507
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,370
things in the room moving, weird sounds,

508
00:22:46,453 --> 00:22:49,267
footsteps, things like that.

509
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:54,350
Being frozen in place and I
have very specific memories of

510
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,616
things like the bed
being lifted off the ground

511
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,237
and actually being tilted so to sort of

512
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,667
slide me off the end of
the bed, that kinda thing.

513
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,809
Because I'd been into
UFOs and things like that,

514
00:23:03,892 --> 00:23:06,547
I started thinking that's what it was.

515
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:09,787
Little bit later on, jump
forward into the 90s a bit.

516
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:11,466
Ya know, there's a thing
called the Internet now.

517
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:14,287
I was reading on a news
group about UFO abductions

518
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:16,567
'cause I was kinda feeling
like that was what was

519
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,410
going on, I was pretty
convinced at the time.

520
00:23:18,472 --> 00:23:23,315
And then, I found out about
a thing called sleep paralysis

521
00:23:23,398 --> 00:23:26,730
where you are essentially
between sleep states.

522
00:23:26,813 --> 00:23:28,607
Your body is shut down

523
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,307
but your mind is still moving.

524
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:31,897
Your eyes are even open

525
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,237
giving the sensation
of being frozen in place.

526
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,877
And almost hallucinating
while you're doing it.

527
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,597
So a lot of people will
report hearing footsteps,

528
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,446
seeing shadows around the room,

529
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:44,887
activity just outside of the peripheral,

530
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,507
just outside of your vision.

531
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:49,477
Turns out I've had it
chronically my entire life,

532
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,987
which isn't as common and
that's what I was experiencing.

533
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:56,827
That did feed directly
into my interest in UFOs.

534
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,236
I've talked to people who have had

535
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,727
genuine abduction situations.

536
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:04,117
That's not what I was experiencing.

537
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,616
A lot of people think
they're being abducted

538
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,447
and it turns out to be sleep paralysis.

539
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:10,018
And I think sometimes people
maybe are being abducted

540
00:24:10,101 --> 00:24:12,247
and everyone tells
them it's sleep paralysis

541
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:13,507
when it's not.

542
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,067
It's kind of a gray area.

543
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:17,857
But that fit into my
interest, got me deep into it

544
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,995
'cause I wanted to research all about it

545
00:24:20,078 --> 00:24:22,472
up until I figured out
what this condition was.

546
00:24:22,555 --> 00:24:27,367
- So this happened back in 2017.

547
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:31,717
I was taking astronomy at
the local community college.

548
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,287
We had been observing the
moon for a really long time,

549
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:37,477
mapping craters and so forth.

550
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,547
So I was trying to get
the telescope trained

551
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:42,037
on the Orion nebula and then,

552
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,053
I heard this group of people behind me,

553
00:24:45,136 --> 00:24:49,177
another group on a different telescope,

554
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:52,297
freaking out about some object in the sky.

555
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:55,117
They're going like holy
shit, what is that thing?

556
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,197
So ya know, I was like okay, ya know,

557
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,347
the moon and the Orion
nebula are gonna be here

558
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,087
for a few billion more years.

559
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:07,117
I'm gonna have plenty of
other chances to look at those.

560
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,117
This thing might not be
here for another second.

561
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,067
I better go see what it is.

562
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:15,667
I walk over to where they're all pointing

563
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,767
and I'm standing there and what it was,

564
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,097
it was this v-shaped object.

565
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:23,257
It was gunmetal black
and there were four big

566
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:27,127
circular white lights
down either arm of the V.

567
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:31,687
Sort of like what was seen in the 1997

568
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:35,827
Phoenix lights incident
if you know that one

569
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:39,243
and it was just drifting
along really, really slowly.

570
00:25:39,326 --> 00:25:43,207
One of the other witnesses
said looked like it was going

571
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:45,277
something like 15 miles per hour.

572
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,187
Really low, really, really, really low.

573
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:51,607
It was started maybe
level with the tree tops

574
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:54,697
and never got above about
1,000 feet, I would say.

575
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,707
It was pretty big in the night sky.

576
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,902
I would say it was comparable to

577
00:25:58,985 --> 00:26:01,927
if you've ever seen the full moon.

578
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:04,537
It just kept on going and kept
on going and kept on going

579
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,428
and then, after about 20ish seconds,

580
00:26:07,511 --> 00:26:11,737
it kinda got to a point and so,

581
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:15,740
this is where my account
diverges with the other witnesses.

582
00:26:15,823 --> 00:26:17,857
I remember seeing
something a little bit different

583
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,017
from the other people that were there.

584
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,447
What I distinctly remembered is

585
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:25,354
when it got to the point where it stopped,

586
00:26:25,437 --> 00:26:28,687
it looked to me almost like it faded into

587
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,517
the rest of the sky.

588
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,607
The best way I could describe
it is it was like the borders,

589
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:37,477
these edges of this V
shaped craft were very sharp,

590
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,245
very distinct and it was
kinda like the borders

591
00:26:40,328 --> 00:26:43,357
looked to me like they were getting almost

592
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,797
fuzzier and fuzzier until the structure

593
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,557
kinda faded into the rest of the sky.

594
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,640
That's what I remember.

595
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:53,617
Now, the only witnesses only,

596
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,296
the other witnesses
remember it differently.

597
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,007
They remember just seeing it trail off

598
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:59,377
until they couldn't see it anymore.

599
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,907
So they didn't see it cloaking.

600
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:03,697
What I'll say about that
is that no two people

601
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:06,427
are gonna remember an event the same way.

602
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:10,537
So if I see a car crash,
I'll say it was a red Honda

603
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,597
or something and you might say it was

604
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,107
a orange Lamborghini and
that's an extreme example

605
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,847
but everyone remem...

606
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:22,417
Details of any remembered
eyewitness account

607
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,757
are gonna differ in certain ways.

608
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,887
But we all agreed that it was there.

609
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,086
We all agreed that it happened.

610
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,497
There were three other people.

611
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:33,667
So I was like okay well,
I saw something weird,

612
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:34,927
didn't get a video.

613
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:37,380
I'm kind of annoyed about that, ya know?

614
00:27:37,463 --> 00:27:40,537
Especially as a scientific sort of person.

615
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,667
I like to have evidence for things.

616
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,727
So, I said to myself, okay,
I want to investigate this.

617
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:48,877
I wanna figure out what I saw.

618
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,327
And I wanna see if I
can get to the bottom of it.

619
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:56,527
- The way that I became
a MUFON field investigator

620
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:59,077
was after my mom passed away.

621
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:03,387
I started just veraciously
reading the literature out there.

622
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:06,226
Ya know, before, when my mom was alive,

623
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:08,887
there was always that
chance she might give me

624
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:11,317
that golden ticket and finally, ya know,

625
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,352
just tell me outright everything.

626
00:28:14,435 --> 00:28:16,807
There's no chance of that now.

627
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,537
I just kept on reading and watching shows

628
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,567
and finally realized ya
know, I'm no better off now

629
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:24,207
than I was before.

630
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:26,197
Ya know, I don't know who to believe

631
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,197
and what's true and what's bogus and what.

632
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:34,280
Around 2014 or 15, hangar 1 TV show came on

633
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:38,437
which was the MUFON produced UFO show

634
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,417
and it was a cut above everything else

635
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,317
that was out there.

636
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,777
It was ya know, from case files,

637
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,507
by watching that show, I finally decided

638
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,887
I wanna do this.

639
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:50,497
I wanna go and investigate my own cases

640
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:53,347
and that way, I'm not
reading about somebody else's

641
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:55,987
ya know, investigation they did.

642
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:59,947
I'm not questioning the
veracity of these reports.

643
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,617
It's feet on the ground, ya know?

644
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,897
And it's me doing it.

645
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,747
But I found my state
director who is Jeff Krauss

646
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:11,043
at that time and he told me, you know,

647
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:13,627
if you go to MUFON. Com,

648
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:16,477
it'll say become a
MUFON field investigator.

649
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,835
Just click on that and it'll
give you all the information.

650
00:29:19,918 --> 00:29:23,227
Technically ya know, you
get the field investigator's

651
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:26,557
handbook which is excellent document.

652
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,057
Very professional.

653
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,657
Based on Dr. J. Allen
Hynek's work and Vallee,

654
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,337
Jacques Vallee's work.

655
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:37,687
And just these many ya know, 54 years now

656
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:40,747
that MUFON has been doing this.

657
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:44,497
So I studied the book
and then ya take a test.

658
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,807
They do a background check on you and stuff

659
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:50,707
because you don't want, ya
know, serial killers and stuff

660
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,194
doing this, yeah.

661
00:29:53,765 --> 00:29:56,857
The next thing you know,
I was a field investigator.

662
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,297
I started getting cases.

663
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,777
You know, a case will
come in and the state director

664
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,217
will assign those cases.

665
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,817
That's what I do now is I'll
assign the cases to other,

666
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,388
my field investigator team.

667
00:30:09,471 --> 00:30:11,917
Once in a while, I'll
see one that seems like

668
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,244
it has my name on it.

669
00:30:13,327 --> 00:30:16,215
I feel an affinity for and once in a while,

670
00:30:16,298 --> 00:30:20,035
I'll grab one for myself
now still 'cause ya know,

671
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:25,118
you're either a UFO
investigator or you're not, right?

672
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:28,687
So, I always have current cases going

673
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:30,217
but I share the wealth now.

674
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:33,967
- We don't have very many
confirmed cases where

675
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:37,147
I could actually take a piece of a UFO

676
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,617
and do a lab and study it.

677
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:43,417
But what we do have is
a lot of evidence of them

678
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,997
affecting the environment around them.

679
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,687
So we have evidence of
them bouncing radar waves

680
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:51,487
off of themselves.

681
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:54,517
We have evidence of
them having heat signatures

682
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,097
that can be picked up on infrared camera.

683
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:01,597
- There's definitely a great interest in

684
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:05,737
our military capabilities by our visitors.

685
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,973
This is why we see things like

686
00:31:08,056 --> 00:31:10,657
my friend Robert Solas, for instance,

687
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:15,740
who was a commander
of an ICBM base in Montana

688
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,589
back in 1968.

689
00:31:18,672 --> 00:31:22,507
They had a UFO that was hovering right over

690
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,217
the missile base.

691
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,737
The guy in the guard shack is calling down.

692
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,443
Everybody sees this thing.

693
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,447
Each missile went offline.

694
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:34,147
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

695
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,677
And then they went back online.

696
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,876
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

697
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,617
It's like this is what we can do.

698
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,980
Yeah you can build these things.

699
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:41,677
You can aim them at each other.

700
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,157
But you're not in control
of what finally really

701
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,927
actually happens to them.

702
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:49,027
We have final word on that.

703
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,527
I think it was a show of power.

704
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:52,957
It was also showing us, I mean,

705
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,537
this is a repeating thing that people hear

706
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,207
in alien encounters is that ya know,

707
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:02,857
nuclear weapons are evil,
that they will destroy humanity.

708
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:07,135
People are left with visions and dreams

709
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:11,167
after having a contact experience

710
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:15,667
of desolation like the
book of revelation, ya know?

711
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:18,997
But we brought it upon
ourselves is what people

712
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,487
are always told, that this is your future

713
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,197
if you're not careful.

714
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,681
I heard from one
interesting person recently

715
00:32:26,764 --> 00:32:30,157
who told me Mars isn't
so much for colonization

716
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,487
as it is a learning tool for you guys.

717
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:37,567
This is what you will become
if you don't change your ways.

718
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:41,707
- We're now at an age where data is finally

719
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,747
being released about this stuff.

720
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:47,502
Tick tack stuff, yeah, the
USS Nimitz, all of those.

721
00:32:47,585 --> 00:32:49,685
You had multiple eyewitnesses.

722
00:32:49,768 --> 00:32:51,787
Honestly, that's nothing new.

723
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:54,487
That's been in the UFO
literature for decades.

724
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:57,307
The point is that now,
the only difference now

725
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:01,047
is that it's being talked about a lot more

726
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:02,737
in the mainstream.

727
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,797
So now, even NASA is
openly getting involved

728
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,207
in investigating UFOs.

729
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:09,487
That was something that was announced

730
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,197
just like three weeks ago.

731
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,160
- Well I know there's
been a string of sightings

732
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,313
over the years of military pilots

733
00:33:16,396 --> 00:33:20,647
seeing strange objects
flying around while they're

734
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:23,257
up in the air and not just visual

735
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,027
but also being picked up on radar.

736
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:27,247
The pilots are picking it
up and the radar towers

737
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:29,617
and the bases are picking it up as well.

738
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,897
There's plenty of audio
recordings of the pilots

739
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,387
talking back and forth
and describing the sightings

740
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,620
as they're seeing them.

741
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,436
Seems like a lot of them are
taking place over the water,

742
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,188
over our coasts.

743
00:33:40,271 --> 00:33:43,822
And there's a whole theory on aquatic UFOs.

744
00:33:43,905 --> 00:33:46,027
I find it very interesting that

745
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:48,247
the military's finally acknowledging this

746
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,330
and releasing it.

747
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,997
- Best evidence I've heard of up till now,

748
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,787
I would say I would harken back to

749
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:57,367
what everyone kind of talks about which is

750
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:59,308
the tic tac incident.

751
00:33:59,391 --> 00:34:03,217
- As far as the tic tac and
the way that the government,

752
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,897
I think that they were very, very,

753
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,057
very foot draggy about it.

754
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:11,527
I mean, this event happened in 2004.

755
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:15,787
It wasn't until 2017 that it
became public knowledge.

756
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:18,757
A video got out and there's
nothing that they could say

757
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,687
about that video.

758
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:21,367
It wasn't supposed to get out.

759
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:24,097
It went out privately on the sly

760
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:27,337
and one of the pilots,
ya know, he more or less

761
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:32,420
videoed his radar screen
or his flir video screen

762
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,147
of what they were seeing.

763
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:36,757
And there you see this
craft that's just doing things

764
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:41,107
that are impossible for
anything that we have to do.

765
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:43,867
- Yeah, there was no
visible means of propulsion

766
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:45,153
which is really weird.

767
00:34:46,233 --> 00:34:48,847
Really, really weird.

768
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:52,957
I mean, that shouldn't be
possible with what we know.

769
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,847
No visible means of propulsion

770
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:58,237
and being able to do those maneuvers.

771
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,224
And being able to, I mean,
if you think about it right,

772
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:04,627
from a physics standpoint, if you're in a

773
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:07,525
really fast moving thing that's going at

774
00:35:07,608 --> 00:35:11,731
thousands of gs and suddenly stopping,

775
00:35:11,814 --> 00:35:14,617
you would be turned to
paste because ya know,

776
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,167
if you've ever been in a
car that suddenly stops,

777
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,417
you know that inertia is a thing.

778
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,967
You would be thrown
to the wall of the thing

779
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:23,527
really, really hard.

780
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:28,597
Somehow, that's not
happening to whatever is piloting

781
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,689
these things unless there is no pilot.

782
00:35:30,772 --> 00:35:34,777
I think the likeliest version
of the extraterrestrial

783
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,397
hypothesis from what I know

784
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,507
is that they might be machines, probes.

785
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:43,657
- So I think that the
government was kind of forced

786
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,117
to acknowledge that yes, it's a thing,

787
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,637
and it opened up the whole can of worms.

788
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,316
- At one point I think the original footage

789
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,957
had been leaked out
and then a little while later,

790
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,147
the military officially released it.

791
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,707
That's an amazing step.

792
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:58,567
That's a huge step compared to the last

793
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:00,757
let's say 60, 70 years

794
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,557
where they just say no, no, it's nothing.

795
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,907
We don't know anything.

796
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,857
We don't research that stuff.

797
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,746
Turns out they have been
researching it all along.

798
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,816
They've been keeping tabs
on this stuff from day one.

799
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,665
- And I think that they
were afraid that if they put,

800
00:36:12,748 --> 00:36:15,757
if they put stuff out to the public,

801
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,917
you're also putting it out to our enemies.

802
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,201
You're putting it out to other ya know,

803
00:36:21,284 --> 00:36:24,580
other foreign nationals that might not have

804
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:28,447
our self interest in mind.

805
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:31,297
So I can see why they're
foot draggy about it.

806
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:35,133
I can see why they didn't
want that information out there,

807
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,107
but it's about time.

808
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,306
- I think these tic tac sightings

809
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:40,897
are a huge step in that direction

810
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:44,097
to getting what we call disclosure,

811
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:47,767
of the government saying
yes, here's what we know.

812
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:50,923
Here's what we've got
on file for all of this stuff.

813
00:36:51,006 --> 00:36:53,977
They bleed it out a
little bit at a time to us

814
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,197
but I think there's a lot
more they're not saying.

815
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,040
I know there's a lot
more they're not saying.

816
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:00,847
- Cases where you have multiple sensors

817
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:02,707
that are all picking these things up.

818
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:05,167
So it's not just eyewitnesses

819
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,847
but it's all of these sort of things

820
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:09,387
that are designed to monitor the sky.

821
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:12,427
Ya know 'cause the thing is a delusion,

822
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:16,717
a hallucination can't
bounce radar waves off of it

823
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,417
and it can't show up on an infrared camera.

824
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,117
- Especially near air bases or anywhere

825
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,977
where they have nuclear weapons,

826
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,327
anything of that sort.

827
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,277
Sort of high security areas.

828
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,010
They tend to see that a lot more,

829
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,587
traditionally near missile
silos and things like that.

830
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:34,507
There's been plenty of
cases of anything from

831
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:38,347
just strange lights to
there's been historical cases

832
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:43,327
of having alarms and things being set off

833
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:46,477
or even triggering launch sequences.

834
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,637
There's even been reports of just

835
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,787
not military, necessarily,
but NASA test rockets,

836
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:54,067
test flights, being messed with,

837
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:56,347
seeing lights and seeing
things moving around

838
00:37:56,430 --> 00:38:00,337
the launch site and having
the launch being shut down.

839
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,327
Oh, we didn't do it.

840
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:02,227
We'll keep shutting this off.

841
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:04,477
We'll keep ya know, breaking,

842
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,796
but nobody could figure out what it was

843
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,356
except that it lined up
with these weird lights

844
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,647
in these sightings at the time.

845
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:10,567
- It's very difficult, I'd say.

846
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:12,457
It's very difficult to do that with the,

847
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,767
at least the physics that we have,

848
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:17,437
but that's what makes
them interesting, right?

849
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,917
So the analogy that I would make is if,

850
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,000
if these are alien, they
are interstellar in origin,

851
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:31,117
then it's kind of like
the level of technology

852
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,817
that you would need to
do what I just described,

853
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:38,677
colonize the whole galaxy,
possible but very advanced.

854
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,677
Advanced enough, in fact,
that I would harken back

855
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,924
to Arthur C. Clarke's old quote,

856
00:38:45,007 --> 00:38:46,784
"any sufficiently advanced technology

857
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:49,023
"is indistinguishable from magic."

858
00:38:49,106 --> 00:38:53,077
It would be a little bit like
magic in the sense that,

859
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,087
ya know, if you sent a nuclear reactor

860
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:58,177
back to Victorian England,
that would really be

861
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,427
magic to them, ya know?

862
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,647
'Cause they don't understand.

863
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:06,337
That would've been before
Marie curie sort of figured out

864
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:09,487
radium and figured out ya know,

865
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:12,097
it wouldn't make any sense.

866
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:15,727
One signifier of
extraterrestrial technology

867
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,557
that got here from another star system

868
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,447
should be that it doesn't make sense to us.

869
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:21,903
It shouldn't make sense to us.

870
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:25,687
- I mean, yeah.

871
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:28,267
I mean, there's some
stuff I don't necessarily

872
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:30,991
like to say or talk about just because

873
00:39:31,074 --> 00:39:34,297
I don't like to give definitive answers

874
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:37,537
and I also like, with cases
I've personally worked,

875
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,366
I don't like to talk too
much about it because

876
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:41,353
these are private citizens
that may or may not have said,

877
00:39:41,377 --> 00:39:43,205
"hey, you can talk
about this or you can't."

878
00:39:43,288 --> 00:39:46,724
When you file a report,
there is a box that says,

879
00:39:46,807 --> 00:39:47,976
"do you wanna remain anonymous?"

880
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,617
Do you want to keep this stuff quiet

881
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,577
or do you care?

882
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,467
There's a thing for that.

883
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:55,930
I just assume, even if they don't care,

884
00:39:56,013 --> 00:39:59,324
I don't like to say that,

885
00:39:59,407 --> 00:40:01,514
"oh, this lady from this specific town

886
00:40:01,597 --> 00:40:03,937
"on this specific day saw this thing."

887
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,526
Because people will
put two and two together.

888
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:07,777
They'll figure out that was Mary Jane

889
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:10,957
who lived in ya know,
Las Vegas, and she's a...

890
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,696
They'll figure that out
and maybe that person

891
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,620
doesn't want anybody to know about it.

892
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,757
So, I tend to shy away
from giving too much detail

893
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:23,287
on ya know, actual real
cases I've worked personally.

894
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:25,507
- Ya know, there's a few different reasons.

895
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,477
The subject was stigmatized
but it was more stigmatized

896
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,017
from the standpoint
of most of the scientists

897
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,726
involved in the search for life, obviously,

898
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:36,367
would tell you yeah,
there's probably life out there

899
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:37,327
or else they wouldn't be spending

900
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:38,737
their careers on it, right?

901
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:43,820
But the idea was ya
know, it's very difficult for

902
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:47,137
interstellar travel is really hard.

903
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:50,677
And why would the aliens
come here to just sort of

904
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:55,760
show up and hover over
some dude's farm in Kentucky

905
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,387
and abduct a few cattle.

906
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:01,087
Or you've heard the old
stereotype about UFOs.

907
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:02,713
You know about it.

908
00:41:02,796 --> 00:41:04,657
So, that was a big part of it.

909
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,817
I think another thing is that UFOs

910
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:12,877
are very difficult thing to
study with the scientific method

911
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,957
because you can't predict
when a UFO is gonna show up.

912
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,437
So, if I wanted to
observe a star, let's say,

913
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,687
I could train my telescope on it

914
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:25,087
and I know that that star's
gonna be there tomorrow.

915
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:27,007
So I could train my telescope on it again.

916
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:29,887
So I can reproduce whatever I find.

917
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:32,677
UFOs, you don't know
when one's gonna show up.

918
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,527
You can't set up an observation station,

919
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:39,397
an experiment and
everything, because it's not,

920
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,987
it's completely unpredictable.

921
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:44,406
It's very difficult to sort
of get repeated tests.

922
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,477
- This is one case
that's just kind of a really

923
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,297
interesting straight ahead UFO case.

924
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:59,051
MUFON case number 95355.

925
00:41:59,134 --> 00:42:02,407
Kinda blows me away and I do, ya know,

926
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:04,447
keep in touch with the main witness.

927
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:06,727
Witness and two friends
were on a weekend camping

928
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:10,016
fishing trip at lake
silverwood near big bear.

929
00:42:10,099 --> 00:42:12,727
Driving in a rural area,
the witness observed

930
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:14,497
a bright Amber light that was flying

931
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:17,009
silently and low in the distance.

932
00:42:17,092 --> 00:42:19,837
The object, he noticed
that the object didn't have

933
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,117
proper FAA lights on it,

934
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,397
so the witness pulled his
truck over to the shoulder

935
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,977
and all three witnesses
got out of the truck.

936
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,260
They were all leaning up
against the bumper of the truck

937
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:32,947
watching as the object slowly
approached their position.

938
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:36,187
As the object approached,
it resolved into an object

939
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:38,947
which the witness described
as a black boomerang

940
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:42,157
wedge-like shape, like a giant pair of

941
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,257
wraparound sunglasses.

942
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:46,537
By the way, I'll mention
that the main witness

943
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:49,417
of this case is an aerospace engineer

944
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,267
working for a major aerospace company.

945
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:55,927
All three witnesses could
hear a low humming sound.

946
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:58,357
We could feel it in our bones and our feet.

947
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,466
It was quite uncomfortable.

948
00:43:00,549 --> 00:43:03,127
The witness's friend said that he made sure

949
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:05,227
the truck engine was turned off

950
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:07,327
as he had heard that UFOs can cause

951
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:10,777
car electrical problems and
cause an electrical system

952
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:12,007
to burn out.

953
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:12,847
And that's true.

954
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:14,917
We've seen that from case to case.

955
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,227
The witness states that
the object had four visible

956
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:19,957
decks on either side facing him

957
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,987
that he could actually
see backlit silhouettes of

958
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:25,777
either people or possibly beings

959
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:28,777
standing or walking on four louvered decks

960
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:31,597
which were visible behind a giant window

961
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,487
or what looked like a giant window,

962
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:35,317
which encased the front of the craft.

963
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,447
I'm guessing it was
some kind of a force field

964
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:39,844
or some material that we don't or,

965
00:43:39,927 --> 00:43:41,707
don't know about.

966
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:43,717
As the object passed over the witness,

967
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,547
he could see four panels on the back

968
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:48,247
which had the look of electronic snow

969
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:50,587
like you see on a old television set

970
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,537
that's between channels.

971
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:55,387
And I've heard this in other cases too

972
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:57,277
where there's a propulsion system seen

973
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,377
and it looked almost like the snow

974
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:01,537
that you'll see on a television.

975
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:03,967
The witness states the
craft continued heading

976
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:06,667
on it's original trajectory
until it was finally

977
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:10,387
lost to their sight at the
visual vanishing point.

978
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:13,657
The witness who was on the
camping trip with his friends,

979
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:15,877
he worked as a lab technician doing

980
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,367
electroplating of circuitry boards

981
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:22,087
that were used exclusively
in aerospace work.

982
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:24,041
Guy as sharp as a tack.

983
00:44:24,124 --> 00:44:26,707
No reason to make this story up.

984
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:27,967
Here's some of his interview.

985
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:29,714
He said, "I've never seen anything like

986
00:44:29,797 --> 00:44:31,574
"what we witnessed that Sunday.

987
00:44:31,657 --> 00:44:32,504
"We all saw it.

988
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:34,754
"My best friend who passed away last year

989
00:44:34,837 --> 00:44:36,014
"was there as well.

990
00:44:36,097 --> 00:44:38,534
"He didn't want to report this even though

991
00:44:38,617 --> 00:44:41,864
"we did know about MUFON
when we had our sighting.

992
00:44:41,947 --> 00:44:44,444
"But John recently passed
away which freed me up

993
00:44:44,527 --> 00:44:47,384
"to finally put in a
sighting report about this.

994
00:44:47,467 --> 00:44:49,784
"I don't know if it's
ours or if it's theirs

995
00:44:49,867 --> 00:44:51,614
"but I'm hoping that you can help me

996
00:44:51,697 --> 00:44:54,997
"because it looked like
a flying aircraft carrier."

997
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,557
I interviewed the witness.

998
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,127
It says here, you know, I
interviewed him thoroughly

999
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:02,347
three times over four months.

1000
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:03,997
A witness never changed his story,

1001
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,273
never embellished on what he had said.

1002
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:09,607
What I'll do when I speak with somebody,

1003
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:14,137
like in this case, there was
only one main witness left.

1004
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,447
So I'll kinda cold call the person

1005
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:19,357
and have them repeat so that ya know,

1006
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,692
you know if somebody's
reading from a piece of paper

1007
00:45:21,775 --> 00:45:24,817
or if they're embellishing
or making something up

1008
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:27,490
or if they're telling you
something from memory.

1009
00:45:27,573 --> 00:45:30,547
This guy had just all the
emotions that you would have

1010
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:33,063
if you had seen something
amazing like that.

1011
00:45:34,861 --> 00:45:36,644
He said, "we were all talking to each other

1012
00:45:36,727 --> 00:45:37,807
"about what we were seeing.

1013
00:45:37,867 --> 00:45:41,234
"We were excited and scared
as well as you could imagine.

1014
00:45:41,317 --> 00:45:43,574
"We could see columns from deck to deck

1015
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:44,984
"and on the most upper deck,

1016
00:45:45,067 --> 00:45:47,924
"we could see humanoid
figures moving around.

1017
00:45:48,007 --> 00:45:50,444
"We were saying things
like look at that guy.

1018
00:45:50,527 --> 00:45:52,364
"Is he driving that thing or what?

1019
00:45:52,447 --> 00:45:55,244
"It looked like somebody
was shining a light

1020
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:58,627
"up at it like the UFO
that was seen in China."

1021
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:01,447
There was a similar
sighting that was seen in

1022
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:04,724
Beijing airport a few years ago.

1023
00:46:04,807 --> 00:46:06,644
"Everything around us
seemed to be crackling

1024
00:46:06,727 --> 00:46:08,984
"and I could feel my insides humming.

1025
00:46:09,067 --> 00:46:10,753
"Thinking of it now, I'm really glad that I

1026
00:46:10,777 --> 00:46:12,854
"turned off my truck.

1027
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:14,774
"As we were looking
at the back of the craft,

1028
00:46:14,857 --> 00:46:16,844
"there were four boxes that were louvered

1029
00:46:16,927 --> 00:46:20,594
"and they shimmered like a
road on a hot summer day.

1030
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:23,834
"The boxes looked like a TV
when there's no channels on.

1031
00:46:23,917 --> 00:46:27,134
"Black and gray from
top to bottom of the craft.

1032
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:29,294
"When I worked in aircraft, I was once in

1033
00:46:29,377 --> 00:46:33,134
"the world's largest building
in Everett, Washington.

1034
00:46:33,217 --> 00:46:35,204
"I was aircraft hangar there

1035
00:46:35,287 --> 00:46:36,764
"and this would not fit in there.

1036
00:46:36,847 --> 00:46:39,554
"The ceiling would've
collapsed with all the structures

1037
00:46:39,637 --> 00:46:42,187
"having to be removed to fit it in."

1038
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:44,017
The way that I closed this case was,

1039
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,627
I said witness was to the point, lucid.

1040
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:48,787
He never diverted from
his original interview

1041
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:50,197
and his statements.

1042
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,267
He recounted his experience from memory

1043
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:55,417
and never stumbled around
in recounting his sighting

1044
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,687
as if recalling a remembered incident.

1045
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:01,057
Witness has worked for
many years as a technician

1046
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:04,117
in the aerospace industry
having originally worked

1047
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,897
in electroplating components
at his grandfather's company.

1048
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:10,297
Considering the witnesses
background in aerospace

1049
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:13,297
and the witnesses composure
and the levels of emotion

1050
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:15,007
while describing his sighting to me

1051
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:18,487
during the four methodical
interviews I conducted with him,

1052
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:20,225
I believe the witness was describing

1053
00:47:20,308 --> 00:47:23,677
a remembered event
that he could not explain.

1054
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,087
And I closed this as a
unknown aerial vehicle, a UFO.

1055
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:30,607
That's one of my favorite UFO cases.

1056
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:34,993
It's just no abduction,
no beings except possibly,

1057
00:47:35,076 --> 00:47:38,917
ya know, and I wonder
what this was, ya know?

1058
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,759
Could it have been time travelers?

1059
00:47:40,842 --> 00:47:43,447
Was that us from the future, ya know?

1060
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:47,047
It has kind of a human craft look to it.

1061
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:49,237
Ya know, the aircraft carrier thing.

1062
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,547
I could kinda see that, ya know?

1063
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:53,407
In his illustration.

1064
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:55,897
But certainly, I don't think it's something

1065
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,427
that we have now.

1066
00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:00,101
Or if it is, it's quite secretive.

1067
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,036
- Ya know, I've been
told time and time again

1068
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,386
that ya know, the more you do this,

1069
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:07,867
the more involved you
get with UFO research.

1070
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:09,817
You tend to start having those experiences

1071
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:12,727
like you somehow, you pop
up on their radar somehow,

1072
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:13,957
whoever they are.

1073
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,567
They realize you're interested
and you're poking around,

1074
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:19,297
so they poke back eventually.

1075
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:21,007
I haven't had that happen yet.

1076
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:22,327
It's a little frightening.

1077
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:25,177
Depending on the degree
of poking that's being done.

1078
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:29,035
But I do wanna experience that for myself.

1079
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:34,417
- If anybody out there,
if you've had an affinity

1080
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,577
for the things that I've been talking about

1081
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:38,749
and you'd like to do this yourself,

1082
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:40,987
it's not only very possible.

1083
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:43,087
It's pretty easy to do.

1084
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:46,237
You just apply yourself, read the book,

1085
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:50,527
take the test, and then
you start getting cases

1086
00:48:50,610 --> 00:48:53,137
and we mentor you at first.

1087
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:56,317
You know, we have a
mentorship program that we do

1088
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,737
that kinda gets people up
to square when they first join

1089
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:01,237
and before you know it,

1090
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:04,319
you're going out on cases.

1091
00:49:04,402 --> 00:49:09,402
90 to 95 percentage of
cases are prosaic objects

1092
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:11,977
that people misidentified.

1093
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:16,177
But that five to 10
percent that I can't explain,

1094
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:19,747
that's what keeps me going
and keeps me doing this

1095
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:21,097
day in and day out.

1096
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:23,401
I don't foresee a time in my life

1097
00:49:23,484 --> 00:49:25,357
where I won't be doing this.

1098
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,257
I've got the bug.

1099
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:29,557
I love it and you can do it too.

1100
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,356
- And that's kinda the
point of it too is that

1101
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:34,537
MUFON's a safe place
to submit these reports.

1102
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:36,817
You can absolutely do it
anonymously if you want.

1103
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,346
You don't have to give
your personal information

1104
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:39,547
if you don't want to.

1105
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:41,107
You can check the box that says

1106
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:42,575
keep my name out of this.

1107
00:49:42,658 --> 00:49:44,617
Don't contact me.

1108
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:45,876
I'm just giving you this information

1109
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,437
because someone needs it.

1110
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,237
Absolutely free to do that.

1111
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,070
You know the old saying,

1112
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,487
I want to believe.

1113
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:52,320
That's me.

1114
00:49:52,403 --> 00:49:54,997
- I think that's really what
it's all about in the end.

1115
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:58,567
It seems to be working now because ya know,

1116
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:02,977
I've got a team working
under me and I've got ya know,

1117
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:06,402
speaking engagements
and I get to tell people

1118
00:50:06,485 --> 00:50:10,747
about this amazing
phenomena which is like magic

1119
00:50:10,830 --> 00:50:12,397
but real, ya know?

1120
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,807
And I love it.

1121
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:14,890
I love it.

1122
00:50:14,962 --> 00:50:18,214
There's no way I'll ever not be doing this.
