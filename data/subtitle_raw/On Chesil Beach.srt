1
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:42,072
So, we're in E.

2
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:43,991
- The tonic.
- No, E.

3
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,242
All right, E.

4
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:48,496
So, four bars of that,
you know the sort of thing,

5
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,952
"Woke up this morning,
head felt so bad,"

6
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,036
then into A.

7
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,120
The sub-dominant.

8
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,794
"Woke up this morning,
head felt so bad."

9
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,500
Same thing,
different chord, see.

10
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,381
Hmm. Tricky.

11
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:00,461
Then back to E again...

12
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:06,806
Then, this is the emotional punch,
it reaches right up to B.

13
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:08,849
Ah. The dominant.

14
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,430
And he says
something like,

15
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:13,267
"Gonna tell that two-timin' woman,"
back through A,

16
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,773
you know,
"she's driving me mad"

17
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,605
and then this lovely little thing,
the turnaround on B seventh...

18
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,694
Minor seventh
might be better.

19
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,867
And that
brings you back to E.

20
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,326
- And am I?
- What?

21
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:25,494
Driving you mad.

22
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,663
Well, actually, yes.

23
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,296
<i>The Prime Minister,
Sir Harold Macmillan,</i>

24
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,093
<i>has been holding talks
in Washington</i>

25
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:44,013
<i>with the United States
president, Mr. John Kennedy.</i>

26
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,968
<i>The principal subject of their discussion
was a proposed test ban treaty...</i>

27
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,313
Not tonight. Thank you.

28
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:01,565
Perfect.

29
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,566
Now listen!

30
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,119
Nice microtones...

31
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,035
A load of sick bloody cats.

32
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,788
I'd rather have your lot.

33
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:26,306
I really don't mind,
if you want that Hank person.

34
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,507
Or is it Elvis?

35
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,101
Chuck Berry.

36
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:34,435
It's all right, he's gone,
he's had it.

37
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:35,982
Honestly, you can,
I think it's...

38
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,189
He's quite...

39
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:44,282
- Quite what?
- Well, sort of merry.

40
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,866
Chuck Berry?

41
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:48,365
What else?

42
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:51,114
And, you know, bouncy.

43
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,666
Do you know,

44
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:57,962
I think you must be the squarest
person in all of western civilization.

45
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,079
But you love me.

46
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:00,673
Therefore, I love you.

47
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,308
You know, Florence,
it was beautiful.

48
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,272
Nothing went wrong!

49
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,016
Even my mother behaved herself.

50
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,150
Do you think she knew
what was happening?

51
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,908
I don't know.
Perhaps she did.

52
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,406
Poor Edward...

53
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,168
Steady.

54
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,222
Get it.

55
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,762
Bastard.

56
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:58,226
Now, give it here.

57
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,452
Listen, I've decided.

58
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:14,030
If we have a girl,
she'll be called Chloe.

59
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,618
Chloe.

60
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,457
Yes, it's beautiful.

61
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,596
Damn. Ignore it.

62
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,313
You ought to look.

63
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,534
Evening, sir.
Dinner what you ordered.

64
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:53,702
Not this early...

65
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,043
Ma'am.

66
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,711
- Careful.
- Sir.

67
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,468
Uh, no, perhaps...

68
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:15,849
- The windows closed a bit.
- Sir.

69
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,510
- Not that much.
- Oh, right you are.

70
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,095
A bit more.
Yeah, that's it. Thank you.

71
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,305
- And push the curtains back.
- Certainly, sir.

72
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,851
Just push the curtain...

73
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,017
- Facing each other.
- Yes, sir.

74
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:26,985
- The chairs.
- Ah.

75
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:44,958
It's very good actually.

76
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,630
Thank you
very much, sir.

77
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,315
Are you...

78
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,615
Are you going to stand there
the whole time?

79
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:16,740
Uh, we do the silver service
on the beef, sir,

80
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,789
and then we all retire.

81
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:20,997
Oh.

82
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:25,787
I love you.

83
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,083
And I...

84
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,965
Thank you.

85
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,270
You ever feel the need
for anything, sir,

86
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,814
just, uh, pull
on the string. Hard.

87
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,313
And have
a very nice one, sir.

88
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,529
Uh, yes.

89
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:53,940
Good night.

90
00:08:58,747 --> 00:08:59,908
Oh.

91
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,077
Yes.

92
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,701
Sorry.

93
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:08,787
Thank you.

94
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,926
Girls. Girls, can you come down?
I need your help.

95
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,253
Oh, God...

96
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,597
In the garden, please.

97
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,099
- Marjorie.
- She was up there.

98
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,266
- She could hear me.
- Harriet.

99
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:06,262
- That's all right.
- Come on, Harriet, Dad wants us.

100
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,604
In the garden, quickly.

101
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,852
She could understand me.
She was listening to me.

102
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,731
I know, I know. But she would
also listen to you with your clothes on.

103
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,562
No, but she needs
the connection.

104
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:18,194
The nights are shorter now,
so she doesn't sleep so much.

105
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,570
But she won't
come down.

106
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:20,988
No. She'll never
come down.

107
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,158
We're quite safe.

108
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:26,248
Marjorie Mayhew.
You'll get me thrown in prison.

109
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,333
Girls, help Mum
get dressed.

110
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,705
Come on, Mum.

111
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,837
Do you know, as you walk
that way along the beach,

112
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,339
the stones get bigger.

113
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,040
Yes?

114
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:23,674
Well, over thousands of years storms
have sort of graded the pebbles.

115
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:27,260
So, when local fishermen
come ashore at night

116
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,969
they can tell exactly
where they are.

117
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,476
That's the story, anyway.

118
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,442
We could go back out there.

119
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,396
- You don't mean now.
- Why not?

120
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,439
Take the wine,
some fruit.

121
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,274
It won't get dark
for a long time.

122
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,155
Yes, but I'm not sure we
could just leave all this...

123
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,571
I'm not awfully hungry
after that lunch.

124
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,405
Yes, but Flo, they've gone to a
lot of trouble. We can't just...

125
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,037
I know, but it looks
so beautiful out there...

126
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,335
But we're here...

127
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,255
In here...

128
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,417
And you're so beautiful.

129
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,921
I keep thinking
how beautiful you are, and...

130
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,924
I suppose you're right.
I mean, about...

131
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,505
Oh, God.

132
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,178
Look, sorry. I...
Am I being a bully?

133
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,431
Of course, you're not.

134
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,764
You know what,

135
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,980
I could get them to bring back
that plate warmer thingy.

136
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,356
And we could go out
for as long as you like.

137
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,812
No, I'm just being silly.

138
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,148
Honestly, Edward, I don't think I
could bear to have them back in here.

139
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,358
It won't take a minute.
It's no trouble at all...

140
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:24,609
Edward, please, no!

141
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,159
God...

142
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:32,787
We're having
our first row.

143
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:36,204
- Florence, we're not.
- We are. Because I'm being selfish.

144
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,338
Honestly, we're not.
You're not being selfish.

145
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,585
We are, we are.

146
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,542
And it's all
my stupid fault.

147
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,887
And what are they saying,
your Aldermaston lot,

148
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:51,890
about this wonderful wall
in Berlin last month?

149
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,721
Bit awkward for the lefties,
isn't it?

150
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,556
We hate it. Everyone hates it.

151
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:59,527
An entire country turned into a prison camp,
with the Soviet's blessing.

152
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,898
A proud day for socialism.

153
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:03,280
- How was school?
- A million Russian troops

154
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:04,740
- spread along the border.
- All right.

155
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,237
What do you think
prevents them

156
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,569
from sending their tanks
across the north German plain?

157
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:09,744
Common sense,
I should think.

158
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:14,082
Common sense? Nonsense!
It's the bomb, the one you want to ban.

159
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:17,628
Communism, as it proudly proclaims,
is an expansionist creed.

160
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:22,041
It's our nuclear bombs that deter them.
It's as simple as that, my dear.

161
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,501
We need a deterrent.

162
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:27,929
Do you remember a couple of months ago I
said I met this chap at a CND meeting?

163
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,425
I've asked him round
tomorrow for tea.

164
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,510
- Chap?
- Is he a beatnik?

165
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:33,593
No.

166
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,055
- Beard and sandals?
- No.

167
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,061
- What does he do?
- He's a beatnik.

168
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:41,189
Shut up. He's like me,
just finished his degree.

169
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,236
- What college?
- UCL.

170
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,780
But darling, that's London.

171
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:48,318
For the sons of tradesmen.
Florence!

172
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,118
They produce
some pretty decent engineers.

173
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:51,779
Well, exactly.

174
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,199
What does his father do?

175
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:58,001
You mean, is he working class
or one of us?

176
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:00,496
Yes. I think that's
more or less what I mean.

177
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,416
His dad's headmaster of a
primary school in Henley.

178
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,425
And what does your young man
intend doing with himself?

179
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,601
I haven't researched
his prospects.

180
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:18,105
I haven't worked out his
precise socioeconomic status.

181
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,400
I haven't arranged to marry him.
I've asked him for tea. For tea.

182
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,357
Jolly good.

183
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:31,114
Pass the new green...
What are we calling them?

184
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,452
Mangetout.

185
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:40,961
I would say it was the day I
bought my first railway ticket.

186
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,038
I must have been 13.

187
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,000
When I joined the queue
my heart was thumping.

188
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,919
I'd rehearsed my lines in the bedroom,
the night before,

189
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,464
like a big speech
in a Shakespeare play.

190
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,470
And then it was my turn and I
said in a tiny shaking voice,

191
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,896
"May I please have
a half single to London?"

192
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,433
Not a single mistake!

193
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:07,108
Then I was walking towards the
barrier with the ticket in my hand

194
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:09,064
and I thought, "This is it.

195
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:13,114
"I've done it, I've joined the big world,
I'm a grown-up!"

196
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,197
Well, mine...

197
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:21,127
It was the time when I learned
what really happened to my mum.

198
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,335
So now we have Holman
Hunt on loan to New York,

199
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,213
Burne Jones on loan
to Edinburgh,

200
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:31,761
so I decided not to move the
Titians or Rubens, as requested.

201
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:35,888
But to bring up from store
two glorious Uccellos...

202
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:39,141
- I don't know Uccello.
- Oh, darling! Glorious.

203
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,723
Uh, a fifteenth-century
pioneer of perspective,

204
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:44,774
- a mathematician in fact...
- Better stand back a bit.

205
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,727
And wonderful at animals.

206
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:50,030
Birds. Landscape.
Trees in their natural color.

207
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,028
You, Lionel, you especially
would love it...

208
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,413
<i>I'd grown up
with the way she was.</i>

209
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,213
<i>Taken her for granted.</i>

210
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:08,882
<i>We all did.</i>

211
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,680
<i>But when he used
this horrible phrase,</i>

212
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,099
<i>everything changed.</i>

213
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,096
Brain-damaged.

214
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,517
Suddenly I saw her
the way other people did.

215
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,278
That must have been awful.

216
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,277
You're always
very kind to her.

217
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,911
My mother just pretends
to be brain-damaged.

218
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,282
Funny thing, it was
a sort of release.

219
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,544
I felt this...

220
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:50,503
This space opening up
around me.

221
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:55,675
She was brain-damaged,
and I wasn't.

222
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,014
I wasn't her,

223
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:00,635
I wasn't my family,
I was me.

224
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:09,110
I felt kind of excited,
like my life had just begun.

225
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:17,655
Ed! Second post.
Looks like the one!

226
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,821
Big moment, eh?

227
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,123
Uh, Terry,
I think I'll...

228
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,660
Tell me tomorrow.
And good luck.

229
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,546
I don't believe it.

230
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:40,348
Mum.

231
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,428
Mum, listen.

232
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:47,847
Are you listening?

233
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,355
This isn't how she looks now.
This is the future.

234
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:54,313
A new thing. A special camera that
tells you how she'll look one day.

235
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,273
This is important.

236
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:58,154
Put that down
for a moment.

237
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:00,695
Listen to me.

238
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,238
I got a first, Mum.

239
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,540
A first class degree.

240
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,126
That's right, son.
I saw you. I was watching.

241
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:12,916
Now you tell me.
Yellow, like this has two things.

242
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,250
A meaning and a number.

243
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,794
Now I know the number...

244
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,797
Seven, Mum.

245
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,303
Seven.

246
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:24,972
I can't remember
the meaning.

247
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,020
- Anne?
- Up here.

248
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:36,939
- Harriet?
- What?

249
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,995
Anne, Harriet,
I got a first.

250
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,585
- Is that good?
- It's the best.

251
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:51,999
Dad'll be happy then.

252
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,751
- When's he back?
- 8:00.

253
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,087
- 9:00.
- 9:00.

254
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,670
You two should be outside.
It's beautiful.

255
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:02,097
- Too hot.
- Too boring.

256
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:11,853
<i>Hello. Is Toby there?</i>

257
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,859
<i>Uh, when are you
expecting him?</i>

258
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,902
<i>Oh.</i>

259
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,481
<i>Mrs. Davenport?</i>

260
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,988
<i>Edward Mayhew,
a university friend of Henry's.</i>

261
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,068
<i>Is he there?</i>

262
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,071
Finland?

263
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,637
Just consider it
for a moment, Florence.

264
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:32,768
If it fell on St. Giles,
the crater would be half a mile across,

265
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:33,847
a hundred feet deep,

266
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:36,558
and the city would be
uninhabitable for a thousand years

267
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,314
because the radioactivity...

268
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:39,520
Hello.

269
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:41,692
Hello.

270
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,241
Would you like one?

271
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,613
It's all about a hydrogen
bomb landing on Oxford.

272
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,830
Can't think
of anything better.

273
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,744
Do you mind
if I tell you something?

274
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,213
- I've got to tell someone.
- Tell me.

275
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,963
I say, do we know you?

276
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,008
I just heard, I got a first

277
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,090
in history.

278
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:09,425
That's fantastic.

279
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,010
Let's get on with handing these out,
shall we?

280
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:14,645
All right.

281
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,977
So, it's a series
of history books,

282
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,233
not about the great men,

283
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:25,066
but about the minor
figures at their side,

284
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:28,326
the bit-part players
who fade away.

285
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:32,782
Like the man who rode non-stop
from London to Edinburgh

286
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,583
to tell the king of Scotland
that Elizabeth was dead

287
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,581
and he was now
the king of England.

288
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,921
I think that's a brilliant idea.

289
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,834
I thought everything would be clear
as soon as my result came through.

290
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,044
But it isn't.

291
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:47,258
I'm still just
hanging around.

292
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:48,384
Like me.

293
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:54,269
I could play in this awful dance
orchestra in a hotel near Slough.

294
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:56,938
But what I really want
is to work with my quartet.

295
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:58,602
What's that?

296
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:02,318
Two violins,
viola, cello.

297
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,270
We're called
the Ennismore Quartet.

298
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:07,657
Then Daddy would have to support me,
and he and I don't exactly...

299
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:08,984
What did you get?

300
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:10,860
What?

301
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:13,033
In your music degree.

302
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,704
Well, actually,
same as you.

303
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,003
To Miss Florence...

304
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,341
Uh...

305
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:30,505
Ponting.

306
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,766
To Miss Florence Ponting.

307
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:37,395
In acknowledgment
of your fine achievement.

308
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:40,057
Well done.

309
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,314
Thank you.

310
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,508
Florence, look...

311
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:19,888
I love you.

312
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,519
And you're so...

313
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:28,067
Uh...

314
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:40,750
I mean,
I need to kiss you.

315
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,355
I love you, too.

316
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,319
And I...

317
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:14,901
I...

318
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:17,662
What is it, darling?

319
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,621
Nothing.

320
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,275
Edward...

321
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:50,278
- What?
- Sorry.

322
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,114
What is it?

323
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,991
Well...

324
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,119
I just thought...

325
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:04,368
You know, it isn't awfully
comfortable here when we could...

326
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:09,748
Oh, you... you mean...

327
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:15,428
Yes, of course, let's...

328
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:20,429
Come on then.

329
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:59,923
If I just take
this off then...

330
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:04,261
Well, we could go
on the bed and...

331
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:08,473
Well...

332
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:13,854
Then, I think I'll...
My shoes.

333
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,531
I'll do it.

334
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:19,863
It'd be better.

335
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,978
So, come on.
Why do you love him?

336
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:57,155
One. Aren't you going
to take notes?

337
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:03,487
One, he's not like
anyone else.

338
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,789
- No one is.
- Mmm. You'd be surprised.

339
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,117
Two,

340
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,919
he always has a history book in
his pocket and a pencil stub.

341
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,000
Three,

342
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:22,298
he knows the names of trees and
flowers and constellations.

343
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,262
And he wears plimsolls,
never shoes.

344
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,969
- And his socks never match.
- Exactly.

345
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:31,936
And he doesn't know the difference
between a croissant and a baguette.

346
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:36,065
- That's why I love him!
- And do you know what Mummy called him?

347
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:37,979
God. What?

348
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,190
I heard her on the phone
to Iris Murdoch.

349
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:43,868
And she said he was
a bit of a country bumpkin!

350
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,205
That's him.

351
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,207
You set eyes on me for the first time...

352
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:56,836
And I saw a man who wasn't
wearing a jacket.

353
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,508
- What then?
- Loose shirt,

354
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:02,049
sleeves rolled up
to the elbows,

355
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:04,756
- tails hanging out.
- Pfft. Nonsense.

356
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,304
<i>Trousers with a mend in the knee,</i>

357
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:11,392
and long hair,
almost over your ears.

358
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:13,356
What else?

359
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:16,435
All right.

360
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:22,194
I liked the way you stopped
in the doorway

361
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,486
and looked around at everyone
as if you owned the place.

362
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:28,617
Proud.

363
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,332
No, I mean, bold.

364
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:34,752
I just needed
to tell someone,

365
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:36,879
anyone, that I'd got
a first.

366
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,799
Then you saw me
and decided to stare me out.

367
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:42,969
You glanced at me and decided
I wasn't worth a second look.

368
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,777
Did you think then
it was love at first sight?

369
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,383
Well?

370
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,970
Actually, I'm beginning
to think it was.

371
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:58,370
It'll do for now.

372
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:17,017
What's this?

373
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:18,188
Quintet?

374
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,349
You said I should decide
on the next piece...

375
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:22,026
But it means getting in
another viola.

376
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:23,728
Another person. It's going
to change everything.

377
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,779
- It's too soon.
- Say hello to Elsbeth,

378
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:27,528
in her third year,
awfully good.

379
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,526
Hello.

380
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,157
- Hello.
- Hello.

381
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,588
Right then, we'll begin.
Charles, your big moment.

382
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,921
So I see.

383
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,890
Take it a little slower
than marked.

384
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,514
Again.

385
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:03,851
It's tender.
Like a question.

386
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,812
It's a series
of questions.

387
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,674
People think you're shy,

388
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:35,262
but the fact is you're rather tough, aren't you?

389
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:36,433
Can I buy you that drink?

390
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:40,225
Oh, I'm late for work.

391
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:58,372
All artists
to the green room, please.

392
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,791
One minute please, Florence.

393
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,927
Use the wrist,
Florence.

394
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:42,309
Half a turn each time,
it's not that complicated.

395
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:14,735
Do you want
to know a secret?

396
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:17,980
Yes.

397
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,490
Actually, I'm
a little bit scared.

398
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,158
I think I am, too.

399
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,744
- I could...
- Ugh. Just...

400
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,446
For God's sake,
Florence, just hold still.

401
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:12,122
Turn around.

402
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,761
- Please don't tear it...
- Oh, bloody hell!

403
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:29,093
Such a clumsy idiot.
I can't even do the simplest thing. A zip!

404
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,263
There's something
wrong with me.

405
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:39,229
Look, let's sit
on the bed.

406
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,869
You get so cross
sometimes.

407
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,626
- You look like you want to hit someone.
- Do I?

408
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:02,961
Your face goes
quite frightening.

409
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,554
Tell me something.

410
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:18,275
- You have beautiful legs and...
- No, not that. Not about me.

411
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:22,313
"With my body
I thee worship..."

412
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:25,529
You used to get into fights,
didn't you? You told me.

413
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,577
Tell me about the last time
you got in a fight.

414
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,163
Ugh. It was terrible.
You don't want to hear about that.

415
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,330
I do.

416
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:35,375
I need to know
your worst side.

417
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:40,293
All right.

418
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:48,841
Well, it was
in my final year.

419
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,516
Saturday night.
I went to the Hundred Club.

420
00:37:57,317 --> 00:38:00,776
<i>I was there with this chap,
cleverest person in our year,</i>

421
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:03,855
<i>I have no idea what he was doing there.
He hated loud music.</i>

422
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:10,782
- Susie's tits are bigger.
- Lucy's tits aren't so big.

423
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:13,239
If you want to go all the way with
a girl in the History department...

424
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:14,990
Or the English
department...

425
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,700
First you've got
to meet her parents.

426
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,331
And then you've got to marry her.

427
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,502
I think I'll head off.

428
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:21,626
Late night meeting
of the Philosophy Society.

429
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:25,126
Philosophy.
Uh, that's great. I... I'll come with you.

430
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:30,552
<i>I really admired Harold and,
uh, wanted him to take me seriously.</i>

431
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:33,016
<i>And the point about
Gabriel Marcel is this.</i>

432
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:37,058
As individuals, we're all seeking
harmony in our transient lives

433
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:40,482
and we find it through what he
called secondary reflection.

434
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,185
The key idea being that
philosophical inquiry

435
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,737
was based on wonder
and astonishment,

436
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,611
and being open to the
presence of others.

437
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,408
Jewboy!

438
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:51,702
What did you just say?

439
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:53,154
Edward, don't.

440
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:02,671
Someone call the police!

441
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,462
Oh, my God, look what
you've done to him!

442
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:09,928
You brute!
You mad or something? Really!

443
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,389
<i>He avoided me after that.</i>

444
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:13,966
Call an ambulance!

445
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,471
<i>He never
spoke to me again.</i>

446
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:20,064
My dad says things about Jews.
Drives me nuts.

447
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,478
Why do you think
he never spoke to you again?

448
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:27,234
I think
he was ashamed of me.

449
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:30,107
I'd always been in fights.

450
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:33,365
In playgrounds,
or outside pubs after kicking-out time.

451
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:35,787
Edward!
So dangerous and stupid.

452
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:37,331
People said
I was good at it.

453
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,037
I was proud of myself.

454
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,373
And then?

455
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:45,043
And then I didn't want to be a
prize-fighting yokel anymore.

456
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:46,999
I wanted to be cool,
like Harold.

457
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:49,176
You are.

458
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:53,593
And now you've got to promise your wife.
No more fights. Ever.

459
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:56,842
Promise.

460
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,271
Can I ask you
something?

461
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:13,700
I want to take
your stockings off.

462
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,117
Well, I think
I'd better do it.

463
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:56,910
So brown.

464
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:00,614
It was that day
I walked from Henley.

465
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:35,820
One mile.

466
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:44,075
Wicket will want rolling
again before tomorrow.

467
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,750
It'll be done,
Mr. Rammage.

468
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:09,524
Florence!

469
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:23,326
How did you get here?
How long have you...

470
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:25,783
I took the train to Henley
and walked through the woods.

471
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:27,960
I had a map.
Didn't get lost once.

472
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,419
Seven miles.

473
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,039
And then I ate an orange
by the wall near the church,

474
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:33,874
looking down
across the valley

475
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,675
and checked the map
and I thought,

476
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:40,806
"He's only one mile away now,
and I've never been so happy in my life."

477
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,102
- Straight.
- Sorry.

478
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:01,985
Whoo!

479
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:05,284
No!

480
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,417
- Was that good?
- It was good.

481
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:12,208
- Did I do a good job?
- Yes.

482
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,752
- You happy?
- Very.

483
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,543
Good.

484
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:26,350
Work to do.

485
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,017
There! Did you see it?

486
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:35,648
Yellowhammer?

487
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,650
No! It was going fast
and low over there.

488
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:39,902
Greenfinch?

489
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:42,905
Sparrowhawk.

490
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,489
Honestly, Florence,
the only ones you ever get right are robins.

491
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,198
And blackbirds.

492
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:51,372
What am I
to do with you?

493
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:57,375
Come on. This way.

494
00:43:58,344 --> 00:43:59,676
Almost home.

495
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,024
Florence, she won't
remember you.

496
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:24,990
You say that every time.
She might one day.

497
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:28,114
But she can list every
painting in the Ashmolean.

498
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:57,689
Marjorie, hello,
it's Florence.

499
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,187
I've come to see you.

500
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:02,898
Me? Why me?
I've done nothing wrong.

501
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:40,352
I've brought you something interesting.
From the museum.

502
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:41,812
We talked about it before.

503
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:43,989
You told me things
I never knew.

504
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:47,527
Oh! Uccello.
<i>The Hunt in the Forest.</i>

505
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:49,657
It's his last.

506
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:51,621
Look at that perspective.

507
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,323
You told me that
when he was young

508
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:56,702
he painted his fields blue
in protest at the boring food.

509
00:45:56,796 --> 00:46:01,211
Yes, Vasari says the Abbot gave him cheese
soup followed by cheese pie every day!

510
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:06,086
I thought we could paint it,
make a copy together.

511
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:08,923
A forgery!

512
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,348
I'll make some tea.

513
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:04,065
There are
two more in here.

514
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:08,490
Sprouting, but they'll do.
Peel 'em and chuck 'em in.

515
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:10,483
Then we're going to do
something about this floor.

516
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:11,819
Is there a bucket or...

517
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:14,620
- Florence! Florence!
- Florence! Florence!

518
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:16,323
We've got something
to show you.

519
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:17,783
- Come in here.
- Florence.

520
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:20,126
Florence!

521
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,218
It's beautiful.

522
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,187
It really is.

523
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:41,940
We helped.
I did some green.

524
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:44,143
So did I.
And brown.

525
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,611
- But it was Mum.
- It was truly Mum.

526
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:50,615
In Uccello the horses
know everything.

527
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,863
They were wild once, you see,
but they've swapped sides.

528
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:54,577
They're with the hunters now.

529
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:57,371
They feel guilty.
You can see it in their eyes.

530
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:00,538
Beautiful.

531
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:03,332
Good old Mum.

532
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:04,921
We love you,
Florence.

533
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:11,219
- Come on, Edward. Lots to do.
- Thank you.

534
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:25,020
Isn't that Florence
a lovely girl?

535
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:28,937
Is she the one
who gives me a bath?

536
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:32,824
No, sweetheart.
Edward's friend.

537
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,866
Anne,
can you put the spoons on the table, please?

538
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,326
All right.

539
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:45,754
Harriet, right over there.
And the spoons go next to the knife.

540
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:49,799
Marjorie, do you want
to come and sit down?

541
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:51,422
Yes, dear.

542
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:56,222
Um, Mum, you're sitting
over here. I'll sit here.

543
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:57,765
Marry that girl.

544
00:48:57,852 --> 00:49:01,095
And Florence can sit here,
and Edward can sit here.

545
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:14,858
Uh...

546
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:27,871
I'm so glad you're here, my dear.
I've been wanting to try this out.

547
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:34,420
Rabbit stewed in plums.
All day on a low heat.

548
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:36,755
You're a marvelous cook,
darling.

549
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:38,632
It smells delicious.

550
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:44,555
Do you know, I make all our own jam,
marmalade, chutney.

551
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:46,188
It never stops.

552
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:48,141
And you do
a wonderful job.

553
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:49,897
I do my best.

554
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:53,901
Do you have children
of your own, dear?

555
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,198
No.

556
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:24,598
Sort of tickles.

557
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:27,564
It's all right.

558
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:43,830
I want to
ask you something.

559
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:47,913
Yes?

560
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:52,960
How many girls
have you, you know...

561
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:59,592
The truth is,
not many really.

562
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:02,591
How many then?

563
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:05,974
Just some.

564
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:13,477
Six?

565
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,860
Yes, about that, or...

566
00:51:20,953 --> 00:51:22,160
I don't know.

567
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,657
Four? Do you think
it was four?

568
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:30,210
Um...

569
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:35,508
Flo, it's a... I think it's
a matter of definition.

570
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:51,723
And what were
their names?

571
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:54,059
"Their names"? Why are we
talking about...

572
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:03,909
Well, there are no names.

573
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:09,870
You're the first.

574
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:16,877
You are the first.

575
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:21,469
<i>She used to play Cinderella,</i>

576
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:24,844
<i>but she took to drugs, narcotics,
and excessive alcohol.</i>

577
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:27,596
<i>Now, she couldn't even play
the wick in Aladdin's lamp.</i>

578
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:33,186
<i>And now I have a short scene
from the famous film</i> Dracula.

579
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:35,312
<i>That girl died.</i>

580
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:40,322
<i>That was the vampire strangling his,
I mean her victim.</i>

581
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:46,577
<i>And now we have</i>
Fascination <i>by van Gogh</i>

582
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:49,657
<i>which now hangs in
the Louvre gallery in Paris.</i>

583
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,325
Fascination.

584
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:17,684
- Who's that fellow over there?
- Just someone.

585
00:53:17,778 --> 00:53:20,361
- Looks a bit rough.
- Let's start, shall we.

586
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:21,813
Charles.

587
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:20,254
Did you like it?
You looked like you'd fallen asleep.

588
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:22,878
Asleep? No, honestly. I loved it.

589
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:26,052
I often listen
with my eyes closed.

590
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:30,181
Look, I can
even sing it.

591
00:54:34,313 --> 00:54:36,054
All right. I take it back.

592
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:41,814
Come on. I want to show you
where I used to work.

593
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:56,495
This is where the performers
wait to go on stage.

594
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:59,210
And afterwards I'd
serve them drinks here.

595
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:01,330
I once made a cup of tea
for Benjamin Britten.

596
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:03,289
- Oh, yes, the famous...
- And this peephole.

597
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:07,297
I'd hear the applause
and watch like this,

598
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:10,388
and when the players
started to leave the stage,

599
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:13,767
I'd have to open it smoothly,
without being seen.

600
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,862
Can you imagine the terror and
the thrill of stepping out here

601
00:55:26,949 --> 00:55:28,531
to play your first concert.

602
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:31,488
These are
discerning audiences.

603
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:32,819
Yes, it would be
something...

604
00:55:32,913 --> 00:55:35,326
I just know the Ennismore
will play here one day.

605
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:44,255
And when we do,
I'll choose the Mozart Quintet,

606
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:45,457
the one you can sing.

607
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:48,801
Yes.

608
00:55:53,642 --> 00:55:54,883
Yes.

609
00:55:56,228 --> 00:55:57,594
We'll play it beautifully.

610
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:02,766
The critic from <i>The Times</i>
will be there.

611
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,692
We'll triumph.

612
00:56:10,409 --> 00:56:15,370
And it will be yours,
it'll be specially for you.

613
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:17,822
It's my promise.

614
00:56:23,672 --> 00:56:28,337
And I'll be here.

615
00:56:28,677 --> 00:56:30,839
Dead center,
three rows back.

616
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,886
Ready to shout at the end.
What is it they shout?

617
00:56:32,973 --> 00:56:34,009
Bravo.

618
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:37,718
Bravo! Bravo
the Ennismore Quartet!

619
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:42,226
This is where I'll be,
Florence, this very seat.

620
00:56:42,316 --> 00:56:44,148
Number 9, row C.

621
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:47,402
And that is my promise.

622
00:56:50,032 --> 00:56:51,944
This was recorded in Berlin.

623
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:55,201
I've never heard
a stereophonic thingy before.

624
00:56:56,622 --> 00:56:58,079
What's the point of it?

625
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:01,116
You hear the whole spread
of an orchestra.

626
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:03,080
Violins on the left,

627
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:07,334
double basses on the right,
and everything in between.

628
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,842
Stand here,
close your eyes...

629
00:57:18,894 --> 00:57:20,601
You know
what an octave is.

630
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:25,065
Now you're going to hear the
greatest octave leap there ever was.

631
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:56,971
I love you!

632
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:57,190
Florence?

633
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:01,027
Flo?

634
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:32,399
Just...

635
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:36,480
Florence, don't move,
okay? Florence?

636
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:37,737
Mmm.

637
01:00:05,352 --> 01:00:07,844
All right.
Let me... Let me put this another way.

638
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:12,436
You don't seem quite as happy
as you should.

639
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:19,276
In love, as you say,
getting married in the summer.

640
01:00:19,366 --> 01:00:23,451
No, I am honestly.
I'm very happy.

641
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,787
Something's bothering you,
Flo.

642
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:34,336
It could be the quartet,
the cellist, Charles Morrell.

643
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:38,086
I think he's a bit taken with me,
keeps asking me out.

644
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,422
That's easy.
Now you've got a fiancé.

645
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:45,806
Oh, well, you see,
I don't want the quartet to know.

646
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:48,767
They'll think I'm leaving,
they'll panic.

647
01:00:55,402 --> 01:00:56,984
That's not it though,
is it?

648
01:01:14,713 --> 01:01:15,874
I'm just being silly.

649
01:01:15,964 --> 01:01:17,455
Could you not talk
to your mother?

650
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:28,303
- I should go.
- Stay just a little longer.

651
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:29,725
There's something...
Sit down.

652
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:35,564
There's something
I want to say.

653
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:39,818
You can change your mind.

654
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:43,189
So your father's
ordered a marquee,

655
01:01:43,283 --> 01:01:46,492
your mother's getting
measured for a dress,

656
01:01:46,578 --> 01:01:48,410
the invitations are
at the printers.

657
01:01:50,165 --> 01:01:54,785
Flo, these are minor details,
trifles compared to what's at stake.

658
01:01:58,590 --> 01:01:59,876
It's not too late
to turn back.

659
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:02,125
I really have to go.
I'm giving a lesson.

660
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:09,220
No. God! No, I mean, hell.
Sorry, I didn't mean to say that.

661
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:11,096
I'm sorry.

662
01:02:11,186 --> 01:02:13,223
This is a mess.

663
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:22,649
<i>"This pleasurable excitement</i>

664
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:25,277
<i>"causes the penis
to fill with blood</i>

665
01:02:25,367 --> 01:02:27,859
- <i>"and become engorged..."</i>
- Oh, God.

666
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:32,788
<i>"Secretes a clear substance
to lubricate the mucous membrane."</i>

667
01:02:35,043 --> 01:02:37,376
<i>"And now the foreplay
is concluded.</i>

668
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:39,829
<i>"He lies on top of her,</i>

669
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:43,712
<i>"and it is perfectly acceptable
for her to use a hand gently</i>

670
01:02:43,802 --> 01:02:45,418
<i>"to guide her husband in.</i>

671
01:02:46,388 --> 01:02:48,505
<i>"And at last he enters her."</i>

672
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:50,718
Enters me.

673
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:54,510
<i>"He enters her,
and this is known as penetration."</i>

674
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:55,720
Flo?

675
01:02:55,814 --> 01:02:57,646
Enter. You may enter me.

676
01:02:58,024 --> 01:02:59,060
What?

677
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:01,358
Nothing.

678
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:03,356
Are you all right?

679
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:05,733
I'm feeling rather sick.

680
01:03:05,824 --> 01:03:07,611
What are you reading?

681
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:08,817
A sex manual.

682
01:03:08,952 --> 01:03:11,365
Flo! Because of Edward?

683
01:03:13,248 --> 01:03:14,489
What does it say?

684
01:03:15,417 --> 01:03:19,286
It says women are like doorways.
Men can enter through them.

685
01:03:20,255 --> 01:03:23,248
That's so ridiculous!
That simply isn't true.

686
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:24,419
I'm afraid it is.

687
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:27,714
What else does it say?

688
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:30,304
You won't like this.

689
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:34,387
It says the penis...

690
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:35,593
Ugh.

691
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:38,182
- The penis fills with blood.
- Blood?

692
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:39,351
Ugh!

693
01:03:39,607 --> 01:03:41,223
- No sign of Daddy?
- No.

694
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:44,068
That's just typical.

695
01:03:44,154 --> 01:03:47,113
I've got my Spinoza
supervision now, um,

696
01:03:47,198 --> 01:03:49,110
so, Ruth, no running
in the hall,

697
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:53,406
and Florence, could you delay
your screeching until after tea?

698
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:06,753
Come on, Flo, it's easy.
Just point and choose.

699
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:08,379
But you're not meant
to see it.

700
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:16,175
<i>What about this one?</i>

701
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:21,473
<i>No. Awful.
Too creamy and frilly.</i>

702
01:04:22,317 --> 01:04:24,650
I want something simple.
And white.

703
01:04:24,736 --> 01:04:27,274
- White?
- Can I help you young people?

704
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:29,777
We're late for rehearsal.
Thank you.

705
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:20,623
- You all right?
- Yes.

706
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:46,561
- I love you.
- I love you.

707
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,822
Edward, tell me something.

708
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:56,359
Say something.

709
01:05:56,911 --> 01:06:00,450
No, say something stupid
like you used to.

710
01:06:04,586 --> 01:06:08,455
Miss Ponting, you have
a clavicle and a philtrum

711
01:06:09,174 --> 01:06:11,257
that all men
wish to play on,

712
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:14,213
and a vibrato
that all men adore,

713
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:18,548
but you're entirely mine,
and I'm so very glad and proud.

714
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:23,685
In that case,
you may kiss my vibrato.

715
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:40,156
Such hard calluses
for so soft a woman.

716
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:46,370
And my philtrum...

717
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:08,102
There. Is that all right?
Am I squashing you?

718
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:09,894
No, not really.

719
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:18,611
Sorry.

720
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:21,363
It just...

721
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:24,618
I need to...
I can't quite...

722
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:27,116
- Just lie still.
- Sorry. If you could...

723
01:07:28,419 --> 01:07:31,253
- I know, I'm trying.
- If you could just lift a little.

724
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:33,672
I know. I'm trying to.
I just... I can't quite...

725
01:07:39,264 --> 01:07:40,755
<i>"He lies on top of her.</i>

726
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:44,725
<i>"And it is perfectly acceptable
for her to use a hand gently</i>

727
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:46,388
<i>"to guide her husband in."</i>

728
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:52,649
Florence.

729
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:55,690
In here.

730
01:07:57,407 --> 01:07:59,649
It's too... Ah!

731
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:02,192
What is it?

732
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:04,611
What is it?

733
01:08:04,706 --> 01:08:06,663
Oh, my God!

734
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:08,536
Oh!

735
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:39,817
Don't look at me!

736
01:08:40,742 --> 01:08:43,530
Please don't look at me!
Stop looking at me!

737
01:09:13,274 --> 01:09:14,355
Edward.

738
01:09:16,069 --> 01:09:18,356
- Here at last.
- Sorry I'm late.

739
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:20,984
- No one would stop for me.
- Oh, they're idiots.

740
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:23,448
Perhaps I should get
a haircut.

741
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:25,617
- Or a new jacket or something.
- Come and see your room.

742
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:29,447
This time Mummy's put you
in the small room, right at the top.

743
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:32,453
- Hello.
- As far away from me as possible.

744
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,659
Very sensible.

745
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:41,090
It's enormous.

746
01:09:46,808 --> 01:09:47,889
You're beautiful.

747
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:01,395
Put your arms
right round me.

748
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:04,861
I like that.

749
01:10:06,494 --> 01:10:08,656
Daddy wants
to show you the factory.

750
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:09,736
The job.

751
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:14,499
Let me kiss
your vibrato.

752
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:15,746
Stupid.

753
01:10:16,421 --> 01:10:19,209
Do you think you can be a
salesman and write history books?

754
01:10:19,298 --> 01:10:20,414
Someone's got to try it.

755
01:10:20,508 --> 01:10:23,592
And the insurance came through.
You're allowed to drive the Humber.

756
01:10:24,971 --> 01:10:27,054
And Ruth says you're
playing tennis with Daddy.

757
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:30,008
No. Florence. I'm hopeless.
It's ridiculous. I can't even...

758
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:31,429
- That's not what you said at dinner.
- I know, but, I...

759
01:10:31,519 --> 01:10:33,010
It's all right.
He'll simply want to thrash you.

760
01:10:33,104 --> 01:10:34,470
Just let him.

761
01:10:36,566 --> 01:10:40,480
But you're mine now.
I want to thrash him.

762
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:42,276
Don't you dare.

763
01:10:44,866 --> 01:10:47,074
Did Florence tell you?
I'll be giving her a couple of grand.

764
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:48,533
Get you both started.

765
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:50,702
- That's awfully...
- You any good by the way?

766
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:54,873
- I'm pretty useless, actually.
- Everyone says that.

767
01:10:56,002 --> 01:10:59,962
I expect you're thinking because you're
young you're going to slaughter me.

768
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:02,585
Well, my friend,
think again.

769
01:11:04,427 --> 01:11:06,214
Anyway, here it is.

770
01:11:09,766 --> 01:11:11,473
Old Ministry
of Defense place.

771
01:11:11,559 --> 01:11:13,596
Bought it for a song.
Cost less than my boat.

772
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:21,059
Mostly specialist stuff
made to order for labs.

773
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:26,401
This oscilloscope is being adapted
for Oxford's engineering department.

774
01:11:26,491 --> 01:11:29,780
A lot of our work is for universities.
But we could do more.

775
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:33,620
Perhaps spend a couple of months
here learning what we do,

776
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:37,999
get your mind round
some basic electronics.

777
01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:42,417
Uh, then you'll go round to universities,
explain our services,

778
01:11:43,174 --> 01:11:44,585
drum up business for us.

779
01:11:46,761 --> 01:11:48,218
You'll even have
your own office.

780
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:56,597
Will I have a desk?

781
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:10,907
Six love. Two sets to me.
One more?

782
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:13,360
I don't know.
I think I'd rather just go inside...

783
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:16,743
Your serve. Come on, man.
See if you can get a game.

784
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:18,449
Just one game.

785
01:12:25,132 --> 01:12:26,794
- Out!
- In.

786
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:31,803
- Love fifteen.
- I know.

787
01:12:31,889 --> 01:12:33,300
Thirty-forty.

788
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:41,684
Whoops!

789
01:12:44,402 --> 01:12:45,563
One-four.

790
01:12:46,821 --> 01:12:48,153
For God's sakes, man.
Come on!

791
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:58,906
Match point.

792
01:13:01,919 --> 01:13:03,205
That's it!

793
01:13:04,422 --> 01:13:06,835
Six love, six love,
six one.

794
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:13,925
I have to say it. That return of serve,
the drop shot was a complete fluke.

795
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:16,428
Well, no, actually,
I've been working on that one.

796
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:23,855
My, God, Florence!
How long have you been there?

797
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:26,103
Not long at all.
I thought I'd just...

798
01:13:26,193 --> 01:13:28,731
I asked you a question,
damn it. How long?

799
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:30,608
- About 5 minutes.
- About?

800
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:32,776
About?

801
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:34,699
What the hell do you think
you're up to?

802
01:13:35,453 --> 01:13:37,945
Did I invite you
to spy on me?

803
01:13:38,706 --> 01:13:39,947
Well?

804
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:42,324
Answer me!

805
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:17,628
There you are. Did you really
need to come this far?

806
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:18,844
Yes.

807
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:20,422
It must be two miles
back to the hotel.

808
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:22,178
I needed to get out.

809
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:29,098
Look, this is ridiculous.
It was unfair of you to run out like that.

810
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:30,807
- Was it?
- Yes.

811
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:32,935
In fact, it was unpleasant.
Bloody unpleasant.

812
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:35,442
- Yes.
- What do you mean, "Yes"?

813
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:37,272
You know exactly
what I mean.

814
01:15:40,244 --> 01:15:42,281
It was absolutely
revolting.

815
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:51,044
You don't have the faintest idea
how to be with a man, do you?

816
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:55,248
If you did, it would
never have happened.

817
01:15:57,261 --> 01:16:01,221
In all this time,
you've never let me near you.

818
01:16:01,307 --> 01:16:03,048
You've never let me...

819
01:16:05,102 --> 01:16:06,968
You don't know a thing
about any of it, do you?

820
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:09,638
- Please don't bully me.
- I'm not bullying you.

821
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:11,640
Yes, you are.
Edward, you are!

822
01:16:11,776 --> 01:16:13,608
- You're talking bloody nonsense.
- I'm trying to...

823
01:16:13,694 --> 01:16:15,686
You're the one who stopped us
getting close.

824
01:16:17,031 --> 01:16:18,988
When we hold hands you think
you're doing me a favor.

825
01:16:19,075 --> 01:16:20,065
You're so stuck up!

826
01:16:20,201 --> 01:16:22,363
- Is that what you think?
- Yes, it bloody well is what I think.

827
01:16:22,453 --> 01:16:24,786
Then why are you here?

828
01:16:24,872 --> 01:16:28,331
Why are you chasing me
down the beach?

829
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:31,285
Why can't you let me
just sit here by myself?

830
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:45,222
Edward, I want
to make you happy.

831
01:16:47,645 --> 01:16:49,682
But I think I'm always
a disappointment.

832
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:54,649
You're always advancing,
I'm always backing away.

833
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:58,607
And we can't
talk about it.

834
01:16:59,698 --> 01:17:03,692
We can never just
be happy. Or just be.

835
01:17:06,038 --> 01:17:09,406
You're always demanding something more,
and I'm useless at...

836
01:17:14,255 --> 01:17:18,841
And you go silent and unhappy
and it's all my fault.

837
01:17:20,761 --> 01:17:22,172
And when I do...

838
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:26,298
I mean when I say yes to something
even if I don't really want to,

839
01:17:26,392 --> 01:17:28,975
I know there'll be another
thing that I'm expected to do.

840
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:30,597
I'm no good
at these demands.

841
01:17:30,688 --> 01:17:31,929
Demands?

842
01:17:32,022 --> 01:17:33,854
Well, what I mean is...

843
01:17:33,941 --> 01:17:36,103
You think I'm some sort
of debt collector.

844
01:17:37,903 --> 01:17:39,690
I hope you're not
talking about money.

845
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:43,148
Of course, I'm not.

846
01:17:43,242 --> 01:17:44,449
That's it, isn't it? Money?

847
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:46,034
- Honestly, I wasn't talking about...
- I don't care about money...

848
01:17:46,162 --> 01:17:48,119
- I didn't mention money, Edward.
- ...yours or anyone's.

849
01:17:48,205 --> 01:17:49,537
- I know you don't.
- So keep your money.

850
01:17:49,623 --> 01:17:52,457
You think I demanded
that job from your father?

851
01:17:52,543 --> 01:17:57,584
It was your idea. And do you know what?
I don't want to work for him.

852
01:17:57,673 --> 01:17:59,960
- Tell him I've changed my mind!
- I know you don't mean that.

853
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:02,334
- It's just because you're feeling...
- I bloody well do!

854
01:18:11,979 --> 01:18:14,813
But why did you run off like that?
You shouldn't have done that.

855
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:16,390
I've already...
I've already told you.

856
01:18:18,068 --> 01:18:23,359
- You wanted to humiliate me.
- No, honestly.

857
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:25,486
It's something...

858
01:18:27,578 --> 01:18:29,194
I can't explain it.

859
01:18:30,331 --> 01:18:33,790
I don't know what it is,
why I ran away.

860
01:18:34,835 --> 01:18:36,246
I got in such a state.

861
01:18:36,337 --> 01:18:38,294
- I was ashamed...
- So you humiliated me.

862
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:42,374
All right, then. If that's what you want!
I was trying to humiliate you.

863
01:18:43,886 --> 01:18:46,754
It's no less than you deserve when
you can't even control yourself.

864
01:18:46,847 --> 01:18:48,588
You're a bitch
talking like that!

865
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:09,025
Edward, please go away.

866
01:19:23,717 --> 01:19:25,504
We could be so free
with each other.

867
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:28,841
We could make each other
so happy.

868
01:19:34,561 --> 01:19:36,097
Instead,
we're in this mess.

869
01:19:40,943 --> 01:19:42,184
Yes.

870
01:19:44,321 --> 01:19:45,562
Meaning what exactly?

871
01:19:45,656 --> 01:19:46,772
It's a mess.

872
01:19:50,744 --> 01:19:51,985
It's hopeless.

873
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:00,456
Is it?

874
01:20:24,653 --> 01:20:26,269
Is it a nightingale?

875
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:31,736
It's a blackbird.

876
01:20:36,290 --> 01:20:37,576
As late as this?

877
01:20:39,543 --> 01:20:42,502
It must be a prime site he's on.

878
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:46,247
He's doing overtime,
having to work hard.

879
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:50,881
Like me.

880
01:20:58,020 --> 01:20:59,761
Edward, no, please.

881
01:21:06,904 --> 01:21:09,897
There's something
I want to say to you.

882
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:11,526
It's not...

883
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:12,949
What?

884
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:15,947
You know I love you.

885
01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:18,538
Still.

886
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:21,624
I want to spend
my life with you.

887
01:21:21,752 --> 01:21:23,664
And you feel the same.

888
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:27,919
We love each other,
and we can set each other free.

889
01:21:30,594 --> 01:21:33,302
Edward, it must be obvious
to you by now that I'm...

890
01:21:34,681 --> 01:21:37,298
- Florence, what is it?
- That I'm pretty hopeless.

891
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:42,600
No, I'm absolutely
hopeless at sex.

892
01:21:43,982 --> 01:21:45,393
I'm no good at it.

893
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:49,485
I don't seem to need it like other people,
like you do.

894
01:21:52,157 --> 01:21:54,444
I might change,
but I can't imagine it.

895
01:21:57,037 --> 01:22:00,075
If I don't say this now we'll
always be struggling with it.

896
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:04,413
It's going to cause you a lot of unhappiness,
and me, too.

897
01:22:05,129 --> 01:22:06,461
Florence, I don't understand
what you're...

898
01:22:06,547 --> 01:22:08,038
Mummy knows two homosexuals.

899
01:22:08,632 --> 01:22:10,965
They live in a flat together,
like man and wife.

900
01:22:11,051 --> 01:22:13,338
Two men. In Oxford,
in Beaumont Street.

901
01:22:13,429 --> 01:22:15,512
They both teach
at the University.

902
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:19,382
And we can live by our own rules too,
Edward.

903
01:22:20,269 --> 01:22:22,602
I can say this because
I know you love me.

904
01:22:24,273 --> 01:22:26,185
We don't have to be
like everyone else.

905
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:28,729
We could live together and...

906
01:22:28,861 --> 01:22:30,193
And so...

907
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:33,358
And no one would know
what we did or didn't do.

908
01:22:33,449 --> 01:22:38,740
We'd be together,
and if you wanted, really wanted,

909
01:22:38,829 --> 01:22:42,288
that's to say, whenever it happened,
and, of course, it would happen,

910
01:22:42,416 --> 01:22:45,534
I'd understand,
more than that, I'd want it.

911
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:48,119
Because I want you
to be happy and free.

912
01:22:49,548 --> 01:22:52,382
I'd never be jealous,
as long as I knew that you loved me.

913
01:22:54,303 --> 01:22:55,464
Oh, God.

914
01:22:55,554 --> 01:22:57,671
Honestly, my darling,

915
01:22:59,349 --> 01:23:02,217
I just want to be
with you all my life,

916
01:23:02,311 --> 01:23:04,143
look after you,
be happy with you,

917
01:23:04,271 --> 01:23:05,978
and work
with the quartet,

918
01:23:06,064 --> 01:23:07,726
and one day at Wigmore Hall

919
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:10,775
play something glorious
and beautiful for you

920
01:23:10,861 --> 01:23:12,102
like the Mozart.

921
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:15,237
Have I...

922
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:19,033
Have I got this right?

923
01:23:21,747 --> 01:23:24,239
You want me to go with other women.
Is that it?

924
01:23:25,209 --> 01:23:26,416
Not if you didn't want to.

925
01:23:26,502 --> 01:23:28,960
Have you actually forgotten
that we were married today?

926
01:23:30,506 --> 01:23:33,670
We're not two old queers living
in secret on Beaumont Street.

927
01:23:33,759 --> 01:23:35,341
We're man and wife!

928
01:23:42,893 --> 01:23:46,352
"With my body
I thee worship!"

929
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,346
That's what
you promised today.

930
01:23:48,482 --> 01:23:50,144
In front of everybody!

931
01:23:51,944 --> 01:23:54,778
Are you so innocent and stupid
that you don't realize

932
01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:57,901
how disgusting and
ridiculous your idea is?

933
01:23:59,284 --> 01:24:01,071
And what an insult it is?

934
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:02,944
An insult to me!

935
01:24:16,593 --> 01:24:17,754
You tricked me.

936
01:24:21,181 --> 01:24:22,513
You're a fraud.

937
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:29,312
And I know
what else you are.

938
01:24:32,442 --> 01:24:33,728
Do you know what you are?

939
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:37,691
Frigid.

940
01:24:39,241 --> 01:24:40,482
That's what.

941
01:24:42,703 --> 01:24:44,160
Completely frigid.

942
01:24:46,915 --> 01:24:49,157
You thought
you needed a husband,

943
01:24:50,502 --> 01:24:53,620
and I was the first bloody
fool to come along.

944
01:27:50,015 --> 01:27:52,132
Edward? Edward?

945
01:28:17,209 --> 01:28:20,077
Hello, Edward, love.
Have you been at work?

946
01:28:21,379 --> 01:28:22,790
But where's Florence?

947
01:28:25,217 --> 01:28:26,378
Oh, my God, son.

948
01:28:36,102 --> 01:28:37,309
<i>And what about
all those presents?</i>

949
01:28:37,395 --> 01:28:39,933
They'll all be sent back.
Dad's writing to Mrs. Ponting.

950
01:28:40,315 --> 01:28:42,773
- Why can't we see Florence?
- We love her.

951
01:28:43,193 --> 01:28:45,651
- Why won't you tell us what's happened?
- Look...

952
01:28:46,947 --> 01:28:49,439
One day when you're grown up,
you'll understand.

953
01:28:50,408 --> 01:28:51,774
But listen, I want you
to make me a promise,

954
01:28:51,868 --> 01:28:53,029
a really solemn promise.

955
01:28:53,119 --> 01:28:55,657
That you'll never ever mention
her name to me again,

956
01:28:55,747 --> 01:28:58,490
or ask me any more questions
about her. Do you understand?

957
01:28:59,084 --> 01:29:00,120
Hands on hearts.

958
01:29:00,627 --> 01:29:02,789
- Edward. This is so stupid.
- I mean it.

959
01:29:15,183 --> 01:29:16,390
And the job.

960
01:29:17,853 --> 01:29:19,719
You'll have to write
to Mr. Ponting.

961
01:29:20,272 --> 01:29:21,638
I already have.

962
01:29:27,612 --> 01:29:30,821
I've had a letter back
from Florence's mother.

963
01:29:32,158 --> 01:29:34,195
- Here, you'd better read it.
- I'd rather not.

964
01:29:39,666 --> 01:29:40,827
Well...

965
01:29:43,962 --> 01:29:45,828
Anyway, it's agreed.

966
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:52,509
Non consummation.

967
01:30:00,937 --> 01:30:02,348
Come on, son.

968
01:30:05,609 --> 01:30:07,692
Is there really nothing
you want to tell me?

969
01:30:16,745 --> 01:30:18,327
Are you sure?

970
01:31:43,832 --> 01:31:44,948
Eddy.

971
01:31:47,002 --> 01:31:48,288
Look at this.

972
01:31:48,962 --> 01:31:49,998
What?

973
01:31:50,922 --> 01:31:52,959
Does that list not look
familiar to you?

974
01:31:54,551 --> 01:31:58,261
- We have all these records already.
- What?

975
01:32:01,725 --> 01:32:04,012
I don't know what they've done here.
It's a mess.

976
01:32:04,102 --> 01:32:06,435
Looks like they've sent
last month's order.

977
01:32:06,896 --> 01:32:08,307
And this month's.

978
01:32:08,398 --> 01:32:10,060
Uh...

979
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:11,607
They got it totally mixed up.

980
01:32:12,402 --> 01:32:13,984
Well, we'll just have
to separate them out,

981
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:15,777
and call,
what's his name?

982
01:32:16,531 --> 01:32:19,239
- Bob.
- He could come by this afternoon.

983
01:32:24,247 --> 01:32:26,910
Excuse me. Do you have
any Chuck Berry?

984
01:32:28,293 --> 01:32:29,500
Sure.

985
01:32:32,088 --> 01:32:33,829
Didn't we have
this problem before?

986
01:32:33,965 --> 01:32:35,877
Reckon we did.

987
01:32:37,135 --> 01:32:38,546
Let's see...

988
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:41,712
How about a "Best of"?

989
01:32:42,182 --> 01:32:43,593
That's perfect.

990
01:32:46,936 --> 01:32:48,848
You don't look the sort
to be into this kind of thing.

991
01:32:48,938 --> 01:32:51,601
It's not for me.
It's for my mum's birthday.

992
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:54,938
She's pretty old.
She's going to be 36.

993
01:32:57,739 --> 01:32:59,355
It's not so old really.

994
01:33:00,533 --> 01:33:03,071
You see, she only listens
to classical music

995
01:33:03,161 --> 01:33:04,652
but she does like Chuck Berry.

996
01:33:05,371 --> 01:33:06,578
Me too.

997
01:33:06,664 --> 01:33:09,202
She always says he's bouncy and merry.

998
01:33:13,004 --> 01:33:16,213
She'll be so surprised.
But how much is it?

999
01:33:16,299 --> 01:33:18,336
I've only got 75p.

1000
01:33:21,221 --> 01:33:22,587
Oh, it's...

1001
01:33:28,061 --> 01:33:30,394
It's okay.
You can have it.

1002
01:33:31,314 --> 01:33:32,555
I want you
to have it.

1003
01:33:33,316 --> 01:33:34,682
Are you really sure?

1004
01:33:36,111 --> 01:33:37,397
Yes.

1005
01:33:38,196 --> 01:33:41,530
Amazing. And thank you.
I'll put my money into your charity...

1006
01:33:41,616 --> 01:33:43,027
No, no.
There is no need...

1007
01:33:46,162 --> 01:33:50,497
Just... Just tell her,
you know...

1008
01:33:53,294 --> 01:33:54,830
Tell her "happy birthday."

1009
01:33:55,255 --> 01:33:58,293
But happy birthday from who?

1010
01:34:00,468 --> 01:34:01,458
Um...

1011
01:34:02,512 --> 01:34:05,926
Oh, from...
You know, from the shop.

1012
01:34:07,767 --> 01:34:10,726
Bye then. And thanks again.
You're really nice.

1013
01:34:12,188 --> 01:34:13,474
Wait.

1014
01:34:14,732 --> 01:34:16,189
You haven't told me
your name.

1015
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:21,104
Chloe. Chloe Morrell. Bye.

1016
01:35:14,834 --> 01:35:18,123
- So she borrowed this bike...
- Nah, she stole it.

1017
01:35:18,213 --> 01:35:19,704
Went shooting down the hill,
to his mother's house

1018
01:35:19,797 --> 01:35:22,540
and said, "Look,
here's your money back."

1019
01:35:29,182 --> 01:35:30,593
It's not always
like that.

1020
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:35,306
I knew this couple once.

1021
01:35:37,023 --> 01:35:38,685
Very straight.

1022
01:35:38,775 --> 01:35:42,234
Sort of innocent
and young.

1023
01:35:44,113 --> 01:35:45,399
And she was
very beautiful.

1024
01:35:48,326 --> 01:35:52,991
So they get married, you know,
the whole conventional thing.

1025
01:35:53,706 --> 01:35:55,948
Church and cake.

1026
01:35:56,793 --> 01:35:59,251
- Honeymoon in a hotel by the sea...
- Mmm.

1027
01:36:00,672 --> 01:36:02,129
And on the big night,

1028
01:36:04,092 --> 01:36:07,256
it doesn't quite work out,
you know, in bed.

1029
01:36:09,806 --> 01:36:11,843
And she gets
really upset.

1030
01:36:13,101 --> 01:36:16,344
And she tells him that
she's not really into sex.

1031
01:36:18,231 --> 01:36:22,100
That when they live together,
he can have it with anyone he likes.

1032
01:36:24,362 --> 01:36:26,399
- Anyone but her.
- What an offer.

1033
01:36:27,031 --> 01:36:28,522
Does she love him?

1034
01:36:29,993 --> 01:36:31,200
Yes.

1035
01:36:33,997 --> 01:36:35,613
She does.
She really does.

1036
01:36:36,791 --> 01:36:38,407
But that's the thing,
you see, he doesn't get it.

1037
01:36:38,501 --> 01:36:39,537
He shouldn't have listened.

1038
01:36:39,627 --> 01:36:41,664
He just should have
slipped her one on the beach.

1039
01:36:41,796 --> 01:36:44,038
Typical.

1040
01:36:44,549 --> 01:36:46,085
You're so sensitive.

1041
01:36:46,759 --> 01:36:48,170
He's too angry.

1042
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:52,216
He doesn't see that...

1043
01:36:53,891 --> 01:36:55,257
Well, the thing is...

1044
01:36:57,645 --> 01:36:59,056
She really loves him.

1045
01:37:00,732 --> 01:37:02,564
And she doesn't want
to let him down.

1046
01:37:05,778 --> 01:37:09,943
But she wants to be with him,
and she wants him to be happy.

1047
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:15,406
So, it all comes apart
that night on the beach.

1048
01:37:18,124 --> 01:37:19,365
They never...

1049
01:37:21,085 --> 01:37:22,872
They never see
each other again.

1050
01:37:29,010 --> 01:37:31,753
Married for six hours.

1051
01:37:39,062 --> 01:37:40,769
What happened to her?

1052
01:37:42,815 --> 01:37:43,896
I don't know.

1053
01:37:46,027 --> 01:37:48,360
I guess she, um...

1054
01:37:51,324 --> 01:37:52,405
I don't know.

1055
01:38:17,683 --> 01:38:19,094
All right. Here we go.

1056
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:27,604
Didn't even see it.
Too damn slow.

1057
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:01,136
<i>Almost half a century ago,</i>

1058
01:39:01,227 --> 01:39:03,469
<i>four students at the
Royal College of Music</i>

1059
01:39:03,563 --> 01:39:05,099
<i>began to meet informally</i>

1060
01:39:05,189 --> 01:39:06,805
<i>to play some favorite pieces</i>

1061
01:39:06,899 --> 01:39:08,891
<i>and improve
their ensemble technique.</i>

1062
01:39:09,444 --> 01:39:12,653
<i>The result was the now
celebrated Ennismore Quartet.</i>

1063
01:39:13,406 --> 01:39:15,523
<i>This October at Wigmore
Hall in London,</i>

1064
01:39:15,616 --> 01:39:18,734
<i>they'll present a program of Mozart,
Beethoven and Britten</i>

1065
01:39:18,828 --> 01:39:21,992
<i>to celebrate 45 years
of great music making.</i>

1066
01:39:22,290 --> 01:39:24,498
<i>A performance given
even greater significance</i>

1067
01:39:24,584 --> 01:39:26,200
<i>by the recent announcement</i>

1068
01:39:26,294 --> 01:39:29,037
<i>that this will be the
Ennismore's farewell concert.</i>

1069
01:39:29,130 --> 01:39:31,122
<i>Yesterday, at their
Primrose Hill home,</i>

1070
01:39:31,215 --> 01:39:35,459
<i>I spoke to violinist Florence Morrell
and her husband Charles, the cellist,</i>

1071
01:39:35,553 --> 01:39:36,919
<i>asking them first</i>

1072
01:39:37,013 --> 01:39:40,177
<i>how hard it had been to reconcile
a successful domestic existence,</i>

1073
01:39:40,266 --> 01:39:44,055
<i>three children, five grandchildren,
with the demands of international...</i>

1074
01:40:10,046 --> 01:40:11,253
Thank you, darling.

1075
01:40:15,384 --> 01:40:17,501
Bye, Mum.
Best of luck.

1076
01:40:19,639 --> 01:40:22,473
Bye, Dad.
Best of luck.

1077
01:40:30,024 --> 01:40:31,856
- There you go, Dad.
- Thanks, my boy.

1078
01:40:31,943 --> 01:40:34,481
Mom, we are so proud
of you both.

1079
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:20,646
Bravo.

1080
01:43:57,523 --> 01:43:59,014
I am sorry, Edward.

1081
01:44:01,527 --> 01:44:03,268
I am most terribly sorry.

1082
01:44:10,786 --> 01:44:12,197
Let's go back now...

1083
01:44:13,289 --> 01:44:14,496
Together.

1084
01:44:18,002 --> 01:44:19,334
Edward?
