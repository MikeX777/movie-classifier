00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:26,000
HAD HER HUSBAND SHOT

3
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,083
<i>Paris is outraged,</i>

4
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,750
<i>Paris is shattered,</i>

5
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,541
<i>Paris is tormented,</i>

6
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:45,708
<i>but Paris is...</i>

7
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:47,958
<i>liberated!</i>

8
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:55,916
{\an8}NOVEMBER 3RD 1944

9
00:01:58,041 --> 00:02:00,250
<i>At that time,
it was difficult to be young.</i>

10
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:03,750
<i>But you don't choose
when you have your youth.</i>

11
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,791
<i>It happens when you're young.</i>

12
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:09,333
<i>I've still not forgotten anything
about my time with Georges</i>

13
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:11,125
<i>nor anything that he told me.</i>

14
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:14,250
<i>Yet, I would've liked some of the details
to have got lost.</i>

15
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:20,750
Are you OK?

16
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,250
That's it.

17
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:36,125
It's OK.

18
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,500
- Leave me, Georges.
- Stop!

19
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:50,250
Shit, we're going to get out.

20
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,166
I said we're going to get out.

21
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:07,541
<i>Friend, do you hear the dark flight
Of the crows over our plains?</i>

22
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:14,583
<i>Friend, do you hear the muffled clamor
Of enchained countries?</i>

23
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:21,916
<i>Hey, partisans, workers, and peasants
This is the signal</i>

24
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,166
<i>Tonight the enemy will know
The price of blood and tears</i>

25
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:33,166
Whoa! What have you got in your hump?

26
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,291
Ingots?

27
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,541
Don't shout!

28
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,333
There's too many for me.

29
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,208
They won't get me.

30
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,666
Get off.

31
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,750
Get off.

32
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,291
Go away! Go back to fishing.

33
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,333
Documents, please.

34
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:12,708
Get out, we need to check
with the prefecture. Stand there.

35
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:11,083
- Don't stay in this house.
- Don't worry.

36
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,625
Hello, darling.

37
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,583
Georges!

38
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,041
You're mad coming back.

39
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,916
- Swear that you weren't waiting for me.
- Every minute.

40
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,958
Was there a treasure hunt?

41
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:32,625
No, it put them in such a rage
not finding your brother and you.

42
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,916
They were also looking for money
that you might have hidden.

43
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,083
They're not smart enough for that.

44
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,291
Walk a bit so I can watch you.

45
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:53,833
They arrested me, you know?

46
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,125
I spent three months in prison.

47
00:09:57,125 --> 00:10:00,666
Luckily my uncle managed to free me,
given his rank.

48
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,750
Yes, I saw him come out.

49
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,416
You didn't do anything.

50
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,000
I lived with you.

51
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:11,916
Do you regret it?

52
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,125
Now you'll see, we'll get out.

53
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,291
Really?

54
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,083
If they find you, they'll kill you.

55
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,458
I told you they weren't
smart enough for me.

56
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,166
You didn't even come back
for these diamonds?

57
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,875
No.

58
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,250
I knew you'd be here.

59
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,208
You're all I have now.

60
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,625
What about your brother?

61
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,000
FranÃ§ois is dead.

62
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:09,041
They won't be able to question him,
that'll piss them off no end.

63
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,750
What do you plan on doing now?

64
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,333
Change your life with these diamonds?

65
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,833
Take me around the world
followed by the police?

66
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,958
The diamonds are for extras.

67
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,416
Champagne, caviar, anything you want.

68
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,625
Listen.

69
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,500
The cops will be disappointed.

70
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,541
It's a masterstroke, my darling.

71
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:32,916
Do you see what's happening?
Don't start with these pipe dreams.

72
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,125
Listen!

73
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,458
This time it's for sure. I'm getting out.

74
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,416
You'll see.

75
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,291
You come help me, we'll fuck them.

76
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,583
First, we have to go to Paris.

77
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
<i>Commandant Adrien Rove,
of the Second Bureau intelligence service,</i>

78
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,250
<i>ended up seeing me thanks to my uncle.</i>

79
00:11:56,916 --> 00:12:01,208
<i>It was my third visit to the Parisian
hotel commandeered by the army.</i>

80
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,541
Is it free?

81
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:06,958
No.

82
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,625
How much?

83
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,583
You need to forget this file.

84
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:19,333
Do you know what's in this file?

85
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:25,000
The registrations of Georges Gualtieri
and his brother

86
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,666
with German police in Marseille.

87
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,666
Today, that would cost
being killed by firing squad.

88
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,000
That's what it's cost us.

89
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,750
Georges' motivations aren't simple
to understand.

90
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,208
- I imagine.
- No.

91
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:42,708
Now that his brother is dead,
he can be himself again.

92
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,833
- That wouldn't clear some of his actions.
- No, I know, of course.

93
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,375
I'm not excusing him, you know.

94
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,875
But you're not risking anything
by meeting him.

95
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:59,500
You can't ignore that he helped you save
thousands of lives.

96
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,125
What are you doing in this mess?

97
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,791
What a woman would do for love.

98
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,916
You're risking a lot.

99
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:25,958
I know.

100
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:30,166
And when will we see him... your friend?

101
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,916
In an hour if you want.

102
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,583
But you won't set a trap for him?

103
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,458
You have our word.

104
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,333
I suppose I should be happy?

105
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,958
The door is there.

106
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,333
Make a choice.

107
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,041
Fine.

108
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:02,125
How did you meet this individual?

109
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,833
My father is a ship-owner in Marseille.

110
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,166
Sometimes I worked with him.

111
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,833
One day, Georges came to the office
for an expense history.

112
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:15,375
That day, you would have been
better off catching the flu.

113
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,166
You're a real one, aren't you?

114
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:47,708
Take it.

115
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,833
It seems you have something
to propose to us?

116
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,458
It would seem, yes.

117
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:06,625
Are you interested in clearing the metro?

118
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,875
What do you mean by clearing the metro?

119
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:13,458
It means the Germans were going
to blow it up at the Liberation.

120
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:14,875
Everything's ready to go.

121
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,958
Imagine a great explosion in the metro.

122
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:21,583
Not at night, at rush hour.

123
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,416
When all the big shops clear out.

124
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,375
With the Seine just above.

125
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,500
There's no lifeboats in the metro.

126
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,208
I know a network waiting for it.

127
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,041
What network?

128
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,833
Civilian Germans who speak French

129
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:36,625
with French names,

130
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:40,208
in a completely French and legal business.

131
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:45,791
- How's someone like you useful to them?
- Someone like me?

132
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,291
They're no longer
the masters of Paris, agreed?

133
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,833
How do they get into the metro
to test their devices?

134
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,208
We told them we knew someone

135
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:59,208
in the metro management
that could be bought. That's it.

136
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,250
That's why they didn't reject
me and my brother from Germany.

137
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,333
Can we know this someone's name?

138
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,750
I don't know it,
you'll just have to make it up.

139
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,333
What do you want in exchange?

140
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,666
Something very dear to me.

141
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,125
Very cheap for you.

142
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,166
A clean past?

143
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,416
He's great, he understands it all.

144
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,375
This week alone,

145
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:32,750
you're the third little traitor
to offer their services.

146
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:34,666
Traitor?

147
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,625
I'm not a traitor.

148
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:41,666
What's a Frenchman
working for the Germans?

149
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,875
For me, France is just detention centers.

150
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,666
Georges, it's fine, calm down.

151
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,833
How much time do I have?

152
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,916
The time to reassure me
if you want to avoid a catastrophe.

153
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:05,333
Do you want a bit more coffee, commandant?

154
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,833
The two brothers only operated
in and around Marseille.

155
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,666
Where my wife disappeared.

156
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:16,208
I know what you're thinking,
but be cautious.

157
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,958
This Georges Gualtieri must be
a mythomaniac.

158
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,875
There's no reason for him
to invent his metro story.

159
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,583
Yes, I'd love some coffee, thanks.

160
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:32,166
A whole network of German civilians
camouflaged in Paris, unbelievable!

161
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,708
For the metro.

162
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:37,041
I already have the uniforms.
The rest will go as planned.

163
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,833
We can't be suspicious enough
of that bastard.

164
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:46,083
He must have loved his brother,
it sheds light on the individual.

165
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,833
The Gestapo caves were lacking in light.

166
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:55,250
He surely must have met a lot of guys
like Goetz, who knows?

167
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,791
He might lead me to him.

168
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:15,291
These are the people implicated
in the La Fente file, the de Fustanges.

169
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:18,166
I protest, this arrest is unjust.

170
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,791
Accusing us of working with German police!
Scandalous!

171
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:25,958
Commandant, please call
the police chief immediately.

172
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,541
He's a friend of ours.

173
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:30,875
We'll look at it tomorrow.

174
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:34,541
- Let us go!
- This is ridiculous.

175
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:42,333
Tomorrow Gualtieri is taking me
to his Nazi network.

176
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,333
Maybe we could take a breath.

177
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,708
Before going into the snake pit.

178
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,416
Your commandant wanted
to have me followed.

179
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,000
The fake traitor.

180
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:37,250
Talk about a jerk,
I saw his guy with a newspaper.

181
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,333
He wants the network, to have a good raid.

182
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,416
He wants the cake to himself,
and then me, bam!

183
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:49,583
But since you started it all,
no one can take you away.

184
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,208
Shit!

185
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,000
I saw the whole thing.

186
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,333
I drove them to every land mine.

187
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:58,041
Mine-clearing, a successful mission.

188
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,625
And I saw all of them, them and me,

189
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:03,750
lined up with their ground machines
for the family photo.

190
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,916
And the, "Thank you, Mr. Gualtieri."

191
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,916
"Oh, thank you, Mr. Gualtieri!"

192
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,750
Do you know what I mean?
"Thanks a lot, Mr. Gualtieri!"

193
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,250
At that moment,
I became someone else, a new man.

194
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,458
I started again.

195
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:25,208
We both started again.

196
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,500
Yes!

197
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,416
- But I'm a traitor!
- Come on, it's not that simple.

198
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,250
Listen to me.

199
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,791
It will be even more simple.

200
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,166
They want to double-cross me?

201
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,250
- It's going to blow.
- What?

202
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,666
No, don't do that!

203
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,375
The Germans will do it anyway,
so it will blow up.

204
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,958
I don't give a shit about the company!

205
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:50,750
They've always laughed
at my brother, they can die!

206
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,041
OK.

207
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:57,916
I have an errand to run.

208
00:20:58,583 --> 00:20:59,833
I'll be back in an hour.

209
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,125
<i>He's a hunchback! He's a hunchback!</i>

210
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,375
Come in, commandant, please.

211
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:37,625
- You're crazy bringing him here.
- I swear, he's nothing to be scared of.

212
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,958
Clearly, I wasn't alone.

213
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,583
It wasn't the newspaper guy,
it was the girl with the kid.

214
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:53,458
We're not getting involved
in a Nazi network

215
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,458
without the service covering us!

216
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:59,291
- Then they'll send me packing.
- I don't trust you anymore.

217
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,291
Listen, Gualtieri.

218
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,625
Four years ago, you were in prison.

219
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:08,125
When you got out,
you took revenge on the prosecutor!

220
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:09,750
He became disabled.

221
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,333
New sentence of 15 years' hard labor.

222
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:14,583
You got out thanks to the German police.

223
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,666
And you're talking to me about trust?

224
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:19,375
Answer, say something!

225
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:21,708
He humiliated his brother.

226
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,083
It's none of his business.

227
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,833
Since it's none of my business,
why did you come to find me?

228
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:30,708
You thought I'd let you stay free
just like that?

229
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:33,291
Or that I'd beg a guy like you?

230
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:36,625
You have five seconds to decide.

231
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:39,833
You agreed, didn't you?

232
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:42,333
Georges, I've had enough. This ends now.

233
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:43,458
Make a decision.

234
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:53,166
I can still count to five.

235
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,375
Let's go.

236
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:09,875
Are you armed?

237
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:11,750
Always.

238
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:14,916
Remember, we're familiar now.

239
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,958
Don't worry, old pal,
we work together now.

240
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:20,583
You'll see.

241
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,583
How are you? This is my colleague.

242
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:31,708
After you, RenÃ©.

243
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:48,333
These are the maps of the tunnels.

244
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:52,166
There's been work on since August.

245
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:57,833
You'll have to check the device,
there might be cut wires.

246
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,583
What do you think?

247
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:02,541
It's possible.

248
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:05,708
We'll be dressed like the workers,
in uniforms

249
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:08,208
provided by the head
of technical services.

250
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:11,666
I suppose he's only interested
in money too.

251
00:25:13,291 --> 00:25:15,333
You know, the FÃ¼hrer...

252
00:25:16,416 --> 00:25:20,208
He really loves France, our FÃ¼hrer!

253
00:25:21,458 --> 00:25:22,958
We realized that, yes.

254
00:25:24,041 --> 00:25:28,416
I can't understand why they involved
Frenchmen in my network.

255
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,500
Hey!

256
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,250
It's Frenchman that you got for the cash,

257
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:35,875
there are others you got...
who knows why?

258
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:37,083
Right, RenÃ©?

259
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:41,458
But how will you get
into the metro without us?

260
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:43,541
Ah yes, it's true, that...

261
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:49,250
OK, warn your guy that we'll go together
to check the... mine areas.

262
00:25:52,541 --> 00:25:54,708
At this time, he isn't at home.

263
00:25:57,041 --> 00:25:58,416
Call him at work!

264
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,875
They have a phone in the metro.

265
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:15,375
Metropolitan...

266
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:17,958
Technical management, administration...

267
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:20,041
Technical services.

268
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:22,083
Babylon 32-14.

269
00:26:28,791 --> 00:26:31,708
Sorry, we're not leaving

270
00:26:31,708 --> 00:26:34,416
until the operations have been successful.

271
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,333
Hello? Technical services?

272
00:26:44,375 --> 00:26:46,750
Can I speak to Mr. Robillard, please?

273
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:50,375
Yes, the maintenance manager in the south.

274
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:52,958
Yes, Robillard, yes.

275
00:26:53,708 --> 00:26:55,250
Ah, hello, RenÃ©.

276
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,750
Day or night?

277
00:27:00,416 --> 00:27:03,291
I can take the night if that suits you?

278
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:04,791
I can do a stand-in.

279
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:07,666
When?

280
00:27:08,458 --> 00:27:09,958
Tonight.

281
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:13,875
Is tonight OK?

282
00:27:15,291 --> 00:27:18,666
CHÃTELET
PONT DE NEUILLY EXIT

283
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:42,583
It's here.

284
00:27:42,583 --> 00:27:44,333
There are two loads at the base.

285
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:04,833
Nobody touch the wires here.

286
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:09,250
The loads are taken in the wall,
you see where it is lighter.

287
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,666
Careful of this rail.

288
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:32,750
It's electric.

289
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:36,875
There's still one or two trains that need
to go back to the depot.

290
00:28:40,583 --> 00:28:42,125
OK, well...

291
00:28:42,666 --> 00:28:44,666
You said under the Seine, here we are.

292
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:49,458
Halfway between the ChÃ¢telet
and St. Michel stations.

293
00:28:51,583 --> 00:28:53,750
This is where the Seine has to flow.

294
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:57,125
So I placed three double loads.

295
00:28:57,125 --> 00:29:00,875
One at the base, one in the arch
and one at the top.

296
00:29:05,833 --> 00:29:07,375
Where's your detonator?

297
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:09,083
It's easy access.

298
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,583
- When will it blow up?
- Tomorrow morning.

299
00:29:13,583 --> 00:29:15,458
At a very busy time.

300
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:17,458
Perfect!

301
00:29:18,125 --> 00:29:19,791
Who'll press the button?

302
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:22,416
Franz will.

303
00:29:24,291 --> 00:29:25,958
Thanks for your help.

304
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,708
It stops there.

305
00:29:30,375 --> 00:29:32,250
Wait.

306
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,250
I only get paid if it works.

307
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:41,125
- You have to monitor it to the end.
- Yes, guys.

308
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:45,125
You need to check the detonator. No?

309
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:50,416
Franz!

310
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,958
OK, we have to go back
to the first station.

311
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,041
It's this way.

312
00:29:56,916 --> 00:29:58,541
Armed police, who are you?

313
00:29:58,625 --> 00:29:59,750
Drop your weapon.

314
00:30:15,458 --> 00:30:17,250
DELAYED TRAINS

315
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:05,458
That would have suited you, right?

316
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,791
You have poor taste in pranks.

317
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:13,458
It's settled.

318
00:32:15,958 --> 00:32:17,291
For the Gualtieri file...

319
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:25,375
Stay here.

320
00:32:26,125 --> 00:32:29,583
I'll take care of the other one.
And I'll notify the bomb squad.

321
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,583
Are you a collaborator?

322
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:47,083
Are you the police?

323
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,375
We just had to follow the wires,

324
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:57,500
we found it hidden
in the manager's office.

325
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:00,375
See this?

326
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:02,416
It's a mercury detonator.

327
00:33:03,208 --> 00:33:06,750
The Germans just had
to turn the thing like this

328
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,208
horizontally.

329
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:11,541
And there, the mercury will touch
the wires

330
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:12,583
and it blows up.

331
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,458
And thanks to who did it not blow up?

332
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:17,250
Thanks to Mr. Gualtieri.

333
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:19,500
Thank you, Mr. Gualtieri.

334
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,791
See, you had your hour of glory.

335
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,458
I'm sure Commandant Rove has a word.

336
00:33:24,458 --> 00:33:26,583
As soon as you have your papers in order,

337
00:33:26,583 --> 00:33:29,208
your name will be cleared,
we can start a new life.

338
00:33:47,791 --> 00:33:50,625
Have you done what was needed
for Gualtieri's papers?

339
00:33:51,208 --> 00:33:52,625
What papers?

340
00:33:53,541 --> 00:33:54,958
Toilet paper.

341
00:33:59,416 --> 00:34:01,250
I gave him my word and...

342
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,625
I didn't give him mine.

343
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,958
Don't worry about it,
he won't need papers.

344
00:34:09,875 --> 00:34:11,458
He worked for us.

345
00:34:13,375 --> 00:34:15,958
Thanks to him, we avoided
a massacre in the metro.

346
00:34:16,791 --> 00:34:19,458
He won't have time
to sing from the rooftops.

347
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:22,500
He never lied to me.

348
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,833
We found his brother's body.

349
00:34:25,958 --> 00:34:27,958
He could still be very useful to us

350
00:34:27,958 --> 00:34:30,625
in the south, he knew people
working for the Gestapo.

351
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:32,916
torturers who infiltrate everywhere.

352
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:36,791
Wouldn't it be worth
looking at the issue again?

353
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:45,416
Your officer promises are nice.

354
00:34:46,166 --> 00:34:48,666
I just have one word,
but I have superiors.

355
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,166
Oh yeah!

356
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,500
And what did your superiors tell you?

357
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:57,166
They know that you knew
a lot of people in Marseille.

358
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:00,500
If you help us, they'll hire you
in our services,

359
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,875
- it's better than an identity card.
- What if I don't want that?

360
00:35:03,875 --> 00:35:05,625
It'll be more difficult for me.

361
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:07,041
And particularly for you.

362
00:35:08,916 --> 00:35:12,333
I'm just asking you to come
with me and point them out.

363
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:19,541
That's a no.

364
00:35:20,541 --> 00:35:22,000
Accept it, Georges.

365
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:26,875
What do you take me for?

366
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,916
I'm not a professional informant!

367
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,041
Stopping torturers
or those responsible for deportation,

368
00:35:33,125 --> 00:35:34,833
- is a service to humanity.
- Fine.

369
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:38,000
I've already been told all about humanity.

370
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:44,541
You have three days to think about it.

371
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:54,291
CITY SERVICES

372
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:01,125
Whore!

373
00:36:10,666 --> 00:36:13,708
MARSEILLE A FEW DAYS LATER...

374
00:36:20,708 --> 00:36:22,833
<i>It was the year of chances
and revenge,</i>

375
00:36:22,833 --> 00:36:25,833
<i>which came to an end
in function rooms, town halls</i>

376
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:27,916
<i>schools and even stadiums.</i>

377
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,666
MARRIAGE HALL

378
00:36:31,166 --> 00:36:35,875
<i>All whilst helping Commandant Rove
to discover the real collaborators.</i>

379
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:38,916
<i>Georges had the impression
that Rove was secretly looking</i>

380
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,916
<i>for something else, something personal.</i>

381
00:37:03,083 --> 00:37:05,250
<i>We lived in a place chosen by the service</i>

382
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:09,375
<i>and I waited alone for them to come back
from their hunt every day.</i>

383
00:37:19,916 --> 00:37:22,166
<i>George was bogged down in this mistrust,</i>

384
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:26,083
<i>in the midst of people being arrested
quickly and freed with indifference.</i>

385
00:37:36,916 --> 00:37:38,500
- It's wet.
- No, no.

386
00:37:41,208 --> 00:37:42,333
Thank you.

387
00:37:45,708 --> 00:37:47,916
I really fucked them.

388
00:37:51,541 --> 00:37:53,250
I recognized harelip straight away.

389
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:56,250
And they freed him!

390
00:37:57,708 --> 00:38:01,458
It's the first time he's been lucky
in his fucking life!

391
00:38:03,916 --> 00:38:05,583
What are we doing with this one?

392
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:09,625
Let him tell you what he's been doing
the last few years, we'll check it out.

393
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:16,250
He's the only one that went between
Gualtieri and me without looking at us.

394
00:38:22,083 --> 00:38:23,625
I wonder where Rove went.

395
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:26,750
He may have gone to see
a girl on the street corner.

396
00:38:27,458 --> 00:38:28,958
That would surprise me.

397
00:38:29,958 --> 00:38:31,583
Do you think he spits on it?

398
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:35,375
He seems to be above all that,
or next to it.

399
00:38:35,375 --> 00:38:36,958
I might be wrong.

400
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,000
There was a new cleaner again
this morning.

401
00:38:42,875 --> 00:38:44,625
The third one in four days.

402
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:49,291
They must work for the service.

403
00:38:49,375 --> 00:38:51,791
They change them
so no one gets used to them.

404
00:38:51,875 --> 00:38:53,625
We're being watched all the time.

405
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:58,125
If I wanted to go, it wouldn't be
the surveillance that stopped me.

406
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:00,500
They're not smart enough.

407
00:39:01,125 --> 00:39:02,208
What do you think?

408
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,583
There must be men around the house.

409
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:08,125
The purge won't last 107 years.

410
00:39:08,708 --> 00:39:10,041
Hopefully.

411
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:12,833
It shocks me to see Frenchmen
shaving women's heads

412
00:39:12,833 --> 00:39:15,416
and painting swastikas on their heads.

413
00:39:16,291 --> 00:39:19,958
Whilst the Americans are dropping
like flies in the Ardennes.

414
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:23,458
Rove says they've lost 500,000 men
since D-Day.

415
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:27,375
It's not over.

416
00:39:33,916 --> 00:39:36,166
Georges, this house is too big.

417
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:18,333
They've not given me a signal.

418
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,958
They stopped a bit, those two jerks.

419
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,125
They were never smart.

420
00:40:30,541 --> 00:40:33,416
If you go blind, I can grow old in peace.

421
00:40:37,416 --> 00:40:39,166
You'll never be old.

422
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,458
You think?

423
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,166
Not even later?

424
00:40:42,958 --> 00:40:44,333
Much later?

425
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:46,666
Later...

426
00:40:47,416 --> 00:40:48,625
when is that?

427
00:41:03,375 --> 00:41:06,125
FÃ©lix Ringlet, known as Little Breton,

428
00:41:06,125 --> 00:41:08,500
and Robert Arregui, known as The Basque.

429
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,333
Does that mean anything to you?

430
00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:18,333
Our services think otherwise.

431
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,625
And there's also Gianno Rinaldi.

432
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:24,541
You know, Harelip.

433
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:29,708
Are you proud of arresting
those three poor men?

434
00:41:29,708 --> 00:41:33,000
That's why I agreed
to follow you to Marseille.

435
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,333
They said torturers!

436
00:41:34,333 --> 00:41:37,750
They won't get them if you double-cross
me, you don't recognize anyone!

437
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:40,083
They're like me, burglar buddies.

438
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:43,333
We were in prison together,
the Germans were looking for us.

439
00:41:44,291 --> 00:41:46,208
We still have 13 years left.

440
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:51,625
Do you know what a central prison is?

441
00:41:51,625 --> 00:41:54,916
In my position, would you have refused
the freedom offered?

442
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,333
You could've agreed and run off.

443
00:41:57,333 --> 00:41:58,416
Right!

444
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,625
With all the police on my ass,
the German and the French.

445
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:05,083
I should have met you,

446
00:42:05,083 --> 00:42:07,791
you'd have offered me a place
in the Resistance.

447
00:42:07,875 --> 00:42:10,250
- Would you have joined?
- Would you have taken me?

448
00:42:14,291 --> 00:42:17,416
The Nazis had bigger ideas.

449
00:42:25,166 --> 00:42:27,041
Do you smoke now?

450
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:29,500
Only on special occasions.

451
00:42:34,708 --> 00:42:35,666
Rove!

452
00:42:36,458 --> 00:42:37,833
I'm stopping.

453
00:42:37,833 --> 00:42:38,875
I'm leaving you.

454
00:42:40,833 --> 00:42:41,916
I suspected as much.

455
00:42:42,791 --> 00:42:44,416
But you won't go far.

456
00:42:45,708 --> 00:42:47,083
How much advance will I get?

457
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:49,208
One hour.

458
00:42:52,291 --> 00:42:55,166
If you come with me to a school
where they're waiting for us

459
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:58,625
I'll see your escape tomorrow morning,
you'll have one night's advance.

460
00:42:58,625 --> 00:43:01,083
Yes! I'm sick of your help and all that!

461
00:43:01,083 --> 00:43:03,666
It's not help, I need you.

462
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:07,500
Like I need nuns,
hookers, bank managers...

463
00:43:08,083 --> 00:43:09,875
- Big family!
- There you go.

464
00:43:09,875 --> 00:43:12,833
- Yes.
- Which doesn't bother with pity.

465
00:43:12,833 --> 00:43:15,458
I want to see my daughter.

466
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:18,416
I fought in Verdun,
you bunch of little bastards!

467
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,958
Screw you!

468
00:43:19,958 --> 00:43:22,000
What did my daughter do wrong?

469
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,125
She slept with the Germans, so what?

470
00:43:24,833 --> 00:43:27,125
Without her the family
would've died of hunger.

471
00:43:27,791 --> 00:43:29,375
Bunch of scumbags.

472
00:43:29,916 --> 00:43:31,041
She was right!

473
00:43:31,125 --> 00:43:32,500
Wait for me a minute.

474
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:36,041
You don't have the right to shave her!

475
00:43:36,125 --> 00:43:37,750
Trash!

476
00:43:40,916 --> 00:43:42,291
Release them.

477
00:44:13,291 --> 00:44:14,875
Your papers, please.

478
00:44:40,333 --> 00:44:43,625
Fernand Fournier,
Knight of the Legion of Honor.

479
00:44:43,625 --> 00:44:45,125
Knight my ass!

480
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:48,125
This one is worth it.

481
00:44:48,125 --> 00:44:49,583
Real trash.

482
00:44:51,458 --> 00:44:52,750
Come on.

483
00:44:54,833 --> 00:44:58,708
A.B.C.D.E THE COUNTRY WILL BE REBORN
OVER THE GRAVES OF TRAITORS

484
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:13,750
THE COUNTRY WILL FLOURISH
OVER THE GRAVES OF TRAITORS

485
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:16,333
It's fairer, because of the bastard.

486
00:45:36,666 --> 00:45:38,166
Hello, Ibrana.

487
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:42,583
What do you want?

488
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:46,708
Do you still have your offices
on rue de Paradis in Marseille?

489
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:48,666
What offices?

490
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:51,166
The French Gestapo ones.

491
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,708
Are you accusing me
of being a Gestapo agent?

492
00:45:56,291 --> 00:45:57,250
Me?

493
00:45:57,833 --> 00:46:00,375
One day, you'll apologize to me,
I guarantee it.

494
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:02,458
With a poker.

495
00:46:12,333 --> 00:46:13,333
You...

496
00:46:14,625 --> 00:46:15,750
Bastard.

497
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:19,375
Do you know each other?
No need for introduction, then.

498
00:46:25,041 --> 00:46:26,416
It's not me!

499
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,708
It's him, that's his brother!

500
00:46:28,708 --> 00:46:31,083
Your brother invented the poker.

501
00:46:32,291 --> 00:46:34,583
Don't put anything else on my brother.

502
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:36,416
He's had enough of that.

503
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,500
Where is he?

504
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:39,750
Does he work for you?

505
00:46:40,541 --> 00:46:41,791
Like you?

506
00:46:41,875 --> 00:46:43,250
You bastard!

507
00:46:44,125 --> 00:46:45,958
I should've bumped you both off.

508
00:46:45,958 --> 00:46:48,791
He is well informed, you know why?

509
00:46:49,541 --> 00:46:51,083
Because I was there.

510
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:14,666
So?

511
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:19,333
- The truth is there.
- It was me.

512
00:47:22,083 --> 00:47:23,958
We had to.

513
00:47:23,958 --> 00:47:26,541
- Tell him!
- No!

514
00:47:26,625 --> 00:47:28,375
We didn't have to.

515
00:47:29,125 --> 00:47:30,583
It's not fair.

516
00:47:30,583 --> 00:47:33,833
He's there, strutting like a cop,
but it's not fair.

517
00:47:33,833 --> 00:47:35,333
- He's like me.
- No!

518
00:47:35,333 --> 00:47:37,000
Because he has remorse.

519
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:39,416
That's the best one.

520
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,708
Everyone can have remorse.

521
00:47:41,708 --> 00:47:43,458
I have it too, it's easy.

522
00:47:43,458 --> 00:47:45,416
No, remorse can be proved.

523
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:49,125
Otherwise it's settled with 12 bullets
in the skin in the small hours.

524
00:47:55,583 --> 00:47:57,166
There's one.

525
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,375
There's still 11 more.

526
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,666
Work on him here.

527
00:48:10,791 --> 00:48:14,208
No helping him until he says
something important, understood?

528
00:48:15,708 --> 00:48:17,500
Question him about Dr. Goetz.

529
00:48:18,291 --> 00:48:19,541
You never know.

530
00:48:21,625 --> 00:48:23,291
I heard you talking about Goetz.

531
00:48:24,208 --> 00:48:25,458
Are you interested?

532
00:48:26,916 --> 00:48:28,000
Do you know him?

533
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,291
Yeah, he's a German
who looks after the radio.

534
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:32,666
Yes, and?

535
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:35,041
I saw him with a guy I knew.

536
00:48:35,125 --> 00:48:37,125
A crook they called The Slide.

537
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:38,916
He was a radio freak as well.

538
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,333
But Goetz...

539
00:48:42,125 --> 00:48:44,375
didn't just come for the radio.

540
00:48:44,375 --> 00:48:47,666
He loved the chubby southern girls.

541
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:49,500
And where did The Slide operate?

542
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:53,125
Ah! Most recently he directed
the Gestapo from Avignon.

543
00:48:54,958 --> 00:48:56,958
My wife was arrested in Avignon.

544
00:48:59,541 --> 00:49:00,791
Your wife?

545
00:49:03,125 --> 00:49:05,000
- Did she work with you?
- Yes.

546
00:49:05,583 --> 00:49:06,958
In the underground movement.

547
00:49:12,125 --> 00:49:13,541
Have you ever seen her?

548
00:49:15,125 --> 00:49:17,875
You may have seen her
in the arrested Resistance fighters.

549
00:49:17,875 --> 00:49:19,500
No, not that.

550
00:49:22,166 --> 00:49:23,791
She disappeared on July 25th.

551
00:49:23,875 --> 00:49:27,250
By July I was already locked up in Germany
with my brother.

552
00:49:28,166 --> 00:49:31,416
We need to find Goetz,
it's of utmost importance.

553
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,625
He knows a lot.

554
00:49:32,625 --> 00:49:36,833
He sent back English agents
and communicated with London for them.

555
00:49:36,833 --> 00:49:39,875
He made a big move.
Perhaps with The Slide...

556
00:49:39,875 --> 00:49:41,750
He's already cleared off.

557
00:49:43,791 --> 00:49:46,333
His real name is Galiettas.

558
00:49:57,250 --> 00:50:00,166
Miss, do I find you in the bed of a thug?

559
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:03,500
A guy from the Gestapo
and a bourgeois girl like you?

560
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,625
Let me explain, there must have been
a misunderstanding.

561
00:50:06,625 --> 00:50:10,750
A little traitor of the homeland,
a convict on the run?

562
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:13,916
I love him, commandant,
he is so tender, so sensitive.

563
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,375
I'd die if something happened to him.

564
00:50:16,375 --> 00:50:18,083
Little wretch!

565
00:50:18,083 --> 00:50:21,333
Before I die, I will submit to you.

566
00:50:21,333 --> 00:50:22,375
But commandant...

567
00:50:23,708 --> 00:50:25,666
That's not like you at all!

568
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:27,291
But you're...

569
00:50:27,375 --> 00:50:29,416
Stop, you're hurting me.

570
00:50:39,541 --> 00:50:40,500
Hello?

571
00:50:41,083 --> 00:50:42,708
Yes, hello, Commandant Rove.

572
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:45,458
Yes, don't go, I'll put him on.

573
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,291
Hello, yes?

574
00:50:51,666 --> 00:50:52,875
Yes...

575
00:50:54,125 --> 00:50:55,500
Right now?

576
00:50:56,833 --> 00:50:58,250
OK, I'm coming.

577
00:50:58,875 --> 00:51:02,083
Very quickly, I'll cut through
the old Panier neighborhoods.

578
00:51:02,083 --> 00:51:03,333
OK, yes.

579
00:51:05,208 --> 00:51:07,166
He's with Ibrana, he wants to see me.

580
00:51:07,958 --> 00:51:09,083
Where?

581
00:51:10,083 --> 00:51:13,166
At the precinct where he's been
questioning since yesterday.

582
00:51:14,333 --> 00:51:15,791
Oh, shit!

583
00:51:18,416 --> 00:51:20,458
In any case all the cops will be there.

584
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:24,291
When he recognizes me, we'll have a laugh.

585
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,583
They'll stand to attention.

586
00:51:28,583 --> 00:51:31,000
Don't go through the old areas,
they know you.

587
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,750
It's dangerous. Tell Rove to come get you.

588
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:36,875
What do you want me to do,
my angel, I'm untouchable.

589
00:51:36,875 --> 00:51:38,625
What's it like living with me?

590
00:51:39,791 --> 00:51:41,708
If you say so.

591
00:51:44,166 --> 00:51:46,500
PELLETIER HOUSE
BUY AND SELL

592
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:53,083
Look, isn't that guy Bosco's brother?

593
00:51:59,041 --> 00:52:01,083
Bosco's brother is in the area.

594
00:52:01,083 --> 00:52:02,500
That fucking Gestapo.

595
00:52:08,916 --> 00:52:12,041
Bosco! Trash!

596
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,166
Quick!

597
00:52:22,125 --> 00:52:23,625
Get him!

598
00:52:23,625 --> 00:52:25,833
DU CHÃTEAU PRESCHOOL

599
00:52:29,833 --> 00:52:31,500
Bastard!

600
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,208
Stop!

601
00:52:34,833 --> 00:52:36,208
Don't be jerks.

602
00:52:37,083 --> 00:52:39,250
We're all going to the cops together.

603
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:40,958
That's what I came back for.

604
00:52:45,916 --> 00:52:47,875
And that's just the start.

605
00:52:47,875 --> 00:52:51,583
After, we'll do what you did
to the others, shall I tell you?

606
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,750
You'll talk now.

607
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:55,333
Stop your bullshit,
here you talk or you die.

608
00:52:55,333 --> 00:52:56,958
You'll go out feet first if not.

609
00:52:57,541 --> 00:52:58,750
What?

610
00:52:59,833 --> 00:53:01,458
Get Vincent to take care of it.

611
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,875
Tomorrow, you'll be begging to talk.

612
00:53:04,875 --> 00:53:08,375
Today, you're mute,
tomorrow you'll be deaf, you'll be sorry.

613
00:53:11,083 --> 00:53:13,291
Here, Gualtieri. Really!

614
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:15,500
Your brother?

615
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,666
Where is he?

616
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:18,416
You'll never get him where he is.

617
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:19,791
We got you.

618
00:53:20,708 --> 00:53:22,583
You won't get a medal for that.

619
00:53:22,583 --> 00:53:23,916
I'm a double agent.

620
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,333
A double agent? Well then.

621
00:53:27,708 --> 00:53:28,833
Can you prove it?

622
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:33,041
Do you have a telephone?

623
00:53:33,125 --> 00:53:34,708
Call Commandant Rove.

624
00:53:34,708 --> 00:53:37,333
Adrien Rove, central precinct.

625
00:53:38,041 --> 00:53:40,041
He's there waiting for me.

626
00:53:41,083 --> 00:53:42,916
I don't belong there anymore.

627
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,958
This is a special service.

628
00:53:45,708 --> 00:53:47,125
We're purifying.

629
00:53:48,583 --> 00:53:49,750
We'll look into it.

630
00:53:51,291 --> 00:53:53,333
Whilst we wait, take him to the garage.

631
00:53:58,375 --> 00:54:00,333
Call this Rove at the precinct.

632
00:54:01,041 --> 00:54:02,708
Do you believe him, lieutenant?

633
00:54:02,708 --> 00:54:04,916
We might as well get information.

634
00:54:19,583 --> 00:54:21,416
- Neuvole!
- Georges!

635
00:54:23,666 --> 00:54:26,208
I thought you went to Germany.

636
00:54:26,208 --> 00:54:27,875
Yes, I did.

637
00:54:27,875 --> 00:54:29,541
I got homesick.

638
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:32,833
- What about your brother?
- He's dead.

639
00:54:36,916 --> 00:54:38,250
In a way...

640
00:54:39,125 --> 00:54:40,458
It's better for him?

641
00:54:41,541 --> 00:54:42,541
Yeah.

642
00:54:45,166 --> 00:54:46,166
Say...

643
00:54:46,708 --> 00:54:48,250
What's this special service?

644
00:54:48,791 --> 00:54:51,625
The research board, I think it's called.

645
00:54:56,166 --> 00:54:57,416
Say...

646
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,875
- The captain...
- Yes.

647
00:54:58,875 --> 00:55:00,375
- The one with the beard?
- Yes.

648
00:55:00,375 --> 00:55:02,125
Have you ever seen him anywhere?

649
00:55:02,708 --> 00:55:03,666
No.

650
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:05,333
Shit!

651
00:55:05,333 --> 00:55:08,250
I recognize his voice,
but I don't know anyone with a beard.

652
00:55:08,791 --> 00:55:10,875
You can grow a beard.

653
00:55:10,875 --> 00:55:11,916
Yes!

654
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:17,083
What do they know about you exactly?

655
00:55:18,333 --> 00:55:20,500
Enough to send me down for 20 years.

656
00:55:21,833 --> 00:55:23,708
Go to the bathroom if you want.

657
00:55:25,083 --> 00:55:26,625
One at a time.

658
00:55:30,916 --> 00:55:32,791
This captain...

659
00:55:32,875 --> 00:55:34,750
I'm sure I've seen him before.

660
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:37,208
We've seen so many guys
in the last two years.

661
00:55:42,875 --> 00:55:44,291
Have you seen anyone?

662
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:46,416
Yeah.

663
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,166
Randomly, right and left.

664
00:55:49,166 --> 00:55:51,625
Jo from Nice, Mathieu the Brute.

665
00:55:52,541 --> 00:55:54,291
FranÃ§ois The Belgian.

666
00:55:54,375 --> 00:55:55,375
The Slide.

667
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
- What about Litas?
- Yeah.

668
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,458
A real nutcase.

669
00:56:03,666 --> 00:56:05,333
He thinks the Germans will return.

670
00:56:05,916 --> 00:56:07,791
You know what he's like.

671
00:56:09,125 --> 00:56:10,500
Gualtieri!

672
00:56:15,958 --> 00:56:16,916
That's it!

673
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:19,625
I know where I saw the bearded guy.

674
00:56:19,625 --> 00:56:21,083
Gualtieri.

675
00:56:21,708 --> 00:56:23,625
That's it! Oh.

676
00:56:28,041 --> 00:56:29,250
Don't worry about it.

677
00:56:29,833 --> 00:56:31,333
I'll get you out of here.

678
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,666
- We're waiting for you.
- Thanks, good man.

679
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:37,875
I'll do everything I can
so you don't get harmed.

680
00:56:44,583 --> 00:56:45,958
So?

681
00:56:45,958 --> 00:56:48,416
They fooled you, it seems?

682
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:51,166
Exactly! And it's me who got a good catch.

683
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:53,375
A nice bearded man.

684
00:56:57,333 --> 00:56:58,458
Take this.

685
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:00,875
While I think about it.

686
00:57:11,291 --> 00:57:15,458
I'm sorry but the mission I'm offering you
doesn't have a beard.

687
00:57:17,625 --> 00:57:18,916
Highest order.

688
00:57:21,208 --> 00:57:22,750
If it's really essential.

689
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:25,208
I'm sorry.

690
00:57:26,125 --> 00:57:27,916
Have you had it for a long time?

691
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,541
September 1939.

692
00:57:30,166 --> 00:57:33,458
I vowed never to cut it
until we were victorious.

693
00:57:35,208 --> 00:57:37,416
I have fewer concerns!

694
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:40,375
It's just a question of weeks.

695
00:57:44,666 --> 00:57:46,333
Thank you.

696
00:57:46,333 --> 00:57:47,458
War wound?

697
00:57:50,083 --> 00:57:51,041
Yes.

698
00:57:51,666 --> 00:57:53,416
Sedan, May 13th, 1940.

699
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,958
But in my unit, we held on
until the bitter end.

700
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,500
If all Frenchmen had fought like you,

701
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,541
we wouldn't have seen the Milice.

702
00:58:03,625 --> 00:58:04,791
No doubt.

703
00:58:07,541 --> 00:58:11,500
It seems that you escaped Germany
and formed a Maquis in Sologne.

704
00:58:12,166 --> 00:58:13,166
Yes!

705
00:58:14,125 --> 00:58:15,375
End of 1943.

706
00:58:16,708 --> 00:58:19,208
What does this mission involve,
Commandant?

707
00:58:19,208 --> 00:58:23,500
We thought you could help us uncover
someone responsible for a massacre.

708
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,458
You really think I'm useful to you?

709
00:58:26,458 --> 00:58:27,541
Yes!

710
00:58:28,916 --> 00:58:30,833
You have surprising self-control.

711
00:58:32,833 --> 00:58:34,500
You'll work with this gentleman.

712
00:58:37,083 --> 00:58:39,375
I think you knew his brother rather well.

713
00:58:40,375 --> 00:58:42,583
Possibly, what's his name?

714
00:58:44,625 --> 00:58:46,333
His name won't mean anything.

715
00:58:46,333 --> 00:58:48,250
But people don't forget my brother.

716
00:58:49,041 --> 00:58:50,041
He's a hunchback.

717
00:58:50,708 --> 00:58:53,041
A hunchback? I don't know.

718
00:58:53,625 --> 00:58:56,875
No, he must have made a mistake,
I'd remember.

719
00:58:58,708 --> 00:59:00,125
It's OK.

720
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:05,458
OK, let's go.

721
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:09,166
What? Tonight?

722
00:59:10,166 --> 00:59:11,583
Yes, it's...

723
00:59:12,583 --> 00:59:14,208
It's a long journey.

724
00:59:15,208 --> 00:59:16,958
We'll get there tomorrow morning.

725
00:59:19,291 --> 00:59:20,625
It's cold up there.

726
00:59:20,625 --> 00:59:21,750
Take this.

727
00:59:23,166 --> 00:59:24,625
Put this on.

728
00:59:31,458 --> 00:59:32,416
Take this.

729
00:59:33,958 --> 00:59:34,916
Why?

730
00:59:37,125 --> 00:59:38,583
Does this beret bother you?

731
00:59:39,458 --> 00:59:41,458
No, nothing bothers me.

732
00:59:52,541 --> 00:59:55,416
If you're wrong about him,
it'll be very serious.

733
01:01:06,625 --> 01:01:08,541
So what are we doing?

734
01:01:09,875 --> 01:01:10,833
Nothing.

735
01:01:12,208 --> 01:01:13,416
Waiting.

736
01:01:22,791 --> 01:01:23,916
The militiaman!

737
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,083
The militiaman!

738
01:01:25,083 --> 01:01:27,375
Mommy, mommy, the militiaman!

739
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:11,458
Yes, it's me, Commandant.

740
01:02:12,583 --> 01:02:14,208
I am Alexis de Boitreuil.

741
01:02:15,125 --> 01:02:16,583
I was a soldier, understand?

742
01:02:17,375 --> 01:02:18,833
A French officer.

743
01:02:20,333 --> 01:02:22,125
I'll die under gunfire.

744
01:02:23,083 --> 01:02:24,375
Like a soldier.

745
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:31,125
Who is the mayor of this village?

746
01:02:31,125 --> 01:02:32,500
I am.

747
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:35,291
Commandant Rove.

748
01:02:35,375 --> 01:02:37,583
Leave him with us, Commandant.

749
01:02:37,583 --> 01:02:39,708
We'll take care of him, it's our right.

750
01:02:39,708 --> 01:02:42,916
No, I can't.
We will interview him on the spot, but...

751
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,458
Then, I'll send him back
to the military authorities.

752
01:02:45,458 --> 01:02:48,458
He had men from this village
hanging from trees.

753
01:02:48,458 --> 01:02:52,250
He didn't have the courage to go
into the mountains and trap the Maquis,

754
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:54,166
they attacked innocent people.

755
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:56,666
- Did you arrest the hunchback?
- He's dead.

756
01:02:58,750 --> 01:03:01,916
We want names, dates, all the details.

757
01:03:03,333 --> 01:03:06,041
If not, I'll hand you over
to your victims' families.

758
01:03:07,833 --> 01:03:11,416
Mr. Mayor, take him with my men
to a locked room.

759
01:03:24,458 --> 01:03:27,125
I would've happily killed your brother.

760
01:03:35,125 --> 01:03:36,583
To stop talking about it,

761
01:03:37,541 --> 01:03:39,041
I can tell you one thing.

762
01:03:39,708 --> 01:03:43,041
If I had wanted to, I could've stopped him
doing that bullshit.

763
01:03:43,791 --> 01:03:44,875
Why didn't you?

764
01:03:47,416 --> 01:03:49,833
Because my brother enjoyed

765
01:03:49,833 --> 01:03:51,958
seeing other people suffer.

766
01:03:53,375 --> 01:03:56,166
For me, the joy
of a handicapped person is priceless.

767
01:03:59,708 --> 01:04:02,583
No one recognizes you here,
are you not surprised?

768
01:04:02,583 --> 01:04:05,416
No, I stayed near the cars.

769
01:04:07,291 --> 01:04:09,666
And maybe I've changed already!

770
01:04:18,666 --> 01:04:20,458
I did horrible things too.

771
01:04:20,458 --> 01:04:22,791
But my reasons are in the files.

772
01:04:23,708 --> 01:04:25,166
I understand.

773
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:28,791
No.

774
01:04:28,875 --> 01:04:30,791
You don't understand.

775
01:04:32,791 --> 01:04:34,375
I'm not looking for apologies.

776
01:04:34,916 --> 01:04:36,500
What's done is done.

777
01:04:37,333 --> 01:04:39,250
I'm just giving you an explanation.

778
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:43,291
Happy new year!

779
01:04:43,375 --> 01:04:44,583
Happy new year!

780
01:04:45,375 --> 01:04:46,500
Happy new year!

781
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:48,500
Happy new year!

782
01:04:56,208 --> 01:04:57,791
I have a present for you.

783
01:04:57,875 --> 01:04:58,916
Really?

784
01:05:00,083 --> 01:05:01,875
Oh, thanks, I'm touched.

785
01:05:01,875 --> 01:05:04,083
Yes, it's very kind.

786
01:05:04,083 --> 01:05:05,916
And it's superb.

787
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,666
The painter isn't
that well known yet, but...

788
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:10,166
I trust his talent.

789
01:05:10,833 --> 01:05:12,875
I think you're right.

790
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,708
If the countess allows me...

791
01:05:24,083 --> 01:05:25,125
It's beautiful!

792
01:05:26,166 --> 01:05:28,416
- Where did it come from?
- I got it in a bar.

793
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:31,750
It may be from a heist.

794
01:05:35,666 --> 01:05:38,625
And is there a little present for me,
Commandant?

795
01:05:40,083 --> 01:05:41,583
A small medal?

796
01:05:41,583 --> 01:05:44,166
I don't know, maybe the Legion of Honor?

797
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:46,750
I'll consider you for the next promotion.

798
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:49,708
Yeah? Well I have a present for you.

799
01:05:52,541 --> 01:05:53,583
A present like this.

800
01:05:54,583 --> 01:05:56,166
Thanks, I don't need anything.

801
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,291
It doesn't have to be like this, Commandant.

802
01:06:01,208 --> 01:06:04,291
I spoke about your wife.

803
01:06:04,875 --> 01:06:06,458
Stop, Georges, it's not funny.

804
01:06:06,458 --> 01:06:08,000
Don't joke about that.

805
01:06:11,541 --> 01:06:13,041
I'm not joking.

806
01:06:17,958 --> 01:06:19,875
I know where The Slide is.

807
01:06:21,166 --> 01:06:24,083
If we have The Slide, we get to Goetz.

808
01:06:25,291 --> 01:06:28,208
And if we have Goetz...

809
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,208
Explain yourself.

810
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:38,166
First...

811
01:06:38,791 --> 01:06:40,791
We need to get a friend out of prison.

812
01:06:42,333 --> 01:06:43,791
Has he been convicted?

813
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,208
Not yet.

814
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:48,291
But he risks 20 years.

815
01:06:49,791 --> 01:06:50,750
OK.

816
01:07:11,083 --> 01:07:12,708
That's his nickname.

817
01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:17,750
It was the bearded guy that duped him.

818
01:07:18,791 --> 01:07:20,791
Another reason to free him.

819
01:07:37,791 --> 01:07:39,541
I don't like this party anymore.

820
01:07:40,166 --> 01:07:41,208
Oh shit.

821
01:07:48,083 --> 01:07:49,458
It's nothing.

822
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:51,916
I was unlucky.

823
01:07:53,166 --> 01:07:54,958
It might be called something else.

824
01:07:57,125 --> 01:07:58,708
But I'll put it back together.

825
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:01,541
I'm the king
of putting things back together.

826
01:08:03,791 --> 01:08:05,833
If not, I'll buy a new one.

827
01:08:06,458 --> 01:08:07,916
A nicer one.

828
01:08:09,125 --> 01:08:11,125
I have a friend
who can forge anything.

829
01:08:11,833 --> 01:08:13,708
Rembrandt...

830
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:15,833
Renoir.

831
01:08:15,833 --> 01:08:17,250
And he's a real artist.

832
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,291
<i>The most beautiful</i>

833
01:08:39,708 --> 01:08:42,833
<i>Of all the tangos in the world</i>

834
01:08:44,083 --> 01:08:49,958
<i>Is the one I danced in your arms</i>

835
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:57,625
<i>I have known other tangos around</i>

836
01:08:59,250 --> 01:09:04,833
<i>But my heart will never
Forget that one</i>

837
01:09:06,416 --> 01:09:07,666
I love you.

838
01:09:10,875 --> 01:09:14,833
We'll send you to Spain
if you've told the truth, we'll forget you

839
01:09:14,833 --> 01:09:17,333
and... you'll forget us.

840
01:09:19,458 --> 01:09:20,416
Is that OK?

841
01:09:23,125 --> 01:09:24,500
And whilst we wait?

842
01:09:25,083 --> 01:09:26,750
We'll still keep an eye on you.

843
01:09:27,958 --> 01:09:29,625
Until we find The Slide.

844
01:09:29,625 --> 01:09:30,916
You can trust him.

845
01:09:31,916 --> 01:09:34,166
Look at me, I'm free.

846
01:09:34,833 --> 01:09:36,291
I even have my gun.

847
01:09:40,333 --> 01:09:42,208
It's not in my nature to snitch.

848
01:09:43,625 --> 01:09:47,083
But The Slide wouldn't last
very long anyway.

849
01:09:49,375 --> 01:09:52,750
An old asylum.
That suits him. He went mad.

850
01:09:54,208 --> 01:09:55,666
And where are you in it all?

851
01:09:56,375 --> 01:10:00,375
I was supposed to go back there
with a part to repair his transceiver.

852
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,166
Tell me what the part is,

853
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:05,375
and we'll take it to him.

854
01:10:06,583 --> 01:10:07,583
It's an oscillator.

855
01:10:08,416 --> 01:10:09,375
A little lamp.

856
01:10:10,041 --> 01:10:12,458
It's in my things with my papers.

857
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:14,625
Perfect.

858
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:22,416
Can you find this asylum for us?

859
01:10:32,958 --> 01:10:33,916
Vincent!

860
01:10:34,958 --> 01:10:37,125
Don't refuse, this is your chance.

861
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:39,708
The Slide is a bastard.

862
01:10:41,541 --> 01:10:42,500
Take this.

863
01:10:43,416 --> 01:10:44,541
To see what's coming.

864
01:10:50,083 --> 01:10:51,291
Judas's last coins.

865
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:54,000
Why? Were you seeing Christ?

866
01:11:08,166 --> 01:11:10,416
Be ready to intervene however we decide.

867
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:11,875
Understood.

868
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:24,583
So, did the telephone work?

869
01:11:24,583 --> 01:11:26,041
Yes.

870
01:11:27,166 --> 01:11:29,958
He's very happy
that I'm bringing OberfÃ¼hrer Kulemann,

871
01:11:29,958 --> 01:11:31,750
he's the big radio specialist.

872
01:11:37,208 --> 01:11:40,416
<i>You'll see, it's on this road,
25 kilometers from Avignon.</i>

873
01:11:41,375 --> 01:11:42,875
<i>There's a very long wall</i>

874
01:11:42,875 --> 01:11:45,708
<i>behind this wall is a
whole gang of crooks,</i>

875
01:11:45,708 --> 01:11:48,916
<i>former Gestapo disguised as nurses.</i>

876
01:12:04,958 --> 01:12:06,791
It's OK, open it.

877
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:53,666
Old Georges, here you are at last!

878
01:12:54,291 --> 01:12:56,541
Well, I don't see Satan.

879
01:12:56,625 --> 01:12:57,958
He's dead.

880
01:12:57,958 --> 01:12:59,583
God too.

881
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:03,833
Let me introduce OberfÃ¼hrer Kulemann.

882
01:13:11,625 --> 01:13:13,083
Leave us.

883
01:13:25,583 --> 01:13:27,458
Here is your...

884
01:13:28,291 --> 01:13:30,666
- Oscillator.
- Thanks, OberfÃ¼hrer.

885
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:33,250
My name will be remembered.

886
01:13:34,541 --> 01:13:35,875
I was a small-time crook.

887
01:13:37,083 --> 01:13:39,083
I'm going to change the world.

888
01:13:40,125 --> 01:13:42,458
I thought you were
only interested in cops?

889
01:13:42,458 --> 01:13:45,500
Poor fool! How do you think
I would keep mine

890
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:47,583
if the Germans lost the war?

891
01:13:49,416 --> 01:13:50,791
With that...

892
01:13:52,166 --> 01:13:54,458
I'm going to fix my radio station.

893
01:13:55,333 --> 01:13:56,625
And so...

894
01:13:56,625 --> 01:14:00,208
I'll confuse the issue
of the Battle of the Bulge.

895
01:14:00,833 --> 01:14:02,125
And so...

896
01:14:02,125 --> 01:14:04,625
I'll sabotage the junction.

897
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:09,541
The Americans are waiting
for their VIII Corps.

898
01:14:09,625 --> 01:14:12,375
And I'll send Germans in their place.

899
01:14:13,416 --> 01:14:15,250
<i>Panzer Division!</i>

900
01:14:18,958 --> 01:14:22,833
You were reckless with the Neuvole.

901
01:14:26,416 --> 01:14:28,875
He might have met a double agent.

902
01:14:29,541 --> 01:14:31,125
But I know him!

903
01:14:31,958 --> 01:14:35,375
And double agents always get mixed up
at any time, right?

904
01:14:36,583 --> 01:14:38,000
You should have...

905
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,291
Killed Neuvole!

906
01:14:40,541 --> 01:14:41,500
It's done.

907
01:14:43,541 --> 01:14:45,500
You won't need to thank him.

908
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:50,291
In your heyday,
he introduced Goetz to you.

909
01:14:50,375 --> 01:14:52,416
A pretentious idiot
who'll come kiss my ass!

910
01:14:54,208 --> 01:14:56,000
Are you waiting for Goetz?

911
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,291
I'm waiting for them all.

912
01:14:58,458 --> 01:14:59,833
I'll be their last refuge.

913
01:15:00,583 --> 01:15:03,625
We need to wait here quietly
for the Germans to come back.

914
01:15:04,416 --> 01:15:07,416
Then this Goetz might come
with another chick.

915
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:10,125
And I'll... kill them both.

916
01:15:10,125 --> 01:15:11,875
Because the last little minx

917
01:15:11,875 --> 01:15:13,750
who was with him

918
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:16,125
was a little informant bitch.

919
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:18,916
Sir...

920
01:15:38,458 --> 01:15:41,458
It's the 83rd and 84th infantry

921
01:15:41,458 --> 01:15:43,416
of the VIII Corps in the Ardennes.

922
01:15:44,333 --> 01:15:45,833
Read that to them.

923
01:15:50,708 --> 01:15:51,833
No.

924
01:15:52,375 --> 01:15:53,833
It's impossible.

925
01:15:53,833 --> 01:15:55,750
I can't this time.

926
01:15:58,583 --> 01:16:00,208
More tightening?

927
01:16:26,625 --> 01:16:28,000
Who is it?

928
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,166
It's me, The Foal.

929
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:32,500
We found a poisoned dog in the park.

930
01:16:34,458 --> 01:16:36,583
How many times? What does that mean?

931
01:16:36,583 --> 01:16:38,500
- You're not...
- We're not.

932
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:40,375
No! Bunch of pansies.

933
01:16:40,375 --> 01:16:42,041
Hands on your head.

934
01:16:59,416 --> 01:17:01,250
Get the woman out.

935
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:02,791
The one downstairs, quickly.

936
01:17:03,416 --> 01:17:04,375
Telephone.

937
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:10,541
Roland.

938
01:17:11,208 --> 01:17:12,375
Come up with the girl.

939
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:46,750
There's ten men outside with dogs.

940
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:52,083
Bunch of crooks.

941
01:17:55,416 --> 01:17:56,958
Double agent!

942
01:17:59,416 --> 01:18:00,958
You're not getting out alive.

943
01:19:16,041 --> 01:19:18,291
Thanks, sir.

944
01:19:43,583 --> 01:19:44,708
So?

945
01:19:46,708 --> 01:19:50,291
It was Goetz who sent me it, the bastard.

946
01:19:51,166 --> 01:19:55,125
She made us fall into a Maquis trap
we lost two squads.

947
01:19:55,125 --> 01:19:56,750
We finally got the bitch!

948
01:19:57,916 --> 01:19:59,250
Where is she?

949
01:19:59,250 --> 01:20:00,791
In a lake.

950
01:20:01,375 --> 01:20:03,458
With some Maquis members.

951
01:20:03,458 --> 01:20:04,916
Carnage.

952
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,708
The Germans dropped them in a lake
- above Vaison-la-
- Romaine.

953
01:20:09,833 --> 01:20:11,625
When they stick you to the post,

954
01:20:11,625 --> 01:20:14,583
I'll come myself
to give you the final blow.

955
01:20:14,583 --> 01:20:16,833
Commandant Rove told you.

956
01:20:16,833 --> 01:20:19,541
It's no use telling the truth, Commandant.

957
01:20:21,666 --> 01:20:24,375
I'll tell you how she died, your brunette.

958
01:20:25,125 --> 01:20:27,083
Like that, you'll remember me.

959
01:20:27,083 --> 01:20:29,375
They always remember The Slide.

960
01:20:30,791 --> 01:20:32,708
She was a good-looking girl.

961
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:36,666
This is what Goetz and I did to her.

962
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:41,333
Goetz was a specialist.

963
01:20:41,333 --> 01:20:42,541
An expert.

964
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:44,208
We...

965
01:20:51,125 --> 01:20:52,500
I did the same for myself.

966
01:20:54,375 --> 01:20:55,583
Thanks.

967
01:21:02,166 --> 01:21:04,000
Commandant...

968
01:21:04,916 --> 01:21:06,833
I had the VIII Corps.

969
01:21:07,458 --> 01:21:09,125
Everything is arranged.

970
01:21:25,375 --> 01:21:26,458
I'm going.

971
01:21:26,458 --> 01:21:27,958
I'll cover you.

972
01:22:11,625 --> 01:22:13,708
Surrender, drop your weapons!

973
01:22:14,666 --> 01:22:16,083
The service is intervening.

974
01:22:18,333 --> 01:22:20,291
Everything is settled outside.

975
01:22:22,041 --> 01:22:25,625
There are prisoners in the cellar
and this lady needs hospitalizing.

976
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:28,541
You!

977
01:22:28,625 --> 01:22:30,708
Take this one away.

978
01:22:48,458 --> 01:22:49,791
For your wife...

979
01:22:51,083 --> 01:22:52,750
I was really hopeful.

980
01:23:49,375 --> 01:23:51,541
Bury her with her friends.

981
01:23:56,125 --> 01:23:59,250
Does she still have family, parents?

982
01:23:59,875 --> 01:24:02,083
No, just me.

983
01:24:03,666 --> 01:24:05,333
And I just had her.

984
01:24:20,875 --> 01:24:24,250
You're emotional because of your wife.

985
01:24:25,250 --> 01:24:29,291
I understand, but don't worry
about that scoundrel Gualtieri.

986
01:24:29,375 --> 01:24:32,250
I'm only working on efficiency now.

987
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:34,541
He could work with Pellin.

988
01:24:34,625 --> 01:24:36,833
No, I don't want him
to meet another agent.

989
01:24:37,583 --> 01:24:39,875
He knows you, that's already too many.

990
01:24:39,875 --> 01:24:41,166
He could work alone.

991
01:24:41,791 --> 01:24:43,833
Send him on a foreign mission.

992
01:24:43,833 --> 01:24:46,000
- There's work in Indochina.
- No.

993
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,666
There's nothing for him there.

994
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:49,541
There's something in BesanÃ§on.

995
01:24:52,416 --> 01:24:56,958
A cork factory where the staff
turns over completely in six months.

996
01:24:58,333 --> 01:25:02,291
It might be hiding one
of those German sabotage networks.

997
01:25:03,250 --> 01:25:06,416
Get him some fake papers,
a cork sales card.

998
01:25:08,416 --> 01:25:10,208
That will help him succeed.

999
01:25:11,375 --> 01:25:13,041
What exactly will he have to do?

1000
01:25:13,125 --> 01:25:16,666
Get a feel for the place and manage
to infiltrate thanks to his past.

1001
01:25:18,166 --> 01:25:20,125
I'm sure he will succeed.

1002
01:25:22,125 --> 01:25:23,958
Thank you on his behalf, Colonel.

1003
01:25:35,083 --> 01:25:36,875
- Hello.
- Hello.

1004
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,166
This is where we first met.

1005
01:25:41,250 --> 01:25:42,291
Yes.

1006
01:25:44,958 --> 01:25:46,583
Here are the papers.

1007
01:25:50,916 --> 01:25:52,041
Robert Latour!

1008
01:25:52,875 --> 01:25:54,416
Cork salesman.

1009
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:56,333
- His real papers?
- He'll get them.

1010
01:25:56,333 --> 01:25:58,875
This is for the mission
I spoke to you about.

1011
01:25:58,875 --> 01:26:01,416
- So he's enlisted in the service?
- Absolutely.

1012
01:26:02,041 --> 01:26:05,000
Thanks a lot. I want to kiss you!

1013
01:26:05,958 --> 01:26:07,666
I knew you'd keep your word.

1014
01:26:08,208 --> 01:26:10,416
They are more real than life, great work.

1015
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:13,833
You could almost cross a border with them.

1016
01:26:13,833 --> 01:26:17,000
There's no need to put ideas in his head!

1017
01:26:18,541 --> 01:26:19,958
It's time to make a choice.

1018
01:26:22,875 --> 01:26:24,625
I've decided.

1019
01:26:57,625 --> 01:27:00,458
CORK FACTORY
COMTÃ BROTHERS

1020
01:27:02,583 --> 01:27:04,666
- Hello, miss.
- Sir.

1021
01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:06,875
Robert Latour, cork salesman.

1022
01:27:06,875 --> 01:27:09,208
I'd like to speak to the director,
I called.

1023
01:27:09,208 --> 01:27:10,250
I know, yes.

1024
01:27:10,958 --> 01:27:12,583
- You can go up.
- Thanks.

1025
01:27:17,791 --> 01:27:19,000
Hello?

1026
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,166
It's him, he's coming up.

1027
01:27:27,791 --> 01:27:29,125
Hello.

1028
01:27:33,083 --> 01:27:35,666
Hello, Mr. Latour. Please, have a seat.

1029
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:36,750
Thank you.

1030
01:27:41,166 --> 01:27:43,708
So, you have a proposition for us?

1031
01:27:43,708 --> 01:27:46,125
Yes, I think it's very interesting.

1032
01:27:46,708 --> 01:27:48,833
Let me start by showing you the samples.

1033
01:27:56,125 --> 01:27:59,208
I hope you represent a major company.

1034
01:29:03,541 --> 01:29:04,666
{\an8}MARSEILLE APRIL 1945

1035
01:29:04,750 --> 01:29:07,250
{\an8}<i>Georges got away
with three months in hospital</i>

1036
01:29:07,250 --> 01:29:10,166
{\an8}<i>before being locked
in Marseille's St. Pierre prison.</i>

1037
01:29:10,250 --> 01:29:13,708
<i>The cork factory was no longer occupied
by a German network</i>

1038
01:29:13,708 --> 01:29:16,041
<i>like the Second Bureau had claimed,</i>

1039
01:29:16,125 --> 01:29:18,166
<i>but by the internal security service.</i>

1040
01:29:19,083 --> 01:29:21,291
<i>He had therefore fallen into a trap.</i>

1041
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:30,875
DETENTION CENTER

1042
01:29:32,833 --> 01:29:35,541
<i>Despite all the efforts
by his lawyer Mr. Vilar,</i>

1043
01:29:35,625 --> 01:29:39,291
<i>we couldn't prove that he had worked
for the Second Bureau.</i>

1044
01:29:39,375 --> 01:29:41,791
<i>In a letter rogatory
by the examining judge,</i>

1045
01:29:41,875 --> 01:29:45,916
<i>the services in Paris refused
to recognize Georges' participation.</i>

1046
01:29:48,416 --> 01:29:51,416
Obviously, since they tried
to get him killed.

1047
01:29:52,875 --> 01:29:55,500
Now they're charging him
with the attempted murder

1048
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:58,583
of the two French agents
that he mistook for Germans.

1049
01:29:58,583 --> 01:30:00,625
That confusion will cost us dearly.

1050
01:30:01,166 --> 01:30:02,708
And Commandant Rove?

1051
01:30:04,166 --> 01:30:07,166
By coincidence, his colonel sent him
on a foreign mission.

1052
01:30:07,875 --> 01:30:11,000
I never stopped asking for his statement.

1053
01:30:12,125 --> 01:30:15,875
<i>It finally happened.
All my hopes were on him.</i>

1054
01:30:15,875 --> 01:30:19,416
<i>I couldn't imagine that he made
an agreement with the service</i>

1055
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:21,125
<i>to betray Georges.</i>

1056
01:30:21,125 --> 01:30:24,500
<i>No, I couldn't have been
that wrong about him.</i>

1057
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:27,916
No and no, these orders are definitive.

1058
01:30:28,875 --> 01:30:31,583
The service must wash its hands
of this story.

1059
01:30:31,583 --> 01:30:35,625
- Colonel, it's too easy.
- It's not about knowing if it's easy.

1060
01:30:36,375 --> 01:30:37,625
It's about the service.

1061
01:30:39,291 --> 01:30:41,250
I set the trap for him in BesanÃ§on

1062
01:30:41,250 --> 01:30:44,125
and I gave the orders to bring him down.

1063
01:30:44,708 --> 01:30:46,916
He was lucky in the end.

1064
01:30:47,958 --> 01:30:51,291
Imagine that you've never seen
that thug in your life.

1065
01:30:54,541 --> 01:30:57,125
- He can prove otherwise.
- Not at all.

1066
01:30:57,125 --> 01:31:01,041
I took care of that,
we removed all his traces.

1067
01:31:09,541 --> 01:31:10,750
He was young.

1068
01:31:15,083 --> 01:31:16,791
There was youth everywhere.

1069
01:31:18,666 --> 01:31:20,833
Resistant fighters shot dead at 16.

1070
01:31:21,958 --> 01:31:23,500
Think about it.

1071
01:31:25,625 --> 01:31:26,833
Come on.

1072
01:31:27,666 --> 01:31:29,583
One day, you'll understand.

1073
01:31:33,416 --> 01:31:35,041
Commandant Rove!

1074
01:31:38,625 --> 01:31:40,666
The service betrayed Georges.

1075
01:31:41,208 --> 01:31:42,166
I know.

1076
01:31:42,958 --> 01:31:44,833
Now you're here, we can sort it out.

1077
01:31:45,916 --> 01:31:49,458
He ran into the internal security service
in BesanÃ§on.

1078
01:31:49,458 --> 01:31:52,166
Surely you didn't know
that the factory was a trap?

1079
01:31:53,833 --> 01:31:56,000
It depends who was trapped.

1080
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,500
The service is driven
by political imperatives.

1081
01:32:01,875 --> 01:32:03,958
And my duty is to obey the service.

1082
01:32:06,916 --> 01:32:07,875
I see.

1083
01:32:08,708 --> 01:32:10,125
Yes, it's true.

1084
01:32:10,916 --> 01:32:13,791
Millions of people dead, martyrs.

1085
01:32:13,875 --> 01:32:16,250
You must be thinking
about your wife too.

1086
01:32:16,833 --> 01:32:19,583
Guys like Georges don't carry weight.

1087
01:32:20,708 --> 01:32:22,958
But you have to weigh up everything.

1088
01:32:22,958 --> 01:32:25,958
He helped you, you made him believe
in his redemption.

1089
01:32:25,958 --> 01:32:28,000
Yes, I always had hope for him.

1090
01:32:28,583 --> 01:32:30,958
I hoped that it wouldn't be too late.

1091
01:32:30,958 --> 01:32:33,083
Your words can make everything better.

1092
01:32:34,416 --> 01:32:35,375
Listen to me.

1093
01:32:36,166 --> 01:32:39,375
Georges will be judged
for belonging to the German police.

1094
01:32:39,375 --> 01:32:42,958
In his files, there's no torture
or deportation to his name.

1095
01:32:42,958 --> 01:32:45,166
You have to pay but you have to plead.

1096
01:32:45,250 --> 01:32:49,333
If he talks about his work with me
without proof, it will go against him.

1097
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,708
He's already talked about it.

1098
01:32:51,708 --> 01:32:55,958
His lawyer has called you as a witness.
It'll force the prosecution to do it too.

1099
01:32:58,541 --> 01:32:59,833
Don't make that mistake.

1100
01:33:01,375 --> 01:33:04,458
It's hard to admit,
but that's the best thing to do.

1101
01:33:04,458 --> 01:33:06,416
The best thing to do?

1102
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:08,708
I'll tell you what will happen.

1103
01:33:08,708 --> 01:33:10,583
Because I know Georges well.

1104
01:33:10,583 --> 01:33:14,125
It will work out so that you have
to face up to the trial.

1105
01:33:14,125 --> 01:33:16,666
- Don't play that card.
- Why not?

1106
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:23,458
<i>In Georges' game, what was the right card?</i>

1107
01:33:27,625 --> 01:33:30,791
Excuse me, sir,
wasn't this a laboratory before?

1108
01:33:30,875 --> 01:33:33,375
I don't know, everyone is new here.

1109
01:33:35,750 --> 01:33:37,083
Thanks.

1110
01:33:40,250 --> 01:33:42,083
BRIC-A-BRAC
...CEUTICS

1111
01:33:42,083 --> 01:33:45,500
OUTDOOR CENTER
FOR DEPORTED CHILDREN

1112
01:33:57,625 --> 01:33:59,958
FOR OUR MARTYRS

1113
01:34:04,375 --> 01:34:06,583
<i>And under these trees, who do we talk to?</i>

1114
01:34:08,416 --> 01:34:11,625
<i>How do I talk about Georges
to these widows and these orphans?</i>

1115
01:34:20,833 --> 01:34:21,791
HOUSE FOR SALE

1116
01:34:21,875 --> 01:34:25,000
Georges had found Neuvole there,
at the Research Directorate.

1117
01:34:25,541 --> 01:34:29,166
Now there's just
these knick-knacks, and me.

1118
01:34:29,250 --> 01:34:31,625
Your uncle knows Rove well.

1119
01:34:31,625 --> 01:34:33,250
Yes, I've thought about it.

1120
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:36,250
But he refuses to get officially involved
in all of this.

1121
01:34:38,583 --> 01:34:40,125
I'm going to the trial.

1122
01:34:40,125 --> 01:34:41,833
I'll testify personally.

1123
01:34:41,833 --> 01:34:44,416
After all, I got mixed up
in all the events.

1124
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:45,833
You'll get arrested,

1125
01:34:45,833 --> 01:34:48,833
accused of non-disclosure,
being an accomplice.

1126
01:34:48,833 --> 01:34:50,333
That won't be good for us.

1127
01:34:50,333 --> 01:34:54,375
You have to accept
that we're in a time of special courts,

1128
01:34:54,375 --> 01:34:56,083
almost revolutionary.

1129
01:34:58,083 --> 01:34:59,041
And Ibrana?

1130
01:34:59,916 --> 01:35:01,208
And the militiaman?

1131
01:35:02,083 --> 01:35:03,250
Both shot dead.

1132
01:35:03,958 --> 01:35:05,625
At the moment, there's no delay.

1133
01:35:06,708 --> 01:35:07,833
Listen...

1134
01:35:07,833 --> 01:35:10,458
Since you were kids, you and your brother,

1135
01:35:10,458 --> 01:35:13,958
I defended you in all your petty thefts.

1136
01:35:13,958 --> 01:35:16,083
So today, I won't surprise you.

1137
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:18,375
Rove isn't coming to the trial.

1138
01:35:19,166 --> 01:35:20,875
We can't prove anything.

1139
01:35:21,708 --> 01:35:24,500
It will be better to change
the defense method.

1140
01:35:29,541 --> 01:35:30,958
You know my whole life.

1141
01:35:32,458 --> 01:35:35,041
And you won't talk
about the one good thing I did?

1142
01:35:40,916 --> 01:35:43,666
I want Commandant Rove to come and say it.

1143
01:35:43,750 --> 01:35:45,083
That's all.

1144
01:35:45,791 --> 01:35:49,208
Sir, I won't allow you
to insult this court.

1145
01:35:49,791 --> 01:35:53,000
I'm not insulting it,
I'm saying it's a special court

1146
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,500
and I'm starting to doubt
that justice will be done.

1147
01:35:56,083 --> 01:35:57,208
Please be specific.

1148
01:35:58,333 --> 01:36:01,041
I called upon Commandant Rove
from the Second Bureau.

1149
01:36:01,625 --> 01:36:02,875
And you, the prosecution,

1150
01:36:02,875 --> 01:36:06,791
you also have the right to call a witness
of the same importance.

1151
01:36:06,875 --> 01:36:08,291
I did not fail to do so.

1152
01:36:08,375 --> 01:36:11,208
I think despite everything
that the defendant is a liar

1153
01:36:11,208 --> 01:36:14,958
who dares to invent heroic actions
to cancel out his betrayal.

1154
01:36:14,958 --> 01:36:17,000
Government Commissioner,

1155
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:20,375
I repeat, you have to put everything
in the hands of justice.

1156
01:36:20,375 --> 01:36:23,000
I assure you we are, sir.

1157
01:36:24,041 --> 01:36:27,750
But on one side there's already the blood
and tears of martyrs.

1158
01:36:27,750 --> 01:36:29,750
It's very heavy, you know.

1159
01:36:29,750 --> 01:36:32,958
Listen, erm...
I don't want to make a speech.

1160
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:37,125
But if I've done wrong to anyone here,
they just have to say.

1161
01:36:40,875 --> 01:36:42,333
Did I do something to you?

1162
01:36:43,416 --> 01:36:44,375
Sit down.

1163
01:36:44,375 --> 01:36:45,458
Fuck you!

1164
01:36:50,416 --> 01:36:51,375
Silence!

1165
01:36:54,208 --> 01:36:56,916
<i>I remember that the trial
turned into confusion.</i>

1166
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,916
<i>No one believed
in Georges' positive actions</i>

1167
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,208
<i>and his past became all the more shameful.</i>

1168
01:37:09,708 --> 01:37:12,416
<i>And then came the moment
that I'll never forget.</i>

1169
01:37:17,125 --> 01:37:20,708
Sir, the main witness of the trial
has just arrived.

1170
01:37:21,708 --> 01:37:23,416
Please come in, Commandant Rove.

1171
01:37:43,083 --> 01:37:44,791
You are Commandant Rove,

1172
01:37:44,875 --> 01:37:47,041
attached to an intelligence service.

1173
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:51,125
You're not related to
or an associate of the defendant.

1174
01:37:52,166 --> 01:37:55,750
Swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

1175
01:37:55,750 --> 01:37:58,416
Raise your right hand and say, "I swear".

1176
01:37:58,500 --> 01:37:59,791
I swear.

1177
01:38:00,375 --> 01:38:01,750
Commandant.

1178
01:38:02,333 --> 01:38:05,333
Let me remind you
that you have been called by both

1179
01:38:05,333 --> 01:38:07,500
the defense and the prosecution.

1180
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:10,000
I just have one question to ask you.

1181
01:38:10,750 --> 01:38:15,583
Your answer will compromise
both your honor and the life of a man.

1182
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:20,916
Do you know Georges Gualtieri?

1183
01:38:33,291 --> 01:38:34,500
No.

1184
01:38:51,708 --> 01:38:54,375
Does the defense have
a question for the witness?

1185
01:38:58,666 --> 01:38:59,916
No.

1186
01:39:00,791 --> 01:39:02,166
No questions.

1187
01:39:04,125 --> 01:39:06,041
The Court thanks the witness.

1188
01:39:14,583 --> 01:39:17,458
<i>I still remember that late afternoon</i>

1189
01:39:17,458 --> 01:39:20,833
<i>when the judge declared
Georges' death sentence.</i>

1190
01:39:21,416 --> 01:39:24,541
<i>I really thought it was for someone else.</i>

1191
01:39:25,791 --> 01:39:29,125
<i>I wanted to shout,
to run after the commandant</i>

1192
01:39:29,125 --> 01:39:31,333
<i>but I stayed still.</i>

1193
01:39:31,333 --> 01:39:33,916
<i>We often do the opposite
of what we should.</i>

1194
01:40:25,541 --> 01:40:27,291
You're wearing a light dress.

1195
01:40:29,125 --> 01:40:30,750
It's summer again.

1196
01:40:37,291 --> 01:40:38,500
What about me, Georges?

1197
01:40:40,916 --> 01:40:42,166
Don't worry, sweetheart.

1198
01:40:43,541 --> 01:40:46,083
You'll see, the guns will get stuck.

1199
01:41:54,166 --> 01:41:57,291
Do you still have Dr. Goetz's file?

1200
01:41:57,375 --> 01:41:58,666
Yes, colonel.

1201
01:41:59,333 --> 01:42:01,416
I can tell you, I know it by heart.

1202
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,708
Thanks, but I'd like the file.

1203
01:42:04,458 --> 01:42:06,333
- Is there anything new?
- Yes.

1204
01:42:09,416 --> 01:42:11,583
He was brought to us yesterday from Lyon.

1205
01:42:13,958 --> 01:42:15,250
Where is he?

1206
01:42:15,916 --> 01:42:17,458
I absolutely want to see him.

1207
01:42:18,041 --> 01:42:20,625
It'll be hard, we have
to give him to the Americans.

1208
01:42:21,375 --> 01:42:23,583
The Americans? Why the Americans?

1209
01:42:23,583 --> 01:42:27,208
Because it's the biggest
anti-communist file in Europe.

1210
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,041
So he'll work for the USA.

1211
01:42:31,291 --> 01:42:32,833
Freely?

1212
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,666
Yes, freely.

1213
01:42:36,291 --> 01:42:38,208
But, does that still exist?

1214
01:42:39,041 --> 01:42:41,291
He has many deportations
on his conscience,

1215
01:42:41,375 --> 01:42:43,625
even kids, the bill is high.

1216
01:42:43,625 --> 01:42:45,500
It became priceless.

1217
01:42:46,250 --> 01:42:50,291
These papers will go to the crematorium
to join their victims.

1218
01:42:52,958 --> 01:42:56,416
What do you want? It's still
the famous political circumstances.

1219
01:42:57,083 --> 01:42:58,708
We can't escape them.

1220
01:43:03,916 --> 01:43:05,666
He killed my wife too.

1221
01:43:15,750 --> 01:43:18,541
It's only the Americans
who will look for Goetz.

1222
01:43:28,875 --> 01:43:30,791
Dr. Goetz.

1223
01:44:23,958 --> 01:44:25,250
Louise.

1224
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,166
I have to talk to you to tell the truth.

1225
01:44:28,750 --> 01:44:30,708
That's fine with me.

1226
01:44:34,166 --> 01:44:36,291
What will happen now?

1227
01:44:38,041 --> 01:44:40,583
As soon as the lawyer gets the letter,

1228
01:44:40,583 --> 01:44:43,791
he'll do what's necessary
to suspend the execution.

1229
01:44:44,708 --> 01:44:47,291
In a few days,
I'll go to Marseille with you.

1230
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,500
Georges isn't risking anything?

1231
01:44:52,375 --> 01:44:55,041
Absolutely nothing because he's appealing.

1232
01:44:58,458 --> 01:45:00,041
Will there be a new trial?

1233
01:45:00,791 --> 01:45:01,791
Yes.

1234
01:45:03,208 --> 01:45:05,416
This time, it'll take ten years maximum.

1235
01:45:06,583 --> 01:45:08,250
He'll get pardoned, he's young.

1236
01:45:08,250 --> 01:45:10,666
If he finds you when he comes out,
he'll be saved.

1237
01:45:13,166 --> 01:45:15,750
He's lucky he met you.

1238
01:46:04,458 --> 01:46:05,750
Pascal, open up.

1239
01:46:14,666 --> 01:46:16,416
Hey!

1240
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:17,916
Your chains are coming off.

1241
01:46:18,500 --> 01:46:20,541
Rove went back on his statement.

1242
01:46:21,250 --> 01:46:24,875
I'll have his letter tomorrow,
we're going to overturn the conviction.

1243
01:46:27,875 --> 01:46:29,250
Is it remorse or Louise?

1244
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,333
A bit of both.

1245
01:46:31,333 --> 01:46:33,708
She'll tell you herself,
she's coming here.

1246
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,208
I can see the prosecutor's face from here.

1247
01:46:48,625 --> 01:46:52,958
Colonel, about Georges Gualtieri,
I committed perjury.

1248
01:46:52,958 --> 01:46:55,375
I wrote to the judge to tell the truth.

1249
01:46:55,375 --> 01:46:56,791
This isn't serious, Rove?

1250
01:46:57,791 --> 01:46:58,750
You realize...

1251
01:46:58,750 --> 01:47:03,125
If it's about the rotten political
situation, it's not worth it.

1252
01:47:04,083 --> 01:47:06,291
And you can leave your dogs, I don't care.

1253
01:47:08,500 --> 01:47:09,916
Everyone lives as they can.

1254
01:47:13,041 --> 01:47:15,083
Excuse me a second.

1255
01:47:19,583 --> 01:47:21,583
Connect me to the Ministry of Justice.

1256
01:47:22,583 --> 01:47:24,458
Yes, yes, urgently.

1257
01:47:26,750 --> 01:47:28,250
MARSEILLE
17 AUGUST 1945

1258
01:47:41,166 --> 01:47:43,041
Oh my God, what is it?

1259
01:47:54,208 --> 01:47:55,500
Mr. Vilar.

1260
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:56,625
Yes.

1261
01:47:56,625 --> 01:47:57,708
This is for you.

1262
01:47:58,416 --> 01:47:59,875
You need to sign there.

1263
01:48:11,791 --> 01:48:15,041
In accordance with the judgment
made on June 3rd, 1945,

1264
01:48:15,125 --> 01:48:17,875
the action taken has been rejected...

1265
01:48:18,625 --> 01:48:22,458
Enforces the death sentence
against Georges Gualtieri

1266
01:48:22,458 --> 01:48:26,291
who will be shot on August 17th, 1945
in the court of Fort St. Nicolas.

1267
01:48:26,375 --> 01:48:28,000
Duty of Mr. ...

1268
01:48:29,125 --> 01:48:31,708
No, wait, there's been a mistake!

1269
01:48:31,708 --> 01:48:33,041
Are you Mr. Vilar?

1270
01:48:33,125 --> 01:48:35,416
- No mistake.
- We do this every day.

1271
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:38,083
- At 5 am?
- No, usually in the afternoon.

1272
01:48:38,083 --> 01:48:40,416
- Sign it.
- My client is on appeal.

1273
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:42,333
That's nothing to do with us.

1274
01:48:42,333 --> 01:48:44,291
Hurry, it's in an hour.

1275
01:48:59,666 --> 01:49:02,166
HÃ´tel du Vieux Port?
Room 126, quickly.

1276
01:49:07,791 --> 01:49:09,500
- Hello?
- <i>Louise.</i>

1277
01:49:10,458 --> 01:49:12,000
Yes, it's me.

1278
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:13,583
Do you know where Rove is?

1279
01:49:13,583 --> 01:49:16,125
Here in Marseille, in the same hotel.

1280
01:49:16,125 --> 01:49:18,208
You need to go and wake him up.

1281
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:19,541
What is it?

1282
01:49:19,625 --> 01:49:23,291
It's Georges, an execution order,
in an hour at Fort St. Nicolas.

1283
01:49:23,875 --> 01:49:24,833
Oh no!

1284
01:49:25,708 --> 01:49:27,041
Don't say that.

1285
01:49:27,125 --> 01:49:29,208
Do something. Rove needs to act.

1286
01:49:29,208 --> 01:49:31,875
I'll do the impossible.
I'll run to the president.

1287
01:50:11,583 --> 01:50:12,833
Aim!

1288
01:50:14,750 --> 01:50:16,000
Fire!

1289
01:50:17,833 --> 01:50:23,666
Stop! Stop everything! Stop!

1290
01:50:23,750 --> 01:50:25,958
Stop!

1291
01:50:30,916 --> 01:50:31,958
Stop!

1292
01:50:32,916 --> 01:50:34,458
Stop!

1293
01:50:41,375 --> 01:50:42,583
New development.

1294
01:50:43,458 --> 01:50:46,291
Commandant Rove has
gone back on his statement.

1295
01:50:47,791 --> 01:50:48,958
Read it!

1296
01:50:49,875 --> 01:50:51,583
Gualtieri was telling the truth!

1297
01:50:51,583 --> 01:50:55,041
I have last-minute orders
from Paris, from the Ministry.

1298
01:50:55,125 --> 01:50:57,000
I can't do anything.

1299
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:58,166
Sir...

1300
01:50:59,458 --> 01:51:01,750
I'd like to read the letter.

1301
01:51:07,375 --> 01:51:11,833
The commandant is arriving
in person at any minute.

1302
01:51:11,833 --> 01:51:14,875
I beg you to suspend the execution.

1303
01:51:16,708 --> 01:51:18,541
I beg you.

1304
01:51:22,083 --> 01:51:24,333
- Aim.
- It's an ambush.

1305
01:51:24,333 --> 01:51:26,000
Warning me an hour before!

1306
01:51:30,041 --> 01:51:34,250
It's illegal, it's completely illegal.
My client is on appeal.

1307
01:51:36,708 --> 01:51:39,041
I didn't even have time to get dressed.

1308
01:51:39,125 --> 01:51:40,791
Don't worry.

1309
01:51:40,875 --> 01:51:43,125
This is illegal, it won't happen.

1310
01:51:48,083 --> 01:51:49,541
I still did it all.

1311
01:51:52,125 --> 01:51:54,500
Yes, you did it.

1312
01:51:57,416 --> 01:51:59,375
- You did it, yes.
- Aim.

1313
01:52:00,750 --> 01:52:01,916
Fire.

1314
01:52:03,208 --> 01:52:05,250
Georges! Georges!

1315
01:52:06,416 --> 01:52:07,583
Another one down.

1316
01:52:10,541 --> 01:52:13,541
Commandant Rove,
I have a pass from General Dupuis.

1317
01:52:13,625 --> 01:52:16,791
It's fine, Commandant.
You don't have a pass.

1318
01:52:16,875 --> 01:52:18,708
- But how...
- Wait there.

1319
01:52:19,291 --> 01:52:21,583
The staircase is to the right, Commandant.

1320
01:52:24,750 --> 01:52:25,708
No!

1321
01:52:33,833 --> 01:52:35,375
You have a friend down there?

1322
01:52:38,458 --> 01:52:39,541
The redhead?

1323
01:52:42,583 --> 01:52:45,208
It'll be his last go
on the merry-go-round.

1324
01:52:45,208 --> 01:52:46,666
She still has her hair.

1325
01:52:58,250 --> 01:52:59,916
It's not the fear, sir,

1326
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,333
it's the cold.

1327
01:53:03,916 --> 01:53:05,291
Forgive me.

1328
01:53:21,541 --> 01:53:23,166
Stop, it's an order!

1329
01:53:23,250 --> 01:53:25,583
Government Commissioner, Commandant Rove.

1330
01:53:25,583 --> 01:53:27,250
There'll be another trial.

1331
01:53:27,250 --> 01:53:28,958
I obey a minister of justice.

1332
01:53:29,500 --> 01:53:31,125
Take the convict away.

1333
01:53:35,166 --> 01:53:36,125
It's not possible.

1334
01:53:37,333 --> 01:53:38,500
It's not fair.

1335
01:53:40,041 --> 01:53:42,083
It's completely unfair.

1336
01:53:45,083 --> 01:53:47,291
Lieutenant, listen to me.

1337
01:53:47,375 --> 01:53:50,291
Listen to a superior officer,
don't kill this man.

1338
01:53:52,416 --> 01:53:54,375
Lieutenant, it's an assassination.

1339
01:53:55,458 --> 01:53:57,166
Let me go, you idiots.

1340
01:53:57,250 --> 01:53:58,333
Please!

1341
01:53:58,333 --> 01:54:00,375
Everything is bad enough, right?

1342
01:54:04,208 --> 01:54:06,708
Son, do you accept
the help of religion?

1343
01:54:10,541 --> 01:54:12,875
God's mercy is infinite.

1344
01:54:19,291 --> 01:54:21,166
What are you doing with that letter?

1345
01:54:22,625 --> 01:54:24,291
I'm taking it with me.

1346
01:54:57,666 --> 01:54:59,041
Aim!

1347
01:55:00,083 --> 01:55:01,041
Fire!

1348
01:55:49,041 --> 01:55:52,500
Every day, the Germans kill our own,
even women.

1349
01:55:53,208 --> 01:55:54,416
It comes to us all.

1350
01:55:55,375 --> 01:55:57,208
Did you hear that, officer?

1351
01:55:58,166 --> 01:56:00,125
I lost my son.

1352
01:56:01,666 --> 01:56:04,041
Are you not ashamed
of defending these people?

1353
01:56:05,250 --> 01:56:07,416
There's no more homeland, no flag.

1354
01:56:08,291 --> 01:56:09,666
You don't know what it is.

1355
01:56:10,333 --> 01:56:11,541
Have you lost anything?

1356
01:56:13,625 --> 01:56:14,958
They tortured my son.

1357
01:56:15,833 --> 01:56:19,083
What do you say to that, the pair of you?

1358
01:56:25,500 --> 01:56:30,583
It's clear that we absolutely can't live
without pity.

1359
01:56:38,666 --> 01:56:40,958
<i>I came back to this bridge a few times.</i>

1360
01:56:42,041 --> 01:56:44,583
<i>Commandant Rove was killed
in the Algerian war</i>

1361
01:56:45,458 --> 01:56:48,583
<i>and men continued killing each other
all over the world.</i>

1362
01:56:49,291 --> 01:56:51,333
<i>Nothing really changed</i>

1363
01:56:51,333 --> 01:56:54,416
<i>if it weren't for the bodies
of the cars and their speed.</i>

1364
