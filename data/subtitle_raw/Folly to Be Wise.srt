Platoon, halt!

[all] One, two.

00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:23,791
-Platoon will advance, right turn.
-One, two, three, one.

7
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:27,916
Platoon, stand at ease. Stand easy.

8
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,291
Now listen to me, the lot of you…

9
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:33,916
I'm letting you off light today,
as it's your first day in the Army,

10
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,708
but don't think I'm satisfied, no!
And when I give you the fall out,

11
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:43,041
don't run away with the idea that this
village is a little corner of Montmartre

12
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:44,666
because it's not!

13
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:48,833
You'll find plenty the healthy mind needs
in the precincts of the camp.

14
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:52,125
There's a NAFI here.
There's a reading room, a games room

15
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,583
where you can enjoy
an invigorating game of draughts.

16
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:57,541
There's a piano there too
but the manager keeps it locked up

17
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,583
and only lets the key out
to proper pianists.

18
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:01,791
There's a camp theater

19
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:07,041
where you can enjoy a wide variety
of entertainment from concerts to films,

20
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,833
all of which you will have seen before.

21
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,125
And tonight, I might add,

22
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,833
they've got a special piece
of resistance for you,

23
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:16,000
but I won't divulge it for fear
of spoiling your enjoyment.

24
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,625
But, whatever you do with yourselves,
remember this,

25
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,833
you've got a real day's work tomorrow,

26
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:25,166
so don't go
getting yourselves over­excited.

27
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,583
All right, platoon, attention!

28
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:32,458
Now, watch this fall out.
Smart turn right, pause of two, three,

29
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,000
and double off the Parade Ground.

30
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:37,708
Platoon, fall out!

31
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:40,291
[all] One, two, three. One, two, three.

32
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:41,500
Go on, double!

Ah, thank you, and bravo,
Miss Qaalthrop, bravo, ladies.

39
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,125
Just hold it one moment, will you, please?

40
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:01,958
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Many of you,

41
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,958
rather I should say, several of you,

42
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:08,000
may have met me officiating
at last Sunday's Church Service,

43
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:09,166
my first in this camp.

44
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:13,250
And no doubt you are wondering
what on earth I am doing now in a theatre,

45
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:18,166
in what I believe was once upon a time
known as a resort of vagabonds.

46
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,125
[laughs]

47
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,625
I don't think anyone nowadays

48
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:24,625
would describe Miss Qualthrop
and her gallant little band

49
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,666
in quite those terms.

50
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:30,208
I use the word "band"
of course collectively,

51
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,666
not musically.

52
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,791
Now the fact is that the CO

53
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,500
has put me in charge
of the entertainment here

54
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:42,333
since Major James
has been posted to Malaya,

55
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:45,125
and it is my first and very pleasant duty

56
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:48,541
to thank Miss Qualthrop
and her talented companions

57
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,291
for coming all the way
from Wordington here

58
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:54,125
to entertain us,
and I think we ought to show them

59
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:58,875
in the usual manner that in spite of
a lamentably small attendance,

60
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:03,125
that their journey wasn't, uh… wasted.

61
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,125
Come along, come along now.
Curtain, please!

62
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,666

Oh…

67
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm terribly sorry, ladies and gentlemen,

68
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:25,625
but it appears that Miss Qualthrop
and her instrumentalists

69
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:29,750
have had to catch the bus.

70
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:33,333
I am sorry, but apparently
there is nothing left for me to do now

71
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:36,500
but to wish you all a very,
very good night.

72

[audience chuckles]

73
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:45,208
The camp seems very
deserted tonight, Corporal.

74
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,708
It's pay night, sir.

75
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,791
Oh? And where does everyone go
on pay night?

76
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,666
I mean,
I'm trying to find out the sort of shows

77
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,083
that you fellows would like me to put on.

78
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,166
-I should try the village, sir.
-The village?

79
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,708
There are several centers
of conviviality there, sir,

80
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,083
if you'll pardon the use
of the expression.

81
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,958
What you're trying to tell me, Corporal,
is that there are several pubs there.

82
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,791
Precisely, sir, yes. The biggest crowd
you'll find in the Rose and Crown.

83
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:08,666
I'm a non-drinker myself, sir,
but I gather the beer there is better,

84
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,375
according to popular report,
the barmaids too, sir.

85
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,833
Well, I'd certainly choose the place
where the beer is better

86
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:17,875
not to mention the barmaids.
Goodnight, Corporal.

87

-Good evening, staff.
-Good evening, sir.

104
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:15,333
-You seem a bit surprised to see me here.
-Yes, sir.

105
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:16,458
Well, to tell you the truth,
I was only wondering

106
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:19,083
what all you fellows did
with your evenings.

107
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,500
-Well, I…
-Yes, yes,

108
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:22,541
I see all right,

109
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,708
but supposing there were no such places
as the Rose and Crown,

110
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:27,875
-where would you be then?
-In the Red Lion, sir.

111
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:31,208
Oh, I can see, Sergeant,
you're not going to be a very

112
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,500
profitable source of investigation.
Cheers.

113
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,666
Excuse me, I've just seen my batman.

00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:46,791
-Excuse me… Hello Walter.
-Sir?

115
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,708
I'm surprised to see you here.

116
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,833
I thought at least that you and Jessie
would have been at the concert

117
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:53,625
to support me, in spite of the music.

118
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:56,458
Jessie and me,
she's being a bit difficult.

119
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:57,500
Oh. [chuckles]

120
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,041
Oh, but nothing serious, I hope?

121
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:02,375
No, just that someone's
been trying to improve her mind.

00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,625
[chuckles]

123
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,125
But Walter, you must remember

124
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,916
that Jessie is
a very intelligent young girl,

125
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,250
naturally, she wants to…

126
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:14,333
Oh, Walter, you're not insinuating
that I've been doing that?

127
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,458
Oh no, no, no, come, come, come.

128
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:20,000
After all, I've only given Jessie
a few good books to read

129
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,625
and advised her
to listen to the Third Programme.

130
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,583
There's nothing improper in that, Walter.

131
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:29,250
You must remember that young Jessie
has a very enquiring mind.

132
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:32,125
She never used to have
when she was secretary to Major James.

133
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:36,666
Yes she had, yes she had, Walter, only
it was probably dormant under the Major.

[sighs]

135
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:41,583
In any case, Walter, I don't see
why this should lead you to quarrel.

136
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,708
-Well, it has.
-But how, Walter, how?

137
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,375
Well, she wants to know things now.

138
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,958
Oh, I see.

139
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:51,458
The things presumably
that you don't know the answer to.

140
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,791
Things that nobody knows the answer to.

141
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:57,083
Oh, I'm afraid you're deceiving yourself,
Walter.

142
00:09:57,166 --> 00:10:00,791
In this fast moving world, there's
always somebody that knows the answer.

143
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,375
Be patient with her, Walter,
but everything will be alright.

of shows you fellows would like,

They won't kick you out yet, sir.

150
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:19,583
Walter, in my position,
I cannot afford to be kicked out.

151
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:23,666
I wonder if you'd care
to finish this for me?

152
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,208
I don't really like it.

153
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,083
Walter, I want you with the car
sharp at seven o'clock tomorrow morning.

154
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,291
-Seven, sir?
-Yes, yes.

155
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,458
I'm planning a very full day tomorrow.
Goodnight Walter.

156
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:32,708
Goodnight, sir.

[slow soft music plays]

158
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,875
Now then. Yes, yes, yes.

159
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,833
-Tea won't be one minute, sir.
-No time for tea today, Jessie.

160
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:13,041
We've work to do. Good morning, Jessie.

161
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,958
-Good morning sir.
-Get me Major James's theatre file.

162
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,625
-The file with future engagements.
-Yes, but the kettle is on the boil.

163
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,250
So am I, Jessie, so am I.

164
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:22,625
We're going to sweep out
the Augean stables, so jump to it, Jessie.

165
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:23,791
Oh, yes, sir.

166
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:32,083
Good morning, Jessie.

167
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,750
What are you doing out driving the Padre
at this time in the morning?

168
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,666
We've been out since seven.

169
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,208
We'd done the church
and the hospital already.

170
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:40,958
Sorry if I was a bit short last night.

171
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:44,500
That's okay. If it'll make you happy,
I'll read a few books.

172
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:48,250
A few books won't make any difference,
Walter. That's not education.

173
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,875
-Well, what is?
-How should I know?

174
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,541
I never had any education.

175
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:56,208
-Then what are you talking about?
-I don't know,

176
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,875
being able to talk like the Padre
and people.

177
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,375
Yes, but you're in love with me,
not the Padre.

178
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:02,375
I know.

179
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,625
But being in love isn't everything,
Walter.

180
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,416
You know, we might be married
for 40 or 50 years

181
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,625
and all we'd be able to do
is to talk about things.

182
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,500
We couldn't talk about
what they're all about,

183
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,041
because we don't know
what they're all about, neither of us.

184
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,375
So we couldn't really discuss
anything sensibly.

185
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:18,666
Now do you understand?

186
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,625
Well, there's quite a few things
I do know about.

187
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:21,666
Of course there are.

188
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,041
There's nothing you don't know
about the inside of a car,

189
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,375
but where does that get you?

190
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,250
It gets you wherever you're going.

191
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,375
I don't mean about things like that,

192
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:32,250
I mean about life
and history and everything.

193
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:35,041
You can't know about things like that
unless you read about them.

194
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,250
I could get on encyclopedia
and read it through if you like.

195
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,375
Don't be silly, it would take years.

196
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:43,500
I could get a little encyclopedia,
a potted one.

197
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,750
I don't want anything potted
except the tea.

198
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,541
You can bring that in.

199
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,500
There you are Jessie.
Now, everything in correct order?

200
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,666
Yes, sir.

201
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,625
Too late to do anything
about Saturday, I suppose.

202
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:55,583
What have we?

203
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:58,958
Lady Dodd's Company of Thespians
doing Charley's Aunt.

204
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:01,125
Well, that looks to me rather jolly.

205
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,791
The last time they were here,
they did Quiet Weekend.

206
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,666
-What was it like?
-Quiet.

207
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,000
Well, I suppose we must hope for the best

208
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,583
and make a clean sweep after that.

209
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,708
Now, what have we on the ninth,
the Mordington Madrigal Society

210
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:17,666
in an evening of plainsong and canticle.

211
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,583
Yes, well, we'll start on them, I think,
while there's time.

212
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,208
What's the number of the secretary?

213
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:27,458
-Miss Graham. Mordington 69.
-Mordington 69.

214
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,208
Hello, Mordington 69, please.

215
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,791
Forgive me asking, sir, but what are you
going to put in their place?

216
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,208
Hmm? [chuckles]

217
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,916
Let's clear the decks first, Jessie,

218
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
and then we'll talk about plans
for the future later.

219
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:39,958
[door opens]

220
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:48,916
Hello? Hello, is that Miss Graham
of the Madrigals?

221
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:52,333
Good morning, Miss Graham,
my name is Paris.

222
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,708
I'm the new Entertainments Officer
at the camp.

223
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:55,750
[laughs] Yes.

224
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:58,708
Thank you, very well indeed, and you?

225
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,916
Good, good, good.
Well, it's this way Miss Graham.

226
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,541
I've been going over our program
for the next few weeks

227
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:08,500
and you know, I find Major James has
rather overweighted us on the vocal side.

228
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,416
Well, I…
I do feel that a certain amount of variety

229
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,416
is necessary in these camp entertainments,
don't you, Miss Graham?

230
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,541
I don't quite follow you, Miss Graham.

231
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:24,458
Of course, I shouldn't dream of asking you
to do conjuring tricks.

232
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:31,875
All I was going to suggest, Miss Graham,
was a postponement of your canticles.

233
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:37,750
When? Well, until I ring you Miss Gr…

234
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,250
Miss Graham, please.

235
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,166
-Hello? Hello?
-[phone dial beeps]

236
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,000
[sighs]

237
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,916
Well, that was…
that was very quickly settled.

238
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,041
Your tea, sir.

239
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:58,250
Thank you, Jessie.
Now then, what have we next?

240
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:01,416
Let me see now, Thursday,
the 14th… oh dear.

241
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,041
Miss Qualthrop again and her strings.

242
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,791
Oh, no, no, no.
I do feel that once is enough.

243
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,041
Maxted 74.

244
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,000
Hmm?

245
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,708
No, I think I'll write to her, Jessie.

246
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,041
[gasps]

247
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,041
Lady Dodd is here to see you, sir.

248
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,083
Oh.

249
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,291
That'll be about her program for Saturday.

250
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:20,791
Show her in, Walter.

251
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,458
Do you know Jessie,
I think we should look on the bright side

252
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:25,333
and have 300 programs duplicated. Hmm?

253
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:28,166
No? Oh well, 200 at any rate.

254
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,541
Good morning, Captain Paris.

255
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:30,500
[Chaplain] Ah, Lady Dodd.

256
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:33,041
I'm frightfully sorry to butt in on you
at this hour of the morning,

257
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:36,791
but I absolutely had to.
I don't know how to tell you.

258
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,291
The Thespians have been
overtaken by disaster.

259
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,333
Oh, no, please, Lady Dodd,
not, not for Saturday?

260
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,166
For Saturday and forever.

261
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,500
There's been a rift in the company.
There's…

262
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,666
I don't think I should discuss it
in front of this young person.

263
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,708
That's all right, Lady Dodd,
I'm his confidential secretary.

264
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,916
Well, you know Mr. Burrows
who plays Charley's Aunt?

265
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,916
No, no, no, of course, you don't know him.

266
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,541
But you know Mrs. Phillips who keeps
the cake shop in Mordington High Street

267
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:03,041
and who plays Donna Lucia?
Her husband is on the Stock Exchange.

268
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:06,083
He came home the other evening
and found his wife and Mr. Burrows…

269
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,416
Well, I don't think I'll go into details.

270
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,291
Please, please don't, Lady Dodd.

271
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,500
But what on earth are we going to do
for Saturday?

272
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:14,166
Well, we can't play Hamlet
without the Prince of Denmark, can we?

273
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,875
But I thought you were doing
Charley's Aunt?

274
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,083
That's what I mean.
We can't play Charley's Aunt

275
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:19,666
without Charley's Aunt.

276
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,083
Oh, yes, of course,
I understand that, Lady Dodd.

277
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:25,333
And we'd had new scenery painted
and everything. It does seem such a pity.

278
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:27,291
Of course, I had thought
of something you could substitute.

279
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,416
Oh did you, Lady Dodd?
For Saturday, I'd do anything.

280
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,791
Well then, I suggest you bring Miss Graham
and her Madrigals forward a week.

281
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:34,291
[Chaplain] Oh.

282
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:39,625
No, I'm afraid that's out of the question,
Lady Dodd, I just cancelled them.

283
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,875
[Dodd] Oh dear,
they will be disappointed.

284
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,291
Well, now let me think.

285
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:46,083
The Reverand Hugh knows
the Dickens characters.

286
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,083
A hundred faces under one hat.

287
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:51,875
Well,
that could or could not be entertaining.

288
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,833
I know, but I'm afraid
he's away at Torquay.

289
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:55,833
Then, of course, there's Mrs. Prout.

290
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,833
-Who is Mrs. Prout?
-Oh she's brilliantly clever.

291
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,500
She's the wife of George Prout,
the artist.

292
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:01,916
They're both brilliantly clever.

293
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,875
They live down by the river.
She writes children's books.

294
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,541
-"Zimbo, the spotted Zebra."
-But Lady Dodd,

295
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,250
surely not, not for the troops.

296
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,833
[Dodd chuckles]
Oh, I wasn't thinking of her books.

297
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:14,291
-She has a puppet show
-Oh.

298
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:16,250
In any case,
I don't think she could manage it.

299
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,541
She has Professor Mutch the philosopher
staying with them.

300
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,166
Professor Mutch of the BBC?

301
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:21,791
Yes, that's right.

302
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,458
He's in Question Marks
every Wednesday on the light.

303
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,541
No matter what they ask,
he always knows the answers.

304
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:30,041
Yes, yes, yes Jessie. But I doubt
if he could find the answer to this que…

305
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,375
Question Marks?

306
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,791
What kind of a program is that, Jessie?

307
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:38,625
It's a sort of, um… a Brains Trust.
I thought of sending in a question myself.

308
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,041
A Brains Trust?

309
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:44,250
Why not, hmm? Why not?
Yes indeed, why not?

310
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,875
Jessie, go and tell Walter
to get the car again.

311
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:46,916
-Yes, sir.
-Lady Dodd,

312
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,833
I do believe we've found the answer
to our troubles.

313
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:51,125
-Really?
-Where do Mr. and Mrs. Prout live?

314
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,041
Riverside Cottage,
at the corner of Alum Lane.

315
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,041
Riverside Cottage,
at the corner of Alum Lane.

316
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:58,125
[gentle orchestral music plays]

317
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,291
[Mutch] You see, a picture

318
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:14,416
or a piece of sculpture
is budded off from the artist

319
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,083
and it's only when his work has grown up
a bit and becomes a separate entity

320
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,916
that he's fit to give an opinion on it.

321
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,416
Oh, one's constantly coming across
George's sort of dogmatism on the BBC

322
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,458
-and even more complicated for him…
-Jimmy, you really do reason so clearly.

323
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:29,166
Oh good gracious, I mean to say,
that's my job, that kind of reasoning.

324
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,166
All the same, you know,
if you don't mind my saying so,

325
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:35,791
I sometimes think you intellectualize
things a little too much.

326
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,291
Well now.

327
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:41,541
I suppose I do have a sort of tendency
to sublimate emotions and impulses

328
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:45,083
but into a rationalized
and connected intellectual system.

329
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,041
I mean to say, why not?

330
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:50,166
After all, we have developed
rationalizing faculties

331
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,708
and no doubt
for some sort of coherent purpose

332
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,166
or at least
as part of an intelligible process.

333
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,833
And you know, after all,
there is a certain satisfaction

334
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,458
in the exercise of one's
more highly developed faculties.

335
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:03,791
Yes, I suppose so. Yes, I suppose
there is a certain satisfaction…

336
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:07,166
What I need to say isn't there? I mean
to say take you and me, for instance.

337
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,916
-Oh.
-[Mutch] There you are.

338
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:16,916
[Chaplain clears throat]

339
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,916
I'm terribly sorry to intrude like this

340
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,708
but I really couldn't help it, you know.

341
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,791
My name is Paris.
I'm the Chaplain from the camp.

342
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:31,125
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

343
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,958
Please, please, please,
don't be embarrassed

344
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,625
If you forgive my saying so,
but it's very, very refreshing these days

345
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,708
to see a couple carrying their courtship
into married life.

346
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:42,833
Oh, yes, yes, yes,
it's something that occurs all too rarely.

347
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:43,958
[chuckles]

348
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:47,208
Look, I haven't come
to pronounce little homilies to you,

349
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:50,666
I understand you have
a Professor Mutch staying with you?

350
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,458
This is Professor Mutch.

351
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:58,125
Oh… Oh, how do you do, Professor?

352
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:01,208
Oh, how silly of me, I ought
to have recognized you from the BBC.

353
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:05,083
But you haven't spoken yet, have you?
So really, it's quite excusable, isn't it?

354
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,500
[Paris laughs]

355
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,083
And you are?

356
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,333
Mrs. Prout.

357
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:13,000
Ah, yes, yes, I thought so. And Mr. Prout?

358
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:16,041
My husband's working
in his studio at the moment.

359
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,791
Oh, but how very fortunate.

360
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:20,541
I mean, because you see,
I wanted to catch you together,

361
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:23,208
all three of you, I mean,
of course, naturally.

362
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:26,291
Then perhaps we'd better go
into the studio.

363
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:30,041
-Thank you, that's very, very kind of you.
-I'll lead the way.

364
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,208
Oh.

365
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,625
Very, very pleasant morning,
nice and fresh.

366
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,708
[gentle orchestral music]

367
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:41,708
Fascinating place you have here,
Mrs. Prout, and I love artists' studios.

368
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:45,666
George, I've brought a visitor,
the Reverend Paris from the camp.

369
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,958
-Oh blast!
-This is my husband George.

370
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:52,250
Captain Paris wants to see us
about something, so I've asked him in.

371
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:56,208
Please, please don't stop
whatever it is you're doing, Mr. Prout.

372
00:20:56,291 --> 00:21:00,166
I know that you artists
like to be left alone when you're…

373
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:04,750
I say, this is a rather ambitious effort
you're at, Mr. Prout.

374
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,666
What's it going to be?

375
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,791
It is not going to be, it is.

376
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,708
Oh, oh really?

377
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:14,208
George thought of calling it
"Apotheosis."

378
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:19,541
Ah. Yes, yes, well, why not?

379
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,166
[Angela] I'm making tea,
would you like some?

380
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,458
Oh, well…

381
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:26,875
Persons of my cloth have a name
for being addicts, haven't they?

382
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:27,833
[both chuckle]

383
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:30,083
I'll leave you to talk then
while I get it.

384
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:32,166
[Chaplain] Oh thank you, thank you.

385
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,458
Thank you very much.

386
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,541
[Mr. Prout] Well, what can we do for you,
Padre?

387
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:38,958
Well, in a sense,
I'm here to pick your brains.

388
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:41,416
You see, it was only this morning
that I learned we had three

389
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,541
such celebrated people in the neighborhood

390
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:47,541
and as we've been rather badly let down
over Saturday's show at the camp,

391
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:53,125
I thought what a wonderful idea
it would be to get up a Brains Trust.

392
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:55,333
Oh. So that's it.

393
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:59,083
Professor Mutch here is paid to do
that sort of thing on the BBC, you know.

394
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:00,375
Overpaid, but still…

395
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,333
Yes, I know he Is.

396
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:03,833
I mean, I know he does it professionally,

397
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:07,416
but I thought for the troops, you know,
it would keep them out of trouble

398
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,041
and get me out of rather a nasty hole.

399
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:11,750
Yes, I see.

400
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:14,708
Well, you know, in a way, I wouldn't mind.

401
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,916
But the truth of the matter is, you know,
that there's a great deal more

402
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,250
in these "Question and Answer" affairs
than meets the eye.

403
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:24,250
Oh, I do really appreciate that,
Professor,

404
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:28,666
but I thought that with Mr. and Mrs. Prout
here to take care of the arts…

405
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,708
-Eh?
-And one or two other local lights…

406
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:33,916
-What local lights?
-Well, what…

407
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,458
what meeting would be complete
without Lady Dodd?

408
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:39,250
What meeting would stay awake with her?
I think it's a horrible idea.

409
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:43,000
Oh, I don't know, I suppose
in a way it might be possible.

410
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:45,083
And in 50 other ways impossible.

411
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:48,000
I've got no brains and Mutch here
is practically an imbecile.

412
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:48,958
[Mr. Prout chuckles]

413
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:51,666
[Mr .Prout] Oh, he's no worse
then his stupider, kinder neighbor

414
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,041
in ordinary conversation.

415
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:55,500
You wait until you see him
before an audience.

416
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:59,125
-Now, come, come, come, come.
-He seems to think all right in a way,

417
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:02,416
but there's always some sort of
technical hitch between his thinking box

418
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,750
and his talking apparatus.

419
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:06,875
I don't think he's got the faintest idea
of what he's saying half of the time.

420
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:08,666
[Chaplain laughs]

421
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:12,958
I see our friend here
is a bit of a leg puller, hmm?

422
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:16,541
I've never pulled anyone's leg
in my life, why should I?

423
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:18,958
The trouble with you is
you've no faculty for self-criticism.

424
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:20,750
I was just saying the
same thing to Angela.

425
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:23,000
[scoffs] You were, were you?

426
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:25,291
-[Mr. Prout] Listen to who's talking.
-Hmm?

427
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:29,916
Well, I don't think that self-criticism
is a very common virtue, though, do you?

428
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,958
-Angela! Who said it was a virtue?
-What?

429
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:39,291
Angela! Where is that confounded woman?
I want my tea.

430
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:40,833
At least, I don't want it but I need it.

431
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:42,458
[Angela] Coming, coming.

432
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:43,916
You've been a devil of a time!

433
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,375
My dear George,
I'm accustomed to your bad manners

434
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,708
but what will Captain Paris think of us?

435
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:50,208
[Mr. Prout] I know what he thinks of us.

436
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:52,666
He thinks we're a ready­made brains trust.

437
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,333
-Brains trust?
-Well, yes, as a matter of fact,

438
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:57,375
I only called in to see whether you
and Mr. Prout and the Professor here

439
00:23:57,458 --> 00:23:59,500
could help us
with a little show at the camp?

440
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:02,583
Really? I say,
it would be fun, wouldn't it?

441
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:04,416
Isn't it nice of him to ask us, George?

442
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,458
Nice?

443
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:08,875
Do you realize, sir,
that I take the profession of Michelangelo

444
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:10,583
with some seriousness?

445
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,916
Well, of course, I realize that,
Mr. Prout,

446
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,333
but I should have thought
that even Michelangelo could bring himself

447
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:17,583
now and again
to answer a civil question or two.

448
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:20,125
-Bah!
-And that's all I'm asking you to do.

449
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,166
You'll persuade him, won't you,
Mrs. Prout?

450
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:25,833
I can't persuade him to do anything,
not oven to change his underclothes.

451
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:27,000
[Mutch] I'll persuade him.

452
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:29,208
Oh, will you?

453
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:32,375
Well, I don't know
if you'd call it persuasion exactly,

454
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:34,958
but if I hear him standing on his dignity
as an artist,

455
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:37,958
something will impel me
to lick the living daylights out of him.

456
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:40,125
He could, you know.
He used to box for his university

457
00:24:40,208 --> 00:24:41,875
and George is a terrible physical coward.

458
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:43,166
Well, of course,

459
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:46,791
if you wish to lay bare the most
secret corners of our private lives

460
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:49,333
to every Tom, Dick and Harry
who happens to drops in.

461
00:24:49,416 --> 00:24:51,791
Nonsense, George.
The Padre isn't Tom, Dick or Harry.

462
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:54,000
No, it's William, actually.

463
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:56,041
And in any case, you said yourself
the world would be a better place

464
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:57,875
if we all told the truth about ourselves.

465
00:24:57,958 --> 00:25:00,708
Oh, let's all take our clothes off,
shall we?

466
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:02,916
Angela, show him your appendix scar,
why don't you?

467
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,791
And I've got the most entertaining
birth mark…

468
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:09,666
Oh please, no. Look, I think
it's awfully decent of you all to consent

469
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,916
to come along and help us.

470
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,416
The show begins at 1930 hours

471
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,833
and I hope you will all join me
in a glass of sherry

472
00:25:15,916 --> 00:25:18,916
in what we laughingly call
"The Green Room" at the theatre.

473
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,958
-Say a quarter of an hour earlier?
-Just a minute, Captain, just a minute.

474
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:24,083
I mean, after all,
nobody's said yet that…

475
00:25:24,166 --> 00:25:26,458
-They certainly haven't.
-No.

476
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:30,125
And there's something rather important we
haven't discussed, not so simple either,

477
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:33,125
something on which the entire success
or failure, for that matter,

478
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:36,458
of the Brains Trust depends.
Who is going to be Question Master?

479
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:42,250
I mean to say, you see my point, a good
Question Master has to be a dictator

480
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:43,958
but not a tyrant if you follow me,

481
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:46,250
the iron hand in the velvet glove,
you know.

482
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:49,041
He has to be a diplomat
and a disciplinarian.

483
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:52,708
In fact, he has to be defending counsel,
judge and jury all rolled into one.

484
00:25:52,791 --> 00:25:54,458
Now who have you got in mind for that?

485
00:25:56,333 --> 00:25:59,958
Well, as a matter of fact,

486
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:02,041
I…

487
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:04,916
[chuckles]

488
00:26:05,708 --> 00:26:06,875
You?

489
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:11,083
Yes, sir, yes, that's… that's right.

490
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:13,000
Well,
I don't think I'll keep you any longer.

491
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:14,666
Thank you for a most lovely cup of tea,
Mrs. Prout.

492
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,791
I'll come out with you.

493
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:19,250
Thank you. Goodbye, Professor.

494
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:21,583
Goodbye everybody. [chuckles nervously]

495
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:23,416
See you all on Saturday.

496
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,333
[Chaplain] Thank you.

497
00:26:26,333 --> 00:26:28,000
Now look what you've let us in for.

498
00:26:28,541 --> 00:26:31,083
-Me?
-Yes, you.

499
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:33,000
And what did you mean by saying
you'd give me a hammering

500
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:35,000
if I didn't go?
Do you know I nearly believed you?

501
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:38,333
-Oh, well, I mean to say…
-Do you remember our first day at school?

502
00:26:38,416 --> 00:26:40,250
When we got
to our stinking little cubby hole,

503
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:41,666
you gave me the thrashing of my life.

504
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,041
I had exactly the same feeling
a moment ago.

505
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:45,708
-It was most unpleasant.
-[Professor laughs]

506
00:26:45,791 --> 00:26:48,458
I remember you always were
a cocky little blighter.

507
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:50,291
I probably did you a darn good turn.

508
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,250
[Mr. Prout scoffs]

509
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:54,208
I spent the rest of the term trying
to think of ways of getting rid of you.

510
00:26:54,291 --> 00:26:57,583
Ha-ha! If it comes to that,
I'm still thinking of them.

511
00:26:57,666 --> 00:26:59,875
You're invited for a weekend
and you stay a couple of weeks.

512
00:26:59,958 --> 00:27:00,791
Oh, well, of course,

513
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:02,333
-you'll want me to clear out then.
-Don't be an ass.

514
00:27:02,416 --> 00:27:05,125
You amuse me and Angela likes you,
I can't know why.

515
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:07,708
Probably because I'm not rude to her
in public.

516
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:11,416
Rude to her in public, me?
Good heavens! Talk sense.

517
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,333
Angie and I are terrific pals.

518
00:27:13,416 --> 00:27:14,291
Oh yes, I know that.

519
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:16,666
I think in the whole circle
of our acquaintances,

520
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:19,041
we're the only happy couple
that are legally married.

521
00:27:19,125 --> 00:27:21,375
We're terrific pals.
I don't know what I'd do without her,

522
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:22,458
confound her.

523
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:24,625
[chuckles]

524
00:27:24,708 --> 00:27:27,750
Look at her now,
trying to fascinate the Padre.

525
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:29,250
[chuckles]

526
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:31,708
Poor little devil,
that's not her line of country.

527
00:27:31,791 --> 00:27:36,041
I think that's why I like her so much.
She's so completely unfascinating.

528
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:38,625
I'd hate to be married
to one of these disturbing women,

529
00:27:38,708 --> 00:27:41,041
they're as selfish as the devil
and full of tricks.

530
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:44,375
Angie's is not like that.
She's no Helen of Troy and she knows it

531
00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:45,875
and I know it and she knows I know it.

532
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:50,333
-So we got on like a house on fire.
-Oh, you do, do you? I mean, do you?

533
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:54,583
Well, don't we? You know
as well as anyone that we do hang it.

534
00:27:54,666 --> 00:27:59,625
Yes, I suppose you do.
Yes, yes of course, yes.

535
00:27:59,708 --> 00:28:02,791
[soldiers chattering]

536
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:06,958
All right, men, gather round.
Come on, wake up now.

537
00:28:07,041 --> 00:28:11,000
Now pay attention. There's a brains trust
in the theatre on Saturday

538
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:14,250
and the Entertainments Officer
wants volunteers to send in questions.

539
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:17,083
Brown, Buckley, Payne, Moore, Stenning,

540
00:28:17,166 --> 00:28:19,333
sit down and write out a question each
and remember,

541
00:28:19,416 --> 00:28:24,291
nothing about army regulations, pay, food,
personnel, or anything appertaining to,

542
00:28:24,375 --> 00:28:25,333
understand?

543
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:29,583
Right, now you know your orders.
And when you've got your tracts,

544
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:33,000
you can decide amongst yourselves
who's going to send in these questions,

545
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:35,833
but I want a spontaneous response,
you understand?

546
00:28:35,916 --> 00:28:38,416
Otherwise I'll have you all
in the company office, got it?

547
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,500
[lighthearted orchestral music]

548
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:47,333
Good morning, Jessie.
I've brought the fatigues.

549
00:28:47,416 --> 00:28:49,750
-The what?
-That's what the R.S.M called 'em,

550
00:28:49,833 --> 00:28:50,916
the questions for Saturday.

551
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Put them on his desk
and I'll come in and sort them.

552
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:03,458
There's a flick on at Mordington
about motor racing in technicolor.

553
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:04,791
How about it Saturday?

554
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:06,750
What, and miss the Brains Trust?

555
00:29:06,833 --> 00:29:08,333
What do you take me for?

556
00:29:08,416 --> 00:29:11,250
As a matter of fact,
I'm going to ask a question myself.

557
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:14,416
-You are?
-[Jessie] Mm-hmm.

558
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,208
-Something I want to know.
-Can't you look it up?

559
00:29:17,291 --> 00:29:19,291
It's something you can't look up.

560
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:21,791
I can't think what you want
to get mixed up in that kind of thing for.

561
00:29:22,416 --> 00:29:25,791
Because it's very important to me,
that's why.

562
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:28,833
Well, if I was you,
I'd let sleeping dogs lie.

563
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,666
Of course, you would, Walter,
you don't want to know anything,

564
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,583
even if the world blew up,
you wouldn't ask why.

565
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:34,583
[chuckles]

566
00:29:34,666 --> 00:29:37,125
Arguing again, you two? Dear, dear, dear!

567
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:39,083
-Walter, I want you on Saturday.
-Me, sir?

568
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:41,875
Yes. I want you to look after
the lights and the curtains.

569
00:29:41,958 --> 00:29:44,000
-Do you think you can manage that?
-Well, I suppose so, sir.

570
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:47,625
Good, I thought that would please you.
Well, well, well!

571
00:29:47,708 --> 00:29:49,208
What a splendid response!

572
00:29:49,291 --> 00:29:52,083
You know, this shows the enthusiasm
for this sort of program.

573
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:53,208
-Yes, sir.
-Do you know, Jessie,

574
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,125
I think we are going to have a very,
very diverting evening. Now let me see…

575
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:57,083
Uh…

576
00:29:57,166 --> 00:30:01,541
"Can the Brains Trust tell us
the best way of making homemade gin?"

577
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:02,583
[chuckles]

578
00:30:02,666 --> 00:30:05,208
Well, I hope we'll do better than that.

579
00:30:05,291 --> 00:30:09,125
By the way, I'm sorry to see that you
and Walter still seem to be disagreeing.

580
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:11,708
Sometimes I wonder
if we're really suited to each other.

581
00:30:11,791 --> 00:30:12,833
[Chaplain] Ha, why not?

582
00:30:12,916 --> 00:30:13,791
[chuckles]

583
00:30:13,875 --> 00:30:15,916
That's better. Yes, I…

584
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,166
don't understand it but by jove,
it's better.

585
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,250
The way I look at it, sir,

586
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:21,416
I mean, all Walter can do
is talk about what I look like

587
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,666
and his blooming engines
and his wireless and that.

588
00:30:25,916 --> 00:30:28,583
I don't think we can have questions
about football pools.

589
00:30:28,666 --> 00:30:29,625
Sorry, carry on, Jessie.

590
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:30,958
That's all very well, sir,

591
00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:33,958
but you know, it's going to wear
a bit thin in about 40 or 50 years,

592
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:36,625
and you've got to have education
to understand people.

593
00:30:36,708 --> 00:30:39,458
Which Walter doesn't understand me a bit.
He said so himself.

594
00:30:39,541 --> 00:30:41,041
[chuckles]

595
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:42,458
That's a very good one.

596
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:44,916
Yes, but Jessie, if you're both
of the same level of education…

597
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,875
-Then neither of you are better off.
-What's that?

598
00:30:46,958 --> 00:30:49,208
I think people should marry
to better themselves,

599
00:30:49,291 --> 00:30:50,791
at least one of them should be better off.

600
00:30:51,708 --> 00:30:52,875
Oh, dear, dear, dear!

601
00:30:52,958 --> 00:30:55,458
That's a very materialistic way
of looking at things, Jessie.

602
00:30:55,541 --> 00:30:57,583
What about falling in love?

603
00:30:57,666 --> 00:30:59,208
I don't know so much about that.

604
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:01,041
Being in love is all very well,

605
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:02,750
but where's your guarantee
you're going to be in love

606
00:31:02,833 --> 00:31:06,125
till death do you part?
That's taking a big risk.

607
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:07,541
Yes, but Jessie,

608
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:10,416
if a thing's worth doing,
it's worth taking a big risk for it.

609
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,708
That's what my father said,

610
00:31:11,791 --> 00:31:14,250
and my mother and me had to whip round
the neighbors to pay for his funeral.

611
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:16,083
Hmm, yes, I know but…

612
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,666
Hello, this is your writing, Jessie.

613
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:22,291
-I know, it's my question, sir.
-What? Oh.

614
00:31:23,541 --> 00:31:25,250
Oh, Jessie.

615
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:28,083
I think If you don't mind,
I'd rather not open it.

616
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:29,708
-Why not?
-Because…

617
00:31:29,791 --> 00:31:33,250
Well, don't you see that
if it's a good question and I select it,

618
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:35,541
well, I might be accused of favoritism,

619
00:31:35,625 --> 00:31:39,875
and if it isn't and I don't,
you will just be disappointed.

620
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,500
So please, Jessie, if you don't mind,
I'd rather you took it back.

621
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:50,166
I'm sorry, Jessie,
but you do see my position, don't you?

622
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:51,208
Of course, sir.

623
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,916
[trumpet music plays]

624
00:32:01,416 --> 00:32:03,416
[upbeat music plays]

625
00:32:04,208 --> 00:32:08,166
What on earth is all this?
But Jessie, I ordered sherry.

626
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,541
I asked them to a glass of sherry,
not to a party.

627
00:32:10,625 --> 00:32:12,416
I know, sir,
but everybody doesn't like sherry

628
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,125
so I thought
I'd get something of everything.

629
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:16,875
-It's on sale or return, sir.
-Oh, is it?

630
00:32:16,958 --> 00:32:18,500
I suppose that's something.
Well, look, Jessie,

631
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:21,625
put these questions in my table where
I'm sitting. Keep them in that order.

632
00:32:21,708 --> 00:32:22,625
And Jessie,

633
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:24,791
see that everyone has a glass of
water in front of them, will you, please?

634
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:26,083
I've already done that, sir.

635
00:32:26,166 --> 00:32:27,583
Good girl, good girl.

636
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:30,958
I can't think
what he wants this thing up for.

637
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:33,666
Well, Padre thought something sylvan
would be appropriate.

638
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,458
Is this supposed to be sylvan?

639
00:32:35,541 --> 00:32:38,208
It's all we've got.
It was done for the WRAC pantomime.

640
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:40,750
-[bass music plays]
-[audience chatter]

641
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:58,916
It is my very pleasant duty
as question master

642
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,583
to introduce to you
tonight's brains trust.

643
00:33:01,666 --> 00:33:04,791
Therefore, on my extreme left, no, no,
my extreme right…

644
00:33:04,875 --> 00:33:06,625
-Good evening, Padre.
-Ah.

645
00:33:06,708 --> 00:33:09,125
I hope you don't mind Brian
and Penelope coming along

646
00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:10,833
but Lord Dodd has gone to the pictures

647
00:33:10,916 --> 00:33:12,541
and they would've been
so lonely in the house

648
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:14,291
with only the housekeeper
and the parlor maid.

649
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:16,125
That's perfectly alright, Lady Dodd.

650
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:18,083
I shan't take them on the stage,
of course,

651
00:33:18,166 --> 00:33:20,416
not that they don't understand
every word that's said to them.

652
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,625
I am sure they do, Lady Dodd.
Can I tempt you to a glass of sherry?

653
00:33:23,708 --> 00:33:26,291
Oh, I don't think I should, do you?

654
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:28,875
I mean,
I want to keep my head clear, don't I?

655
00:33:28,958 --> 00:33:30,583
Oh well, perhaps just a teeny one.

656
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:33,083
Who else is coming along tonight?

657
00:33:33,166 --> 00:33:35,375
I mean, besides Professor Mutch
and Mr. and Mrs. Prout?

658
00:33:35,458 --> 00:33:37,416
Well… I… I've asked Dr. McAdam.

659
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,375
Dear Dr. McAdam. We only have him
for the servants now, of course,

660
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:41,875
but he's such a nice man.

661
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:45,125
And then of course, Mr. Byres,
our Member of Parliament.

662
00:33:45,208 --> 00:33:47,875
Oh dear. But he's Labour, you know.

663
00:33:47,958 --> 00:33:51,000
Yes, I know, but after all,
he does represent the constituency.

664
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:53,916
By three votes after two recounts,

665
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
and he wouldn't have got in then

666
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:57,083
if it hadn't been for that
scurrilous campaign he carried on,

667
00:33:57,166 --> 00:34:00,625
suggesting that Sir John's Brewery
deliberately watered their beer,

668
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:03,458
which was too ridiculous, judging from
the state of affairs on election night.

669
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:06,875
Perhaps, that was because most people
went on the whisky, my lady.

670
00:34:06,958 --> 00:34:09,375
Now, we must keep all arguments
for the platform.

671
00:34:09,458 --> 00:34:11,791
Have a sherry, Mr. Byres.
Perhaps you'd prefer beer.

672
00:34:11,875 --> 00:34:13,458
Aye, if there's no champagne.

673
00:34:13,541 --> 00:34:15,458
[laughs]

674
00:34:15,541 --> 00:34:17,875
I'm afraid this is not
the House of Commons, Mr. Byres.

675
00:34:17,958 --> 00:34:19,083
[laughing]

676
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:30,041
Before we start this confounded nonsense,
I need a drink.

677
00:34:30,125 --> 00:34:31,833
The Padre said something
about a glass of sherry.

678
00:34:31,916 --> 00:34:34,875
I need more than my sherry,
I want a large Scotch.

679
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:37,250
If you and Jimmy had been back
from the river at a decent time,

680
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:38,791
we could have popped into the Red Lion.

681
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:40,041
[chuckles]

682
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:42,583
[Chaplain] So I told him
he would be able… Ah, Mrs. Prout.

683
00:34:42,666 --> 00:34:44,041
Good evening.

684
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:46,333
[Chaplain] Good evening, Professor,
Mr. Prout.

685
00:34:46,416 --> 00:34:47,875
-No nerves, I hope.
-Well…

686
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:50,666
Of course not. Come along now,
I want you to meet your fellow brains.

687
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:55,041
Lady Dodd, Mr. Byres,
Mr. and Mrs. Prout, Professor Mutch.

688
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:57,625
-How do you do?
-Now then, let me see, sherry everybody?

689
00:34:57,708 --> 00:34:59,666
-I'd rather have a Scotch.
-What?

690
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,041
Oh. Yes, yes, of course.

691
00:35:02,125 --> 00:35:05,416
This should be an amusing evening and
very stimulating for the troops, I feel.

692
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,500
I mean, so many of them
haven't been taught to think

693
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:10,166
clearly or straightly or starkly.

694
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:13,000
I found that out when Mrs. Weatherby
used to take me out to her girls' club.

695
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:15,333
I mean they simply didn't know
what I was talking about

696
00:35:15,416 --> 00:35:17,208
and I am a simple enough soul.

697
00:35:17,291 --> 00:35:18,958
Hmm, yes, you are.

698
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:21,750
The difficulty is, of course,
they don't really speak our language.

699
00:35:21,833 --> 00:35:23,416
Yes, yes, there's that.

700
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,250
-[Chaplain] Mrs. Prout, Professor
-Thank you very much, Padre.

701
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,958
Let me see, I do hope Dr. McAdam
isn't going to be late.

702
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:31,625
It's half past seven everybody.

703
00:35:31,708 --> 00:35:34,333
Yes, yes, I'm aware of that, Jessie,
what's the house like?

704
00:35:34,416 --> 00:35:35,791
It looks half empty to me.

705
00:35:35,875 --> 00:35:39,333
Half full? Oh, well,
that's better than last Tuesday anyway

706
00:35:39,416 --> 00:35:40,708
and I expect there's plenty more to come.

707
00:35:40,791 --> 00:35:42,125
No, I don't think so.

708
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,250
[door slams]

709
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:45,916
Well, I think we can safely drink
to a most successful evening.

710
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,375
-Oh, thank you.
-[McAdam] I'm sorry I'm late, Paris.

711
00:35:48,458 --> 00:35:50,666
Got called out the last moment.

712
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:53,041
I haven't had time to change either,
I hope it's all right.

713
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:56,166
Of course, perfectly all right, the troops
won't mind. Come along now, doctor,

714
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:58,916
-I want you to meet Mrs. Prout and…
-How do you do?

715
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,541
Mr. Prout.
Lady Dodd and Mr. Byres, you know.

716
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:03,458
-[Mr. Byres] How do you do?
-And Professor Mutch.

717
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:05,708
-Who?
-[Chaplain] Professor Mutch.

718
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:08,708
We'll do well
with the medical questions this evening.

719
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,833
[McAdam] I might have to leave
before the end, you know,

720
00:36:10,916 --> 00:36:12,500
I got a confinement.

721
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:15,625
I can't tell, she might hang on
for hours, of course, she might not.

722
00:36:15,708 --> 00:36:17,875
Oh dear, I sincerely hope she does.

723
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:20,291
-[Chaplain laughs]
-[audience clapping]

724
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:23,250
Oh listen, they're applauding us already,
how very nice of them.

725
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:25,708
I'm afraid that's an indication
that they want the show to begin,

726
00:36:25,791 --> 00:36:28,750
so if you finish your drinks, ladies,
perhaps we shall take our places.

727
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:30,916
Will you follow me, Lady Dodd? Thank you.

728
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,291
[audience clapping continues]

729
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:42,750
Lady Dodd. Right here, Mrs. Prout…

730
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:45,791
[audience clapping]

731
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:50,208
-[audience clapping rhythmically]
-[chattering]

732
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:02,833
[clears throat]

733
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:05,333
[audience imitating coughing]

734
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:07,750
Now ladles and gentlemen,

735
00:37:07,833 --> 00:37:10,458
it is my very pleasant duty
as question master

736
00:37:10,541 --> 00:37:13,750
to introduce to you tonight's
Brains Trust.

737
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:18,333
Now then, on my extreme right without any
further ado is Mr. George Prout,

738
00:37:18,416 --> 00:37:22,166
a very celebrated painter
of oil paintings.

739
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:26,333
He is indeed a member
of the Royal Institute of Oil Painters,

740
00:37:26,416 --> 00:37:32,083
a very, very distinguished body of men
who paint, uh, oil paintings.

741
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,208
So you see,
if there are any questions about art,

742
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:37,166
I am sure that he will be able
to deal with them,

743
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:41,541
especially if they have to do
with oil paintings.

744
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:44,125
Now, next to him I am very happy to be
able to tell you is

745
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:46,958
our old friend Dr. McAdam.

746
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:51,333
-[audience cheers, claps]
-[soldier] Good old doc!

747
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:56,916
Very distinguished graduate of I believe
Edinburgh University?

748
00:37:58,833 --> 00:38:00,000
-[blows pipe]
-[chuckles nervously]

749
00:38:00,083 --> 00:38:02,416
Yes, yes, Edinburgh University.

750
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:07,333
And now, you know, I hardly think there's
any need for me to introduce Lady Dodd.

751
00:38:07,416 --> 00:38:11,916
[audience claps]

752
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,916
[chuckles]

753
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,208
Perhaps I'd better spare her blushes
and pass on to Mrs. Prout.

754
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:21,666
You know, I don't know whether to refer
to her as Mrs. Prout or Angela Kilpatrick

755
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:25,583
because as such she is the author of many,
many delightful children's books

756
00:38:25,666 --> 00:38:29,708
and is also, I understand,
very, very interested in puppets,

757
00:38:29,791 --> 00:38:34,041
and will perhaps someday give us
a little show. Will you, Mrs. Prout?

758
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:37,000
Thank you, thank you, thank you so much.

759
00:38:37,083 --> 00:38:38,541
[chuckles, stops]

760
00:38:38,625 --> 00:38:42,750
Thank you. Now next to her,
I am very happy to be able to tell you

761
00:38:42,833 --> 00:38:46,250
is Professor JFS Mutch

762
00:38:46,333 --> 00:38:49,916
of the University of Skerryvore
and the Light Programme.

763
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,041
He is a great expert in mathematics

764
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:56,958
and is, I understand, one of our
best known collectors of postage stamps.

765
00:38:57,041 --> 00:39:01,416
So, you see, if there are any questions
about mathematics or postage stamps,

766
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,625
I am sure that he will be able
to deal with them.

767
00:39:04,708 --> 00:39:10,041
And lastly, we are very happy to welcome
our local Member of Parliament,

768
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:12,000
Mr. Joe Byres.

769
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:16,166
[audience cheering]

770
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:19,583
We have no politics here

771
00:39:19,666 --> 00:39:22,750
and therefore we are very, very happy
to have him with us.

772
00:39:22,833 --> 00:39:25,541
And now, lets get down
to the business of the evening.

773
00:39:25,625 --> 00:39:28,208
The questions are on anything
and everything.

774
00:39:28,291 --> 00:39:31,958
I've just chosen them at random,
at least, more or less.

775
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:35,500
Naturally, we've had to bar questions
on politics and religion

776
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:39,375
and questions showing
ill-timed facetiousness.

777
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:41,750
I mean, we can't really discuss politics
and religion

778
00:39:41,833 --> 00:39:43,458
in a mixed gathering of this sort

779
00:39:43,541 --> 00:39:47,000
and of course, the CO won't have smut.

780
00:39:47,083 --> 00:39:49,375
-[audience laughs]
-But what's left makes a pretty good lot

781
00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:53,625
and the first is from private JS Dixon.

782
00:39:53,708 --> 00:40:00,041
He asks "What makes cows in a field
run after railway trains?"

783
00:40:00,125 --> 00:40:03,125
Well now, let me see, I think we'll…

784
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:06,333
I think we'll ask Lady Dodd to kick off.

785
00:40:06,416 --> 00:40:11,416
Come along now, Lady Dodd, what makes cows
in a field run after railway trains?

786
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:16,291
Well, now, that is a question
I've often wondered myself.

787
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:19,208
My Aunt was a great friend
of Sir James Barrie

788
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:21,666
and he used to they were running
to catch any babies

789
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,708
that might fall out of the windows.

790
00:40:23,791 --> 00:40:25,583
I hardly think it can be that myself,

791
00:40:25,666 --> 00:40:28,916
though, mind you,
cows are frightfully intelligent animals.

792
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,708
Ah, thank you, Lady Dodd,
thank you very much. Professor?

793
00:40:32,791 --> 00:40:35,666
Well, I mean to say…

794
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:39,125
are we entitled to suppose
that they have in point of fact

795
00:40:39,208 --> 00:40:43,166
any reason for running
after trains at all? If you follow me.

796
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:45,375
Oh, they must have, they must have!

797
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:47,458
Yes, they, well, I don't know…

798
00:40:48,125 --> 00:40:50,583
I mean, after all,
when one talks about reason,

799
00:40:50,666 --> 00:40:54,666
one's plunging head over heels
into the psychological aspect,

800
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:57,958
and I mean, after all,
have cows a psychological aspect?

801
00:40:58,041 --> 00:41:00,458
[Mutch chuckles]

802
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,958
[Mutch] I mean to say,
we don't know enough about it.

803
00:41:03,041 --> 00:41:05,833
It may be a simple enough problem
in biophysics,

804
00:41:05,916 --> 00:41:07,875
but we just don't know, now do we?

805
00:41:07,958 --> 00:41:09,708
You see my point?

806
00:41:09,791 --> 00:41:10,708
[Mutch chuckles]

807
00:41:10,791 --> 00:41:14,625
Yes, oh yes, yes, yes, of course!
Of course, thank you, Professor.

808
00:41:14,708 --> 00:41:15,666
Oh, and Mr. Byres.

809
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:18,000
They get excited by the clatter.

810
00:41:18,083 --> 00:41:20,916
You don't see cows running in a field
where a lot of trains pass,

811
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,041
they get used to it.

812
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:26,083
Yes, thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Byres. Mrs. Prout?

813
00:41:26,166 --> 00:41:28,458
I agree with Mr. Byres.

814
00:41:28,541 --> 00:41:31,708
I think any kind of vague tumult
is exciting.

815
00:41:31,791 --> 00:41:35,500
I think they run after the trains because
they like the monotony to be broken.

816
00:41:35,583 --> 00:41:38,375
Cows lead very monotonous lives, remember.

817
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:39,625
I don't agree.

818
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:41,041
Most human beings

819
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:45,125
have far more monotonous lives than cows,
and the one thing they hate

820
00:41:45,208 --> 00:41:49,708
is having the monotony broken.
Anyhow, cows don't run after trains.

821
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:51,208
Oh, yes they do, George.

822
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:53,083
No they don't.

823
00:41:53,166 --> 00:41:55,583
Anyhow, cows are females.

824
00:41:55,666 --> 00:41:58,291
What's the good of worrying
why they do anything on the living earth?

825
00:41:58,375 --> 00:42:01,458
-[audience laughs, claps] Here, here!
-Now, now, order, order.

826
00:42:01,541 --> 00:42:04,875
Now let me see, Dr. McAdam,
perhaps you will sum up.

827
00:42:04,958 --> 00:42:07,208
What? Well, what was the question?

828
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:08,750
[chuckles]

829
00:42:08,833 --> 00:42:12,583
Why do cows run after railway trains?

830
00:42:12,666 --> 00:42:14,458
I haven't the slightest idea.

831
00:42:14,541 --> 00:42:17,375
[all laugh]

832
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:22,208
Well now, I think we've had very varied
and satisfactory answers

833
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:23,625
to that most interesting question,

834
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:27,541
and I think the Trust has decided
that it would be unwise

835
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:31,291
to go too far into the cow's motives.

836
00:42:31,375 --> 00:42:33,833
Well, now the next question
is a very interesting one.

837
00:42:33,916 --> 00:42:40,125
It's from…
from 857643, Lance Corporal Jenks W.

838
00:42:40,208 --> 00:42:42,125
of the Royal Military Police.

839
00:42:42,208 --> 00:42:46,291
[audience boos]

840
00:42:46,375 --> 00:42:51,500
He wants to know "Is civilization in the
opinion of the Brains Trust, a failure?

841
00:42:51,583 --> 00:42:54,708
And what is civilization anyway?"

842
00:42:54,791 --> 00:42:59,791
Well, we ought to get some good answers
to that, eh? Uh… Mrs. Prout?

843
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:01,916
We'd better answer
the second part first, hadn't we?

844
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,083
Yes, just as you wish.
"What is civilization anyway?"

845
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:09,500
Civilization surely is the application
of knowledge and experience

846
00:43:09,583 --> 00:43:12,083
to the good of the greatest number
of people.

847
00:43:12,166 --> 00:43:13,291
Oh, is it?

848
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:15,875
You count a certain number of fatheads

849
00:43:15,958 --> 00:43:18,791
and then try how far
whatever you've got to go round.

850
00:43:19,541 --> 00:43:21,375
That's not civilization.

851
00:43:21,458 --> 00:43:24,750
You can have civilization
if you've got half a dozen sensible men

852
00:43:24,833 --> 00:43:26,666
and a thousand million mugs.

853
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:28,375
But the mugs have no part in it.

854
00:43:28,458 --> 00:43:30,958
Oh, they haven't, haven't they?
Well, it's high time they had.

855
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:34,791
Now, now, I'm afraid we're getting
perilously near politics.

856
00:43:34,875 --> 00:43:37,000
Look, perhaps Lady Dodd can tell us

857
00:43:37,083 --> 00:43:39,125
whether she thinks
that civilization is a failure.

858
00:43:39,208 --> 00:43:44,041
Oh, I don't think it's a failure at all.
Look at us, look at the Romans,

859
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:46,791
look at the way they treated animals
and Christians.

860
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,916
[Chaplain]
Thank you, thank you, Lady Dodd.

861
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,541
Well now,
I think that more or less covers…

862
00:43:54,875 --> 00:44:00,041
Covers…
Oh, you wish to say something, Professor?

863
00:44:00,958 --> 00:44:02,875
Well, well…

864
00:44:02,958 --> 00:44:06,125
I suppose I should say something about it
as it is a matter

865
00:44:06,208 --> 00:44:08,000
I have given
a very great deal of thought to.

866
00:44:08,083 --> 00:44:09,708
[Mutch mutters]

867
00:44:09,791 --> 00:44:14,625
I mean to say, we must start.
I mean this is important, I mean to say.

868
00:44:14,708 --> 00:44:18,916
We must start by having
absolutely clear ideas

869
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,541
about what we mean
by what we are talking about.

870
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:23,916
I mean to say, you see,

871
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,166
it's not as though there's only
been one civilization in the world,

872
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:30,833
there have been dozens and dozens.
It's hopeless.

873
00:44:30,916 --> 00:44:31,916
[Mutch chuckles, inhales]

874
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,958
Oh, I could go on about this all night
but perhaps I'd better not.

875
00:44:35,041 --> 00:44:37,708
Oh, no, no, perhaps,
perhaps not, Professor,

876
00:44:37,791 --> 00:44:41,958
but thank you, thank you all the same.
Mr. Byres,

877
00:44:42,041 --> 00:44:45,000
but no politics, mind.

878
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:47,583
What do you think of civilization?

879
00:44:47,666 --> 00:44:48,833
I don't think much of it.

880
00:44:48,916 --> 00:44:50,291
[laughing]

881
00:44:50,375 --> 00:44:52,583
Well, that's very much the point, anyway.

882
00:44:52,666 --> 00:44:55,666
Now, I think I can say that the
Brains Trust is of the opinion

883
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:59,083
that there is a great deal
to be said for civilization,

884
00:44:59,166 --> 00:45:02,041
and that there is life in the old dog yet.

885
00:45:02,125 --> 00:45:04,291
-And now we'll pass on…
-[Byres] At the same time, I must say

886
00:45:04,375 --> 00:45:07,333
that a civilization
that is built from top to bottom

887
00:45:07,416 --> 00:45:10,083
on humbug class privilege
and the profit motive

888
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:13,500
is about as fancy a piece of jerrybuilding
as ever I heard of.

889
00:45:13,583 --> 00:45:16,875
The whole jingbang will come down
with a clatter one of these days,

890
00:45:16,958 --> 00:45:20,166
-you'll see.
-Quite, quite, quite, Mr. Byres.

891
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:23,500
-And now we'll pass on to…
-I agree with every word you say.

892
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:26,791
-Eh?
-Every beautiful device we human beings

893
00:45:26,875 --> 00:45:31,166
have invented to keep the gorillas
and yahoos in order will be destroyed.

894
00:45:31,791 --> 00:45:34,375
What do you mean by gorillas and yahoos?

895
00:45:34,458 --> 00:45:36,500
Your sacred proletariat.

896
00:45:36,583 --> 00:45:37,875
-[Chaplain gasps]
-[Byres] Well, I am blowed.

897
00:45:37,958 --> 00:45:39,958
Who do you think you are, anyway?

898
00:45:40,041 --> 00:45:42,708
The Chairman here says
you make your living painting pictures.

899
00:45:42,791 --> 00:45:45,166
Well,
my little girl of twelve paints pictures,

900
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:48,250
but if I catch her putting on airs
because she can put down on paper

901
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:51,416
something that looks like a horse
or a chrysanthemum,

902
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:52,916
I'd give her the thrashing of her life!

903
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,500
[banging gavel]

904
00:45:54,583 --> 00:45:58,500
Please, please, Mr. Byres,
we must get on with the next question.

905
00:45:58,583 --> 00:46:00,333
I never met a Labour politician

906
00:46:00,416 --> 00:46:02,208
who could do anything
but bluster and rant.

907
00:46:02,291 --> 00:46:03,625
Is that so?

908
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:05,875
Well, if you're asking for home truths,
you'll get them.

909
00:46:05,958 --> 00:46:08,041
And if you're asking for a punch
on the nose, you'll got that too.

910
00:46:08,125 --> 00:46:10,041
Go on Joe, show 'em what you're made of!

911
00:46:10,125 --> 00:46:13,041
Please, Mr. Byres, and please, you too,
Mr. Prout, you're both out of order

912
00:46:13,125 --> 00:46:14,375
if you don't mind my saying so, gentlemen.

913
00:46:14,458 --> 00:46:16,708
-Well, I demand an apology.
-Surely not, Mr. Byres…

914
00:46:16,791 --> 00:46:18,750
Very well, I apologize.

915
00:46:20,375 --> 00:46:22,250
Well, I accept your apology.

916
00:46:22,958 --> 00:46:24,541
[Chaplain chuckles nervously]

917
00:46:24,625 --> 00:46:30,125
Well, well, that is very nice,
that's very nice indeed.

918
00:46:30,208 --> 00:46:32,291
[Chaplain laughs]

919
00:46:32,375 --> 00:46:35,958
Well now, we really can get on
to the next question.

920
00:46:36,041 --> 00:46:39,666
It's a most interesting one too.
It's from Bombardier Benskin,

921
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:42,666
and Bombardier Benskin wants to know
whether there is any evidence

922
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:47,958
for the belief that living creatures
exist on the moon's surface?

923
00:46:48,041 --> 00:46:51,666
-On the what?
-On the surface of the moon.

924
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:55,375
Well, Professor, I think we'll ask you
to answer this one.

925
00:46:55,458 --> 00:46:59,833
Come along now, is there any evidence
of life on the surface of the moon?

926
00:46:59,916 --> 00:47:00,916
No!

927
00:47:02,958 --> 00:47:05,208
-I beg your pardon?
-No.

928
00:47:06,166 --> 00:47:10,458
Oh, but… No evidence whatever?

929
00:47:10,541 --> 00:47:13,083
-No.
-None at all?

930
00:47:13,166 --> 00:47:15,125
That seems very peculiar to me.

931
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:21,041
Yes, well, well…
I am sorry, Bombardier Benskin,

932
00:47:21,125 --> 00:47:25,625
but I'm afraid we just got to take it
that there is no evidence of life

933
00:47:25,708 --> 00:47:29,666
on the surface of the moon.
Pity, though, pity.

934
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:31,583
Now we'll get on to the next question.

935
00:47:31,666 --> 00:47:36,708
It's from… Private… Private…

936
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:42,291
Oh dear, it looks like Hezekiah.
It can't be, it's… just a minute,

937
00:47:42,375 --> 00:47:44,333
it's Private JB…

938
00:47:44,416 --> 00:47:45,875
Killigrew.

939
00:47:47,541 --> 00:47:48,666
What… what was that?

940
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:50,583
Killigrew, Jessie Killigrew.

941
00:47:50,666 --> 00:47:52,916
[audience murmurs]

942
00:47:55,166 --> 00:48:00,291
Oh, oh, it's you, Jessie. Oh…
Oh, that's…

943
00:48:01,041 --> 00:48:03,583
yes, that's very Interesting.

944
00:48:03,666 --> 00:48:07,708
Well now,
Private Jessie Killigrew wants to know,

945
00:48:07,791 --> 00:48:10,750
uh…

946
00:48:10,833 --> 00:48:11,750
Oh dear, dear,

947
00:48:11,833 --> 00:48:13,208
what on earth happened to your writing,
Jessie?

948
00:48:13,291 --> 00:48:15,458
It looks like marshmallow but it can't be.

949
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:17,750
Is marriage a good idea?

950
00:48:18,916 --> 00:48:20,208
What, what, what, what?

951
00:48:20,291 --> 00:48:21,791
That's the question.

952
00:48:21,875 --> 00:48:24,333
Is marriage a good idea and if it is,

953
00:48:24,416 --> 00:48:26,083
what's the best way to choose a partner?

954
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:29,541
Oh…

955
00:48:29,625 --> 00:48:32,083
and I thought it was marshmallow.

956
00:48:32,166 --> 00:48:34,166
[chuckles]

957
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:38,083
Oh well, now then,
Private Jessie Killigrew wants to know

958
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:42,916
whether in the opinion of
the Brains Trust, marriage is a good idea.

959
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:45,791
Come along now, Lady Dodd.

960
00:48:46,541 --> 00:48:49,333
Oh I think, it's an excellent idea.

961
00:48:49,416 --> 00:48:51,083
I think that apart
from kindness to animals,

962
00:48:51,166 --> 00:48:55,125
it's one of the best ideas in the world,
except Christianity, of course,

963
00:48:55,208 --> 00:48:57,041
and then,
that takes it all in, doesn't it?

964
00:48:57,125 --> 00:48:59,500
I mean they wouldn't let us get married
in church, would they

965
00:48:59,583 --> 00:49:01,208
unless they thought
it was a wonderful idea?

966
00:49:01,833 --> 00:49:03,125
Thank you Lady Dodd.

967
00:49:04,083 --> 00:49:06,125
Well now, Dr. McAdam,
you've been very silent.

968
00:49:06,208 --> 00:49:07,291
What do you think about it?

969
00:49:08,416 --> 00:49:13,416
Hmm? Oh, I am sorry,
I didn't quite catch the question.

970
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,125
Oh, excuse me, Lady Dodd.

971
00:49:15,208 --> 00:49:18,541
Is marriage a good idea?

972
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:21,958
I don't know whether it's a good idea
or a bad idea,

973
00:49:22,041 --> 00:49:23,541
but it's an inevitable idea.

974
00:49:23,625 --> 00:49:26,583
Mind you, it's a contract
very few sane people enter into.

975
00:49:26,666 --> 00:49:28,833
Oh doctor, what a dreadful thing to say.

976
00:49:28,916 --> 00:49:30,041
What was that?

977
00:49:30,125 --> 00:49:32,958
I said "What an awful thing to say."

978
00:49:33,041 --> 00:49:34,750
Well, it's quite true. I mean,

979
00:49:34,833 --> 00:49:38,541
if falling In love isn't going mad,
then I've never seen a lunatic.

980
00:49:38,625 --> 00:49:39,541
[both laugh]

981
00:49:39,625 --> 00:49:40,791
Well then, how do you account for the fact

982
00:49:40,875 --> 00:49:43,083
that there are hundreds and thousands
of happy marriages?

983
00:49:43,166 --> 00:49:46,250
Anyone can get on with anybody
if he tries hard enough.

984
00:49:46,333 --> 00:49:49,958
Well, if it's as easy as that,
why didn't you get married then, eh?

985
00:49:50,041 --> 00:49:51,541
Because I never went mad.

986
00:49:51,625 --> 00:49:53,375
[audience laughs]

987
00:49:55,583 --> 00:49:57,208
Thank you, Dr. McAdam.

988
00:49:57,291 --> 00:49:58,583
[both laugh]

989
00:49:58,666 --> 00:49:59,833
Mrs. Prout.

990
00:49:59,916 --> 00:50:01,541
I must have been mad when I married.

991
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,916
Well,
that's a nice thing to say in public.

992
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,666
Oh please, never mind about the public.

993
00:50:06,291 --> 00:50:09,375
Jessie, really, this is rather much
of a good thing!

994
00:50:09,458 --> 00:50:10,750
But I want to know.

995
00:50:10,833 --> 00:50:12,291
-And so do I.
-Me too.

996
00:50:12,375 --> 00:50:14,958
[Jessie] Yes, yes, there's lots more here
who want to know.

997
00:50:15,041 --> 00:50:18,000
But you've got to be honest,
and you've got to be human, see?

998
00:50:18,083 --> 00:50:20,958
Because if you're not with all you know
about the world and everything, well,

999
00:50:21,041 --> 00:50:22,625
we won't learn a thing.

1000
00:50:22,708 --> 00:50:24,750
[audience cheers, applauds]

1001
00:50:24,833 --> 00:50:27,708
-Jess--
-It's all right, I'll do my best.

1002
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:30,708
I remember when I first met George,

1003
00:50:30,791 --> 00:50:33,625
the only thing I thought about him
was that I didn't think his finger nails

1004
00:50:33,708 --> 00:50:36,333
were very clean
and he hadn't shaved properly.

1005
00:50:36,416 --> 00:50:37,666
To be perfectly candid,

1006
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:39,708
I didn't think you were much
to look at either.

1007
00:50:39,791 --> 00:50:41,833
You had a way of flinching
whenever you said anything.

1008
00:50:41,916 --> 00:50:46,333
I remember noticing a rather peculiar
and distinctly unpleasant smell.

1009
00:50:46,416 --> 00:50:48,250
It's rather difficult to describe.

1010
00:50:48,333 --> 00:50:51,000
I don't think you need attempt
to describe it here, Mrs. Prout.

1011
00:50:51,083 --> 00:50:54,541
Well, it wasn't a religious smell,
it wasn't a political smell,

1012
00:50:54,625 --> 00:50:57,916
there was some turpentine
and some stale tobacco,

1013
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,458
perhaps that's why I flinched.
I was out with my puppy,

1014
00:51:00,541 --> 00:51:04,000
I remember, and he suddenly started
to bite Mr. Prout's shoes.

1015
00:51:04,083 --> 00:51:05,750
-That's how we got to know each other.
-The darling.

1016
00:51:05,833 --> 00:51:08,208
-What sort of a puppy?
-He was an Aberdeen terrier.

1017
00:51:08,291 --> 00:51:10,583
Oh, there's no love
like a dog's love, is there?

1018
00:51:10,666 --> 00:51:13,666
He was a filthy little brute called Sambo.

1019
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:16,833
I didn't like him any better
at first sight than I liked his mistress.

1020
00:51:16,916 --> 00:51:19,833
She looked liked a bit of damp seaweed
and she had a cold in the head.

1021
00:51:20,583 --> 00:51:23,666
Perhaps it is true
to say I wasn't looking my best.

1022
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:27,041
However you looked,
it wouldn't have made any difference.

1023
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:30,125
We both behaved in an idiotic way
for months afterwards.

1024
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:32,875
-Years.
-And why?

1025
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:36,000
Because we were carrying about
with each other

1026
00:51:36,083 --> 00:51:39,291
a microscopic piece of matter
that could neither read, nor write,

1027
00:51:39,375 --> 00:51:40,500
nor hear, nor speak, nor think.

1028
00:51:40,583 --> 00:51:42,875
It had nothing but a will.

1029
00:51:42,958 --> 00:51:47,250
But somehow or other, that will was
able to call out to its neighbor and say,

1030
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:50,750
"Hi, let's get together
and grow into a thing,

1031
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:54,708
which is a perfectly arranged mixture
of Angela and George."

1032
00:51:55,333 --> 00:51:56,791
"Right" says the other will.

1033
00:51:56,875 --> 00:51:59,833
"The first thing to do
is to make them both mad.

1034
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:02,916
He's a scruffy looking devil
with a face like a gargoyle.

1035
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,875
She's a long lanky creature
with a sniveling cold in the head.

1036
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:13,083
Let's make him think she's Venus
and make her think he's Apollo.

1037
00:52:13,791 --> 00:52:16,458
Otherwise they'll never be
such darned fools

1038
00:52:16,541 --> 00:52:19,125
as to chain themselves together
for the rest of their lives."

1039
00:52:19,208 --> 00:52:20,958
-The doctor is quite right.
-Eh?

1040
00:52:21,666 --> 00:52:23,333
I said you were quite right.

1041
00:52:23,416 --> 00:52:25,791
Well, right about what?
I didn't hear what you said.

1042
00:52:25,875 --> 00:52:27,833
What I said was…

1043
00:52:27,916 --> 00:52:31,625
Please, please Mr. Prout, not…
not again.

1044
00:52:31,708 --> 00:52:32,750
But what I want to know…

1045
00:52:32,833 --> 00:52:34,250
-Jessie!
-All the same,

1046
00:52:34,333 --> 00:52:36,333
I don't think I was so frightful
as all that!

1047
00:52:36,416 --> 00:52:38,416
-Oh yes you were.
-Nonsense!

1048
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:39,458
[audience mutters]

1049
00:52:39,541 --> 00:52:41,625
-What's that?
-Oh, well…

1050
00:52:41,708 --> 00:52:44,375
Mr. Prout, is that only
what you think of her now

1051
00:52:44,458 --> 00:52:45,625
or did you think that then?

1052
00:52:45,708 --> 00:52:47,875
I really,
really must put a stop to all this.

1053
00:52:47,958 --> 00:52:50,250
But why, why? I think it's fascinating.

1054
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,791
[Jessie]
Don't you want us to learn something?

1055
00:52:51,875 --> 00:52:54,333
I thought
that's what Brains Trust was for,

1056
00:52:54,416 --> 00:52:57,125
to teach us something,
and we've only just begun.

1057
00:52:57,208 --> 00:53:00,083
We've seen two people who can get
hooked up for life to each other

1058
00:53:00,166 --> 00:53:01,500
but without knowing the least
what they're after.

1059
00:53:01,583 --> 00:53:04,083
Oh, it doesn't always work out like that.

1060
00:53:04,166 --> 00:53:07,583
I think my husband knew perfectly well
what he was after when he married me.

1061
00:53:07,666 --> 00:53:09,250
[Jessie]
Anyhow, that's how it happened once,

1062
00:53:09,333 --> 00:53:13,250
I want to know what happens next,
do they live happy ever after?

1063
00:53:13,333 --> 00:53:16,541
No one lives happy ever after
but they get on all right.

1064
00:53:16,625 --> 00:53:19,125
-Well…
-[Mr. Prout] What do you mean "well"?

1065
00:53:19,208 --> 00:53:22,000
Oh, I admit we have our ups and downs,

1066
00:53:22,083 --> 00:53:24,416
but personally,
I think we made a darn good arrangement.

1067
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:28,666
I'm sometimes a bit unreasonable,
Angela's never anything else,

1068
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:31,708
but it doesn't take long
to find a modus vivendi.

1069
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:33,958
-A what?
-[Mr. Prout] A way of living.

1070
00:53:34,041 --> 00:53:35,958
Oh, but is it the best way of living?

1071
00:53:36,041 --> 00:53:38,166
No, by heaven, it isn't!

1072
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:41,250
-What did he say?
-I said it isn't.

1073
00:53:41,333 --> 00:53:42,416
It's all very well for George.

1074
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:45,000
He's got somebody to look after
his laundry and do his cooking,

1075
00:53:45,083 --> 00:53:47,208
listen to his ravings
and tell him he's wonderful,

1076
00:53:47,291 --> 00:53:49,541
but where in the name of fortune
does Angela come into it?

1077
00:53:49,625 --> 00:53:51,500
She's got a far better brain than he has

1078
00:53:51,583 --> 00:53:53,500
and she's got qualities
to make something of herself,

1079
00:53:53,583 --> 00:53:55,125
and she's got something else
that you haven't got,

1080
00:53:55,208 --> 00:53:57,416
decent manners
and a capacity for hard work.

1081
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:00,625
And what she's expected to do?
Stand aside like a conjurer's assistant,

1082
00:54:00,708 --> 00:54:02,791
waving a handker­chief
and shouting "voilà!"

1083
00:54:02,875 --> 00:54:05,708
while you pull a mangy rabbit
out of your hat. It makes me sick!

1084
00:54:05,791 --> 00:54:07,750
Yes, but how did it work out that way?

1085
00:54:07,833 --> 00:54:10,416
I'll tell you. I'll tell you all right.

1086
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,833
It's pure undiluted, unadulterated--

1087
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,208
Stop!

1088
00:54:15,666 --> 00:54:19,500
Stop. Sit down, please, Professor.

1089
00:54:21,083 --> 00:54:24,125
[audience murmurs]

1090
00:54:26,083 --> 00:54:30,250
Ladies and gentlemen, it is possibly
a little early to have an interval,

1091
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:32,666
though I must say I think it's high time.

1092
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:36,041
Coffee and soft drinks
will be served in the canteen bar.

1093
00:54:36,125 --> 00:54:38,291
We hope to resume in about ten minutes

1094
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:40,625
when I sincerely trust things
will have come back to normal.

1095
00:54:40,708 --> 00:54:42,583
Curtain, Walter. Thank you, thank you.

1096
00:54:42,666 --> 00:54:45,458
-[audience chattering]
-[flute music plays]

1097
00:54:57,833 --> 00:54:59,458
Look, everybody.

1098
00:55:00,458 --> 00:55:03,458
I don't propose to hold an inquest
over what has just happened,

1099
00:55:03,541 --> 00:55:06,625
nor do I wish to censor anyone,

1100
00:55:06,708 --> 00:55:10,708
all the same, I do feel that we…
at least some of us,

1101
00:55:11,583 --> 00:55:14,666
ought to reflect very, very seriously
on what has just happened.

1102
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:16,333
-You've said it.
-[Dodd] Yes, indeed.

1103
00:55:16,416 --> 00:55:19,458
Well, well, well. A really jolly party.

1104
00:55:19,541 --> 00:55:22,000
I say, what was that young woman
in the audience saying?

1105
00:55:22,083 --> 00:55:23,291
Come and have a drink, Doctor.

1106
00:55:23,375 --> 00:55:25,541
Charming youngster, such a friendly smile.

1107
00:55:25,625 --> 00:55:28,625
-Help yourself.
-Made everything seem so matey.

1108
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:31,375
Here, Jessie.

1109
00:55:31,458 --> 00:55:34,041
What'd you want to go and make
an exhibition of yourself like that for?

1110
00:55:34,125 --> 00:55:36,666
Because I want to find out what happens
to people when they get married.

1111
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,125
-Yes, but you don't have…
-I'm not going to get tied up on spec.

1112
00:55:39,208 --> 00:55:42,875
On our street at home, nobody's happily
married and I'd like to know why.

1113
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:45,125
You might be living on the wrong street.

1114
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:47,208
Come on, Joe, three pints of bitter.

1115
00:55:47,291 --> 00:55:49,333
-You're in a hurry?
-I got to get back to the theater,

1116
00:55:49,416 --> 00:55:51,041
there's some fun and games there tonight.

1117
00:55:51,125 --> 00:55:52,583
Better than all-in wrestling, no kidding!

1118
00:55:52,666 --> 00:55:54,875
Wouldn't surprise me to see a fight
break out in the second half,

1119
00:55:54,958 --> 00:55:56,958
-the way things are shaping.
-Go on.

1120
00:55:57,666 --> 00:55:58,791
[Dodd giggles]

1121
00:55:58,875 --> 00:56:01,541
I'm afraid it's just about time to return,
Lady Dodd.

1122
00:56:01,625 --> 00:56:04,208
And may I, may I say just once again

1123
00:56:04,291 --> 00:56:07,916
that if we all, all of us
make a really determined effort

1124
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:13,125
to cooperate
and avoid at all costs personal topics,

1125
00:56:13,208 --> 00:56:17,041
I am absolutely sure that the whole thing
will go swimmingly this time.

1126
00:56:17,125 --> 00:56:20,625
-I shall do my best.
-Yes, I am quite sure you will, Lady Dodd.

1127
00:56:20,708 --> 00:56:25,125
And I'm sure we all shall. Now come along,
shall we take our places again? Lady Dodd.

1128
00:56:25,208 --> 00:56:26,541
Excuse me, Mr. Byres.

1129
00:56:28,333 --> 00:56:29,333
Come along.

1130
00:56:39,083 --> 00:56:41,958
[chattering]

1131
00:56:42,041 --> 00:56:43,958
What was old Paris talking about?

1132
00:56:44,041 --> 00:56:46,000
-Well, he says nothing personal.
-Hey?

1133
00:56:46,083 --> 00:56:47,458
-Nothing personal.
-Oh.

1134
00:56:47,541 --> 00:56:49,083
-Alright, Mr. Byres.
-Alright.

1135
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,041
Lady Dodd, there's… Here it is,
look, there's a question here

1136
00:56:53,125 --> 00:56:54,708
about the cuckoo.

1137
00:56:54,791 --> 00:56:56,875
Still,
I think perhaps in the circumstances.

1138
00:56:56,958 --> 00:56:58,500
That sounds innocent enough to me.

1139
00:56:58,583 --> 00:56:59,833
That may be, Lady Dodd,

1140
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:03,000
but my only concern now is to keep
the flag flying until the final curtain.

1141
00:57:03,083 --> 00:57:05,166
And I am sure we can all do that. Hmm?

1142
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:09,333
Well, everyone, present and correct
and ready for the fray, hmm?

1143
00:57:09,416 --> 00:57:10,833
Right Walter, up with the curtain.

1144
00:57:10,916 --> 00:57:12,500
Hold it, Walter.

1145
00:57:12,583 --> 00:57:13,875
[audience cheers]

1146
00:57:13,958 --> 00:57:15,708
Where's Mr. Prout? Mr. Prout, Mr. Prout!

1147
00:57:15,791 --> 00:57:17,958
[audience laughing]

1148
00:57:18,958 --> 00:57:24,166
There you are Mr. Prout.
Oh dear, we thought we'd lost you.

1149
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:27,458
Well, now… Ready? Right, Walter.

1150
00:57:27,541 --> 00:57:29,666
[audience applauds]

1151
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,208
There seem to be lots more people now
than there were at the beginning.

1152
00:57:35,083 --> 00:57:36,375
And bad news travels fast.

1153
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:43,250
Well now, ladies and gentlemen,

1154
00:57:43,333 --> 00:57:47,208
we've come to the second part
of this Brains Trust session.

1155
00:57:47,291 --> 00:57:49,416
[audience cheers]

1156
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:54,291
The first part was, I will not say marred,

1157
00:57:54,375 --> 00:57:57,958
but perhaps just a little bit disorganized
by certain,

1158
00:57:58,041 --> 00:58:00,833
oh, shall we call them… eccentricities?

1159
00:58:00,916 --> 00:58:03,250
[audience cheers]

1160
00:58:03,333 --> 00:58:06,458
I think you'll find that a cup of tea…

1161
00:58:06,541 --> 00:58:10,416
uh… or… some other…

1162
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:13,666
light refreshment
has put everything all right.

1163
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:17,375
Now the first question
is from Private Slater

1164
00:58:17,458 --> 00:58:19,250
of the Army Catering Corps

1165
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:23,291
and he wants to know what is meant
by a "sense of humor"

1166
00:58:24,041 --> 00:58:28,333
and how an effective sense of humor
may be cultivated.

1167
00:58:29,333 --> 00:58:30,791
Lady Dodd?

1168
00:58:30,875 --> 00:58:34,750
Well now, I've always had
a great sense of humor myself

1169
00:58:34,833 --> 00:58:36,958
and I have always been very glad of it.

1170
00:58:37,041 --> 00:58:39,500
As to cultivating a sense of humor,

1171
00:58:39,583 --> 00:58:43,291
I think perhaps the best thing would be
to subscribe to a periodical like Punch

1172
00:58:43,375 --> 00:58:45,833
and look at the most amusing pictures.

1173
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:50,458
Thank you, thank you, Lady Dodd.
Now… well, Dr. McAdam.

1174
00:58:51,166 --> 00:58:52,916
[Chaplain]
I wonder if you heard the question?

1175
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,208
Yes, yes, I'm not deaf.

1176
00:58:54,291 --> 00:58:55,291
[laughs]

1177
00:58:55,375 --> 00:58:56,333
I'm sorry.

1178
00:58:56,416 --> 00:58:58,166
Well, have you any remarks
to make on it, then?

1179
00:58:58,250 --> 00:59:01,083
Well, I haven't got
a sense of humor myself. I'm too busy.

1180
00:59:01,166 --> 00:59:03,458
[chuckles] Oh, I don't know.

1181
00:59:03,541 --> 00:59:06,833
I think a good joke now and again
helps to keep things going,

1182
00:59:06,916 --> 00:59:08,375
so long as it's clean.

1183
00:59:08,458 --> 00:59:12,250
Some of the things I hear on the BBC
I can hardly believe my ears.

1184
00:59:12,333 --> 00:59:14,291
-[Chaplain] Thank you, Mr. Byres.
-Mr. Chairman.

1185
00:59:14,375 --> 00:59:17,583
[audience mutters]

1186
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:22,458
Yes, Jessie, what is it now?

1187
00:59:23,083 --> 00:59:26,458
Excuse me sir, but you haven't answered
the last question yet.

1188
00:59:26,541 --> 00:59:30,166
-That's right.
-[audience murmurs]

1189
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:35,125
But Jessie, you must really try
to control your curiosity.

1190
00:59:35,208 --> 00:59:39,208
Mr. and Mrs. Prout are entitled
to some measure of private life.

1191
00:59:39,291 --> 00:59:41,375
But I only want to know about marriage.

1192
00:59:41,458 --> 00:59:43,958
[audience cheers]

1193
00:59:46,125 --> 00:59:50,958
Please, quiet, quiet, please, please!
Really, Jessie, for heaven's sake.

1194
00:59:51,041 --> 00:59:54,000
Well, Private Slater, the Brains Trust
seems to think that a sense of humor

1195
00:59:54,083 --> 00:59:56,875
is a very difficult thing to define
but a very useful thing to have.

1196
00:59:56,958 --> 01:00:00,000
We think you can best cultivate it
by reading suitable magazines

1197
01:00:00,083 --> 01:00:01,791
and refraining from listening to the BBC.

1198
01:00:01,875 --> 01:00:05,125
Now we'll pass onto the next question.
It is, oh, it's anonymous,

1199
01:00:05,208 --> 01:00:09,041
and the question asks "How does
a bluebottle walking on the ceiling

1200
01:00:09,125 --> 01:00:11,125
take off when it wants to fly?"

1201
01:00:11,208 --> 01:00:13,625
Now that is a most interesting question.

1202
01:00:13,708 --> 01:00:16,333
How does a bluebottle
take off from the ceiling?

1203
01:00:16,416 --> 01:00:17,291
Who cares?

1204
01:00:17,375 --> 01:00:19,375
[audience laughs]

1205
01:00:19,458 --> 01:00:21,875
Obviously the person
who asked the question.

1206
01:00:21,958 --> 01:00:23,958
[audience laughs]

1207
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,708
Well now, Dr. McAdam,
perhaps you can help us?

1208
01:00:30,791 --> 01:00:33,458
Oh yes, hmm, yes…

1209
01:00:33,541 --> 01:00:35,500
Talking of a sense of humor.

1210
01:00:35,583 --> 01:00:36,708
-[laughs]
-it's quite true,

1211
01:00:36,791 --> 01:00:39,958
you do come across some laughable things
in general practice.

1212
01:00:40,041 --> 01:00:40,916
Doctor…

1213
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,166
I remember an old fellow
with a swelling on his backside

1214
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:46,708
-the size of your head.
-[audience laughs]

1215
01:00:46,791 --> 01:00:48,666
Doctor, doctor,
we are onto another question.

1216
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:50,291
I had a surgeon in to see him

1217
01:00:50,375 --> 01:00:52,583
and we both agreed
we ought to take a wallop at it.

1218
01:00:52,666 --> 01:00:54,333
-Yes, doctor, but…
-[audience laughs]

1219
01:00:54,416 --> 01:00:57,208
So we did the operation
on the kitchen table.

1220
01:00:57,291 --> 01:01:00,583
I must say, the young fellow
made a good job of it,

1221
01:01:00,666 --> 01:01:03,500
as neat a piece of work as ever I saw.

1222
01:01:03,583 --> 01:01:05,250
Left a beautiful scar.

1223
01:01:05,333 --> 01:01:06,333
[audience laughs]

1224
01:01:06,416 --> 01:01:09,000
Yes, doctor, you're straying,
we went onto another question.

1225
01:01:09,083 --> 01:01:11,083
A pity the old fellow couldn't show it.

1226
01:01:11,166 --> 01:01:12,041
[Dodd laughs]

1227
01:01:12,125 --> 01:01:14,041
Owing to its situation, you understand.

1228
01:01:14,125 --> 01:01:17,166
Yes, doctor, but we're onto
bluebottles now, we're onto bluebottles.

1229
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:18,541
[McAdam] Yes, yes yes.

1230
01:01:18,625 --> 01:01:20,916
So we put him into his bed

1231
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,750
and as soon as he came out
of the chloroform, he said…

1232
01:01:23,833 --> 01:01:26,000
Bluebottles, doctor, bluebottles!

1233
01:01:26,083 --> 01:01:29,833
Oh no, no, no, no.
He didn't need a bottle, no, just a whiff.

1234
01:01:29,916 --> 01:01:34,791
So the old follow felt under his pillow
and took out a handful of dirty notes

1235
01:01:34,875 --> 01:01:37,041
and asked the surgeon what his fee was.

1236
01:01:37,125 --> 01:01:39,166
"Oh," says he, "ten guineas."

1237
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:41,833
So the old fellow counted out eight notes.

1238
01:01:41,916 --> 01:01:45,291
"Here you are," he said,
"eight pounds, take it or leave it

1239
01:01:45,375 --> 01:01:48,625
and if you don't like it, you can put
the swelling back where you found it."

1240
01:01:48,708 --> 01:01:52,583
[audience laughs]

1241
01:01:56,791 --> 01:01:59,083
Quaint old characters you meet sometime.

1242
01:01:59,166 --> 01:02:01,958
-Yes, I remember another time
-Now, the Brains Trust…

1243
01:02:02,041 --> 01:02:06,125
No no, please, please, doctor,
another time, another time, please.

1244
01:02:06,208 --> 01:02:07,833
Oh, yes, all the same to me.

1245
01:02:07,916 --> 01:02:09,208
[Chaplain laughs]

1246
01:02:09,875 --> 01:02:12,041
You know,
I wish someone would explain to me

1247
01:02:12,125 --> 01:02:14,666
how bluebottles manage to walk
on the ceiling at all.

1248
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:17,625
-No, don't be so darned stupid.
-That'll do.

1249
01:02:17,708 --> 01:02:19,625
-[Mr. Prout] What's that?
-[Mutch] I said, that'll do.

1250
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:22,875
Well, upon my word, Mr. Mutch,

1251
01:02:22,958 --> 01:02:26,250
I don't see why the devil
I can't pass a remark to my wife

1252
01:02:26,333 --> 01:02:29,291
-without you brawling and blustering in.
-He wasn't brawling, George.

1253
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:30,666
Yes, he was.

1254
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:33,583
Mr. Prout, please, please, please.

1255
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:36,083
And Professor, please to you too.

1256
01:02:37,166 --> 01:02:39,166
Now, the Brains Trust doesn't appear
to have any positive opinion

1257
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:41,458
about bluebottles,
so we'll pass on to the next question.

1258
01:02:41,541 --> 01:02:44,625
Miss Burgess wants to know if Dr. McAdam

1259
01:02:44,708 --> 01:02:46,666
can come to her at once.

1260
01:02:46,750 --> 01:02:51,333
Oh, what's… Oh dear.
This isn't a question, oh, it's a message.

1261
01:02:51,416 --> 01:02:55,583
Oh, it's for you Dr. McAdam.
It's from Miss Burgess, she wants you.

1262
01:02:56,291 --> 01:02:58,000
Oh, yes, yes.

1263
01:02:58,083 --> 01:02:59,291
[chuckles]

1264
01:02:59,375 --> 01:03:02,291
-I'm sorry I've got to run off like this.
-Yes, yes, of course.

1265
01:03:03,083 --> 01:03:05,166
It isn't Miss Burgess having the baby.

1266
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:06,166
[chuckling]

1267
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:07,833
She's the District Nurse.

1268
01:03:07,916 --> 01:03:10,333
Goodbye, everybody, goodnight. Goodnight!

1269
01:03:10,416 --> 01:03:12,666
[audience cheers, applauds]

1270
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:15,875
I'm sorry I've been called away.

1271
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:17,958
Goodnight, doctor, goodnight.

1272
01:03:21,041 --> 01:03:22,750
Now then, for the next question…

1273
01:03:22,833 --> 01:03:26,041
Mr. Chairman, please,
may I have my question answered first.

1274
01:03:26,125 --> 01:03:28,166
-Is marriage a good idea?
-[audience cheers]

1275
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:31,500
Jessie, for the last time,
will you kindly sit down and keep quiet?

1276
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:34,708
But I want to know what happened.
Everybody wants to know. Don't you?

1277
01:03:34,791 --> 01:03:37,666
[audience cheers]

1278
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:43,500
Please. Jessie. Jess…

1279
01:03:43,583 --> 01:03:46,666
Excuse me, everybody.
I must stop this once and for all.

1280
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:49,500
[audience chattering]

1281
01:03:49,583 --> 01:03:52,458
She'll get put in the jug
if she's not careful.

1282
01:03:53,583 --> 01:03:55,625
Jessie,
you really must try to control yourself.

1283
01:03:55,708 --> 01:03:56,625
You're getting quite hysterical.

1284
01:03:56,708 --> 01:03:58,833
No I'm not!
We never had hysterics in our family.

1285
01:03:58,916 --> 01:04:02,375
We work too blooming hard.
I just want to know, that's all.

1286
01:04:02,458 --> 01:04:04,583
Jessie, but you want to know what?

1287
01:04:04,666 --> 01:04:06,708
! want to know what happened.
Everybody wants to know.

1288
01:04:06,791 --> 01:04:07,666
[audience cheers]

1289
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:09,541
Please, Mrs. Prout,
it's very important to me.

1290
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:13,583
I don't know, I… I don't…

1291
01:04:13,666 --> 01:04:15,708
It's all right, please, don't cry.
Don't worry, I'll take you away.

1292
01:04:15,791 --> 01:04:18,500
You take your hands off her!

1293
01:04:18,583 --> 01:04:20,916
-[Dodd gasps]
-[commotion]

1294
01:04:32,958 --> 01:04:38,083
Sit there. Sit there, Mr. Prout.
Now behave yourself!

1295
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:42,541
I should have warned you that I'd done
a bit of scrapping in my time.

1296
01:04:42,625 --> 01:04:44,833
As a matter of fact, I was once amateur
middle weight champion at my university.

1297
01:04:44,916 --> 01:04:47,375
I know, I know. Like that swine there,

1298
01:04:47,458 --> 01:04:48,958
your only sort of repartee

1299
01:04:49,041 --> 01:04:52,083
is knocking people about
like a couple of navvies.

1300
01:04:52,166 --> 01:04:55,125
You dare put your filthy paws
on a man like me?

1301
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:59,458
Infernal bullies, that's what you are!
Infernal bullies!

1302
01:04:59,541 --> 01:05:02,125
[Mr. Prout sobbing]

1303
01:05:02,208 --> 01:05:06,916
Mr. Prout. Please don't cry, Mr. Prout.
Pull yourself together, man.

1304
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,208
-Be a man.
-[audience muttering]

1305
01:05:09,291 --> 01:05:11,333
I don't know what to do, Lady Dodd.
I just don't know what to do.

1306
01:05:11,416 --> 01:05:13,833
But it isn't your fault.
It isn't your fault.

1307
01:05:13,916 --> 01:05:15,791
-[audience cheering]
-[Jessie] Be quiet, wait a minute, listen,

1308
01:05:15,875 --> 01:05:16,916
I want to say something!

1309
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,916
Just a minute. Listen.

1310
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,833
I don't want to cause trouble.

1311
01:05:20,916 --> 01:05:23,833
I only asked the question
because it's really important to me

1312
01:05:23,916 --> 01:05:26,500
and I think it's important
to nearly all us young ones here.

1313
01:05:26,583 --> 01:05:28,000
[audience cheers]

1314
01:05:28,083 --> 01:05:30,458
Of course we talk about it.
But what do we know?

1315
01:05:30,541 --> 01:05:32,291
We don't know anything

1316
01:05:32,375 --> 01:05:33,708
and when we ask those
who've been through it,

1317
01:05:33,791 --> 01:05:36,208
they put us off with lies and silly jokes.

1318
01:05:36,291 --> 01:05:38,833
Some of us never see anyone
who's got any education

1319
01:05:38,916 --> 01:05:40,416
from one year's end to another,

1320
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:41,708
so now we've got you here

1321
01:05:41,791 --> 01:05:44,375
and we want you to tell us
whether it's worth getting married or not.

1322
01:05:44,458 --> 01:05:47,000
So please, Mrs. Prout,
did you choose right or didn't you,

1323
01:05:47,083 --> 01:05:48,541
and if you didn't, what went wrong?

1324
01:05:48,625 --> 01:05:52,791
[audience cheers]

1325
01:05:57,541 --> 01:06:00,250
She's quite right, you know. We…

1326
01:06:00,333 --> 01:06:01,708
We ought to answer her question.

1327
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:06,250
No, no. No, I'm sorry.
But I really must put my foot down.

1328
01:06:06,333 --> 01:06:08,791
After all,
I am supposed to be Question Master.

1329
01:06:08,875 --> 01:06:11,000
Does the Brains Trust wish me
to continue in that office

1330
01:06:11,083 --> 01:06:13,250
or would you rather I hand it over
to Private Killigrew?

1331
01:06:13,333 --> 01:06:15,958
No. Please go on. You're doing splendidly.

1332
01:06:16,041 --> 01:06:17,291
You're quite good enough.

1333
01:06:17,375 --> 01:06:20,375
Now look, Jessie. Do you want to come up
and be question mistress?

1334
01:06:20,458 --> 01:06:22,041
No, I don't.

1335
01:06:22,125 --> 01:06:25,625
Very well then.
I must insist on being master.

1336
01:06:25,708 --> 01:06:29,166
I suppose Mr. Byres would say that no man
is good enough to be another man's master,

1337
01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:30,875
-but at the same time, I…
-No woman is good enough

1338
01:06:30,958 --> 01:06:32,250
to be another man's mistress.

1339
01:06:33,166 --> 01:06:34,833
Order, order, order!

1340
01:06:34,916 --> 01:06:36,666
Very well then. What do you want me to do?

1341
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:39,083
Do you want me to go on
to the next question or not?

1342
01:06:39,166 --> 01:06:41,250
I think the girl should have her way.

1343
01:06:41,333 --> 01:06:44,000
After all,
we are supposed to be a Brains Trust.

1344
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:46,666
And if she asks a question,
she's entitled to an answer.

1345
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:48,541
-[audience cheers]
-If this was a political meeting,

1346
01:06:48,625 --> 01:06:49,583
she'd get an answer.

1347
01:06:49,666 --> 01:06:52,833
[audience applauds]

1348
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:04,875
Very well then, Mrs. Prout,
I think you had something to add.

1349
01:07:04,958 --> 01:07:08,916
Well, what is it Miss Killigrew
wants to know exactly?

1350
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,416
I just want to know how it works out,
that's all,

1351
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:12,916
marriage, I mean.

1352
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,458
Why, I don't really know. You…

1353
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:18,041
You go mad more or less all of a sudden,

1354
01:07:18,125 --> 01:07:22,083
but you recover quite slowly
and by degrees.

1355
01:07:22,166 --> 01:07:25,125
That's what happened to us. I began by

1356
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:29,875
noticing things about George
that I didn't like very much,

1357
01:07:29,958 --> 01:07:31,750
and I suppose that hurt his vanity because

1358
01:07:32,375 --> 01:07:34,958
he began to lose his temper very often.

1359
01:07:35,041 --> 01:07:38,208
It wasn't the same then, of course,
as it was at first.

1360
01:07:38,291 --> 01:07:41,250
But you aren't the same as you were
when you were three years old.

1361
01:07:42,166 --> 01:07:43,625
George and I are devoted to each other.

1362
01:07:43,708 --> 01:07:45,041
Absolutely.

1363
01:07:45,125 --> 01:07:47,166
But didn't you see
any of his faults at first?

1364
01:07:47,250 --> 01:07:49,500
But I told you I did. All of them.

1365
01:07:49,583 --> 01:07:51,208
Only they didn't seem to matter.

1366
01:07:51,291 --> 01:07:53,625
It was as if they belonged
to some other person.

1367
01:07:54,291 --> 01:07:56,708
I think it's all summed up
by Lord Tennyson

1368
01:07:56,791 --> 01:08:01,416
when he says a friend
should bear a friend's infirmities

1369
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:03,458
and if we've got to bear
a friend's infirmities,

1370
01:08:03,541 --> 01:08:06,041
how much more
ought we to bear a husband's?

1371
01:08:06,125 --> 01:08:08,000
It's all a matter of give and take.

1372
01:08:08,083 --> 01:08:12,083
Oh thank you, Lady Dodd,
and excellently put.

1373
01:08:12,166 --> 01:08:13,958
Now I think we can sum up this discussion

1374
01:08:14,041 --> 01:08:18,166
by saying that marriage is a very,
very good idea indeed,

1375
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:22,458
if we are prepared to give and take,
as Lady Dodd says.

1376
01:08:22,541 --> 01:08:25,125
-Now, we'll pass on…
-But not if it's all on one side.

1377
01:08:25,208 --> 01:08:26,458
[audience murmurs]

1378
01:08:26,541 --> 01:08:28,208
Well, of course,
it must not be all on one side.

1379
01:08:28,291 --> 01:08:30,625
I think Lady Dodd made that perfectly
clear,

1380
01:08:30,708 --> 01:08:31,666
and now we'll pass on to the next…

1381
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:34,583
But it is all on one side.
I mean, what the devil?

1382
01:08:34,666 --> 01:08:36,041
Oh, I beg your pardon. But look here,

1383
01:08:36,125 --> 01:08:37,875
after all,
I know these people better than you do.

1384
01:08:37,958 --> 01:08:40,666
I've known Angela for ten years
and George for nearly 30.

1385
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:42,458
Oh, he's a decent enough chap and all that

1386
01:08:42,541 --> 01:08:44,541
but he's bone lazy and bone selfish

1387
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:47,125
and as conceited
as a peacock with three tails.

1388
01:08:47,208 --> 01:08:49,708
Though what he's got to be conceited about
heaven alone knows.

1389
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:51,041
What I mean to say is after all,

1390
01:08:51,125 --> 01:08:53,583
she's got a personality
of her own and what the devil…

1391
01:08:53,666 --> 01:08:55,083
[grunts, sighs]

1392
01:08:55,166 --> 01:08:57,250
I can't say anything of course.

1393
01:08:57,333 --> 01:08:59,666
For some reason or another,
nobody's supposed to say anything

1394
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:01,500
about this sort of thing
until the whole damage is done.

1395
01:09:01,583 --> 01:09:02,833
Well, it is done!

1396
01:09:02,916 --> 01:09:04,500
And here's somebody
who's had her whole life ruined

1397
01:09:04,583 --> 01:09:08,458
by the crass stupidity
of a bone-headed twerp like that.

1398
01:09:08,541 --> 01:09:10,208
I mean to say
it's high time someone told him

1399
01:09:10,291 --> 01:09:13,250
and I don't care if he knows,
I mean to say…

1400
01:09:13,333 --> 01:09:15,250
[audience murmurs]

1401
01:09:17,333 --> 01:09:18,958
The Professor is of opinion

1402
01:09:19,041 --> 01:09:22,958
that both parties must be prepared
to make some sacrifice

1403
01:09:23,041 --> 01:09:26,375
and there must be some give and take.

1404
01:09:26,458 --> 01:09:28,708
-Now we'll pass on to the next…
-I beg your pardon.

1405
01:09:28,791 --> 01:09:30,333
We'll do nothing of the sort.

1406
01:09:31,541 --> 01:09:34,041
[Mr. Prout]
This man has had the impertinence,

1407
01:09:34,125 --> 01:09:37,291
to come in and out of my house
like a tame lap dog

1408
01:09:37,375 --> 01:09:38,875
and pretend to be my friend.

1409
01:09:39,541 --> 01:09:42,541
Now he stands up
at a public meeting and insults me.

1410
01:09:43,291 --> 01:09:46,416
I want to know what he means by it,
if he's capable of stringing

1411
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:49,250
a couple
of intelligible sentences together.

1412
01:09:49,333 --> 01:09:52,375
I think you can settle that
on a more suitable occasion, Mr. Prout.

1413
01:09:52,458 --> 01:09:57,000
I insist!
He's either said too much or too little.

1414
01:09:57,083 --> 01:09:58,750
I want to know
what the devil he means by it.

1415
01:09:58,833 --> 01:10:01,416
I should have thought
I made my meaning abundantly clear.

1416
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:04,000
I called you a selfish, conceited
bone-headed twerp and I mean it.

1417
01:10:04,083 --> 01:10:06,041
You are one. Upon my life,
I don't know how she sticks him.

1418
01:10:06,125 --> 01:10:08,375
You keep my wife out of this!

1419
01:10:08,458 --> 01:10:10,708
But it's true, George. You are difficult.

1420
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:12,791
That's right.

1421
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:14,708
You turn on me now.

1422
01:10:14,791 --> 01:10:17,083
A moment ago, you were rolling your eyes

1423
01:10:17,166 --> 01:10:19,458
and telling the whole army
how much you loved me.

1424
01:10:19,541 --> 01:10:20,458
[laughs]

1425
01:10:20,541 --> 01:10:22,958
But I'm not surprised, it's just like you.

1426
01:10:23,583 --> 01:10:26,125
You insist on being treated
as a rational being

1427
01:10:26,875 --> 01:10:30,791
and at the same time claim the rights
of a spoiled child.

1428
01:10:30,875 --> 01:10:34,125
How can I make a comrade and partner
out of a creature like that?

1429
01:10:34,208 --> 01:10:36,333
I should begin
by trying to behave like a gentleman.

1430
01:10:36,416 --> 01:10:39,041
I suppose
you call your behavior gentlemanly?

1431
01:10:39,125 --> 01:10:40,833
I only discuss terms
with people who know what they mean.

1432
01:10:40,916 --> 01:10:42,791
Oh stop, I can't stand this!

1433
01:10:42,875 --> 01:10:45,291
Well, as a matter of fact, it's getting
a bit too much for me too.

1434
01:10:45,375 --> 01:10:47,125
I'm not in the least surprised, Lady Dodd.

1435
01:10:47,208 --> 01:10:49,250
Gentlemen, you must either behave
like civilized beings

1436
01:10:49,333 --> 01:10:50,791
or leave this platform.

1437
01:10:50,875 --> 01:10:53,041
Certainly, I'll leave this platform
and I'll take Mrs. Prout with me.

1438
01:10:53,125 --> 01:10:54,500
You'll do nothing of the sort!

1439
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:57,083
-Oh? And who's going to stop me?
-I am!

1440
01:10:57,166 --> 01:11:00,500
[audience cheers]

1441
01:11:00,583 --> 01:11:03,041
Are you going to sit there
and hear me insulted?

1442
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:06,416
I can't imagine a woman
with a spark of spirit

1443
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:09,375
sitting still
and hearing her husband insulted.

1444
01:11:09,458 --> 01:11:12,833
Can't you, Mr. Prout? It's one of
the few pleasures we poor women have.

1445
01:11:12,916 --> 01:11:14,833
If we're talking about insults,

1446
01:11:14,916 --> 01:11:17,875
I've been steadily insulted
ever since this thing began,

1447
01:11:17,958 --> 01:11:18,958
and by you, George.

1448
01:11:19,625 --> 01:11:21,416
And may I tell you,
I've had about enough of it.

1449
01:11:22,208 --> 01:11:24,250
You can go on
washing our dirty linen in public

1450
01:11:24,333 --> 01:11:26,416
as long as Captain Paris will let you.
I'm going with Jimmy.

1451
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:29,875
I forbid you to do any­thing of the sort.

1452
01:11:29,958 --> 01:11:32,666
Why should you? Is he your lover or what?

1453
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:35,458
Yes he is. I mean… Well, he…

1454
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:39,166
He is in a way. I mean… He is.

1455
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:41,833
[audience murmurs]

1456
01:11:47,083 --> 01:11:49,375
Do you mean to say

1457
01:11:49,458 --> 01:11:53,041
that this has been going on
under my very nose?

1458
01:11:53,125 --> 01:11:55,500
Nothing's been going on
under your very nose. Don't be silly.

1459
01:11:55,583 --> 01:11:59,333
I beg your pardon, Professor Mutch,

1460
01:12:00,083 --> 01:12:04,625
but my wife has just stated
in the clearest possible terms

1461
01:12:04,708 --> 01:12:07,125
that she's been deceiving me with you.

1462
01:12:07,208 --> 01:12:08,083
[chuckles]

1463
01:12:08,166 --> 01:12:11,625
You set great store by your gentility.

1464
01:12:11,708 --> 01:12:14,375
Are you accusing my wife of telling lies?

1465
01:12:14,458 --> 01:12:17,125
It isn't what you think it means, George.
It isn't at all.

1466
01:12:17,208 --> 01:12:20,666
Then, what is it?
At least I'm entitled to an explanation.

1467
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:23,708
Of course, Jimmy and I
are very fond of one another,

1468
01:12:23,791 --> 01:12:25,500
but not in that way.

1469
01:12:26,125 --> 01:12:28,750
May I ask what you mean by "that way"?

1470
01:12:28,833 --> 01:12:30,458
No, sir, you may not.

1471
01:12:30,541 --> 01:12:31,875
[audience murmurs]

1472
01:12:31,958 --> 01:12:33,041
Steady, Prout.

1473
01:12:34,125 --> 01:12:35,083
Excuse me.

1474
01:12:40,041 --> 01:12:43,041
I said when I married,

1475
01:12:43,875 --> 01:12:47,875
I'd marry the perfect woman
or remain a bachelor.

1476
01:12:48,833 --> 01:12:52,958
I was poor
but an artist can marry who he likes.

1477
01:12:53,583 --> 01:12:58,125
I was determined to marry a woman
who has graceful and beautiful

1478
01:12:58,208 --> 01:13:02,625
without a blemish
with a voice full of sympathy

1479
01:13:02,708 --> 01:13:05,916
and talking good sense
and not trying to be clever.

1480
01:13:07,541 --> 01:13:11,958
I knew her, I could hear her,
but I couldn't see her.

1481
01:13:12,041 --> 01:13:14,916
All I knew was that she'd be a surprise.

1482
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,833
Dark, fair, it was nothing to me,
height as high as my heart,

1483
01:13:17,916 --> 01:13:21,208
but beautiful she must be,

1484
01:13:21,291 --> 01:13:24,958
and honest and gentle and strong.

1485
01:13:28,208 --> 01:13:29,875
And look what I married.

1486
01:13:34,083 --> 01:13:35,666
He didn't want much, did he?

1487
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:37,458
[audience murmurs]

1488
01:13:37,541 --> 01:13:40,166
Please, please go to the Green Room.
I'll see you there in one minute.

1489
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:41,166
Curtain, Walter.

1490
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:43,166
[audience murmuring]

1491
01:13:50,541 --> 01:13:53,958
Ladies and gentlemen,
I think I'm safe in saying that

1492
01:13:54,041 --> 01:13:58,458
the Brains Trust is of opinion
that holy matrimony is hardly a topic

1493
01:13:58,541 --> 01:14:01,458
for discussion before a mixed audience

1494
01:14:01,541 --> 01:14:05,875
and therefore, I think we must
draw these proceedings to a close.

1495
01:14:05,958 --> 01:14:09,041
I may add that next week,
I am trying to arrange

1496
01:14:09,125 --> 01:14:11,375
for a return visit of the…

1497
01:14:11,458 --> 01:14:14,833
of the May Savitt Qualthrop
string quartet.

1498
01:14:15,541 --> 01:14:18,208
-Thank you, thank you, thank you.
-[soldier] Ladies and gentlemen.

1499
01:14:19,250 --> 01:14:23,250
I hope I'm expressing the sentiments
of all present

1500
01:14:23,333 --> 01:14:26,291
when I ask you to join me
in a vote of thanks

1501
01:14:26,375 --> 01:14:30,208
to our new Entertainments Officer,
the Reverend Captain Paris

1502
01:14:30,291 --> 01:14:33,916
for providing us
with one of the most stimulating

1503
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,083
and, if I may say so without offence,

1504
01:14:36,166 --> 01:14:40,166
one of the most thought provoking
entertainment in the history of our camp.

1505
01:14:40,250 --> 01:14:45,000
[audience applauds]

1506
01:14:45,083 --> 01:14:48,625
Furthermore, we would like
to ask you, Captain Paris,

1507
01:14:48,708 --> 01:14:51,583
Reverend, sir,
if you could make the Brains Trust

1508
01:14:51,666 --> 01:14:55,083
a regular feature
of our entertainments program.

1509
01:14:55,166 --> 01:14:58,208
And now, three cheers for the Padre.
Hip hip!

1510
01:14:58,291 --> 01:15:02,208
[audience hoorays]

1511
01:15:05,041 --> 01:15:06,916
Just like him to pinch the car.

1512
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,416
-Jimmy.
-What?

1513
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:09,833
-[soft music plays]
-[bus arriving]

1514
01:15:09,916 --> 01:15:11,583
Let's catch the bus.

1515
01:15:11,666 --> 01:15:13,750
We must get away from here.
I can't stay in the house after this,

1516
01:15:13,833 --> 01:15:15,875
-how could I?
-Oh, where are we going then?

1517
01:15:18,791 --> 01:15:21,916
Padre, I've been made a laughing stock
tonight and I don't like it.

1518
01:15:22,583 --> 01:15:24,458
I'm sorry, Mr. Byres.

1519
01:15:24,541 --> 01:15:27,083
It's the last time I'll get mixed up
in this kind of caper.

1520
01:15:27,166 --> 01:15:29,166
If only Charley's Aunt hadn't run away
to Doncaster,

1521
01:15:29,250 --> 01:15:30,708
none of this would have happened,
would it?

1522
01:15:30,791 --> 01:15:33,666
Trouble always breeds trouble, doesn't it?

1523
01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:36,875
I believe that fellow Prout
has gone off with the whisky.

1524
01:15:37,583 --> 01:15:38,833
Oh, really.

1525
01:15:38,916 --> 01:15:41,291
What are we going to do
about Mr. and Mrs. Prout, sir?

1526
01:15:43,041 --> 01:15:45,541
I should have thought
that you had already done quite enough

1527
01:15:45,625 --> 01:15:47,250
about Mr. and Mrs. Prout.

1528
01:15:47,333 --> 01:15:49,500
But didn't you see
Mr. Prout had been drinking?

1529
01:15:49,583 --> 01:15:51,833
Yes, and I gather he proposes to continue.

1530
01:15:51,916 --> 01:15:54,666
But there'll be a terrible row for when
the Professor and Mrs. Prout get home,

1531
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:56,166
anything might happen.

1532
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:57,625
She's quite right, you know.

1533
01:15:57,708 --> 01:15:59,541
I don't believe it's safe
to leave them together.

1534
01:15:59,625 --> 01:16:02,916
But I've done my best, Lady Dodd.
I don't see what else I can do.

1535
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,166
Well, if they start to fight,
you could part them

1536
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:06,666
and Walter would help you.

1537
01:16:06,750 --> 01:16:11,750
Jessie, my job in life is not
to part people but to bring them together.

1538
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:15,291
Perhaps you could do that too.
I really feel we should do something.

1539
01:16:15,375 --> 01:16:17,041
I'll tell Walter to get the car.

1540
01:16:18,916 --> 01:16:22,708
You know, I wonder if that poor girl
ought to see a psychiatrist.

1541
01:16:22,791 --> 01:16:26,083
[conductor] Any more fares, please,
any more fares?

1542
01:16:28,333 --> 01:16:29,916
We can go 50 miles tonight

1543
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,375
and tomorrow we'll take the caravan
to Cornwall or Wales,

1544
01:16:32,458 --> 01:16:33,500
I don't mind where.

1545
01:16:33,583 --> 01:16:35,875
But I'm on the air on Wednesday
in Question Marks.

1546
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:37,291
I can't let the BBC down.

1547
01:16:37,375 --> 01:16:40,041
Well then, we'll go to London
and park the caravan there.

1548
01:16:40,125 --> 01:16:41,958
-What? In Portland Place?
-Oh, don't be silly.

1549
01:16:42,041 --> 01:16:45,041
I've got another eight programmes to do,
you know.

1550
01:16:45,125 --> 01:16:46,916
Well, we can go down the Thames somewhere

1551
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,375
and you can travel up to London every day.

1552
01:16:48,458 --> 01:16:50,041
That should be simple enough,
shouldn't it?

1553
01:16:50,125 --> 01:16:51,791
Yes, I suppose so.

1554
01:16:52,458 --> 01:16:54,458
[soft orchestral music]

1555
01:16:56,583 --> 01:16:59,041
Wait, Jessie, who said you could come?

1556
01:16:59,125 --> 01:17:00,583
You might need my help.

1557
01:17:01,833 --> 01:17:04,041
Yes, she really must see a psychiatrist.

1558
01:17:06,625 --> 01:17:07,708
[Mutch] George is back alright.

1559
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:11,208
The lights are on in the studio too.
He's probably in there.

1560
01:17:11,291 --> 01:17:12,708
What are we going to say
if we bump into him?

1561
01:17:12,791 --> 01:17:13,916
I don't care if we do.

1562
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,541
Nothing will make me change my mind now.

1563
01:17:15,625 --> 01:17:16,916
-Nothing?
-What do you mean?

1564
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,791
-Well, what I mean is…
-Oh, come along.

1565
01:17:18,875 --> 01:17:20,541
But ought we to make up our minds
quite so quickly?

1566
01:17:20,625 --> 01:17:23,000
-Why on earth not?
-Well, I was thinking of my place,

1567
01:17:23,083 --> 01:17:26,833
you see, my house­keeper, she has a
terrible antipathy to any sort of change.

1568
01:17:26,916 --> 01:17:28,666
Well, of course,
if you prefer your housekeeper to me.

1569
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:31,791
No, no, no, I don't, my darling but
you see, I can't afford to pension her off

1570
01:17:31,875 --> 01:17:33,458
and she's too old to get another job now.

1571
01:17:33,541 --> 01:17:35,583
I think if I'm prepared to break up
my domestic arrangements,

1572
01:17:35,666 --> 01:17:37,166
you might go a little way
to breaking up yours.

1573
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:39,750
Yes, but as I've explained, Angela,
you see, whichever way we look at it,

1574
01:17:39,833 --> 01:17:41,375
-the point is…
-Don't you love me?

1575
01:17:41,458 --> 01:17:42,791
I love you with my whole soul.

1576
01:17:42,875 --> 01:17:43,958
And I love you too. Don't you see?

1577
01:17:44,041 --> 01:17:45,541
We've got to do something about it now.

1578
01:17:45,625 --> 01:17:46,625
Yes, but Angela…

1579
01:17:46,708 --> 01:17:47,875
Now go and change your clothes
and pack your bag

1580
01:17:47,958 --> 01:17:49,250
and I'll do the same.

1581
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:53,083
[upbeat trumpet music]

1582
01:18:27,625 --> 01:18:29,625
[tense music]

1583
01:18:32,333 --> 01:18:36,000
There's Prout.
See if the other two are back.

1584
01:18:36,083 --> 01:18:37,291
[Chaplain] Mr. Prout!

1585
01:18:38,041 --> 01:18:39,208
Mr. Prout!

1586
01:18:43,083 --> 01:18:44,666
-Mr. Prout.
-[Mr. Prout] Hop it, you!

1587
01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:48,375
[Chaplain] Mr. Prout,
please stop behaving like this.

1588
01:18:51,583 --> 01:18:54,125
Mr. Prout, will you please
stop drinking that stuff?

1589
01:18:54,208 --> 01:18:55,708
It's only making matters worse.

1590
01:18:55,791 --> 01:18:57,083
Will you buzz off

1591
01:18:57,166 --> 01:18:59,375
and stop poking your nose
into other people's business?

1592
01:18:59,458 --> 01:19:02,416
There's no call to be so rude,
Mr. Prout…

1593
01:19:03,583 --> 01:19:05,625
Oh, what on earth are you doing here?

1594
01:19:05,708 --> 01:19:07,708
I came with Captain Paris and Lady Dodd.

1595
01:19:07,791 --> 01:19:10,125
I didn't want to cause trouble tonight,
Mrs. Prout, really I didn't.

1596
01:19:10,208 --> 01:19:13,291
There's no need to apologize, my dear,
I should be very grateful to you.

1597
01:19:13,375 --> 01:19:15,708
If not for you, I might never have had
the courage to make the decision I have,

1598
01:19:15,791 --> 01:19:18,375
so thank you, my dear, very much.
Come along, darling!

1599
01:19:18,458 --> 01:19:19,416
Oh, listen, Mrs. Prout, please,

1600
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:21,000
you must wait and hear
what Captain Paris has got to say.

1601
01:19:21,083 --> 01:19:23,583
-There is nothing more to be said.
-Oh, but Mrs. Prout!

1602
01:19:23,666 --> 01:19:26,375
What on earth are you doing here,
you interfering little brat?

1603
01:19:26,458 --> 01:19:28,416
Oh. Oh, Lady Dodd!

1604
01:19:29,083 --> 01:19:32,125
[tense music]

1605
01:19:43,458 --> 01:19:46,583
[Chaplain] Come now, Mr. Prout,
don't be an idiot, open this door.

1606
01:19:46,666 --> 01:19:48,750
If you don't get away, I'll brain you!

1607
01:19:48,833 --> 01:19:50,875
I don't think you could do that,
Mr. Prout.

1608
01:19:50,958 --> 01:19:53,333
-You see, I happen to be…
-I know,

1609
01:19:53,416 --> 01:19:55,750
ex middle-weight champion
of the monastery.

1610
01:19:55,833 --> 01:19:57,416
Mr. Prout.

1611
01:19:59,708 --> 01:20:01,958
[tense music]

1612
01:20:06,541 --> 01:20:10,083
My pictures!
What on earth is George up to?

1613
01:20:10,166 --> 01:20:12,666
-Mrs. Prout, Professor Mutch.
-What are you doing here?

1614
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:14,375
At least you will listen to me.

1615
01:20:14,458 --> 01:20:16,125
Look,
you can't possibly go away like this.

1616
01:20:16,208 --> 01:20:19,750
Forgive me, but all I am asking you to do
is to think it over, to sleep on it,

1617
01:20:19,833 --> 01:20:22,875
separately of course, and I'm sure in the
morning you will see that I was right.

1618
01:20:22,958 --> 01:20:24,083
Jimmy, don't you realize,

1619
01:20:24,166 --> 01:20:26,583
-George must be going away too?
-What?

1620
01:20:26,666 --> 01:20:28,833
Well, that's why he's got
all my pictures here.

1621
01:20:28,916 --> 01:20:29,791
[Chaplain splutters]

1622
01:20:29,875 --> 01:20:33,125
Why, it's obvious, Mrs. Prout,
he cannot bear to be parted from you

1623
01:20:33,208 --> 01:20:35,958
or from anything
that even faintly resembles you.

1624
01:20:36,041 --> 01:20:39,666
Now, Professor Mutch, look, no doubt
we all have absurd inclinations

1625
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:43,166
and we don't always behave very wisely,
but there is one thing that we do owe

1626
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:47,250
to our self-respect
and that is to play the game.

1627
01:20:47,333 --> 01:20:48,416
What game?

1628
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:51,333
Hmm? Well, you're…
you're a public schoolboy,

1629
01:20:51,416 --> 01:20:53,166
you ought to know
what playing the game means.

1630
01:20:57,083 --> 01:20:59,916
[Angela] Jimmy, we're starting!
I was right. It is George!

1631
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,666
-[bus starts]
-[Angela gasps]

1632
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:05,750
This is absolutely ridiculous.
We can't all go away together.

1633
01:21:05,833 --> 01:21:06,791
[chuckles]

1634
01:21:06,875 --> 01:21:08,791
It might be the best solution,
Professor Mutch.

1635
01:21:08,875 --> 01:21:10,291
Don't talk balderdash.

1636
01:21:10,375 --> 01:21:13,750
[Jessie]
Mrs. Prout, Mrs. Prout! Mrs. Prout!

1637
01:21:15,333 --> 01:21:17,083
-Jessie!
-Thank heavens you're there, sir.

1638
01:21:17,166 --> 01:21:18,583
There's a note for Mrs. Prout
from Mr. Prout.

1639
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:23,625
We'd better scramble out now.

1640
01:21:23,708 --> 01:21:25,291
Yes, we must, before he reaches the gate.

1641
01:21:25,375 --> 01:21:27,583
-Oh, would you mind, please?
-Mrs. Prout.

1642
01:21:27,666 --> 01:21:30,375
[bus rumbles]

1643
01:21:30,458 --> 01:21:33,916
-Did you say "scramble out"?
-We must be raving mad.

1644
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,708
This is a note from your husband.

1645
01:21:35,791 --> 01:21:36,958
I don't want to read it.

1646
01:21:37,041 --> 01:21:38,125
It may tell us where we're going.

1647
01:21:38,208 --> 01:21:39,875
What's it matter where we're going now?

1648
01:21:39,958 --> 01:21:42,000
What does matter
is we're going with George.

1649
01:21:42,083 --> 01:21:44,166
Angela. Angela, just look at this.

1650
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:45,416
What's it say?

1651
01:21:46,583 --> 01:21:48,458
What's he mean?
What on earth does he mean?

1652
01:21:49,083 --> 01:21:50,666
ls anything the matter, Mrs. Prout?

1653
01:21:50,750 --> 01:21:52,250
What does he mean by "this is the end"?

1654
01:21:52,333 --> 01:21:53,666
He couldn't possibly mean…

1655
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:55,541
-Oh, I mean to say, he couldn't, could he?
-Of course not.

1656
01:21:55,625 --> 01:21:57,166
He's only doing this to frighten us.

1657
01:21:57,250 --> 01:21:59,416
Yes, of course, he must be.
He's obviously going back to his mother.

1658
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:00,791
He did once before,
you told me, didn't he?

1659
01:22:00,875 --> 01:22:02,916
-His mother doesn't live on this road.
-Doesn't she?

1660
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,083
-This is the Roxborough Cliff Road.
-I beg your pardon?

1661
01:22:05,166 --> 01:22:07,791
-It's the road to Roxborough Cliffs.
-Where does it go after that?

1662
01:22:07,875 --> 01:22:10,041
Nowhere.
The road ends at the top of the cliffs.

1663
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:11,666
-It's a famous beauty spot.
-[Mutch gasps]

1664
01:22:11,750 --> 01:22:15,291
There's nothing there but a shack
that sells postcards and ice cream.

1665
01:22:15,375 --> 01:22:17,666
But that's ridiculous. He wouldn't
want anything like that, would he?

1666
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:20,083
Come, come, Professor.
Whatever it is in Mr. Prout's mind,

1667
01:22:20,166 --> 01:22:21,333
it certainly is not ice cream!

1668
01:22:21,416 --> 01:22:23,791
Well, what is it then?
What on earth is he doing?

1669
01:22:23,875 --> 01:22:26,625
[tense music]

1670
01:22:37,375 --> 01:22:39,750
I'm quite certain
there's some perfectly simple explanation.

1671
01:22:39,833 --> 01:22:41,416
Then why is he taking all my pictures?

1672
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:44,250
Yes, why is he?
What on earth are we going to do?

1673
01:22:44,333 --> 01:22:46,833
I said in the first place
we shouldn't have acted so precipitately.

1674
01:22:46,916 --> 01:22:47,875
So it's my fault now?

1675
01:22:47,958 --> 01:22:51,041
No, it isn't. It's mine for allowing
myself to be dragged into this.

1676
01:22:51,125 --> 01:22:52,583
So I dragged you into it?

1677
01:22:52,666 --> 01:22:54,833
You did. I wanted time to think it over.

1678
01:22:54,916 --> 01:22:56,416
-Think what over?
-Professor!

1679
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:58,916
There's no sense in trying
to shift the blame at this juncture.

1680
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
-I'm not trying to shift the blame.
-Then what are you trying to do?

1681
01:23:01,083 --> 01:23:04,458
Mrs. Prout, both of you,
keep your heads, please!

1682
01:23:04,541 --> 01:23:08,750
Do, do, do let us try
and sit down quietly and calmly

1683
01:23:08,833 --> 01:23:10,833
and talk this over
like normal human beings.

1684
01:23:10,916 --> 01:23:12,541
After all, there must be
some quite simple way

1685
01:23:12,625 --> 01:23:14,291
of letting Mr. Prout know that we're here.

1686
01:23:14,375 --> 01:23:16,208
Such as rapping on the wall, for example.

1687
01:23:16,291 --> 01:23:17,583
Angela, how far are these cliffs?

1688
01:23:17,666 --> 01:23:20,000
I don't know, half a mile!

1689
01:23:21,125 --> 01:23:24,208
-Half a mile?
-Mr. Prout!

1690
01:23:24,291 --> 01:23:25,791
[banging on wall]

1691
01:23:25,875 --> 01:23:28,500
[door rattles]

1692
01:23:33,625 --> 01:23:37,583
I can hear the sea. George, George!

1693
01:23:37,666 --> 01:23:39,583
It's no use, Professor, I've tried.

1694
01:23:39,666 --> 01:23:43,291
But I can hear the sea, I tell you!
We shall have to jump for it.

1695
01:23:43,375 --> 01:23:44,750
-Come along, Angela.
-No!

1696
01:23:44,833 --> 01:23:46,125
-Yes, yes!
-No, I'm not coming!

1697
01:23:46,208 --> 01:23:48,083
Don't panic, Mrs. Prout,
not at a moment like this.

1698
01:23:48,166 --> 01:23:50,166
If George is going to throw himself
over the cliffs,

1699
01:23:50,250 --> 01:23:52,375
-he's doing it for the love of me!
-Oh, nonsense!

1700
01:23:52,458 --> 01:23:54,583
No time for mock heroics, Mrs. Prout.

1701
01:23:54,666 --> 01:23:55,916
He can hear the sea.

1702
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:00,125
No! I'm staying here.
I'm staying with George. George…

1703
01:24:00,208 --> 01:24:03,541
No, no! No, no! No, no! You can't faint.

1704
01:24:03,625 --> 01:24:06,666
You can't faint, Mrs. Prout.
Oh, she's fainted.

1705
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:08,958
You can't pass, there's no room.

1706
01:24:09,041 --> 01:24:11,000
-Alright, Jessie, you take the wheel.
-Who, me?

1707
01:24:11,083 --> 01:24:12,791
-Yes.
-What are you going to do?

1708
01:24:13,458 --> 01:24:15,375
You'll see. Leave this to me.

1709
01:24:16,833 --> 01:24:19,208
Put her arm round your shoulder and lift.

1710
01:24:19,291 --> 01:24:21,416
[Mutch grunts]

1711
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:22,833
That's right. Drag.

1712
01:24:22,916 --> 01:24:25,166
-[loud bang]
-[both gasp]

1713
01:24:25,250 --> 01:24:26,458
[bus tire squeaks]

1714
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,208
Something's happened.

1715
01:24:30,541 --> 01:24:32,875
George! George! George!

1716
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:39,875
George, darling, are you alright?
Tell me you're alright. What happened?

1717
01:24:39,958 --> 01:24:43,375
-A puncture. What are you all doing here?
-[car tire squeaks, halts]

1718
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:52,375
Deliberately shooting my tires,
what childish conspiracy is this?

1719
01:24:52,458 --> 01:24:54,541
George, you weren't really
going to kill yourself, were you?

1720
01:24:54,625 --> 01:24:57,208
Kill myself? What in heaven's name
are you talking about?

1721
01:24:57,291 --> 01:24:58,666
Then what were you going to do?

1722
01:24:58,750 --> 01:25:02,208
Do what any sane, self-respecting man
would do under the circumstances,

1723
01:25:02,291 --> 01:25:03,916
get away and do some decent painting
for a change.

1724
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,208
But why take all my pictures?

1725
01:25:05,291 --> 01:25:07,916
Well, I hadn't got any canvasses,
I was going to clean them off.

1726
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,333
-Clean me off?
-Well, I had to paint on something.

1727
01:25:10,416 --> 01:25:13,458
Now then, trigger happy,
if you want to get home tonight,

1728
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:15,083
you and your girlfriend
and the rest of you,

1729
01:25:15,166 --> 01:25:16,875
then get down and change that tire.

1730
01:25:16,958 --> 01:25:19,250
Well, if you ask me, half these problems
would never arise

1731
01:25:19,333 --> 01:25:23,500
if more people took a cold bath in the
morning and a sharp walk before breakfast.

1732
01:25:23,583 --> 01:25:25,458
Please, may I say something?

1733
01:25:25,541 --> 01:25:29,708
Look, Jessie. Listen, I'm begging you,
Jessie, try hard just this once

1734
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:31,375
not to say anything at all.

1735
01:25:31,458 --> 01:25:35,375
-Yes, but I just want to--
-Jessie. Now, please.

1736
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:38,291
-Yes, Jessie, shut up.
-What?

1737
01:25:38,375 --> 01:25:40,416
Nothing you say now
can make it any better.

1738
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:43,666
Oh, won't it? Well, I like that.
What are you butting in for anyway?

1739
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:46,708
-[Walter] I got my own ideas.
-[Jessie] You have?

1740
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:50,208
Yes, and why shouldn't I have?

1741
01:25:50,291 --> 01:25:53,333
I've been listening to a lot of beefing
tonight, hanging on to that curtain,

1742
01:25:53,416 --> 01:25:55,208
and what's it all amount to?

1743
01:25:55,291 --> 01:25:57,875
Seems to me that it's blokes like me,

1744
01:25:57,958 --> 01:26:01,458
blokes that hang around street corners
and hang out with the judies

1745
01:26:01,541 --> 01:26:04,250
and bashing around shilling hops
with them.

1746
01:26:04,333 --> 01:26:05,916
We're the blokes that got a chance
to find out

1747
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,208
what's going on in this world,

1748
01:26:08,083 --> 01:26:10,958
better chance than people with their heads
in books half their lives,

1749
01:26:11,041 --> 01:26:12,416
getting educated.

1750
01:26:13,041 --> 01:26:15,208
There's some things you can't learn
from books,

1751
01:26:15,291 --> 01:26:17,250
leastways only secondhand.

1752
01:26:17,333 --> 01:26:21,250
And judies is something, in particular,
you've got to know firsthand.

1753
01:26:22,125 --> 01:26:23,458
Take what went on tonight.

1754
01:26:24,291 --> 01:26:27,708
When you get a lot of blokes and judies
with too much time on their hands,

1755
01:26:27,791 --> 01:26:30,958
it stands to reason
you get a bit of square pushing.

1756
01:26:31,041 --> 01:26:32,500
I've seen it myself.

1757
01:26:33,208 --> 01:26:37,791
Of course, most times it don't do no harm,
it all depends on how bad you've got it.

1758
01:26:38,375 --> 01:26:41,791
Look, say a gent gets sweet
on another gent's Judy.

1759
01:26:42,416 --> 01:26:45,541
The gent what owns the Judy,
he's got two or three things he can do.

1760
01:26:45,625 --> 01:26:48,250
He can go about blinding and belly­aching.

1761
01:26:48,333 --> 01:26:51,416
He can clock the other guy
and give his Judy something to remember,

1762
01:26:52,125 --> 01:26:53,708
but that don't get you anywhere.

1763
01:26:55,250 --> 01:26:59,541
No, the only thing in my experience,
is to sit down over a pint of wallop

1764
01:26:59,625 --> 01:27:01,500
and say, "Here chum, how about it?"

1765
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:04,208
There's plenty of other judies
in the world

1766
01:27:04,291 --> 01:27:07,416
yapping about, leaving their hair combings
all over the place,

1767
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:10,000
what you want to come
messing around my Judy for?

1768
01:27:10,083 --> 01:27:12,291
She takes a bit of getting used to,
I warn you.

1769
01:27:13,125 --> 01:27:14,541
And I've got used to her.

1770
01:27:15,583 --> 01:27:18,041
If you look at it reasonable,

1771
01:27:18,125 --> 01:27:22,500
judies is things that most blokes
can do with, in moderation.

1772
01:27:22,583 --> 01:27:27,416
I mean, there's things you've got to do,
you've got to eat, you've got to sleep,

1773
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:30,375
but you ain't got to go running
after other blokes' judies.

1774
01:27:31,250 --> 01:27:36,041
You know, I've seen the time when I'd give
the most wonderful Judy in the world

1775
01:27:36,125 --> 01:27:38,666
for a plate of bully
and a slice of bread and marge,

1776
01:27:39,833 --> 01:27:42,958
so have some sense, chum,
and how about one for the road?

1777
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,458
Well, that's what I'd say
if I was in his place.

1778
01:27:46,541 --> 01:27:49,416
Well, anyway, I think I would,
you never know, do you?

1779
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:52,833
Walter, I never would have believed.

1780
01:27:53,583 --> 01:27:58,208
You know something?
Walter is right. Oh, Walter!

1781
01:27:58,291 --> 01:28:00,208
-Come off it, Jessie.
-No, no, honestly,

1782
01:28:00,291 --> 01:28:01,875
you see, he's practical.

1783
01:28:01,958 --> 01:28:03,916
Now if the Brains Trust
hadn't been on tonight,

1784
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,625
none of this would have come out and…

1785
01:28:05,708 --> 01:28:07,583
I might never have made my mind up.

1786
01:28:07,666 --> 01:28:08,833
You mean you have?

1787
01:28:08,916 --> 01:28:10,875
Oh yes, Walter.

1788
01:28:10,958 --> 01:28:12,208
Well, thank heaven for that!

1789
01:28:12,291 --> 01:28:15,041
I like that, I like that very much!

1790
01:28:15,125 --> 01:28:17,250
You've settled everything, haven't you?

1791
01:28:17,333 --> 01:28:19,666
That's right. Aw,
everything will be alright, Mrs. Prout,

1792
01:28:19,750 --> 01:28:21,041
if you mark time for a bit

1793
01:28:21,125 --> 01:28:22,791
and Mr. Prout doesn't go on
whacking it up.

1794
01:28:22,875 --> 01:28:26,166
Well, Professor, I think you'd better
stay with us at the hall tonight.

1795
01:28:26,250 --> 01:28:27,708
Oh, well, I mean to say…

1796
01:28:27,791 --> 01:28:29,208
No, he'd better stay here.

1797
01:28:29,291 --> 01:28:30,625
No he had not.

1798
01:28:30,708 --> 01:28:34,000
Go on, get in the car now
and don't keep Lady Dodd waiting.

1799
01:28:34,083 --> 01:28:35,000
Goodnight everyone.

1800
01:28:35,083 --> 01:28:36,625
But Angela, what are you going to do?

1801
01:28:36,708 --> 01:28:40,291
I'm going to town next week to have
my hair done in rows of little lumps

1802
01:28:40,375 --> 01:28:43,083
like iron filings. I'll feel alright then.

1803
01:28:43,166 --> 01:28:44,791
-[Dodd] Come along, Professor.
-Oh yes, of course.

1804
01:28:44,875 --> 01:28:47,458
-But Angela, I mean to say…
-Go on, get out!

1805
01:28:48,125 --> 01:28:49,250
Goodbye then.

1806
01:28:52,833 --> 01:28:57,125
Well, I'll say goodnight to Mrs. Prout.

1807
01:28:58,125 --> 01:29:01,875
Goodnight Mr. and Mrs. Prout.

1808
01:29:03,291 --> 01:29:05,333
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

1809
01:29:09,791 --> 01:29:14,166
You know, I don't think you should have
spoken to Jimmy like that.

1810
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:16,291
I nearly threw his bag at him.

1811
01:29:16,375 --> 01:29:18,750
Well, he's a very sensitive fellow.

1812
01:29:18,833 --> 01:29:22,416
My goodness, I… Oh, what's the use?

1813
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:24,833
George, must you leave your braces
all over the place?

1814
01:29:24,916 --> 01:29:26,333
You know you never wear them.

1815
01:29:26,416 --> 01:29:29,458
I hardly think this is the moment
to discuss braces.

1816
01:29:29,541 --> 01:29:31,333
No, perhaps not.

1817
01:29:33,625 --> 01:29:39,583
George, were you…
really going to paint over my pictures?

1818
01:29:41,166 --> 01:29:42,791
I was going to keep the one
in the sitting room.

1819
01:29:42,875 --> 01:29:46,750
-[Angela sobs]
-[Mr. Prout chuckles]

1820
01:29:46,833 --> 01:29:49,166
You know, there's one thing I want, Angie.

1821
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:51,458
There's not a drop in the house.

1822
01:29:51,541 --> 01:29:53,625
I didn't mean that. I want a cup of tea.

1823
01:29:53,708 --> 01:29:56,666
I'll… I'll put the kettle on.

1824
01:29:56,750 --> 01:29:59,250
No, no, no, no. I'll put the kettle on.

1825
01:29:59,333 --> 01:30:04,000
You? Oh, don't be silly. I'll put it on.

1826
01:30:04,083 --> 01:30:07,375
No, no, no, my darling, you're tired.
I'll put the kettle on.

1827
01:30:07,458 --> 01:30:08,833
But I always put the kettle on.

1828
01:30:08,916 --> 01:30:11,458
Well, let's both put the kettle on.

1829
01:30:16,041 --> 01:30:19,750
[band music playing]

1830
01:30:36,291 --> 01:30:38,291
[coughs]
