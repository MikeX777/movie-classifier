1
00:00:08,368 --> 00:00:11,680
Hey, little buddy.
It's your dad.

2
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:14,911
If you're watching this,
I'm probably dead.

3
00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:18,763
But this is the first
in a series of videos

4
00:00:18,788 --> 00:00:22,522
where I'm gonna show you
how to be a stand-up guy.

5
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,494
I'm gonna teach you how
to fight, like, literally fight,

6
00:00:27,588 --> 00:00:30,158
and how to stand
up for yourself.

7
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,362
I'm gonna teach
you about, you know,

8
00:00:33,387 --> 00:00:36,371
your word and
character and all this stuff.

9
00:00:36,396 --> 00:00:38,786
And I'm not just gonna
yell at the computer,

10
00:00:38,811 --> 00:00:41,692
I'm gonna have ...
I'm gonna film it myself

11
00:00:41,717 --> 00:00:45,826
and demonstrate live
exactly how to do everything.

12
00:00:50,905 --> 00:00:52,093
How am I gonna do that?

13
00:01:09,153 --> 00:01:10,230
Fuck.

14
00:02:02,738 --> 00:02:03,799
Hike!

15
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:07,419
What did you
close your eyes for?

16
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:09,239
Can't expect to catch a
pass with eyes closed.

17
00:02:09,264 --> 00:02:10,506
I didn't.

18
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,134
You flinched.

19
00:02:12,377 --> 00:02:13,636
I saw you.

20
00:02:15,724 --> 00:02:17,045
You don't think they
gave me this ball

21
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,381
for flinching, do you?

22
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,448
Every college in the east
had a scout there that day.

23
00:02:22,503 --> 00:02:23,793
Last one.

24
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:25,380
Basic thrust.

25
00:02:25,405 --> 00:02:26,981
Hold it here.
Hold it here.

26
00:02:27,441 --> 00:02:28,715
And we're gonna
start building ...

27
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,793
Are you satisfied with
the way you play football?

28
00:02:31,005 --> 00:02:32,094
Bryan?

29
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:33,419
Oh, shit.

30
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:34,294
Bryan?

31
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,032
Bryan, come down here.

32
00:02:36,032 --> 00:02:38,022
I'm coming.
God.

33
00:02:38,518 --> 00:02:41,518
I just saw this post.
It's an old friend of mine.

34
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:45,135
He's looking for a cameraman
to help him make a video.

35
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,600
- I don't know.
- You should call ...

36
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,710
What do you mean you don't know?

37
00:02:48,953 --> 00:02:51,005
And wait a minute, what
are you doing here anyway?

38
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:52,317
Don't you have your own place?

39
00:02:52,342 --> 00:02:54,684
Didn't I move you into
your own apartment?

40
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:55,910
I don't have Internet.

41
00:02:55,935 --> 00:02:57,144
How much is Internet?

42
00:02:57,169 --> 00:02:58,325
It's, like, a hundred dollars.

43
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:01,944
Oh, then, like, you need a
job and, like, you need money.

44
00:03:01,969 --> 00:03:03,891
You think people are
standing out on the street

45
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:06,203
handing out jobs to film majors?

46
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:10,024
By the way, how much did you
make up in your room today, huh?

47
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,586
Yeah, you're probably
masturbating to some MILFs.

48
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:14,445
Oh, gross, Mom.

49
00:03:17,134 --> 00:03:18,370
Who is this guy?

50
00:03:19,309 --> 00:03:20,340
Mark McCarthy.

51
00:03:20,365 --> 00:03:22,755
He was a really funny
comic back in the late '80s.

52
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,639
He was on Arsenio Hall
and everything.

53
00:03:24,664 --> 00:03:26,517
And now he works
for an ad agency.

54
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:28,148
He works for an ad agency?

55
00:03:28,173 --> 00:03:31,003
You don't wanna make
commercials because you're too artsy?

56
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:32,049
It is a last resort.

57
00:03:32,074 --> 00:03:34,339
And that's what you do when
you can't get any other work.

58
00:03:34,364 --> 00:03:36,326
Oh, shut your mouth,
you smell like marijuana.

59
00:03:36,351 --> 00:03:37,647
You are calling him.

60
00:03:38,366 --> 00:03:39,717
So, what are you gonna do today?

61
00:03:39,742 --> 00:03:41,451
I have errands all day.

62
00:03:41,725 --> 00:03:43,897
Well, if Housewives
comes on, I'm not waiting.

63
00:03:44,941 --> 00:03:46,184
I'm not a Housewives guy.

64
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:48,474
So, if you wanna have an
affair with them, that's fine.

65
00:03:48,499 --> 00:03:50,255
I'm also pretty
confident about it

66
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,983
because I know you
can't get pregnant.

67
00:03:52,147 --> 00:03:52,983
That is true.

68
00:03:53,008 --> 00:03:57,279
Once you pop a baby in,
it seals up and then ...

69
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,669
You don't worry
about affairs after that.

70
00:03:58,694 --> 00:04:00,850
Right. Like, I could
get jizzed in, like, three

71
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,035
or four times a day and
you would never know.

72
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:04,286
Don't say that.

73
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:06,956
You could go off
and run your errands

74
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:08,749
and I could just be like,
"Jizz in me."

75
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,918
And it's, like, you wouldn't
know. I'm pregnant.

76
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,118
To a lot of guys,
this is a turn-on.

77
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:17,424
Some guys, they wanna
jizz in a pregnant lady.

78
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,468
Okay. I tuned back
in and it's still going.

79
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:20,606
They wanna pop it in ...

80
00:04:20,631 --> 00:04:22,054
Like, what if the baby ... ?

81
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:23,764
What if they jizzed
in the baby's mouth?

82
00:04:35,356 --> 00:04:36,649
Hi, I'm Bryan.

83
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,754
Hi. Mark.

84
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,686
What kind of movie is this?

85
00:04:41,711 --> 00:04:43,408
What kind of hat is that?

86
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,767
Are you a light bulb?

87
00:04:45,115 --> 00:04:48,763
You look like a handsome Chinese
man stuffed into a child's body.

88
00:04:50,328 --> 00:04:51,514
And that hat.

89
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:53,169
How much is that hat?

90
00:04:53,297 --> 00:04:54,360
Uh, I don't know.

91
00:04:54,385 --> 00:04:55,672
I think it was like 15 bucks.

92
00:04:55,697 --> 00:04:56,646
Fifteen bucks.

93
00:04:56,802 --> 00:04:58,748
Here. Here's 20 bucks.

94
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,028
- Why?
- And you can keep the change ...

95
00:05:01,053 --> 00:05:03,075
because I don't wanna
look at that all day.

96
00:05:04,966 --> 00:05:05,992
Let's go.

97
00:05:08,184 --> 00:05:10,262
So, what's your deal anyway?
Are you ... ?

98
00:05:10,287 --> 00:05:12,232
Are you, like, a little kid?

99
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:14,453
What do you mean? I'm 22.

100
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:15,486
Twenty-two.

101
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:16,859
Wow.

102
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,679
How did you hear
about this?

103
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:20,590
Actually, my mom
showed it to me.

104
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:23,657
She's Facebook friends with you.
She showed me your post.

105
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,563
Your mom is Facebook
friends with me?

106
00:05:25,588 --> 00:05:26,440
Yep.

107
00:05:26,465 --> 00:05:28,266
Wow. I'm old.

108
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:30,897
I'm old enough to be your dad.

109
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,938
That's intense.

110
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:34,266
What's her name?

111
00:05:34,362 --> 00:05:35,685
Barbara Gershgorn.

112
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,674
Barbara Gershgorn.

113
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:38,554
Yeah.

114
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:40,258
She worked at a
comedy club in the '80s

115
00:05:40,258 --> 00:05:42,385
and she said
you did a lot of stand-up.

116
00:05:43,186 --> 00:05:44,364
Is that her right there?

117
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:45,254
Yeah.

118
00:05:48,755 --> 00:05:53,606
She looks a lot like a chick
I used to fuck, but older.

119
00:05:54,063 --> 00:05:56,190
If she is who I think she is,

120
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,273
she had this thing
with her pussy

121
00:05:58,298 --> 00:06:00,298
where it was like a
horse eating an apple,

122
00:06:00,323 --> 00:06:02,821
and it would sort of
devour your cock, like ...

123
00:06:03,117 --> 00:06:04,946
Her pussy would
give you a blow job

124
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:06,770
and you were almost
worried it's gonna pfft,

125
00:06:06,795 --> 00:06:08,548
pop off and go flying in her.

126
00:06:12,901 --> 00:06:14,096
Those were the days, man.

127
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:17,086
I was on Arsenio,
did coke with Sam Kinison.

128
00:06:17,226 --> 00:06:21,049
Now I watch reality TV and
feel guilty if I'm up past midnight.

129
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:25,017
So when do we get to the part
where you tell me about the job?

130
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:28,257
Is not a job.

131
00:06:28,538 --> 00:06:29,913
It's an opportunity.

132
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,614
So you're not gonna pay me?

133
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:34,060
Yes. I am gonna pay you in ...

134
00:06:34,662 --> 00:06:35,692
knowledge!

135
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:40,594
I need you to film
me teaching you

136
00:06:40,619 --> 00:06:42,111
everything to know about life.

137
00:06:42,243 --> 00:06:43,734
And I need you to do it now

138
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,532
because I'm not gonna
be around for long.

139
00:06:45,862 --> 00:06:47,260
Why? Where are you going?

140
00:06:47,285 --> 00:06:49,166
Heaven. I'm dying.

141
00:06:49,935 --> 00:06:51,230
I have breast cancer.

142
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:54,059
Are you joking?

143
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,588
My aunt just died
of breast cancer.

144
00:06:57,065 --> 00:06:59,086
First of all, I don't
make jokes like that.

145
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,389
Secondly, I'm not
thrilled about it.

146
00:07:01,414 --> 00:07:03,507
If it was up to me,
I'd have a way cooler cancer,

147
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:05,712
like rock 'n' roll cancer,
all right?

148
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,658
If we keep talking about it,
I'm gonna have a bad trip.

149
00:07:08,683 --> 00:07:10,104
Men can get breast cancer?

150
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:14,472
Yes, they can!
Let's move on!

151
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:18,515
All right. So, what do
you need me to do?

152
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,167
Okay. I need you to film me

153
00:07:21,192 --> 00:07:24,442
giving a bunch of life
lessons to my unborn son.

154
00:07:24,621 --> 00:07:25,635
Isn't that ...

155
00:07:26,097 --> 00:07:28,417
Isn't that kind of like
that Michael Keaton film?

156
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:31,742
"Isn't that kind of like
Michael Keaton film?"

157
00:07:31,767 --> 00:07:35,485
People make videos for
the future all the time, okay?

158
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,918
Is called a time capsule.

159
00:07:37,517 --> 00:07:39,517
Now, pull out your
camera and start filming.

160
00:07:40,336 --> 00:07:42,504
I'm gonna start the video series

161
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:45,043
at the age where he'll
start understanding videos.

162
00:07:45,068 --> 00:07:46,864
So I'm thinking, like, 11.

163
00:07:48,344 --> 00:07:52,236
I've got a prosumer
HD cam and this Flip.

164
00:07:52,261 --> 00:07:53,823
Which would you like me to use?

165
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:54,877
I don't know.

166
00:07:54,902 --> 00:07:56,238
I don't know
you're talking about.

167
00:07:56,263 --> 00:07:57,950
But yeah, just start filming.

168
00:07:58,473 --> 00:08:00,605
I wanna observe
boys' natural habitat.

169
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,238
And I don't want people
to get the wrong idea.

170
00:08:02,263 --> 00:08:03,556
That's what the sign's about.

171
00:08:03,581 --> 00:08:05,541
Left, left! Right, right!

172
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,112
Okay.

173
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,613
<i>Yeah. In the face, in the face!</i>

174
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:09,615
You see that?

175
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,696
<i>Don't be a pussy.</i>

176
00:08:11,989 --> 00:08:14,395
The thing about bullies is,
they're always gonna be there.

177
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,465
You understand?

178
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:20,418
All you have to do to end a
bully is bonk him on the nose.

179
00:08:20,597 --> 00:08:21,602
That's it.

180
00:08:21,962 --> 00:08:25,297
Even if you get in a fight
later and you lose the fight,

181
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:27,085
the fact that you
were that much trouble

182
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,109
means he's never gonna
mess with you again.

183
00:08:29,665 --> 00:08:31,511
Now, I know what you're saying.

184
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:35,099
"Dad, what if I do get in
a fight? How do I fight?"

185
00:08:35,442 --> 00:08:37,286
Great question.
Let's show you.

186
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,616
Okay?

187
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,424
So, when someone attacks
you and it's gonna go down,

188
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:46,378
you just gotta be super-fast
and go, "Oh, shit, here we go."

189
00:08:47,525 --> 00:08:50,572
Employ a super-fast combination,
then get the hell out of there.

190
00:08:50,603 --> 00:08:52,400
Because what that
does with the brain is,

191
00:08:52,425 --> 00:08:54,220
it bonks it against the skull.

192
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:57,108
And that does way more
damage than just boop.

193
00:08:57,133 --> 00:08:58,551
You wanna go boo, boo.

194
00:08:58,642 --> 00:09:00,095
So the poor brain
goes bam, bam, bam.

195
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,877
And that's when you
get a pass out. Okay?

196
00:09:03,174 --> 00:09:05,861
And it helps to use bad grammar.
It makes you sound tougher.

197
00:09:05,886 --> 00:09:08,267
"Look, I don't want no trouble."

198
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:09,859
Right?

199
00:09:10,173 --> 00:09:11,718
Now, once you know that,

200
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,804
once you have the
basics of fighting down,

201
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:15,983
all of a sudden, bullies
aren't so intimidating.

202
00:09:16,441 --> 00:09:17,590
The fight isn't a big deal.

203
00:09:17,615 --> 00:09:19,479
It's a very uncomfortable
six seconds

204
00:09:19,504 --> 00:09:21,754
and then it's done.
It's just like diarrhea.

205
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,322
The way a dog can smell fear,

206
00:09:24,347 --> 00:09:26,066
a bully can smell confidence.

207
00:09:26,151 --> 00:09:28,267
And now, when you see a bully,
you're just sort of like,

208
00:09:28,292 --> 00:09:29,908
"Hey, buddy, what's going on?"

209
00:09:29,933 --> 00:09:32,143
"Oh, cute, he's a tough guy.

210
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:35,993
You're being ... Look, everyone,
we got a tough guy here."

211
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:37,914
And then he senses that,
and gets freaked out.

212
00:09:37,939 --> 00:09:40,251
There's nothing easier than
taking down a tough guy.

213
00:09:40,601 --> 00:09:43,515
Because he's not really a
tough guy if he's acting like one.

214
00:09:44,332 --> 00:09:45,500
Let me show you.

215
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:47,742
Get your stuff.
Let's go to this pack.

216
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:50,342
You're not even hitting him.

217
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,676
Come on, kick
the shit out of him.

218
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:53,651
Hey.

219
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,455
Don't you be filming me, bitch.

220
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,556
You two faggots wanna
get fucked in the ass?

221
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:59,052
What are you doing
with that camera?

222
00:10:00,774 --> 00:10:02,769
Mark! What is going on?

223
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,313
Bryan!

224
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:06,231
- Right there.
- You're gonna get it.

225
00:10:07,685 --> 00:10:08,576
Yes!

226
00:10:13,855 --> 00:10:16,058
You motherfuckers
are going to jail!

227
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,738
You're going to jail!

228
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,883
Oh, cramping,
cramping, I'm cramping.

229
00:10:22,908 --> 00:10:24,701
I'm cramping.
I'm cramping.

230
00:10:27,378 --> 00:10:29,159
Dude, we just beat up children.

231
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,576
It's collateral damage.

232
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,076
If you're making an omelet,
you gotta break some eggs.

233
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:37,125
You punched a kid in the nuts.

234
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:37,801
Yeah.

235
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,528
Did you hear him? He said he
was gonna fuck us in the ass.

236
00:10:40,553 --> 00:10:41,709
He was a rapist.

237
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:46,688
- Let's get out of here.
- Okay.

238
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:49,188
Why would anybody
eat in a tapas place?

239
00:10:49,213 --> 00:10:51,773
"Oh, I'm in the mood
for one oily meatball.

240
00:10:51,798 --> 00:10:53,258
One piece of bacon."

241
00:10:53,283 --> 00:10:56,453
I wouldn't mind bringing my
oily meatballs to a topless place.

242
00:10:56,478 --> 00:10:58,229
Oh, my God.
What is that?

243
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,251
Wow, full turnaround
you just had.

244
00:11:00,276 --> 00:11:03,094
No, it wasn't for her.
It was for her socks sandal ...

245
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:03,964
Oh.

246
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:09,076
I can't believe you care
about women's clothes.

247
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:10,355
Like you're so metrosexual.

248
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,083
That's not women's clothes.
That's my whole point.

249
00:11:12,108 --> 00:11:13,773
She's dressed like a German man.

250
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,260
She has sandals and
socks on, like a weird

251
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,969
goth from Stuttgart.
- This is, like,

252
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:19,304
still a thing with you.

253
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,556
That was a beautiful girl.

254
00:11:20,556 --> 00:11:22,099
You're like a hair
above being gay.

255
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:24,130
- I would not fuck her.
- Wow.

256
00:11:26,095 --> 00:11:28,899
These are amazing, sweetie.
Thanks for making them.

257
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:30,890
Yeah. Thanks so
much, Mrs. McCarthy.

258
00:11:30,915 --> 00:11:32,125
They're delicious.

259
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,486
So, what are you
guys doing, anyway?

260
00:11:35,048 --> 00:11:37,861
Um, we can't tell you.
It's a surprise.

261
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,107
For me?

262
00:11:39,584 --> 00:11:40,445
No.

263
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,494
Then why can't you tell me?

264
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,380
We just can't.

265
00:11:45,701 --> 00:11:46,548
Okay.

266
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,513
Well, that's good, actually,

267
00:11:48,538 --> 00:11:50,623
because I was worried
I was gonna have to,

268
00:11:50,648 --> 00:11:53,374
like, expend the energy
caring, and I just ...

269
00:11:53,554 --> 00:11:55,116
I don't have that
time today, you know?

270
00:11:55,141 --> 00:11:56,601
I'm, like, really busy.

271
00:11:56,626 --> 00:11:58,274
I've got a lot of
things to think about,

272
00:11:58,299 --> 00:12:00,188
like why do my
feet hurt so much?

273
00:12:00,213 --> 00:12:02,533
- She doesn't know I'm dying.
- Why are my toes so fat?

274
00:12:02,558 --> 00:12:05,728
Do I still have ankles? I don't.
I don't have ankles anymore.

275
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:07,405
It's just, like, leggy ...

276
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,547
Okay, pal. If you're
watching this tape,

277
00:12:09,572 --> 00:12:12,409
you're probably a new teen,

278
00:12:12,555 --> 00:12:14,821
you've got tons and tons of zits

279
00:12:14,846 --> 00:12:17,057
and your pubes
look kind of weird.

280
00:12:17,307 --> 00:12:19,267
This is around the age
where you start developing

281
00:12:19,292 --> 00:12:20,918
your funny bone, okay?

282
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,891
You're gonna have
riffs with friends.

283
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,822
They're gonna get more
and more advanced.

284
00:12:24,847 --> 00:12:27,018
There's two categories
with friend riffs,

285
00:12:27,043 --> 00:12:29,441
either I'm gonna fuck you,
or I'm gonna kill you.

286
00:12:29,466 --> 00:12:31,716
The peak, top, coolest,

287
00:12:31,741 --> 00:12:35,209
best joke you can
have with a buddy is this:

288
00:12:37,113 --> 00:12:41,050
"I was just reading in this
magazine about this guy

289
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,955
that super wants to
sleep with his best friend.

290
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,651
It was so stupid.
I was like, 'What? Ha-ha-ha.

291
00:12:48,686 --> 00:12:51,076
I don't know.
Why are they ... ?

292
00:12:51,101 --> 00:12:52,686
It was a questionnaire.

293
00:12:52,711 --> 00:12:54,547
'Why are they talking
about this? Weird.'"

294
00:12:54,572 --> 00:12:58,744
And if your friend is hilarious,
right? He'll go, "Really?

295
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:03,535
What did ... ?
What did it say he should do?"

296
00:13:04,547 --> 00:13:06,257
Ha-ha-ha. Okay?

297
00:13:06,609 --> 00:13:07,710
Once you got there,

298
00:13:07,735 --> 00:13:10,086
you're at the very top and
everything else is gravy.

299
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:12,436
What else? What else? What else?

300
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:15,295
Astrology. If a dude
asks you about astrology,

301
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,083
you shouldn't even
know your sign, okay.

302
00:13:17,108 --> 00:13:18,691
Astrology is for babysitters.

303
00:13:18,716 --> 00:13:22,216
The second someone asks you
about astrology, you just go, hmm.

304
00:13:22,856 --> 00:13:23,988
And walk off.

305
00:13:24,614 --> 00:13:28,325
Also, never say
"Like, literally", okay?

306
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,185
Those are the two
worst things you can say.

307
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:31,978
"Like" means "sort of."

308
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,790
And "literally" means
"exactly." Okay?

309
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:36,900
"Like, literally"
is a contradiction.

310
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,059
That's how you know
you're with a bad dude,

311
00:13:40,084 --> 00:13:42,496
because he's not
holding himself as a man.

312
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:44,565
A man has decorum, okay?

313
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,631
A man presents himself properly.

314
00:13:46,656 --> 00:13:49,359
And that means you have
to dress like you're in control.

315
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,304
Let me see this
for a second here.

316
00:13:51,329 --> 00:13:52,579
Now, this is Bryan,

317
00:13:52,604 --> 00:13:54,994
he's no son of mine,
but he's not a bad guy.

318
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:56,813
But I'm seeing a
lot of problems here.

319
00:13:56,838 --> 00:13:59,048
First of all, what is
all this extra fabric?

320
00:13:59,073 --> 00:14:01,567
Do you find your clothes
by the side of the road?

321
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:04,819
You look like someone who lost
maybe 200 pounds an hour ago.

322
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:05,904
And these.

323
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:08,749
These shower shoes
the kids are wearing today.

324
00:14:08,774 --> 00:14:11,524
What if you're walking
and you get in a fight?

325
00:14:11,549 --> 00:14:13,199
"My God, get this
guy out of here."

326
00:14:13,225 --> 00:14:14,305
Look at that.

327
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,232
- Dude.
- Okay? You need to be apt.

328
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:19,276
You need to be
able to move around.

329
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:20,736
You know what we're gonna do?

330
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:22,279
We're gonna get
you a whole new look

331
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,074
starting right now, all right?

332
00:14:24,099 --> 00:14:25,407
You're gonna look like a man,

333
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:27,789
then I'll teach you
to act like a man.

334
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,267
All right, let's get started.

335
00:14:59,127 --> 00:15:00,687
Well, there's nothing
there I wanna ...

336
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,874
There.
Your makeover is complete.

337
00:15:16,202 --> 00:15:16,983
Thank you.

338
00:15:17,008 --> 00:15:18,828
Let's just do this
top button here.

339
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,004
It makes you look
like a sexy murderer.

340
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:24,538
Do you need those glasses?

341
00:15:24,562 --> 00:15:25,696
For reading and driving.

342
00:15:25,721 --> 00:15:27,345
Okay, you shouldn't
read when you drive.

343
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,540
Oh, all right.

344
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,016
This is a man.

345
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,384
Bryan came in here dressed

346
00:15:32,409 --> 00:15:36,003
like a mentally ill
assassin at a sleepover

347
00:15:36,028 --> 00:15:38,035
and he's leaving here a man.

348
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,429
You look good, buddy.
How do you feel?

349
00:15:41,454 --> 00:15:43,554
Thanks, man.
I feel great.

350
00:15:45,563 --> 00:15:46,696
How you feeling?

351
00:15:48,077 --> 00:15:49,367
How do I feel?

352
00:15:51,933 --> 00:15:53,027
I feel bad.

353
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,728
I'm dying.

354
00:15:59,302 --> 00:16:00,880
I do think she looks better.

355
00:16:01,037 --> 00:16:03,068
It's funny, though, how,
like, they reformed them,

356
00:16:03,093 --> 00:16:05,846
but she's wearing as much
eyeliner as she always was.

357
00:16:05,871 --> 00:16:08,760
But at least she has, like,
a softer lip, which I like.

358
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,758
You can't do eyes
and lip, you know,

359
00:16:10,783 --> 00:16:12,347
because then it's just too much.

360
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:15,099
You gotta just pick one
because, otherwise, you're like ...

361
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,352
It looks like you give
BJs on the first date, right?

362
00:16:18,586 --> 00:16:19,473
Mark.

363
00:16:21,385 --> 00:16:22,236
Mark?

364
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:24,276
Yeah?

365
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:25,791
Doesn't she look better?

366
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:28,463
She's cute now.

367
00:16:31,928 --> 00:16:33,975
Heh. Nice shirt, cowboy.

368
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:35,354
Hurry up.

369
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:38,672
Okay, grooming for
a man is very simple.

370
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:41,968
You take your soap bar,
you lather up your pubes.

371
00:16:41,993 --> 00:16:43,587
That's how you
get a lather going,

372
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:46,040
with the friction, right?
Then take those suds

373
00:16:46,065 --> 00:16:48,984
and peel back your foreskin
and wash your head like that:

374
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,643
You do your balls.
You get down there, all right?

375
00:16:51,668 --> 00:16:54,043
You turn around, you get
your ass crack, all right?

376
00:16:54,068 --> 00:16:55,779
And then it's just
diddley diddley dee.

377
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:57,309
One armpit, doodle doodle doo.

378
00:16:57,334 --> 00:16:58,856
One armpit. Done.

379
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:03,060
No shower for a man should
be more than one minute long.

380
00:17:03,827 --> 00:17:05,132
Oh, morning, honey.

381
00:17:05,762 --> 00:17:07,027
What are you guys doing?

382
00:17:07,052 --> 00:17:08,887
I told you.
He's filming with me.

383
00:17:09,535 --> 00:17:10,388
Why?

384
00:17:10,816 --> 00:17:13,831
He's doing a documentary on me.

385
00:17:14,788 --> 00:17:15,611
Why?

386
00:17:15,692 --> 00:17:16,950
On ... On comed ...

387
00:17:16,975 --> 00:17:19,013
On people who used
to be comedians.

388
00:17:20,112 --> 00:17:21,583
Well, that sounds pretty boring.

389
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,834
That sounds boring?

390
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,162
You're saying I'm boring?

391
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:28,548
We're boring. Sort of, yeah.

392
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,907
I don't know about you,
but I consider boring

393
00:17:30,932 --> 00:17:33,059
to be about the worst
thing you can be.

394
00:17:33,395 --> 00:17:37,536
Well, sorry, but that's what
you are now, so get used to it.

395
00:17:37,561 --> 00:17:38,770
Oh, really?

396
00:17:38,795 --> 00:17:40,827
Yeah.
Once I poop this baby out,

397
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:43,266
there's not gonna be any
late-night partying, okay?

398
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,253
There's not gonna be
doing whatever you want

399
00:17:45,278 --> 00:17:47,229
or your stupid,
like, fart jokes.

400
00:17:47,254 --> 00:17:48,568
No more fart jokes?
Okay, got it.

401
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,515
You don't get to
do shit anymore.

402
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,265
I'm home, you're home.
We are boring!

403
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:54,712
- Fascinating.
- Time to grow up, okay?

404
00:17:54,737 --> 00:17:56,352
I'm having a child,
I don't need two.

405
00:17:56,377 --> 00:18:00,728
Oh, okay. I get it now!
I'm boring and I'm a child!

406
00:18:00,753 --> 00:18:02,284
I'm a boring child!

407
00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:04,143
Yeah, bingo, you got it!

408
00:18:04,168 --> 00:18:07,171
You're being basically insane!

409
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:12,026
- Get out of my bathroom.
- I'm sorry.

410
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,433
Hey, little buddy.
This is your dad's office.

411
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,512
This is where I
worked before I died.

412
00:18:20,537 --> 00:18:21,780
I've got a boner theme

413
00:18:21,805 --> 00:18:23,922
that's going throughout
the whole office.

414
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,231
I know it has kind
of a rapey vibe.

415
00:18:27,256 --> 00:18:29,383
And I keep all my
rapey vibes in here,

416
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:31,336
so things don't get
too out of control.

417
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:34,339
This holds 98 percent
of everything I own.

418
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:35,809
The rest is all bullshit.

419
00:18:39,995 --> 00:18:42,713
Hey, guys. I told you
about the documentary

420
00:18:42,738 --> 00:18:44,527
I'm doing, so I
assume that's cool.

421
00:18:44,948 --> 00:18:46,736
Yeah. Yeah. Whatever.

422
00:18:46,761 --> 00:18:48,410
So great, we're all here.

423
00:18:48,435 --> 00:18:51,647
CarPast is a thing
where you can check out

424
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,461
the history of a
used car online,

425
00:18:53,486 --> 00:18:55,109
see if it's been
in any accidents.

426
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,595
Damages you might not
necessarily see cosmetically.

427
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,642
Can I do my thing? Because
I already have this nailed.

428
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:02,101
Great. Go.

429
00:19:03,906 --> 00:19:06,078
All right, I'm gonna need
a prop. Let's use you, Rob.

430
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,960
Your body is perfect for this.

431
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:10,087
Okay.

432
00:19:10,135 --> 00:19:11,651
Guy's at a used-car lot, right?

433
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,463
He's looking at cars, dubious chap.

434
00:19:13,488 --> 00:19:15,323
Hmm. "I don't like that one."

435
00:19:15,348 --> 00:19:17,741
Hmm. He's smart.
He knows what he's doing.

436
00:19:18,139 --> 00:19:19,599
Then he sees this third car.

437
00:19:19,624 --> 00:19:23,139
We don't acknowledge that
it's a hot chick in a car costume.

438
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:25,378
Okay, imagine these
if they were perfect tits.

439
00:19:25,746 --> 00:19:27,800
And she's got that thing on

440
00:19:27,825 --> 00:19:29,526
where, you know, when
you can't see correctly?

441
00:19:29,551 --> 00:19:32,084
When you have a costume on,
you have to go like that:

442
00:19:32,334 --> 00:19:34,623
I love ... That's
comedy gold right there.

443
00:19:34,976 --> 00:19:36,394
And so I look at her,

444
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,504
and I'm treating her like
any other car, and I go,

445
00:19:38,535 --> 00:19:39,332
"You all right?"

446
00:19:39,741 --> 00:19:43,129
And she goes,
"Yeah, fine. Fine."

447
00:19:43,154 --> 00:19:46,279
And then we sort of draw
out a stare where I'm going:

448
00:19:46,795 --> 00:19:48,154
And then she's sort of going:

449
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:52,762
And then, bloop, some sweat
comes from her face, right?

450
00:19:52,787 --> 00:19:54,849
And then I decide to
test my hunch and I go ...

451
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,782
And I just start pushing
on her stomach, right?

452
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:02,911
And then, as I'm pushing, worst,
grossest, food poisoning fart.

453
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,203
Like: ...

454
00:20:12,793 --> 00:20:15,043
And I just go, "I knew it."

455
00:20:20,626 --> 00:20:21,790
You're kidding, right?

456
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:22,971
No.

457
00:20:25,177 --> 00:20:26,270
Wait, are you kidding?

458
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,946
Okay. All right, no, no.
I mean, that's ...

459
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,861
It's fine for us joking
around in here,

460
00:20:31,886 --> 00:20:34,244
but if we sent them that,
the client might think we ...

461
00:20:34,598 --> 00:20:36,535
Well, they might
question our competence.

462
00:20:37,293 --> 00:20:39,653
I thought I was gonna get
a hundred high-fives here.

463
00:20:39,692 --> 00:20:41,401
You're not gonna
take it to the client?

464
00:20:41,426 --> 00:20:43,868
This is a little bit too much
bathroom humor for this brand.

465
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:48,461
You guys do your job, okay?
I do my job. My job is being funny.

466
00:20:48,486 --> 00:20:51,026
You don't get funny.
Sorry, okay?

467
00:20:51,051 --> 00:20:53,303
Who here has been on Arsenio?
Hands up.

468
00:20:53,328 --> 00:20:54,367
One person.

469
00:20:54,392 --> 00:20:56,374
This is a half-a-million-dollar
commercial.

470
00:20:56,399 --> 00:20:58,367
I am not sending
them a fart joke.

471
00:20:58,392 --> 00:21:01,021
Farts are comedy gold,
you idiot!

472
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:03,004
So wait, I'm ... I'm
gonna run around

473
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:04,521
defending your
farts now, is that it?

474
00:21:04,546 --> 00:21:07,725
Look at a Ben Stiller movie.
Talk to the South Park guys.

475
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:09,727
We don't love it.
We don't like sitting,

476
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:11,781
typing out fart jokes,
but they pay the bills.

477
00:21:11,806 --> 00:21:13,641
Look at anything
that's made money.

478
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:17,306
It has a fart joke in it because
it goes back to cave days, brrt.

479
00:21:17,331 --> 00:21:18,741
Everyone laughed at that.

480
00:21:18,766 --> 00:21:19,577
Okay.

481
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:23,634
Relax, all right? I'm not
sending that to the client.

482
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:25,057
It's not like I'm firing you.

483
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,104
You can't fire me.

484
00:21:27,129 --> 00:21:28,277
I can, actually.

485
00:21:28,302 --> 00:21:30,013
Because I fucking quit!

486
00:21:34,481 --> 00:21:36,294
What is Arsenio? Is that ...?

487
00:21:38,075 --> 00:21:41,243
I hope you got all that. I hope
you filmed every fucking drop.

488
00:21:41,268 --> 00:21:42,068
Really?

489
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:43,882
You're quitting over
a grade-school joke?

490
00:21:43,907 --> 00:21:46,297
It's not about toilet
humor, Tony, okay?

491
00:21:46,322 --> 00:21:49,184
It's about you preventing
me from doing my job

492
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:51,978
because you don't
get that art takes risks.

493
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:53,587
That computer
doesn't belong to you.

494
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:54,665
You know what?

495
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:57,291
Fuck you, dude!

496
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,904
Really? Ho ... ? Are you
gonna do this to me every week?

497
00:22:01,489 --> 00:22:04,513
Just ... Will you just be
a man and apologize?

498
00:22:04,538 --> 00:22:07,451
- And we can move past this.
- Be a man and apologize?

499
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,024
You want me to apologize?

500
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:11,775
Okay. How's this
for an apology, Tony?

501
00:22:13,891 --> 00:22:15,078
Did you hear that?

502
00:22:15,103 --> 00:22:16,414
That was my worst fart

503
00:22:16,439 --> 00:22:18,079
and it still got a laugh.

504
00:22:19,609 --> 00:22:22,289
I'm sick of pretending
I'm not talented.

505
00:22:24,033 --> 00:22:25,369
Ugh! Fuck!

506
00:22:29,592 --> 00:22:30,749
You guys like comedy?

507
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:31,999
Why not?

508
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:36,029
I don't like women for
one very simple reason.

509
00:22:36,696 --> 00:22:37,947
They don't fart.

510
00:22:39,007 --> 00:22:40,873
So I can't relate to them.

511
00:22:42,314 --> 00:22:43,962
Farting is my everything.

512
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,431
It's what I live for.

513
00:22:48,396 --> 00:22:50,779
And I don't just love
the smell of my own farts,

514
00:22:50,804 --> 00:22:52,935
like I know you guys do.
I see you.

515
00:22:53,654 --> 00:22:54,927
I know you scoop 'em.

516
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,187
I know you sit on
the toilet and you go,

517
00:22:57,212 --> 00:22:58,984
"Whoa, that one reeked,"

518
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,009
and you enjoy it.

519
00:23:01,298 --> 00:23:03,063
I'm with you on that, obviously.

520
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:07,680
I like the smell of
my friends' farts.

521
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:11,104
If a friend lets
one rip in the car,

522
00:23:11,129 --> 00:23:12,867
I don't want the
windows wound up.

523
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:15,886
I wanna enjoy it
like a rare cheese.

524
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,855
I'm interested in its origin.

525
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,738
"Did it burn your anal
lips when it came out?

526
00:23:19,763 --> 00:23:21,567
Did you know it was
gonna be this bad?

527
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:26,197
That has a very sort of
powerful after-tang to it.

528
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:28,072
It's got a roadkill
kind of vibe.

529
00:23:28,477 --> 00:23:30,040
Do you eat dead rats?"

530
00:23:34,434 --> 00:23:36,153
I'm sort of a fart gourmand.

531
00:23:36,495 --> 00:23:38,901
I'm like the Mario Batali
of farts.

532
00:23:43,206 --> 00:23:44,749
I quit my job for this.

533
00:23:47,585 --> 00:23:48,389
Yup.

534
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:51,722
I quit my job,
got a pregnant wife,

535
00:23:51,747 --> 00:23:54,606
and I'm dying of
male breast cancer.

536
00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:00,144
Dude, I slayed.

537
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:02,668
Yeah, the part where
you were telling the truth.

538
00:24:02,712 --> 00:24:05,465
Yeah, duh. Ever heard of
"It's funny because it's true"?

539
00:24:05,503 --> 00:24:07,668
That's a lesson
for you. I never lie.

540
00:24:07,707 --> 00:24:08,892
Always tell the truth.

541
00:24:08,917 --> 00:24:10,790
Hey, Mark, can I talk
to you for a second?

542
00:24:10,815 --> 00:24:11,541
Curt.

543
00:24:11,566 --> 00:24:13,213
Did I kill or did I kill?

544
00:24:13,238 --> 00:24:15,491
Yeah, sure, you killed it, baby.

545
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:17,915
I wanna thank you
for letting me perform.

546
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:19,649
Okay. But the problem
is you were required

547
00:24:19,674 --> 00:24:22,494
to bring 15 heads to the
club and you only got six, so ...

548
00:24:22,542 --> 00:24:23,243
Seven.

549
00:24:23,268 --> 00:24:24,440
He didn't pay.

550
00:24:24,901 --> 00:24:28,051
Okay, take me to comedy jail.

551
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,262
You owe me $135.

552
00:24:36,713 --> 00:24:38,525
I still can't believe I'm dying.

553
00:24:39,866 --> 00:24:41,062
It's not sinking in.

554
00:24:41,801 --> 00:24:42,973
My dad's still alive.

555
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:46,111
I never knew my dad.

556
00:24:46,462 --> 00:24:47,273
Really?

557
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:48,996
That blows.

558
00:24:49,228 --> 00:24:50,931
Does your mom know who he is?

559
00:24:51,446 --> 00:24:54,244
No. She wasn't really ...

560
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:57,126
A little tiny bit of a slut.

561
00:24:58,639 --> 00:24:59,692
Hold on.

562
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,001
When I first met you
I was joking around

563
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:03,122
about being your dad,

564
00:25:03,147 --> 00:25:05,428
but I'm starting to
think it could be true.

565
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,262
What year were you born?

566
00:25:07,287 --> 00:25:08,111
1990.

567
00:25:09,447 --> 00:25:13,679
Wow, that's when I was really
wasted and doing a lot of drugs.

568
00:25:14,288 --> 00:25:16,530
And that picture
of your mom looks

569
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:19,329
pretty familiar.

570
00:25:51,693 --> 00:25:52,779
Where have you been?

571
00:25:52,804 --> 00:25:54,669
Guess what I did tonight.

572
00:25:56,675 --> 00:26:01,478
Doing stand-up and killing.

573
00:26:01,478 --> 00:26:02,923
Well, I mean, it was ...

574
00:26:02,948 --> 00:26:05,448
I killed. Killed.

575
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:09,319
Ah. I didn't know you
still wanted to do comedy.

576
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:10,489
It's who I am.

577
00:26:10,544 --> 00:26:12,161
I just got out there on-stage

578
00:26:12,186 --> 00:26:15,897
and I realized this is
what I'm about, you know?

579
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:20,422
Okay. Well, as long as it
doesn't interfere with your job.

580
00:26:20,447 --> 00:26:21,906
I quit my job.

581
00:26:22,925 --> 00:26:23,792
What?

582
00:26:23,817 --> 00:26:25,621
No, this is a new beginning.

583
00:26:25,819 --> 00:26:26,887
Are you serious?

584
00:26:27,667 --> 00:26:29,587
- You quit your job?
- Oh, my God.

585
00:26:29,612 --> 00:26:32,221
You quit your job
that gives you benefits

586
00:26:32,246 --> 00:26:35,236
and a salary while your
pregnant wife is at home.

587
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:37,339
Are you trying to give
me a miscarriage?

588
00:26:37,364 --> 00:26:39,854
I'm going to storm
out of here very slowly.

589
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:43,266
I'm trying to be true to myself,
setting an example for the kid.

590
00:26:43,291 --> 00:26:45,188
- Why would you do that?
- You need to relax.

591
00:26:45,188 --> 00:26:47,650
That is a fucking
stupid thing to do!

592
00:26:47,675 --> 00:26:49,213
I'm following my passion.

593
00:26:49,238 --> 00:26:51,065
Your passion is stupid!

594
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:56,418
Shouldn't you ... ?
Take out the camera.

595
00:26:56,443 --> 00:26:57,473
I got something.

596
00:26:57,861 --> 00:26:58,923
Get it out now.

597
00:26:59,524 --> 00:27:00,435
All right.

598
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,910
Hey, buddy.

599
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:14,274
You're probably in
your late teens by now,

600
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,517
and that means
you're super-horny

601
00:27:16,542 --> 00:27:18,792
and all you can
think about is women.

602
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:20,723
I want you to know

603
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:24,060
that women are very
hard to deal with, okay?

604
00:27:24,122 --> 00:27:26,638
They just sort of spew emotions

605
00:27:26,663 --> 00:27:29,875
like this big
tsunami of diarrhea.

606
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:32,569
You have to get out of
the way when that happens

607
00:27:32,569 --> 00:27:35,928
and sort of grab your
surfboard and ride the waves

608
00:27:35,953 --> 00:27:38,455
and sort of manipulate the ...

609
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,578
the insanity to work for you

610
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:43,996
in a way that's not easy to do.

611
00:27:44,824 --> 00:27:46,636
Actually, cut. Cut.

612
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,257
I have an awesome idea.

613
00:27:49,282 --> 00:27:50,292
Follow me.

614
00:27:50,499 --> 00:27:52,922
We don't deal with them
unless they pay less.

615
00:27:59,735 --> 00:28:01,087
All right, all set.

616
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:03,917
Okay.

617
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:08,626
The hardest thing in the
world to do is the cold call.

618
00:28:09,561 --> 00:28:10,623
What's a cold call?

619
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:13,991
Cold call ... You gotta
let me finish here, okay?

620
00:28:14,235 --> 00:28:17,485
The cold call is when you
don't know the chick at all

621
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:21,072
and you're walking up to her
and saying, "Hey, how you doing?"

622
00:28:21,097 --> 00:28:25,477
Just by doing that,
you're 100 percent admitting

623
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:27,668
that you're there just
because she's pretty.

624
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,418
You don't know anything
about her personality,

625
00:28:30,418 --> 00:28:33,089
and so, what you're basically
doing is walking up and saying:

626
00:28:33,114 --> 00:28:34,511
"Hi, I'm shallow."

627
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,619
That's a big hurdle to get over.

628
00:28:36,827 --> 00:28:39,997
The crucial thing here is
that you understand that it ...

629
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:44,032
Women don't want some
nice, sweet, corny guy, okay?

630
00:28:44,057 --> 00:28:45,349
They want a man.

631
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:47,685
They wanna be safe.
They wanna feel protected.

632
00:28:47,903 --> 00:28:49,504
All right? That's your job.

633
00:28:49,626 --> 00:28:51,387
They wanna be rescued.

634
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:54,066
They want a knight.
They want ...

635
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:56,402
We have to save
the damsel in distress.

636
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:57,095
Yeah.

637
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,413
The problem is,

638
00:28:58,988 --> 00:29:00,698
what kind of danger
are they in in a bar?

639
00:29:00,964 --> 00:29:01,816
Yeah.

640
00:29:01,841 --> 00:29:03,592
You know, there's
no damsel in distress.

641
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:05,278
No, there's no ... Yeah.

642
00:29:05,957 --> 00:29:07,567
Princess in a high tower.

643
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:10,386
So, what we're gonna do is,
we're gonna fabricate

644
00:29:10,411 --> 00:29:12,969
the princess in the
high tower, okay?

645
00:29:12,994 --> 00:29:13,854
Sure.

646
00:29:14,524 --> 00:29:16,797
Son, when we come back,

647
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:19,320
Bryan here is going to be doing

648
00:29:19,345 --> 00:29:22,681
what I like to call the
"wasted wingman."

649
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:23,847
Okay, cut.

650
00:29:24,573 --> 00:29:26,231
And what is that, exactly?

651
00:29:26,256 --> 00:29:28,138
Okay, do you see
those girls over there?

652
00:29:28,552 --> 00:29:29,403
Yeah.

653
00:29:29,428 --> 00:29:31,805
I need you to totally
creep them out.

654
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:33,272
Dude, I don't wanna do that.

655
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,316
Yes, you need to
be a wasted dude

656
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:37,897
that is bumming them
out so I can rescue them.

657
00:29:37,922 --> 00:29:39,570
Dude, I'm not gonna do that.

658
00:29:39,952 --> 00:29:42,929
I'm your father and I'm
telling you, you have to do that.

659
00:29:42,954 --> 00:29:44,110
You're not my dad.

660
00:29:44,135 --> 00:29:46,454
Well, I may have just
cum in your mom's cunt.

661
00:29:46,479 --> 00:29:48,939
Man, enough of that shit.
Come on.

662
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:51,299
It's my dying wish.
You ever heard of death row?

663
00:29:51,324 --> 00:29:53,626
They eat whatever they
want for their last meal.

664
00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:56,196
They'll have ice cream
and steak, whatever.

665
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,722
This is my ice cream steak.

666
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:02,335
After I moved him across
the country in a U-Haul.

667
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,698
- Oh, my God.
- Wait, what did you say?

668
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:09,308
Hi. That's really se ...
That's really sexy.

669
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,810
That's really ...
It looks really good.

670
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:15,106
You know, I think you guys
maybe take ... Take a bath together.

671
00:30:15,131 --> 00:30:16,799
What the hell, man? Well ...

672
00:30:16,824 --> 00:30:18,859
Hey, hey, hey.

673
00:30:18,944 --> 00:30:20,468
- What are you doing?
- Hey, fuck you.

674
00:30:20,493 --> 00:30:22,572
No, fuck you, motherfucker.

675
00:30:23,352 --> 00:30:25,852
Act like I just whispered
something super-scary.

676
00:30:25,877 --> 00:30:27,137
Get out of here.

677
00:30:31,613 --> 00:30:32,707
What are you drinking?

678
00:30:32,707 --> 00:30:35,113
It was a gin and tonic,
but don't worry about it.

679
00:30:35,138 --> 00:30:37,495
I'm worried about it. Gin and tonic?
And what about you?

680
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,329
Same.

681
00:30:38,354 --> 00:30:39,791
Two gin and tonics, please.

682
00:30:40,715 --> 00:30:42,258
Oh. I'm glad you are strangers.

683
00:30:42,258 --> 00:30:44,218
If you were my wife,
I would've murdered him.

684
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:45,491
Not ... I'm not married.

685
00:30:45,516 --> 00:30:47,685
I'm just saying like if I ...
My sister or whatever.

686
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,337
Because your adrenaline is like:

687
00:30:49,362 --> 00:30:50,686
Were you scared?

688
00:30:50,711 --> 00:30:52,630
Yeah, I was a little bit.
Sort of.

689
00:30:52,727 --> 00:30:54,992
Did you hear about that
bum on Bowery recently,

690
00:30:55,017 --> 00:30:57,976
who stabbed a guy in the eye
with a fork at Moby's tea shop?

691
00:30:58,001 --> 00:30:59,899
Yeah, the guy just said,
"Can you move, please?"

692
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:01,088
And the bum goes, prrt.

693
00:31:01,112 --> 00:31:01,900
Oh, God.

694
00:31:01,925 --> 00:31:03,671
Through his eye into his brain.

695
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:06,188
I'm more scared of drunk
guys than I am of gangsters.

696
00:31:06,213 --> 00:31:08,588
With a gangster,
you think he might have a gun,

697
00:31:08,613 --> 00:31:10,753
a bum definitely has a fork.

698
00:31:11,954 --> 00:31:14,805
He doesn't have anything
to eat, but he's got a fork.

699
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:20,671
You were fucking amazing,
by the way.

700
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:22,195
Dude, I don't remember anything.

701
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,431
Literally, I just shut off
and went into autopilot

702
00:31:24,456 --> 00:31:26,761
and watched myself
from outside my body.

703
00:31:26,761 --> 00:31:28,862
See that thing I
did where I said,

704
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,139
"What if we were married?"
Threw a wife thing in there?

705
00:31:31,164 --> 00:31:33,477
You slip into the friend
zone if you don't do that.

706
00:31:33,502 --> 00:31:34,978
Yeah, yeah, but you
had them laughing

707
00:31:35,003 --> 00:31:36,993
like the whole time.
What if you're just not funny?

708
00:31:37,018 --> 00:31:40,355
The secret to humor
is brutal honesty, right?

709
00:31:40,441 --> 00:31:42,869
With some vulnerability on top,

710
00:31:42,894 --> 00:31:46,398
and then just a sprinkling
of insightful commentary

711
00:31:46,423 --> 00:31:50,550
or some kind of pun to
tie it in a bow at the end.

712
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:53,090
Like, I actually
am scared of bums.

713
00:31:53,426 --> 00:31:55,121
But sometimes I get
nervous, you know?

714
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:58,677
I ... I get shaky,
my voice, it trembles.

715
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,093
Do you know about shitty tits?

716
00:32:12,473 --> 00:32:16,519
It's the best-kept secret in
the history of picking up chicks.

717
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:17,526
Are you ready?

718
00:32:18,658 --> 00:32:22,291
If you're intimidated by a girl
and she seems too hot for you.

719
00:32:22,316 --> 00:32:23,876
just imagine her

720
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:28,748
having the worst breasts
in the entire universe.

721
00:32:29,353 --> 00:32:31,181
But I don't just
mean not great tits,

722
00:32:31,206 --> 00:32:35,143
I mean the worst sagging,

723
00:32:35,566 --> 00:32:41,059
wrinkly, veiny, Star Wars bar monsters

724
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:44,090
with huge lumpy nipples and

725
00:32:44,115 --> 00:32:46,549
a giant cavernous belly button

726
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:50,093
with coarse hairs going
down in a big hair trail,

727
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,638
and big, like, broom bristles.

728
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:54,097
Zit, zit, zit.

729
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:57,560
Like a homeless
Romanian 90-year-old

730
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,933
who's dying of tumors.

731
00:32:58,958 --> 00:33:01,586
Oh, my God, you're
gonna make me puke, dude.

732
00:33:01,834 --> 00:33:03,159
Are you a virgin?

733
00:33:04,731 --> 00:33:05,762
That's, like ...

734
00:33:05,787 --> 00:33:07,418
Oh, my God, you are!

735
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:10,425
Oh, my God, I have so
much knowledge to impart.

736
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,864
I don't know where to begin.

737
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:12,481
Okay.

738
00:33:12,506 --> 00:33:14,201
If you feel like you're
gonna cum too soon,

739
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:16,912
imagine Kevin Spacey's head,
7 feet tall,

740
00:33:16,937 --> 00:33:19,565
floating above the bed,
and just focus on that.

741
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:22,752
Uh, if she takes you home,
that means "yes."

742
00:33:22,752 --> 00:33:24,267
Oh, and "no" doesn't mean no.

743
00:33:24,292 --> 00:33:25,416
Three "noes" means no.

744
00:33:25,441 --> 00:33:27,089
One "no" is like, uh, maybe.

745
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:28,925
Two "noes" is you're
not doing a good job.

746
00:33:28,925 --> 00:33:30,910
Three "noes" is get
out of there, give up.

747
00:33:30,935 --> 00:33:32,622
You have to
understand with women.

748
00:33:32,647 --> 00:33:37,324
You can totally subjugate them,
defile them, abuse them.

749
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:40,245
You can make them a
colostomy bag for your cum

750
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:43,063
if, and this is a big if,

751
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:46,149
if you treat them like
a human being after.

752
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,070
You wipe your cum off the face.

753
00:33:48,095 --> 00:33:51,224
"Oh, no, who did
this to my baby?"

754
00:33:51,249 --> 00:33:54,473
You know? You have to make her
breakfast. You have to eat her out.

755
00:33:54,498 --> 00:33:56,491
Dude, it's so much to remember.

756
00:33:56,585 --> 00:33:58,529
You don't know how to
eat out a chick, do you?

757
00:33:58,554 --> 00:34:00,366
Dude, of course.
I mean, come on.

758
00:34:04,055 --> 00:34:05,491
That wasn't even close.

759
00:34:05,516 --> 00:34:06,670
What do you mean?

760
00:34:07,201 --> 00:34:08,114
Okay.

761
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:11,385
What you just showed
me right there was this:

762
00:34:13,288 --> 00:34:14,530
I'm just like you, buddy.

763
00:34:14,555 --> 00:34:16,030
I wanna get in there.
I'm hungry.

764
00:34:16,055 --> 00:34:17,461
I'm a pig at the trough.

765
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:20,570
Okay? But you're like an eel

766
00:34:20,595 --> 00:34:23,468
going into someone's body.
That's freaky for a lady.

767
00:34:23,493 --> 00:34:25,314
Right? You gotta
ease her into it.

768
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:27,524
Imagine she's like
a wild, crazy horse.

769
00:34:29,527 --> 00:34:31,730
You don't go,
"Hey, crazy horse," tickle, tickle.

770
00:34:31,755 --> 00:34:33,631
Like, grab his nuts. Bssh.

771
00:34:33,656 --> 00:34:36,366
They'll just kick you out
of the way. You have to go:

772
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:44,583
"It's okay, Crazy Horse,
stay calm."

773
00:34:44,965 --> 00:34:47,461
You start her at the
very beginning, okay?

774
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:51,305
You just lay your
tongue on her vagina

775
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:52,665
just like a wet rug.

776
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,181
Just plop it down, okay?

777
00:34:55,206 --> 00:34:56,588
And then you know what you do?

778
00:34:56,941 --> 00:34:57,800
Nothing.

779
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:02,039
One-1000, two-1000, three-1000.

780
00:35:02,064 --> 00:35:04,525
We're just sitting there,
she's thinking,

781
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:07,606
"Okay. Now he's not a hungry
beaver eating out my corn,

782
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:10,121
but what's going on down there?

783
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:11,840
Nothing is going on.

784
00:35:11,865 --> 00:35:14,449
Oh, no, wait, something
is going ... Oh, what's this?

785
00:35:14,474 --> 00:35:16,277
We're moving right to left.

786
00:35:16,302 --> 00:35:18,034
We've got some momentum here

787
00:35:18,034 --> 00:35:20,135
and we're probably starting.
Okay, we're st ...

788
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,931
What happened?

789
00:35:24,393 --> 00:35:27,043
Uh ... Oh, I guess he sto ...
Oh, here we go again.

790
00:35:27,043 --> 00:35:29,668
Oh, there's a fast one.
No ... "

791
00:35:30,449 --> 00:35:32,472
You see? You're
building anticipation here.

792
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:35,359
You have to be
totally unpredictable.

793
00:35:35,462 --> 00:35:36,829
So you're starting and then:

794
00:35:36,854 --> 00:35:38,462
"Oh, I'm done.
I'm not doing it anymore.

795
00:35:38,487 --> 00:35:40,463
No, I'm back.
Now I'm going fast."

796
00:35:41,447 --> 00:35:43,282
Windshield wipers,
windshield wipers.

797
00:35:44,411 --> 00:35:46,770
Oh, now the battery's low ...

798
00:35:46,957 --> 00:35:48,230
So now she's going,

799
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:50,175
"Is he gonna eat this
thing or what? Come on."

800
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,901
That's sending the blood down.

801
00:35:51,926 --> 00:35:53,459
All the nerve endings
are getting blood.

802
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:56,677
Everyone in the whole body,
"Hey, hear about this pussy-eating thing going on?"

803
00:35:56,702 --> 00:35:59,717
And everyone goes to the vagina.
"Oh, I gotta check this out."

804
00:35:59,742 --> 00:36:01,977
Around now you start
feeling some juices going.

805
00:36:02,002 --> 00:36:03,524
Once you feel the juices,

806
00:36:03,549 --> 00:36:04,978
that's the time
to ramp it up a bit,

807
00:36:05,003 --> 00:36:07,922
and maybe, just maybe,
see, you don't even know,

808
00:36:08,135 --> 00:36:09,585
maybe get a frequency going.

809
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:12,903
"Oh, boy, here we go.
Now we're cooking with gas.

810
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,548
Doot doo doo, doot doo doo.

811
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:17,760
Now we're gonna go to the end.
Now we're feeling some ... "

812
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,093
What ... ?

813
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:24,840
Just wait it out.

814
00:36:26,164 --> 00:36:27,875
"What is he doing?"
Now you start feeling this.

815
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:31,415
"Oh, my God. Oh, please, please, please."
Anticipation, "Please lick it. Please lick it."

816
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,940
"I might. I might just get
up and go to work right now.

817
00:36:35,018 --> 00:36:36,619
I might go up and
have a bowl of cereal."

818
00:36:36,893 --> 00:36:38,488
"No, I'm not. Now, I'm ... "
And then she's like,

819
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:41,283
"Oh, fuck, thank God.
He's not giving up."

820
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:45,203
Now we're gonna go to the finish line.
We feel the quivering.

821
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,109
It's just a mound of mucus.

822
00:36:47,761 --> 00:36:50,250
And it's time to do the
whole beaver thing, right?

823
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,783
Just start like that.
Go as fast as you can, right?

824
00:36:52,808 --> 00:36:53,877
Wrong!

825
00:36:54,362 --> 00:36:57,133
Now, the final 10 percent,

826
00:36:57,133 --> 00:37:00,010
we do what's called
"the man in the boat isolation."

827
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,236
Okay, so you just
wanna focus on this guy.

828
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:04,603
The man in the boat? The clit.

829
00:37:04,845 --> 00:37:07,827
You see, there's all kinds of labia
and hair and crap around there.

830
00:37:07,852 --> 00:37:10,562
So you just wanna push
all that aside with your mouth

831
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:13,065
and just focus on
the man in the boat.

832
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:15,359
And now you just
start giving him.

833
00:37:15,384 --> 00:37:17,653
And you're just ...
Punching bag, speed bag.

834
00:37:17,653 --> 00:37:18,926
Bdda-bdda-bdda-bdda-bdda.

835
00:37:18,951 --> 00:37:20,949
And you just slap the
shit out of it. "You fucker.

836
00:37:20,974 --> 00:37:22,270
You owe me 300 bucks.

837
00:37:22,295 --> 00:37:24,052
You keep lying about it."
Bam, bam, bam.

838
00:37:24,077 --> 00:37:25,991
You suck it all in and
you create a vacuum.

839
00:37:26,016 --> 00:37:28,330
And you're just going,
boom, boom, boom.

840
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:30,228
And it's going, "Holy shit."

841
00:37:31,054 --> 00:37:33,310
And rrt, and it's gonna hurt,

842
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:34,681
okay, because your
tongue's exhausted.

843
00:37:34,706 --> 00:37:36,721
But you gotta go for the goal.
You keep going, rrt.

844
00:37:36,746 --> 00:37:38,440
"Oh, Jesus Christ."

845
00:37:39,508 --> 00:37:41,078
Now you're going
fucking bananas on it.

846
00:37:41,103 --> 00:37:43,424
Now you're that
beaver eating the corn.

847
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:45,890
"Oh, fucking ..."

848
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:51,728
And then, once it's all over,

849
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:55,065
instead of getting up and
going, prrt, you go, whew.

850
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:57,484
And you go back to that
wet rug from the beginning.

851
00:37:57,585 --> 00:37:59,084
You just bookend it with that.

852
00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:02,399
Just lay it down there
for a few seconds.

853
00:38:03,892 --> 00:38:05,110
And you're done.

854
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:09,693
And now she's yours, forever.

855
00:38:17,232 --> 00:38:19,005
Thank you. Thank you.

856
00:38:19,218 --> 00:38:20,678
Let's go get some coke.

857
00:38:22,928 --> 00:38:24,053
What is this place?

858
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:25,419
It's a gay bar.

859
00:38:25,819 --> 00:38:27,632
What, like, with gay people?

860
00:38:27,902 --> 00:38:28,754
No.

861
00:38:29,725 --> 00:38:31,977
I was just staring. You know,
so I'm in the other seat

862
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:33,603
and I'm just staring.

863
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:35,772
Still, he got really angry
about the whole thing.

864
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:38,029
And I was sitting there,
I was like ...

865
00:38:41,195 --> 00:38:42,129
Hey.

866
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:45,365
I don't know if you
guys remember me.

867
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:47,254
I used to come in here
all the time. I'm Mark.

868
00:38:47,279 --> 00:38:48,130
Mark.

869
00:38:48,155 --> 00:38:49,435
- Yeah, you're Jo.
- Jo.

870
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,053
- Sparkles.
- Yeah.

871
00:38:51,366 --> 00:38:52,831
Just give me a 20 bag.

872
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:55,499
It's another 60, it's 80 bucks.

873
00:38:55,524 --> 00:38:56,976
You don't do 20 bags anymore?

874
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,149
Yeah, I do 20 bags,

875
00:38:58,174 --> 00:39:00,135
if you take a time machine
and go back 30 years.

876
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,299
What are you talking about,
20 bags, this fucking guy?

877
00:39:02,299 --> 00:39:04,697
Oh, man, that's so much blow.

878
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:09,085
There. Thanks for the
year's supply of coke.

879
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,883
- Let me see your dick.
- Oh, come on.

880
00:39:10,908 --> 00:39:12,812
Are you kidding me?
You're still doing that?

881
00:39:12,837 --> 00:39:15,281
Eh. Quick. Just quick.

882
00:39:16,236 --> 00:39:17,223
Fuck.

883
00:39:17,929 --> 00:39:20,192
This is humiliating.

884
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:22,023
- Here we go.
- Not bad.

885
00:39:22,048 --> 00:39:23,641
Turn ...
Flip it over a little ...

886
00:39:24,338 --> 00:39:26,531
Okay. All right.
Let me see your dick?

887
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:28,143
- Me?
- Yeah.

888
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:30,882
- Just pull it out for one second.
- No. I'm not doing that.

889
00:39:30,907 --> 00:39:32,804
- Just flash it, zoop.
- No.

890
00:39:33,122 --> 00:39:35,749
Quick shot of your cock.
Just let me see your cock.

891
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:36,905
Do you want coke or not?

892
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:38,522
No, I don't, actually.

893
00:39:50,309 --> 00:39:51,339
It's all right.

894
00:39:51,364 --> 00:39:52,939
- Really?
- Yeah. Go ahead. Go ahead.

895
00:39:53,205 --> 00:39:54,517
- It's all you. Take it.
- Thanks a lot.

896
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:55,811
All right, guys.

897
00:39:58,719 --> 00:39:59,856
What was that?

898
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:00,863
I know, right?

899
00:40:00,888 --> 00:40:02,934
It looked like a
Rob Zombie clown

900
00:40:02,959 --> 00:40:04,365
joined Tenacious D or something.

901
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:07,145
No, you let him
sexually assault you.

902
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:09,158
Uh, I don't see it that way.

903
00:40:09,387 --> 00:40:10,817
And you said "thank you."

904
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:14,051
Cops have a mental vocabulary
when it comes to crime, okay?

905
00:40:14,076 --> 00:40:16,242
If they see you tapping
out coke on your hand

906
00:40:16,267 --> 00:40:17,992
or using a key bump, they go:

907
00:40:18,017 --> 00:40:20,947
"Hey, I know what that is.
I have a trigger."

908
00:40:20,972 --> 00:40:22,306
But when you do something crazy,

909
00:40:22,331 --> 00:40:25,095
like what I like to
call a palm bump ...

910
00:40:25,583 --> 00:40:27,341
Oh, man.

911
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:30,804
... they just see
a mentally-ill guy

912
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:32,764
slicking back his hair, right?

913
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,172
You just do it in
public like that?

914
00:40:34,197 --> 00:40:35,936
Do what? I just went like this,

915
00:40:35,961 --> 00:40:37,795
and I thought about
something and I'm ...

916
00:40:39,492 --> 00:40:41,210
It's called
perceptual blindness.

917
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:44,521
When the Indians first saw
the boats come with Columbus,

918
00:40:44,546 --> 00:40:45,944
they didn't see anything

919
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:48,629
because their brains didn't
have a department for that.

920
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:50,005
So they couldn't handle them.

921
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,834
They just went, "I see nothing,
just an ocean."

922
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:53,976
What do you mean?

923
00:40:54,001 --> 00:40:55,829
You can become invisible to cops

924
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:58,547
if you do cocaine
in a weird way.

925
00:40:58,797 --> 00:41:00,226
You're gonna lose
some on your face, but ...

926
00:41:00,251 --> 00:41:01,343
Can I try?

927
00:41:01,368 --> 00:41:02,245
Sure.

928
00:41:07,161 --> 00:41:09,333
Wow, you have a gift.

929
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:12,824
You have a tiny bit on
your nose and that's about it.

930
00:41:17,017 --> 00:41:20,548
Okay. Let's do bar etiquette,
number 37.

931
00:41:20,573 --> 00:41:25,483
This is the 340th rule
of page A, section B.

932
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,069
Wow, that's a lot of them.

933
00:41:27,069 --> 00:41:30,613
Man in a bar doesn't have
a credit card, has cash,

934
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:33,533
orders the cheapest beer around.

935
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:35,837
Can we get two of your
cheapest beers, please?

936
00:41:36,245 --> 00:41:39,526
Okay? You notice I didn't
have a fruity drink, okay?

937
00:41:39,551 --> 00:41:41,436
I'm not trying to
disguise the fact

938
00:41:41,461 --> 00:41:43,543
that we're eating
rotten barley and oats.

939
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:45,837
- Yeah.
- You understand? This is poison.

940
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:48,862
We're here basically
at a alcohol crack house

941
00:41:48,887 --> 00:41:50,633
to poison our bodies.

942
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:52,018
They don't do that with heroin.

943
00:41:52,043 --> 00:41:54,014
They don't have
strawberry heroin, right?

944
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:55,176
I don't know.

945
00:41:55,201 --> 00:41:56,973
We should get some heroin.

946
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:58,246
What, dude?

947
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,126
Yes.

948
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:01,644
And I'm not getting a wine

949
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,779
or a cocktail or some
sort of fruity drink

950
00:42:03,804 --> 00:42:05,607
where you have to hold the stem.

951
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:08,193
"Oh, the stem.
I have a little flower.

952
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:11,286
I'm a smart lady,
I'm a businesswoman."

953
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:13,353
We don't do that, right?

954
00:42:13,377 --> 00:42:14,528
Get that guy out of here.

955
00:42:14,553 --> 00:42:16,410
Get that guy out of here.
Those are stupid.

956
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:18,578
With your credit card cocktails.

957
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:26,048
Ladies, I would
like to introduce you

958
00:42:26,073 --> 00:42:28,204
to a fucking asshole.

959
00:42:28,229 --> 00:42:30,791
This guy came up to
me outside and he said,

960
00:42:30,816 --> 00:42:33,066
"I would like to apologize,
dude. I was wasted."

961
00:42:33,091 --> 00:42:34,844
I go, "Wrong gender, man.

962
00:42:34,844 --> 00:42:37,097
You got to apologize to
those two girls in the bar."

963
00:42:37,097 --> 00:42:37,974
Yeah.

964
00:42:39,005 --> 00:42:42,337
I'm really sorry,
I was really drunk,

965
00:42:42,362 --> 00:42:44,646
and it's really
stupid and I'm sorry.

966
00:42:44,646 --> 00:42:48,191
Whatever.
We are totally over it, right?

967
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,728
We are. We're over it.

968
00:42:49,753 --> 00:42:50,986
Beautiful.

969
00:42:50,986 --> 00:42:52,529
We're over it. We're over it.

970
00:42:52,529 --> 00:42:55,801
The trio of victims
accept your apology.

971
00:42:55,826 --> 00:42:56,950
Whoa.

972
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,502
I don't remember
you being as hot.

973
00:42:58,527 --> 00:43:00,603
Did you do something
since we were last here?

974
00:43:00,628 --> 00:43:01,622
I have to talk to you.

975
00:43:01,647 --> 00:43:04,820
If we talk, I'm gonna have
to talk like this ... a blind man.

976
00:43:04,845 --> 00:43:06,359
Every time I look at you,

977
00:43:06,384 --> 00:43:07,923
it's like a flashbulb went off

978
00:43:07,948 --> 00:43:09,546
and I can see your
face everywhere.

979
00:43:09,546 --> 00:43:11,428
- Stop.
- It's like staring at the sun.

980
00:43:11,453 --> 00:43:14,233
You know what I want?
I want Sharia Law in here.

981
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,686
Can we get two burkas
for the ladies, please?

982
00:43:16,711 --> 00:43:17,804
Oh, my God.

983
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:20,223
This is getting too intense,
I can't hack it.

984
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:23,404
It's too much.
It's like Medusa in reverse.

985
00:43:23,429 --> 00:43:25,687
What, they're, like,
turning statues into people?

986
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:27,689
Yes.
That's what they're doing.

987
00:43:27,689 --> 00:43:29,911
Look at this guy. He's
bugging you when he's drunk.

988
00:43:29,936 --> 00:43:32,175
Now he's sober,
he's a metaphor nut.

989
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,348
I gotta go to the bathroom.

990
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:41,185
Whoa, Dude, what are you doing?

991
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:43,731
I'm having some fun, my man.

992
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:47,125
Please tell me you have coke.

993
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:48,344
That is so.

994
00:43:50,107 --> 00:43:52,482
This is really good shit,
it's super-strong.

995
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:53,654
- Really?
- Yeah.

996
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:56,038
It's gonna make your
whole face go numb.

997
00:43:58,277 --> 00:44:00,824
I'm just gonna
break it in for you.

998
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:04,976
Aah. Pa-koo-ahh!

999
00:44:06,562 --> 00:44:07,912
There you go.

1000
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:10,187
There's that and there's that.

1001
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,021
Oh, my God.

1002
00:44:17,765 --> 00:44:20,116
You're so fucking hot.

1003
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:26,748
Oh, I wanna see your
tits so fucking bad.

1004
00:44:26,748 --> 00:44:28,124
Let me see your tits.

1005
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:32,254
Holy fucking shit,
they are so perfect.

1006
00:44:32,254 --> 00:44:35,048
Oh, my God.
I love your tits.

1007
00:44:35,048 --> 00:44:37,626
I love your fucking
tits so much.

1008
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:41,971
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1009
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:45,934
Oh, yeah.
Oh, fuck, take it out.

1010
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:52,070
Oh, my fu-ckin' God.

1011
00:44:56,152 --> 00:44:58,780
The fact that you
believe it's gonna happen,

1012
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,823
and some of that is
delusion and some of that ...

1013
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,325
God bless you.

1014
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:04,119
Some of that is
just perseverance

1015
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:06,413
and faith and all
those good things

1016
00:45:06,413 --> 00:45:08,998
that people try not
to believe in anymore,

1017
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:10,875
but it works, and one day

1018
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:13,086
something changes
and you feel better.

1019
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:15,589
And you hit it. I don't
think it's a delusion at all.

1020
00:45:15,589 --> 00:45:18,300
- Rolling Stone said maybe our next Richard ...
- Right?

1021
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,844
I love your fucking
tits so much.

1022
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:24,969
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1023
00:45:25,432 --> 00:45:28,775
Oh, yeah.
Oh, fuck, take it out.

1024
00:45:31,244 --> 00:45:33,729
Oh, my God.

1025
00:45:34,711 --> 00:45:35,859
Come on, are you kidding me?

1026
00:45:35,884 --> 00:45:38,680
Oh, great.
The ... My Clarks fit in with ...

1027
00:45:38,705 --> 00:45:41,167
Vintage Nikes, those ...
Just throw those on the ...

1028
00:45:41,192 --> 00:45:42,949
Ow! You just hit me.

1029
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:45,661
Those are my custom
Chuck Tayl ... Ow!

1030
00:45:45,661 --> 00:45:47,912
You just hit me with
a steel-toed boot.

1031
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:49,926
Can I get some clothes, please?

1032
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:53,590
Those are yours. That's a shoe.
Oh, great. I'm not a millipede.

1033
00:45:53,615 --> 00:45:57,789
Okay, we're good for shoes.
I'd like some pants.

1034
00:45:58,507 --> 00:46:00,842
Oh, for fuck sakes.

1035
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:05,133
Are you ... ?
Why are you filming this?

1036
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,448
Do you wanna talk
about what just happened?

1037
00:46:09,473 --> 00:46:10,866
Absolutely not.

1038
00:46:11,584 --> 00:46:13,146
Your wife just kicked you out.

1039
00:46:13,146 --> 00:46:15,741
Yeah? Well, maybe she's
collateral damage too.

1040
00:46:27,706 --> 00:46:28,537
Don't film this.

1041
00:46:28,537 --> 00:46:30,288
- I don't have anything ...
- That's him!

1042
00:46:30,427 --> 00:46:32,208
You! You kick my
son in the nuts?

1043
00:46:32,233 --> 00:46:33,186
I don't know who that is.

1044
00:46:33,211 --> 00:46:35,557
That's him, Dad.
Sure as shit.

1045
00:46:39,375 --> 00:46:40,386
Get him!

1046
00:46:40,411 --> 00:46:41,828
Okay. This is a big man.

1047
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:45,568
One more for the road, bitch.

1048
00:46:49,611 --> 00:46:50,677
Fuck.

1049
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:53,727
Why didn't you have my back?

1050
00:46:53,752 --> 00:46:56,305
Ever heard of having
a homey's back?

1051
00:46:58,191 --> 00:46:59,605
See that guy sucker punch me?

1052
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:00,477
Yeah.

1053
00:47:01,277 --> 00:47:03,097
Oh, great. Now I'm that guy.

1054
00:47:04,781 --> 00:47:06,343
You know what a fight face is?

1055
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:09,452
After every fight,

1056
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:11,580
guys wanna look
like they're not fazed,

1057
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:13,103
so they'll go:

1058
00:47:14,249 --> 00:47:16,543
"Did you see that
guy sucker punch me?

1059
00:47:16,543 --> 00:47:17,619
What a bitch."

1060
00:47:17,989 --> 00:47:19,879
But their adrenalin
is pumping so much

1061
00:47:19,904 --> 00:47:21,881
that instead of going like this:

1062
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:23,170
They go like this:

1063
00:47:23,717 --> 00:47:27,120
They go, "Do you see
that guy sucker punch me?"

1064
00:47:28,481 --> 00:47:29,858
It's a fight face.

1065
00:47:33,142 --> 00:47:34,770
Wish I had ...
Do you have any weed?

1066
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:35,620
No.

1067
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:37,463
My balls still kill.

1068
00:47:37,488 --> 00:47:38,607
Oh, dude.

1069
00:47:38,607 --> 00:47:41,067
Weed is good for that,
I heard, and glaucoma.

1070
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:42,694
- I don't know.
- Hey, turn on the camera,

1071
00:47:42,694 --> 00:47:43,733
I got an idea.

1072
00:47:44,399 --> 00:47:45,450
All right.

1073
00:47:50,208 --> 00:47:52,120
Let's do a whole drug guide.

1074
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:52,947
Cool.

1075
00:47:54,953 --> 00:47:56,625
He's getting older now.

1076
00:47:56,804 --> 00:47:58,757
He's gonna need
to know the basics.

1077
00:48:02,228 --> 00:48:03,316
Hey, buddy,

1078
00:48:04,603 --> 00:48:07,343
don't eat ice cream when
you're growing up, by the way.

1079
00:48:07,343 --> 00:48:08,370
I'm having this

1080
00:48:08,395 --> 00:48:10,358
because I was
just in a fistfight

1081
00:48:10,383 --> 00:48:11,468
with some guy.

1082
00:48:13,516 --> 00:48:15,969
I wanna tell you about drugs.

1083
00:48:15,994 --> 00:48:17,469
Now, if you're 14 or something,

1084
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:19,408
don't listen to this.
You're way too young.

1085
00:48:19,433 --> 00:48:21,237
If you're getting older
and they're around,

1086
00:48:21,262 --> 00:48:22,323
don't do them,

1087
00:48:22,348 --> 00:48:25,779
but if you do do them,
here's the basics:

1088
00:48:25,779 --> 00:48:27,519
Weed is good. It's funny,

1089
00:48:27,544 --> 00:48:29,824
it's bad for homework,
and bad for your grades, okay?

1090
00:48:29,849 --> 00:48:32,833
It's for having sex and
watching horror movies

1091
00:48:32,858 --> 00:48:34,349
and laughing with your friends.

1092
00:48:34,374 --> 00:48:35,600
It's not for doing homework,

1093
00:48:35,625 --> 00:48:38,639
and don't be stoned
at school, okay?

1094
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:41,542
Cocaine is fun, it's an
easy way to get laid,

1095
00:48:41,567 --> 00:48:44,631
but it turns your
dick into a baby sock.

1096
00:48:46,758 --> 00:48:49,761
Heroin is Russian roulette.

1097
00:48:49,761 --> 00:48:51,893
Every time you do it,
you're just going,

1098
00:48:51,918 --> 00:48:53,666
"Gee, hope I don't die."

1099
00:48:53,691 --> 00:48:56,184
If you shoot it into
your veins, you will die.

1100
00:48:56,863 --> 00:48:59,019
Have you ... ?
Have you done heroin?

1101
00:48:59,044 --> 00:49:00,120
Of course I've done heroin.

1102
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:02,487
Why would I be giving heroin
advice if I haven't done it?

1103
00:49:02,512 --> 00:49:03,683
You don't believe me?

1104
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:05,902
No. You just said
that you'd die.

1105
00:49:05,902 --> 00:49:09,152
Let's get some heroin right now.
Come on, we're getting heroin.

1106
00:49:14,138 --> 00:49:15,111
Hello.

1107
00:49:15,372 --> 00:49:16,855
Hey, is Gary there?

1108
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,508
He's at work. Who's this?

1109
00:49:19,708 --> 00:49:20,926
He's at work?

1110
00:49:21,129 --> 00:49:23,045
Where? Is he back
at the restaurant?

1111
00:49:23,545 --> 00:49:24,547
Who is this?

1112
00:49:39,306 --> 00:49:41,554
Okay, great. No, no, no. You ...

1113
00:49:43,418 --> 00:49:45,488
- No filming here, okay? Sorry.
- Gary.

1114
00:49:46,393 --> 00:49:47,285
Mark?

1115
00:49:48,403 --> 00:49:50,264
Comedian? Arsenio?

1116
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:53,867
Holy shit, Mark!

1117
00:49:53,867 --> 00:49:55,797
Oh my God. Didn't
recognize you with the beard.

1118
00:49:55,822 --> 00:49:57,220
- Weird, eh?
- You look good.

1119
00:49:57,368 --> 00:49:58,423
You look amazing.

1120
00:49:58,448 --> 00:50:00,373
It's been a long time, man.

1121
00:50:00,373 --> 00:50:01,681
Holy shit. Is this your kid?

1122
00:50:01,706 --> 00:50:02,567
Eh, no.

1123
00:50:02,592 --> 00:50:03,877
Dude, are you famous now?

1124
00:50:03,877 --> 00:50:05,879
I'm still doing comedy,

1125
00:50:05,879 --> 00:50:08,082
but I'm not partying as much,
I'll tell you that.

1126
00:50:08,107 --> 00:50:09,817
Yeah? Good, man. Me too.

1127
00:50:09,842 --> 00:50:12,591
Me too.
I got clean.

1128
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:14,875
I just had my big
chocolate cake last week.

1129
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:16,806
Tasted really good, man. I'm ...

1130
00:50:17,699 --> 00:50:19,203
It's a whole new life for me.

1131
00:50:20,698 --> 00:50:22,126
Yeah. You want a cappuccino?

1132
00:50:22,151 --> 00:50:24,033
They have the best
cappuccino in the world.

1133
00:50:24,058 --> 00:50:25,869
- I'll get you some.
- You take a Guido pill?

1134
00:50:25,894 --> 00:50:27,692
You're Mr. Italiano now.

1135
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:29,736
You ... Come on, I'm half-Italian.
You didn't know?

1136
00:50:29,736 --> 00:50:31,279
- I'm mezzo Italiano.
- Hey.

1137
00:50:31,279 --> 00:50:33,036
This place kind of brings
it out of me, you know.

1138
00:50:33,061 --> 00:50:34,332
Hey, get the fuck out of here.

1139
00:50:34,357 --> 00:50:36,960
"Hey, get the fuck out ... "
Ha, you're funny still, man.

1140
00:50:37,699 --> 00:50:38,583
That's bad.

1141
00:50:38,708 --> 00:50:39,328
Why?

1142
00:50:39,328 --> 00:50:42,039
In NA, cokeheads
get vanilla cake

1143
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,439
and junkies get chocolate cake,

1144
00:50:43,464 --> 00:50:45,752
but not after being
clean for a long time.

1145
00:50:45,752 --> 00:50:46,736
That's great.

1146
00:50:47,072 --> 00:50:47,571
No.

1147
00:50:47,596 --> 00:50:49,890
- Alrighty. Alrighty. Alrighty.
- Hey.

1148
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:51,756
Hey, I gotta say, man,

1149
00:50:51,781 --> 00:50:53,574
seeing someone
from the old days,

1150
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:55,386
it's weird, right?
- So weird.

1151
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:56,802
Fucking weird.

1152
00:50:57,138 --> 00:50:59,766
It's bringing back some
memories too, you know?

1153
00:50:59,766 --> 00:51:01,827
We used to do some wild shit,
he and me, you know?

1154
00:51:01,852 --> 00:51:03,519
Really fucked-up shit.

1155
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:04,334
How old are you?

1156
00:51:04,359 --> 00:51:05,060
22.

1157
00:51:05,085 --> 00:51:07,607
22. I can speak in front of him?

1158
00:51:07,607 --> 00:51:09,457
It depends what
you're gonna say.

1159
00:51:09,482 --> 00:51:10,535
Remember Linda Kim?

1160
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,012
Oh, her tits.

1161
00:51:12,037 --> 00:51:14,122
Linda Kim's tits,
they were these fucking ...

1162
00:51:14,147 --> 00:51:16,068
- They so ... They were long.
- Yeah.

1163
00:51:16,093 --> 00:51:18,220
They drooped down,
like, beneath her pussy.

1164
00:51:18,245 --> 00:51:20,079
This one time I
was titty-fucking her,

1165
00:51:20,104 --> 00:51:22,288
she leaned forward,
I'm like, "What the fuck?"

1166
00:51:22,288 --> 00:51:23,635
I looked down, she put my dick

1167
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:25,625
into her pussy
through her fucking tits.

1168
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:27,302
I was titty-fucking her.

1169
00:51:27,327 --> 00:51:28,711
It was fucking amazing.

1170
00:51:28,711 --> 00:51:30,709
She died ...
You know, she died last year.

1171
00:51:30,734 --> 00:51:31,456
What?

1172
00:51:31,481 --> 00:51:33,925
Yeah. She choked to death.

1173
00:51:34,217 --> 00:51:35,397
What are you talking about?

1174
00:51:35,422 --> 00:51:38,287
On a fucking dick.
I don't keep track of Linda Kim.

1175
00:51:38,312 --> 00:51:40,093
Man. Shit.

1176
00:51:40,118 --> 00:51:42,202
How's the cappuccino?
Best in the fucking world, right?

1177
00:51:42,227 --> 00:51:42,969
It's ...

1178
00:51:43,448 --> 00:51:45,135
Could you get us heroin?

1179
00:51:45,512 --> 00:51:46,547
What's that?

1180
00:51:48,112 --> 00:51:50,269
It's for this documentary
we're doing.

1181
00:51:50,683 --> 00:51:51,964
You're making a documen ...

1182
00:51:51,989 --> 00:51:54,089
That's some Arsenio
shit right there, right?

1183
00:51:54,114 --> 00:51:56,621
That's some new material.
That's very funny.

1184
00:51:56,646 --> 00:51:58,491
Not so much, really. But ...

1185
00:51:58,491 --> 00:51:59,501
I'm not kidding.

1186
00:52:01,577 --> 00:52:04,005
You came here to get
heroin from me, Mark?

1187
00:52:05,579 --> 00:52:06,829
That shit almost killed me.

1188
00:52:06,854 --> 00:52:08,510
C'mon I'm not gonna
get you fucking ...

1189
00:52:08,535 --> 00:52:09,894
What do you want heroin for?

1190
00:52:09,919 --> 00:52:11,295
It's hard to explain.

1191
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:13,420
We just thought we'd come
down get some contacts

1192
00:52:13,445 --> 00:52:14,982
and we would go do it, not you.

1193
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:17,053
I got rid of all my contacts
when I got sober, man.

1194
00:52:17,078 --> 00:52:19,465
I'm ... I am happily clean.

1195
00:52:20,055 --> 00:52:22,195
I think you should leave, okay?
I'm sorry.

1196
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:24,430
- Cool. Sorry.
- Yeah. Sorry.

1197
00:52:25,123 --> 00:52:26,810
We'll just ...
We'll go to the park

1198
00:52:26,835 --> 00:52:28,443
and we'll figure
it out eventually.

1199
00:52:28,468 --> 00:52:30,065
You're not gonna go to the park.

1200
00:52:30,065 --> 00:52:32,191
Those chicken walkers
cut that shit with rat poison,

1201
00:52:32,191 --> 00:52:33,161
it could kill you.

1202
00:52:33,186 --> 00:52:34,969
We're big boys, okay?
We can do this.

1203
00:52:34,994 --> 00:52:36,089
You're not gon ...

1204
00:52:37,072 --> 00:52:38,256
Ah, Gesù Cristo.

1205
00:52:41,034 --> 00:52:42,711
Okay, I don't have
their number anymore,

1206
00:52:43,668 --> 00:52:46,168
but I know these guys,
they live on Flatbush,

1207
00:52:46,193 --> 00:52:49,273
but you cannot go there by
yourself. They'll fucking kill you.

1208
00:52:49,298 --> 00:52:51,183
Flatbush? By Rita's old place?

1209
00:52:51,236 --> 00:52:51,890
Yeah.

1210
00:52:51,915 --> 00:52:53,384
Your house? Your old house?

1211
00:52:53,409 --> 00:52:56,315
I stayed in the house for
two months without leaving.

1212
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:58,009
I can see how you thought
I lived there.

1213
00:52:59,147 --> 00:53:00,507
Okay, but that's perfect now.

1214
00:53:00,532 --> 00:53:01,804
But listen to me, listen to me.

1215
00:53:01,804 --> 00:53:04,413
You cannot go
there by yourself. I ...

1216
00:53:04,438 --> 00:53:05,913
They will fucking end you.

1217
00:53:05,938 --> 00:53:07,766
They've killed
men in that house.

1218
00:53:08,078 --> 00:53:08,895
All right.

1219
00:53:09,203 --> 00:53:11,078
Mark, come on.
You're not going.

1220
00:53:11,103 --> 00:53:12,320
All right. Sure.

1221
00:53:12,345 --> 00:53:13,900
Good. So you're not gonna go.

1222
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,040
Look, we got this.

1223
00:53:15,065 --> 00:53:16,903
Thank you so
much for helping out.

1224
00:53:16,903 --> 00:53:18,468
Okay. You know, but ...

1225
00:53:18,796 --> 00:53:19,822
We were never here.

1226
00:53:19,822 --> 00:53:22,030
I shouldn't have fucking
said anything, man.

1227
00:53:22,055 --> 00:53:24,642
- We appreciate your help.
- You're not gonna go, right?

1228
00:53:24,667 --> 00:53:25,735
You look good.

1229
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:28,790
Imagine this never
happened, okay?

1230
00:53:28,919 --> 00:53:30,794
Poof! Big cloud of smoke.

1231
00:53:30,819 --> 00:53:31,853
Arrivederci.

1232
00:53:32,413 --> 00:53:33,498
Thank you.

1233
00:53:37,632 --> 00:53:40,509
God, grant me serenity to
accept the things I cannot change,

1234
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:43,384
courage to change
the things I can.

1235
00:53:45,056 --> 00:53:46,375
Ah, motherfucker.

1236
00:53:48,768 --> 00:53:51,697
Don't look at 'em. ...

1237
00:53:56,402 --> 00:53:58,723
All right, this is it.
So, guys, just ... Just ...

1238
00:53:59,439 --> 00:54:01,439
I'm gonna go get
your fucking drugs.

1239
00:54:01,665 --> 00:54:03,653
I want you to stay here.
Don't move.

1240
00:54:03,678 --> 00:54:06,444
Do not fucking make eye
contact with anybody, okay?

1241
00:54:06,469 --> 00:54:08,914
And don't bring your camera out.
These people feel disrespected,

1242
00:54:08,939 --> 00:54:11,791
they will swarm you, they will
surround you, beat you,

1243
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:13,533
spit in your mouth.
They'll take turns.

1244
00:54:13,558 --> 00:54:15,525
It's like a dominance thing,
I don't understand it.

1245
00:54:15,702 --> 00:54:16,770
All right.

1246
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:18,715
So ...

1247
00:54:19,925 --> 00:54:20,925
Are you kidding me?

1248
00:54:22,087 --> 00:54:23,631
Bundles, fool.
Give me a fuck ...

1249
00:54:23,656 --> 00:54:24,715
Yes.

1250
00:54:25,457 --> 00:54:26,464
Fuck.

1251
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:30,711
This turned into a
weird fucking day, man.

1252
00:54:30,736 --> 00:54:31,945
It did, right?

1253
00:54:38,958 --> 00:54:39,787
Man.

1254
00:54:40,703 --> 00:54:42,556
Man, this is so fucked-up.

1255
00:54:42,581 --> 00:54:44,532
I know. I wish you
could get some of this.

1256
00:54:44,532 --> 00:54:46,534
I wish you had hidden
cameras in your backpack.

1257
00:54:46,534 --> 00:54:48,434
I don't care about
the filming, dude.

1258
00:54:48,934 --> 00:54:49,989
What we're doing here?

1259
00:54:50,014 --> 00:54:51,442
Why we're here?

1260
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:54,273
Who we're giving money to?
It's just fucked!

1261
00:54:54,298 --> 00:54:56,907
Will you stop being
such a fucking pussy?

1262
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,208
A man is only as
good as his word, right?

1263
00:54:59,233 --> 00:55:01,700
I said I was gonna do something,
I followed through.

1264
00:55:01,725 --> 00:55:03,100
It's called character.

1265
00:55:03,125 --> 00:55:04,835
You're learning a
lesson here today.

1266
00:55:09,228 --> 00:55:10,289
Open your hand.

1267
00:55:11,267 --> 00:55:13,523
- There's your fucking heroin, all right?
- Thank you.

1268
00:55:13,548 --> 00:55:15,604
Clean cut. Welcome.
You're a good man.

1269
00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:17,791
- You're a good boy.
- Holy fuck.

1270
00:55:18,264 --> 00:55:20,123
Don't look at 'em. ...

1271
00:55:24,694 --> 00:55:27,700
We can do this here, but if
my roommate comes back,

1272
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:28,793
he's gonna freak.

1273
00:55:29,285 --> 00:55:30,276
Okay.

1274
00:55:30,495 --> 00:55:31,596
Turn the camera on.

1275
00:55:34,086 --> 00:55:35,305
Hello, son.

1276
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:36,641
This is heroin.

1277
00:55:37,055 --> 00:55:40,296
If you do this, you'll be
like me, and I'm dead.

1278
00:55:40,296 --> 00:55:43,722
We've got about one,
two, four, six, eight, nine?

1279
00:55:43,747 --> 00:55:46,316
We've got nine bags
here for some reason.

1280
00:55:46,552 --> 00:55:49,451
And most junkies would do

1281
00:55:49,476 --> 00:55:52,991
this whole bundle in
one session and be dead.

1282
00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:56,996
So I'm gonna show
you just from a key bump

1283
00:55:57,605 --> 00:56:01,823
how bad and how
evil this drug is.

1284
00:56:01,848 --> 00:56:03,918
Haven't done
this in a long time.

1285
00:56:04,473 --> 00:56:05,832
Okay, watch this.

1286
00:56:05,857 --> 00:56:06,996
Oh, that's a big one.

1287
00:56:11,953 --> 00:56:14,781
It makes you say weird
things because it stings.

1288
00:56:15,135 --> 00:56:17,854
I want to know what
the things that I said are.

1289
00:56:17,879 --> 00:56:19,444
They might be Chinese.

1290
00:56:19,469 --> 00:56:23,272
And our buddy, Bryan,
is gonna do a little bump too.

1291
00:56:23,297 --> 00:56:24,601
I'm not doing that.

1292
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:28,010
It's my dying wish.

1293
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:31,722
I gave you a dying
wish last night.

1294
00:56:31,887 --> 00:56:36,027
No, I said, "I think that was
one of my dying wishes."

1295
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,833
- You didn't. You didn't.
- I said "wishes."

1296
00:56:38,858 --> 00:56:39,770
Wishes.

1297
00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:41,565
You said "wish."

1298
00:56:41,565 --> 00:56:43,361
Yeah, but it's one
of those words, listen.

1299
00:56:43,386 --> 00:56:45,792
My dy ... I have a
lot of dying wishes.

1300
00:56:46,695 --> 00:56:49,013
That's not how you say "wishes."

1301
00:56:49,038 --> 00:56:49,872
Wishes.

1302
00:56:49,897 --> 00:56:51,240
No. That's not how
you say "wishes."

1303
00:56:51,265 --> 00:56:53,100
No, you say it clear.
You have good diction.

1304
00:56:53,125 --> 00:56:55,972
Wishes. I'm kind of sloppy
when I talk and I go:

1305
00:56:55,997 --> 00:56:57,915
"Hey, I have a lot
of dying wishes."

1306
00:56:58,297 --> 00:56:59,305
Well, it doesn't matter.

1307
00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:02,003
I gave you a dying
wish last night. It's ...

1308
00:57:02,136 --> 00:57:03,171
I'm dying.

1309
00:57:05,443 --> 00:57:08,420
Is there any chance at all that
that could give me an overdose?

1310
00:57:12,014 --> 00:57:12,814
No.

1311
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:19,813
Oh, my God.

1312
00:57:20,313 --> 00:57:24,078
Yeah, you should feel the
nod in about five seconds or so.

1313
00:57:25,833 --> 00:57:27,311
It's really evil.

1314
00:57:35,726 --> 00:57:37,019
I'm gonna puke.

1315
00:57:37,044 --> 00:57:38,062
Film this.

1316
00:57:38,507 --> 00:57:39,543
Film this!

1317
00:57:58,767 --> 00:58:00,767
Oh, it's not that bad, actually.

1318
00:58:24,006 --> 00:58:25,461
Um, Bryan?

1319
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:27,960
What are ... ?
What are you doing?

1320
00:58:28,434 --> 00:58:29,549
What the fuck?

1321
00:58:29,986 --> 00:58:30,987
What is ... ?

1322
00:58:31,502 --> 00:58:34,422
- Who is this old dude?
- Shut up!

1323
00:58:34,805 --> 00:58:37,641
Bryan, you're not being a
very good roommate right now,

1324
00:58:37,666 --> 00:58:40,705
and I would really appreciate
it if you could please ...

1325
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:41,828
What the fuck?

1326
00:58:50,816 --> 00:58:52,153
Oh, I'm hungry.

1327
00:58:52,488 --> 00:58:53,639
Try some of this.

1328
00:58:54,003 --> 00:58:55,323
It's space food.

1329
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,068
No.

1330
00:58:57,868 --> 00:58:59,141
It's like eating a steak.

1331
00:59:03,488 --> 00:59:05,615
Hey. Gary?

1332
00:59:05,933 --> 00:59:08,754
Jesus Christ, Gary.
What happened?

1333
00:59:08,956 --> 00:59:11,715
You know, man,
I'm just standing here.

1334
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:14,635
No, no, no. What the fuck
happened to your face?

1335
00:59:16,072 --> 00:59:16,994
My face?

1336
00:59:17,019 --> 00:59:19,294
You're all fucked-up.
Your lip's split open.

1337
00:59:19,319 --> 00:59:21,842
Oh, man, the guy ...
Yeah, these guys ...

1338
00:59:21,867 --> 00:59:24,546
They came out of nowhere and
they fucking beat me up, man.

1339
00:59:24,571 --> 00:59:25,589
And they took my shit.

1340
00:59:25,614 --> 00:59:26,714
What guys?

1341
00:59:26,823 --> 00:59:28,253
The dealers from
the other day, man.

1342
00:59:28,278 --> 00:59:30,614
One of them spat
in my mouth, man.

1343
00:59:30,985 --> 00:59:31,992
It fucking sucked.

1344
00:59:32,017 --> 00:59:34,047
Are you fucking kidding me?

1345
00:59:34,613 --> 00:59:37,566
Bryan, turn the camera on now.
You need to learn this.

1346
00:59:38,588 --> 00:59:40,776
This is called having
your homey's back

1347
00:59:40,801 --> 00:59:42,721
and doing what's right.

1348
00:59:43,787 --> 00:59:45,466
Hey, hey, hey.

1349
01:00:13,073 --> 01:00:15,196
What's up, niggas?

1350
01:00:18,742 --> 01:00:19,786
No!

1351
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,190
No!

1352
01:00:26,587 --> 01:00:28,215
No, no, no!

1353
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:36,384
Fucking Jesus Christ!
Jesus Christ!

1354
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:11,960
What do you think
you're gonna do, huh?

1355
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:13,463
You stupid motherfucker!

1356
01:01:22,025 --> 01:01:23,673
What the fuck?

1357
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:43,810
Heh. Look at my shirt.

1358
01:01:44,138 --> 01:01:45,865
It's totally spotless.

1359
01:01:46,135 --> 01:01:47,555
Fuck your shirt.

1360
01:01:47,876 --> 01:01:49,158
We could've died back there.

1361
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:51,361
I know. Don't you feel alive?

1362
01:01:51,386 --> 01:01:53,089
I've never felt more alive.

1363
01:01:53,814 --> 01:01:55,267
How did I end up here?

1364
01:01:56,422 --> 01:01:58,859
How did I end up
with this fucking fool?

1365
01:01:59,615 --> 01:02:01,896
How did you trick me
into listening to you?

1366
01:02:04,972 --> 01:02:05,853
I'm done.

1367
01:02:05,878 --> 01:02:06,759
What?

1368
01:02:07,456 --> 01:02:08,557
We gotta finish.

1369
01:02:08,582 --> 01:02:09,784
Finish what?

1370
01:02:10,811 --> 01:02:12,209
They have the camera.

1371
01:02:12,521 --> 01:02:14,239
Finish this fucking
bullshit project

1372
01:02:14,264 --> 01:02:16,255
that's just ruining
people's lives?

1373
01:02:17,098 --> 01:02:19,192
Come on, man, don't be a coward.

1374
01:02:19,778 --> 01:02:20,832
Be a man.

1375
01:02:20,973 --> 01:02:22,153
Be a man?

1376
01:02:22,598 --> 01:02:24,223
Be a fucking man?

1377
01:02:25,284 --> 01:02:27,698
You just got your
friend back on junk!

1378
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:30,747
You lost your job and your wife

1379
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:33,417
who's not even gonna
tell your son about you!

1380
01:02:35,461 --> 01:02:37,757
You thought she was
gonna show him these tapes?

1381
01:02:38,005 --> 01:02:39,423
Why would she do that?

1382
01:02:39,423 --> 01:02:41,735
You'd be a fucking awful father.

1383
01:02:43,108 --> 01:02:46,681
If you are my dad,
I'm glad you were never around.

1384
01:02:47,243 --> 01:02:50,602
Having you for a father would
be worse than no father at all.

1385
01:03:34,066 --> 01:03:36,199
That's how it was with
Jeff Foxworthy, you know.

1386
01:03:36,224 --> 01:03:39,130
He was working, I don't know,
real estate or some boring job

1387
01:03:39,155 --> 01:03:41,950
and then he tells his wife,
"I wanna do comedy."

1388
01:03:42,154 --> 01:03:44,154
And she supports him.

1389
01:03:44,154 --> 01:03:45,716
They probably have a tough time,

1390
01:03:45,741 --> 01:03:47,513
and I think they even
had kids at the time.

1391
01:03:47,908 --> 01:03:50,337
But he kicks ass and
the next thing you know,

1392
01:03:50,362 --> 01:03:52,954
he's got the Blue
Comedy comedy tour.

1393
01:03:56,124 --> 01:03:57,793
He's got his own cable guy.

1394
01:03:57,793 --> 01:04:00,246
He's even in that
shit movie Cars.

1395
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,591
Is there any more of this?

1396
01:04:04,925 --> 01:04:07,094
Well, it is time to choose.

1397
01:04:07,094 --> 01:04:10,765
Will it be Ayel,
who is a pyromaniac,

1398
01:04:11,807 --> 01:04:14,142
smokes marijuana every day ...
- Gross.

1399
01:04:14,142 --> 01:04:17,887
and slept with her
male friend's girlfriend?

1400
01:04:17,912 --> 01:04:20,023
Man, let's get out of here.

1401
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:21,567
And go where?

1402
01:04:21,762 --> 01:04:23,026
Let's go to a bar.

1403
01:04:23,026 --> 01:04:25,070
Let's pick up some
fucking chicks, man.

1404
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,405
Pick up chicks?

1405
01:04:26,405 --> 01:04:27,702
Man, we live in New York City,

1406
01:04:27,727 --> 01:04:29,742
why are we sitting here watching TV?

1407
01:04:30,289 --> 01:04:33,835
A man who searches in
haste will never be found.

1408
01:04:36,123 --> 01:04:37,919
Once you discover yourself,

1409
01:04:38,417 --> 01:04:41,635
it is they who will
be picking you up.

1410
01:04:44,673 --> 01:04:47,477
You sound like a fat
chick trying to be sexy.

1411
01:04:48,229 --> 01:04:49,364
Fuck off.

1412
01:04:50,903 --> 01:04:51,855
Okay.

1413
01:05:01,649 --> 01:05:03,164
Sandwiches are big.

1414
01:05:03,189 --> 01:05:04,158
Whoa.

1415
01:05:05,694 --> 01:05:08,233
Must have been easy
to invent shit back then.

1416
01:05:08,752 --> 01:05:10,295
Hero sandwich.

1417
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:14,048
Can I get a beer?
What do you want?

1418
01:05:14,073 --> 01:05:16,221
Can I see your wine list?

1419
01:05:16,246 --> 01:05:17,069
Thanks.

1420
01:05:21,498 --> 01:05:22,858
So, uh ...

1421
01:05:25,102 --> 01:05:26,088
Thanks.

1422
01:05:28,064 --> 01:05:29,656
Listen, there's something

1423
01:05:29,681 --> 01:05:31,486
I've been meaning
to talk to you about.

1424
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:34,348
Um ... the other day,

1425
01:05:34,348 --> 01:05:36,604
when you and that old
guy were passed out ...

1426
01:05:36,629 --> 01:05:38,676
Oh, man, I don't even
hang out with him anymore.

1427
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:39,676
That's good.

1428
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:42,107
I don't want people
like that in my life.

1429
01:05:42,765 --> 01:05:45,419
Yeah. I'm sorry about that, man.

1430
01:05:45,444 --> 01:05:47,881
I really barely remember it,
I was so fucked-up on heroin.

1431
01:05:47,906 --> 01:05:48,899
Yeah.

1432
01:05:50,387 --> 01:05:51,385
Heroin?

1433
01:05:51,410 --> 01:05:52,700
Yeah. It's crazy.

1434
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:54,910
It's ... I mean, it's
a really long story.

1435
01:05:58,729 --> 01:06:00,415
Just so you know, um,

1436
01:06:01,049 --> 01:06:04,637
hard drugs in my apartment,

1437
01:06:04,848 --> 01:06:06,672
kind of a no-no.

1438
01:06:07,054 --> 01:06:09,312
Wait, ... in your apartment?

1439
01:06:09,337 --> 01:06:11,385
You know if a cop saw that,

1440
01:06:11,385 --> 01:06:15,138
then I'm an accessory to,
like, literally ...

1441
01:06:15,567 --> 01:06:16,615
fuck.

1442
01:06:18,754 --> 01:06:20,769
What are you talking about?

1443
01:06:20,769 --> 01:06:22,813
What are you even
saying right now?

1444
01:06:22,813 --> 01:06:24,867
And another thing,
it's not your apartment.

1445
01:06:25,357 --> 01:06:26,715
It's my apartment.

1446
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:28,334
I invited you to live with me.

1447
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:31,577
Here we go with a classic
Capricorn overreaction.

1448
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:33,424
Classic.

1449
01:06:41,588 --> 01:06:42,995
I want you to move out.

1450
01:06:43,284 --> 01:06:44,285
To what?

1451
01:06:45,381 --> 01:06:48,559
No. Listen, I don't think you're
understanding me right now.

1452
01:06:48,584 --> 01:06:49,473
What I'm saying ...

1453
01:06:49,498 --> 01:06:51,676
No. I understand perfectly.

1454
01:06:52,676 --> 01:06:54,652
I don't wanna be
around you anymore.

1455
01:06:55,034 --> 01:06:56,253
You're moving out.

1456
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:01,136
No, I'm not.

1457
01:07:02,436 --> 01:07:04,280
You can't make me.

1458
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:09,150
Okay, there's two
ways this can go down.

1459
01:07:09,243 --> 01:07:10,515
Option one:

1460
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:12,738
you pack your shit
up and move out.

1461
01:07:13,191 --> 01:07:14,277
Option two:

1462
01:07:14,301 --> 01:07:16,384
I beat your ass right now

1463
01:07:16,784 --> 01:07:19,253
and then you pack your
shit up and you move out.

1464
01:07:23,227 --> 01:07:24,952
What if I want option two?

1465
01:07:24,977 --> 01:07:26,167
Well, that's a great option.

1466
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:28,078
I actually prefer that option.

1467
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:30,245
Do you wanna have a
short one here in the bar

1468
01:07:30,270 --> 01:07:32,731
or would you like to go
outside and have a real fight?

1469
01:07:36,261 --> 01:07:37,555
Fuck you, man.

1470
01:07:38,492 --> 01:07:39,922
You're a idiot!

1471
01:07:41,475 --> 01:07:43,264
Oh, so you don't want to fight?

1472
01:07:43,289 --> 01:07:45,529
I thought you just said
you wanted to fight me.

1473
01:07:55,489 --> 01:07:56,926
Did you hear that guy?

1474
01:07:57,153 --> 01:07:58,582
He called me "a idiot."

1475
01:07:59,481 --> 01:08:00,527
I know.

1476
01:08:01,045 --> 01:08:03,547
It's ironic because it's
such an idiotic thing to say.

1477
01:08:29,124 --> 01:08:30,568
I should've known
he was a douche

1478
01:08:30,593 --> 01:08:32,835
when he started
talking about astrology.

1479
01:08:33,149 --> 01:08:34,310
You know what?

1480
01:08:34,904 --> 01:08:36,825
I'm, like, borderline
obsessed with that shit.

1481
01:08:36,850 --> 01:08:39,467
But even I have to admit
that when guys are into it,

1482
01:08:39,492 --> 01:08:41,023
it's, like, really
not a good look.

1483
01:08:41,048 --> 01:08:42,148
Fuck! Right?

1484
01:08:42,173 --> 01:08:44,997
I mean, it's a game that
guys should just not play.

1485
01:08:44,997 --> 01:08:46,206
It's like hopscotch.

1486
01:08:48,452 --> 01:08:51,086
And I don't think girls
actually believe in it, either.

1487
01:08:51,086 --> 01:08:52,963
If you're in love with me,

1488
01:08:52,963 --> 01:08:54,884
it's not like you wouldn't
marry me because

1489
01:08:54,909 --> 01:08:56,971
you found out I was a
Scorpio or something.

1490
01:08:57,344 --> 01:08:59,344
Oh, so we're
getting married now?

1491
01:08:59,345 --> 01:09:00,119
No.

1492
01:09:00,588 --> 01:09:02,987
No, I mean, we're not
getting married for, like, a year.

1493
01:09:11,356 --> 01:09:13,150
What happened to your eye?

1494
01:09:31,418 --> 01:09:33,649
I thought I could help
people, you know.

1495
01:09:35,047 --> 01:09:37,625
I just ended up fucking
up everybody's life.

1496
01:09:39,837 --> 01:09:41,665
Fucked up my own life.

1497
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:44,521
I'm like the King Midas of shit.

1498
01:09:46,391 --> 01:09:48,758
Everything I touch
turns to puke.

1499
01:09:50,228 --> 01:09:52,681
It's actually good
that I'm dying.

1500
01:09:52,706 --> 01:09:54,962
The world would be
better off without me.

1501
01:09:54,987 --> 01:09:58,494
My son won't know
what a fuck-up I am.

1502
01:09:59,232 --> 01:10:00,268
Was.

1503
01:10:04,111 --> 01:10:05,404
Are you gonna eat that?

1504
01:10:09,664 --> 01:10:11,749
Oh, my God! ...

1505
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:16,470
Oh, my God!

1506
01:10:18,298 --> 01:10:20,300
I just realized something
really important.

1507
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:21,376
And I have to do it

1508
01:10:21,401 --> 01:10:23,319
and I'll be right back,
I promise.

1509
01:10:23,344 --> 01:10:24,356
Trust me.

1510
01:10:24,381 --> 01:10:26,132
Where are you going?

1511
01:11:01,725 --> 01:11:02,659
Mark?

1512
01:11:03,681 --> 01:11:04,658
Mark.

1513
01:11:05,066 --> 01:11:06,901
Wake up.
You were right. Mostly.

1514
01:11:06,926 --> 01:11:08,471
No, you were right.

1515
01:11:08,496 --> 01:11:10,277
I'm a total deadbeat.

1516
01:11:11,101 --> 01:11:12,429
You're better off without me.

1517
01:11:12,454 --> 01:11:13,954
No. No, I'm not.

1518
01:11:13,979 --> 01:11:16,564
You were right about girls
and about how to dress

1519
01:11:16,564 --> 01:11:20,126
and about following your
dreams and not taking shit.

1520
01:11:20,151 --> 01:11:21,986
Oh, and also astrology.

1521
01:11:22,654 --> 01:11:24,239
You were right
about your character

1522
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:26,044
and making your
word mean something.

1523
01:11:26,774 --> 01:11:27,617
Really?

1524
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:28,552
Yeah.

1525
01:11:31,664 --> 01:11:32,969
This is you.

1526
01:11:34,279 --> 01:11:34,928
Okay.

1527
01:11:34,953 --> 01:11:37,950
Okay. So this is
what you taught me.

1528
01:11:38,013 --> 01:11:39,921
Yeah. I'm an idiot.

1529
01:11:39,921 --> 01:11:41,052
It's all a pile of shit.

1530
01:11:41,077 --> 01:11:42,873
No, it's not. It's not.

1531
01:11:42,898 --> 01:11:44,134
Just this little piece.

1532
01:11:44,134 --> 01:11:46,352
This piece here.
You see this?

1533
01:11:47,127 --> 01:11:48,955
That's collateral damage.

1534
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:50,299
That's shit.

1535
01:11:50,324 --> 01:11:52,017
Because that says:

1536
01:11:52,017 --> 01:11:53,977
"Do whatever you need
to do to get the job done.

1537
01:11:53,977 --> 01:11:56,789
Fuck people over.
Do whatever it takes."

1538
01:11:57,129 --> 01:11:59,089
That's not what a man does.

1539
01:11:59,441 --> 01:12:01,902
A man takes
responsibility for his actions.

1540
01:12:01,927 --> 01:12:03,595
All of his actions.

1541
01:12:05,379 --> 01:12:07,006
That part's bad.

1542
01:12:07,031 --> 01:12:08,491
But all this is good.

1543
01:12:10,874 --> 01:12:11,906
All this is good?

1544
01:12:11,931 --> 01:12:12,959
Don't do that.

1545
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:16,434
You started this thing
thinking you knew everything.

1546
01:12:16,958 --> 01:12:18,184
And I've learned a lot from you,

1547
01:12:18,209 --> 01:12:20,378
but I also learned
what not to do.

1548
01:12:21,713 --> 01:12:23,590
So now you can learn from that.

1549
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:24,841
Do you get it?

1550
01:12:26,593 --> 01:12:27,616
That's a trip.

1551
01:12:28,178 --> 01:12:30,295
Because now, I'm learning
something from you.

1552
01:12:30,826 --> 01:12:32,323
Put that shit down.

1553
01:12:32,793 --> 01:12:34,199
Come on, buddy. Get up.

1554
01:12:52,508 --> 01:12:54,578
So the other day,

1555
01:12:54,603 --> 01:12:56,634
I was reading this
message board.

1556
01:12:58,292 --> 01:12:59,510
This guy made a post

1557
01:12:59,535 --> 01:13:03,074
where he was working
on a documentary.

1558
01:13:03,942 --> 01:13:06,089
And he's working
with an older guy.

1559
01:13:06,114 --> 01:13:06,989
Oh, yeah?

1560
01:13:07,014 --> 01:13:10,267
He doesn't know what to do.
He's feeling all complicated

1561
01:13:10,292 --> 01:13:14,206
because he's getting
all these feelings.

1562
01:13:14,377 --> 01:13:15,188
Yeah.

1563
01:13:16,143 --> 01:13:19,260
And he's been working with this
guy so long now that he, like ...

1564
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:22,112
He really wants to fuck him.

1565
01:13:22,464 --> 01:13:24,109
Oh, my God.

1566
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:26,694
Yeah.
That's so stupid.

1567
01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:28,679
I know. It's so dumb.

1568
01:13:28,863 --> 01:13:32,242
So the guy in the message
board was asking if ...

1569
01:13:32,242 --> 01:13:33,921
What he should do about
this guy he wants to ...

1570
01:13:33,946 --> 01:13:35,843
Old dude he wants to fuck?

1571
01:13:36,336 --> 01:13:37,221
Yeah.

1572
01:13:39,483 --> 01:13:42,584
So, what did everyone
say he should do?

1573
01:13:51,129 --> 01:13:51,986
Dude.

1574
01:13:54,055 --> 01:13:55,398
You're gonna get your wife back.

1575
01:13:56,683 --> 01:13:57,558
I know.

1576
01:13:57,628 --> 01:13:59,151
Yeah. Right now.

1577
01:13:59,176 --> 01:14:00,858
You gotta go tell her the truth.

1578
01:14:00,882 --> 01:14:02,293
Never lie, remember?

1579
01:14:02,457 --> 01:14:04,730
She doesn't wanna
see my face right now.

1580
01:14:05,136 --> 01:14:06,902
Since when do you just give up?

1581
01:14:07,617 --> 01:14:09,292
You know, Zach
Braff made this movie

1582
01:14:09,317 --> 01:14:10,903
where he camps
out on this girl's ...

1583
01:14:10,928 --> 01:14:12,349
Yeah, The Last Kiss.

1584
01:14:12,995 --> 01:14:16,604
So Zach Braff, he camped out
on this girl's lawn for three days.

1585
01:14:16,663 --> 01:14:18,170
Margs doesn't have a lawn.

1586
01:14:18,195 --> 01:14:20,238
Well, she's got a sidewalk.
That's good enough.

1587
01:14:23,053 --> 01:14:24,538
You know what? You're right.

1588
01:14:25,292 --> 01:14:26,360
You're right.

1589
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:29,606
Let's go.

1590
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:30,864
This one's all you.

1591
01:14:31,952 --> 01:14:33,452
I've got unfinished business.

1592
01:14:36,348 --> 01:14:37,216
Okay.

1593
01:14:39,219 --> 01:14:40,120
All right.

1594
01:14:41,299 --> 01:14:43,438
I can't believe you
picked up that dog shit.

1595
01:14:43,438 --> 01:14:44,861
It wasn't dog shit.

1596
01:15:12,717 --> 01:15:13,518
Gary?

1597
01:15:13,943 --> 01:15:15,970
Is this the methadone clinic?

1598
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:17,431
Cool job, man.

1599
01:15:25,397 --> 01:15:27,037
Hey, buddy. Buddy.

1600
01:15:27,318 --> 01:15:29,357
Can you spray me?
I'm filthy.

1601
01:15:30,318 --> 01:15:32,786
Aah! Get the face.

1602
01:15:36,157 --> 01:15:37,610
Okay, okay.

1603
01:15:40,703 --> 01:15:43,290
I'm gonna go get my wife back.

1604
01:16:31,149 --> 01:16:32,680
Do you know if you can get

1605
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:35,454
DNA samples from feces?

1606
01:16:36,441 --> 01:16:37,376
Why?

1607
01:16:38,284 --> 01:16:39,577
Do you have AIDS?

1608
01:16:52,233 --> 01:16:53,748
- Okay. Wait, wait.
- No.

1609
01:16:53,773 --> 01:16:56,109
Ow, ow! My hand. My fingers.

1610
01:16:56,189 --> 01:16:57,955
I have cancer.

1611
01:17:00,492 --> 01:17:01,868
Is that some kind of joke?

1612
01:17:04,996 --> 01:17:06,261
What do you call that?

1613
01:17:06,706 --> 01:17:08,174
- That's your nipple.
- No.

1614
01:17:08,199 --> 01:17:11,956
That's my nipple, that
is a weird piece of gum.

1615
01:17:12,058 --> 01:17:13,171
What did the doctor say?

1616
01:17:13,171 --> 01:17:15,530
Internet said I have six
to eight months to live.

1617
01:17:15,555 --> 01:17:18,087
The Internet?
Are you fucking stupid?

1618
01:17:18,112 --> 01:17:20,862
I was trying to record
videos for our unborn son

1619
01:17:20,887 --> 01:17:23,973
so he'd have those when
he got older to live by.

1620
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:25,800
That's like the Michael Keaton
movie that nobody saw.

1621
01:17:25,825 --> 01:17:27,618
He was not the first
person to think of that.

1622
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:29,104
I don't think he thought of it.

1623
01:17:29,129 --> 01:17:31,299
He was in it, and it
was a stupid movie.

1624
01:17:31,371 --> 01:17:34,401
I started out doing videos
for him as a young boy ...

1625
01:17:34,401 --> 01:17:36,244
You're not dying.
You didn't even see a doctor.

1626
01:17:36,269 --> 01:17:39,105
I'm dying, so I made
a bunch of videos

1627
01:17:39,130 --> 01:17:41,590
to show our son what
it's like to be a man.

1628
01:17:41,615 --> 01:17:43,826
Then he could watch those.
When I started out,

1629
01:17:43,851 --> 01:17:46,145
I did normal stuff,
like playground stuff,

1630
01:17:46,287 --> 01:17:49,886
and then as it got older,
I got into the party scene

1631
01:17:49,911 --> 01:17:52,403
and I kind of got sucked in.

1632
01:17:52,427 --> 01:17:53,312
Yeah.

1633
01:17:53,336 --> 01:17:56,591
Yeah. You face-fucked
a little girl in a bathroom.

1634
01:17:56,616 --> 01:17:58,118
I am so sorry.

1635
01:17:58,143 --> 01:18:00,603
Is she alive?
What happened to her?

1636
01:18:00,628 --> 01:18:01,886
She's probably fine.

1637
01:18:01,886 --> 01:18:03,863
I saw the tape.
It looks like a snuff film.

1638
01:18:03,888 --> 01:18:06,226
Look, what's important is,
I let you down

1639
01:18:06,251 --> 01:18:09,659
at the most important
time of our lives,

1640
01:18:09,684 --> 01:18:12,300
and I'm so fucking
sorry about that, Margs.

1641
01:18:12,325 --> 01:18:13,919
I don't expect you
to forgive me, okay?

1642
01:18:13,944 --> 01:18:15,404
I'll move next door.

1643
01:18:15,429 --> 01:18:19,128
I'll earn my place back
into your heart, okay?

1644
01:18:19,153 --> 01:18:21,576
I'll do everything right,
I'm gonna be there for him,

1645
01:18:21,601 --> 01:18:24,133
whether you forgive
me or not, okay?

1646
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:26,035
You do that on your own time.

1647
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:28,137
I'm gonna be better.

1648
01:18:29,173 --> 01:18:31,017
I'm gonna be a real man.

1649
01:18:33,543 --> 01:18:37,380
Eventually, it's gonna get back
to like it was when we would ...

1650
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:39,205
When we first Frenched.

1651
01:18:42,677 --> 01:18:46,577
Maybe you wanna French
a little tiny bit right now.

1652
01:19:30,975 --> 01:19:34,443
Fuck off, you fucking fucker!

1653
01:20:10,978 --> 01:20:12,635
My water just broke.

1654
01:20:12,660 --> 01:20:13,738
It went up my nose.

1655
01:20:13,763 --> 01:20:15,355
Oh, it burns.

1656
01:20:15,759 --> 01:20:17,265
You're doing great, Margot.

1657
01:20:17,290 --> 01:20:18,927
Gonna be just
a few more hours.

1658
01:20:18,952 --> 01:20:20,686
Hang in there, okay?

1659
01:20:23,645 --> 01:20:24,654
Hey, Doctor. Doctor.

1660
01:20:24,654 --> 01:20:26,059
<i>Paging Dr. Bender ...</i>

1661
01:20:26,084 --> 01:20:28,961
I know you're busy
and everything, but

1662
01:20:29,348 --> 01:20:31,517
I have this lump on my breast

1663
01:20:31,619 --> 01:20:34,212
and WebMD says
that it's breast cancer.

1664
01:20:35,248 --> 01:20:36,591
Are you trying to be funny?

1665
01:20:36,616 --> 01:20:37,398
No.

1666
01:20:37,625 --> 01:20:39,796
I know this isn't exactly
your department ...

1667
01:20:41,214 --> 01:20:42,816
You don't have breast cancer.

1668
01:20:48,261 --> 01:20:50,764
Did you drink my
fucking apple juice?

1669
01:20:57,534 --> 01:20:59,628
- Push. I can see the head.
- Fuck!

1670
01:20:59,653 --> 01:21:02,028
- One more push, Margot.
- No, no, no!

1671
01:21:02,528 --> 01:21:04,913
Get this fucking
thing out of me!

1672
01:21:04,938 --> 01:21:05,822
Fuck!

1673
01:21:11,226 --> 01:21:13,163
- It's a girl.
- Whoa.

1674
01:21:13,188 --> 01:21:14,968
You wanna cut
the umbilical cord?

1675
01:21:16,703 --> 01:21:18,579
No. You ... You do it.

1676
01:21:29,362 --> 01:21:34,714
It really is. You can see
the vagina and the genitalia.

1677
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:08,069
People talk so much
shit on Merlot, and I'm like,

1678
01:22:08,094 --> 01:22:09,686
"It's a good wine."

1679
01:22:14,696 --> 01:22:18,470
I'm gonna do white Pinot.
What about you?

1680
01:22:35,482 --> 01:22:36,353
Hey.

1681
01:22:37,453 --> 01:22:40,679
I've got ... I'm ...
I'm making a painting.

1682
01:22:41,081 --> 01:22:43,190
Are you recording me?

1683
01:23:01,477 --> 01:23:03,229
So have you seen
your kid's dick?

1684
01:23:03,229 --> 01:23:05,055
Did you look at it or,
like, stare at it or ... ?

1685
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:06,262
It's a girl, so ...

1686
01:23:06,287 --> 01:23:07,333
Oh, okay.

1687
01:23:12,822 --> 01:23:14,618
I swear, you look so familiar.

1688
01:23:14,643 --> 01:23:16,853
- I get that a lot.
-  you're so pretty.

1689
01:23:16,878 --> 01:23:18,083
Oh, shut up.

1690
01:23:18,108 --> 01:23:19,773
You have a gorgeous mouth.

1691
01:24:04,832 --> 01:24:06,519
Delicious.
