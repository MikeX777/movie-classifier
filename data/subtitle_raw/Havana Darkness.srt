1
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,376
Oh my God.

2
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,479
It was a... Argh!

3
00:02:34,712 --> 00:02:36,713
Ah, ah!

4
00:02:50,995 --> 00:02:52,461
Help me!

5
00:02:52,462 --> 00:02:54,497
Somebody, please... Help!

6
00:03:07,577 --> 00:03:09,545
Please...

7
00:03:09,546 --> 00:03:10,480
Please.

8
00:03:17,954 --> 00:03:19,556
Oh, no...

9
00:03:21,624 --> 00:03:22,491
Please.

10
00:03:26,461 --> 00:03:28,832
No, no, no, please! Please!

11
00:05:15,602 --> 00:05:17,103
Happy birthday, buddy!

12
00:05:19,873 --> 00:05:22,808
You forgot your birthday again,
didn't you? I guess I did.

13
00:05:22,809 --> 00:05:24,276
Happy birthday, Carlos.

14
00:05:24,277 --> 00:05:25,612
I'm worried about you.

15
00:05:32,118 --> 00:05:34,787
Cheers! For Carlos!

16
00:05:34,788 --> 00:05:36,823
Thank you, guys! The guy that
will always be older than me.

17
00:05:38,557 --> 00:05:39,591
Ugh!

18
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,796
So you, uh...
You finished this yet?

19
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:45,831
Not even close.

20
00:05:47,067 --> 00:05:48,534
Productive night then, huh?

21
00:05:49,235 --> 00:05:51,003
Something like that, yeah.

22
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:57,008
Hey why don't you, uh... get away
a couple of days? Clear your head.

23
00:05:57,009 --> 00:05:58,877
Yeah I should
probably do it, right?

24
00:06:00,713 --> 00:06:02,114
"Hemingway's Cuba".

25
00:06:03,048 --> 00:06:05,783
Theme's pretty self-explanatory.
What's the problem?

26
00:06:05,784 --> 00:06:07,219
I don't know...
The problem is...

27
00:06:08,754 --> 00:06:10,755
You know, in my head...

28
00:06:10,756 --> 00:06:15,160
I have, sorry, everything I want to
say but... I don't know how to say it.

29
00:06:17,262 --> 00:06:18,528
Enlighten us.

30
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:22,967
It's obviously about Hemingway
and his life and work in Cuba.

31
00:06:22,968 --> 00:06:24,969
Which is your area
of focus, right?

32
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:28,805
I don't know, I'm missing
something, you know? I'm just...

33
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:31,309
I'm trying to find a hook
to hang everything on.

34
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,643
Why don't you just
write something else?

35
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:35,246
John!

36
00:06:35,247 --> 00:06:38,750
John! No... This is what I want to do.
I've been working on this for a while.

37
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:41,552
I don't know, I just...

38
00:06:43,087 --> 00:06:44,988
I've been thinking about

39
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:47,157
going to Cuba and spend
some time there.

40
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:47,959
Why don't you?

41
00:06:49,627 --> 00:06:52,295
Yeah. I should
probably do it, right?

42
00:06:52,296 --> 00:06:55,032
I would love to go
to Cuba someday.

43
00:06:55,033 --> 00:06:57,300
Really? You never told me that.

44
00:06:57,301 --> 00:06:58,535
You never asked.

45
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:02,105
Is your bathroom safe to use?

46
00:07:02,106 --> 00:07:03,807
It's the cleanest room
in this apartment.

47
00:07:08,112 --> 00:07:09,047
Check it out.

48
00:07:11,182 --> 00:07:13,151
Oh so you were
serious about this?

49
00:07:14,818 --> 00:07:16,952
Of course I'm serious about it.
We've been dating forever.

50
00:07:16,953 --> 00:07:18,921
Well, congratulations!

51
00:07:18,922 --> 00:07:21,657
Don't pop the cork on the champagne
bottle just yet. She hasn't said yes.

52
00:07:21,658 --> 00:07:25,227
But she will. Everybody knows that
she likes you, she's in love with you.

53
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:26,630
You think?
Yeah.

54
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:29,232
Come on.

55
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:34,037
What's going on here?

56
00:07:39,642 --> 00:07:40,976
So what's the plan?

57
00:07:40,977 --> 00:07:41,911
Plan for what?

58
00:07:41,912 --> 00:07:44,180
Your birthday, dumb-ass!
What are we doing?

59
00:07:44,181 --> 00:07:46,781
I don't know. Drinks, I guess.

60
00:07:46,782 --> 00:07:48,951
"Drinksh it ish."

61
00:07:48,952 --> 00:07:50,219
What time?

62
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,687
You guys what us to do seven?

63
00:07:52,822 --> 00:07:55,224
So we'll see you
at seven at Veryl?

64
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,258
Veryl is fine.

65
00:07:56,259 --> 00:07:58,360
Seven at Veryl. Hey!

66
00:07:58,361 --> 00:08:00,296
Don't be late!
Never late!

67
00:08:00,297 --> 00:08:01,896
Don't be late!
I won't!

68
00:08:01,897 --> 00:08:03,933
Promise you won't be late!
I promise!

69
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,091
Can I help you?

70
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:32,826
Yeah. Uh, I'm
looking for Joshua.

71
00:08:32,827 --> 00:08:35,030
He's on vacation
for a couple of weeks.

72
00:08:37,031 --> 00:08:40,033
Really? He didn't mention
anything to me.

73
00:08:40,034 --> 00:08:41,402
And you are?

74
00:08:41,403 --> 00:08:45,706
I'm Carlos Carrasco. I'm Joshua's
friend. Come here all the time.

75
00:08:45,707 --> 00:08:47,709
Oh, yes. Carlos.

76
00:08:48,477 --> 00:08:50,043
We've never met.

77
00:08:50,044 --> 00:08:52,146
Joshua did mention you though.

78
00:08:52,147 --> 00:08:54,715
Frank.
Pleasure to meet you.

79
00:08:54,716 --> 00:08:56,984
Joshua asked me
to look after his place

80
00:08:56,985 --> 00:08:59,987
while he's out of town attending
some personal business.

81
00:08:59,988 --> 00:09:01,421
Nothing serious I hope.

82
00:09:01,422 --> 00:09:04,925
Mmm... I'm not entirely
sure of the details myself.

83
00:09:04,926 --> 00:09:08,128
He did, however, say that
you would be stopping by.

84
00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:09,296
He did?
Mm-hm.

85
00:09:09,297 --> 00:09:11,199
In fact he left
something for you.

86
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:13,734
Please, follow me.

87
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:15,669
<i>Por favor.</i>

88
00:09:18,439 --> 00:09:22,875
Joshua mentioned you are working on an essay.
Something to do with Ernest Hemingway, right?

89
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:23,910
Yeah.

90
00:09:23,911 --> 00:09:26,947
Well, he thinks this might
be of benefit to you.

91
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,788
<i>Â¿Havana Darkness?</i>
Mm-hm.

92
00:09:35,789 --> 00:09:37,824
What is this?
Look for yourself.

93
00:09:41,028 --> 00:09:42,795
It's in Spanish.

94
00:09:42,796 --> 00:09:45,298
Most of phrasing and
wording is very disjointed.

95
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:47,967
Huh. My very same impression.

96
00:09:47,968 --> 00:09:49,068
Who's the author?

97
00:09:49,069 --> 00:09:52,205
Anonymous. But this
is where it gets interesting.

98
00:09:52,206 --> 00:09:55,541
Joshua spoke to some guy from an
auction where he picked this up.

99
00:09:55,542 --> 00:10:00,180
He was told that this belonged to
his great uncle, Antonio Gattorno.

100
00:10:01,847 --> 00:10:04,983
Antonio Gattorno.
Mm-hm.

101
00:10:04,984 --> 00:10:07,287
The manuscript came
with a collection of letters.

102
00:10:08,488 --> 00:10:08,988
Here.

103
00:10:10,424 --> 00:10:11,857
Recognize the signature?

104
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,994
Yeah.

105
00:10:15,928 --> 00:10:17,430
That's...
Hemingway?

106
00:10:19,432 --> 00:10:20,466
Who knows.

107
00:10:38,985 --> 00:10:43,389
Antonio Gattorno was a Cuban artist
and a very close friend of Hemingway.

108
00:10:44,423 --> 00:10:47,993
He actually moved to New York and spent
over twenty years living in this city.

109
00:10:48,927 --> 00:10:51,596
Joshua said that this manuscript
was part of a stack of books

110
00:10:51,597 --> 00:10:54,399
that were brought here
from Cuba in the eighties.

111
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:59,471
We strongly believe that this book was
one of Hemingway's lost manuscripts.

112
00:10:59,472 --> 00:11:03,842
At least part of it anyway because
it appears to be unfinished. See?

113
00:11:05,076 --> 00:11:07,979
"For him this place
led to darkness...

114
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,482
which led to pain...

115
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,485
then to horror...

116
00:11:14,986 --> 00:11:18,256
horror so unspeakable
that hung on him forever."

117
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,092
Please, take it.

118
00:11:22,627 --> 00:11:24,094
No!

119
00:11:24,095 --> 00:11:25,562
No, I can't!

120
00:11:25,563 --> 00:11:29,266
I mean... If this is what you say
it is it must be worth a fortune.

121
00:11:29,267 --> 00:11:32,636
As a matter of fact Joshua said that you
might be interested in helping us with that.

122
00:11:32,637 --> 00:11:35,340
Absolutely! Yeah,
of course, but...

123
00:11:36,374 --> 00:11:39,443
but I cannot take it with me.

124
00:11:39,444 --> 00:11:41,045
He insisted you take it.

125
00:11:42,112 --> 00:11:43,479
You sure?

126
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,149
I'm sure. Actually I'm certain.

127
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,018
Joshua will be back
in a couple of weeks.

128
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,987
I promise I'll take
care of this, okay?

129
00:11:50,988 --> 00:11:53,356
If you talk to Joshua please
tell him that I said thank you.

130
00:11:53,357 --> 00:11:55,025
I'll be sure to tell him that.

131
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:50,078
"He stood across the street
from that building in Havana.

132
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:57,017
The place was pure...

133
00:12:57,018 --> 00:12:58,420
evil.

134
00:12:58,421 --> 00:12:59,455
Nothing else.

135
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:02,492
There was some..."

136
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:38,559
What's up?
<i>What's up?!</i>

137
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,161
<i>It's eight fifteen and you are
not here, that's what's up.</i>

138
00:13:41,162 --> 00:13:43,565
Just give me twenty
minutes, I'll be there.

139
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,772
"Oh well, cash in their checks"
and pays in freshman.

140
00:13:51,773 --> 00:13:53,707
What did he do?

141
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,175
He took a swing!

142
00:13:55,176 --> 00:13:57,544
Why am I not surprised.

143
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:58,646
Whose side are you on?

144
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:04,384
So? How's your essay
coming along?

145
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,253
Good. Good. Actually, uh...

146
00:14:07,254 --> 00:14:10,291
Something came up today
that might help a lot.

147
00:14:11,692 --> 00:14:13,259
Your table is ready.

148
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:17,664
You guys remember Joshua, right? The
guy who owns a bookstore. 83rd and York.

149
00:14:17,665 --> 00:14:18,798
Yeah, yeah, the
sweet little thing.

150
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:21,601
Yeah the guy who wants to get
in your pants, that one?

151
00:14:21,602 --> 00:14:22,968
He's not!
Anyway, listen.

152
00:14:22,969 --> 00:14:26,573
This guy, he just recently acquired
a lot of stuff at an auction.

153
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:31,443
And one of those things is this old
book, it's a handwritten manuscript

154
00:14:31,444 --> 00:14:35,448
and they believe it may
have been written by

155
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:37,649
Hemingway.

156
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:38,719
No!
Yes!

157
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,521
It's amazing!
Aha.

158
00:14:42,555 --> 00:14:43,822
And?

159
00:14:43,823 --> 00:14:48,327
What do you mean, "and"? This
is a big deal, don't you see it?

160
00:14:48,328 --> 00:14:50,697
Hemingway wrote a lot of things
that went missing over the years.

161
00:14:52,599 --> 00:14:54,333
Especially when he
was living in Cuba.

162
00:14:54,334 --> 00:14:58,504
So these guys believe that
this is one of those pieces.

163
00:14:58,505 --> 00:15:01,840
So how do you know this is an
original manuscript though?

164
00:15:01,841 --> 00:15:04,476
That's exactly what I'm trying to
learn right now. I'm working on that.

165
00:15:04,477 --> 00:15:09,581
But if I can... if I can prove it is
then I have a foundation for my work.

166
00:15:09,582 --> 00:15:13,518
"Unlocking the mystery
behind Hemingway"

167
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,523
or "Unlocking the mystery
behind Hemingway's work".

168
00:15:18,524 --> 00:15:19,725
Oh.

169
00:15:19,726 --> 00:15:20,826
It has a good ring to it.
No? Well it's a working title.

170
00:15:20,827 --> 00:15:23,094
It's a working title you know.
It's super catchy.

171
00:15:23,095 --> 00:15:25,129
Yeah I mean just... read it.

172
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,465
I would go and spend some time in
Cuba but there's no way to be certain.

173
00:15:27,466 --> 00:15:28,799
What I've been telling you.

174
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,135
Why don't we go?

175
00:15:31,403 --> 00:15:32,571
Why don't we go to Cuba?

176
00:15:33,572 --> 00:15:35,172
This weekend.
Why don't we go?

177
00:15:35,173 --> 00:15:36,741
Okay, you've had one too many.

178
00:15:36,742 --> 00:15:38,243
Go together?
Yeah.

179
00:15:39,478 --> 00:15:40,845
Just up and go?

180
00:15:40,846 --> 00:15:45,181
Yeah. Hey. I don't work this weekend.
You don't work this weekend.

181
00:15:45,182 --> 00:15:47,184
Look. I'm gonna get
us a round of shots.

182
00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:51,389
But if you decide to
go to Cuba I might be in.

183
00:15:52,356 --> 00:15:54,559
It's not gonna be a hindrance
to your research, right?

184
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,093
No, no, I...

185
00:15:57,495 --> 00:15:59,362
Help me out, man!

186
00:15:59,363 --> 00:16:01,398
See me looking at you?
Yeah, but...

187
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:04,101
It is a perfect opportunity
to give her the ring.

188
00:16:05,369 --> 00:16:06,469
Right.

189
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,671
Yeah.

190
00:16:07,672 --> 00:16:09,873
And then are you with me?
Yeah. Of course. It's great.

191
00:16:09,874 --> 00:16:10,807
Okay.

192
00:16:10,808 --> 00:16:12,809
Well. Let's go to Cuba.

193
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,345
Yeah, let's go to Cuba.

194
00:16:15,846 --> 00:16:18,315
So, what's the verdict?

195
00:16:18,316 --> 00:16:19,483
Carlos, what's the verdict?

196
00:16:20,551 --> 00:16:21,519
To Cuba!

197
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,588
Cuba!

198
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:49,634
How much to take us
to Havana?

199
00:16:49,813 --> 00:16:50,580
Let's go.

200
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,441
So this is it.

201
00:17:20,844 --> 00:17:21,811
Awesome.

202
00:17:24,881 --> 00:17:27,950
Carlos, is this uh... is this where
you grew up? Is this the neighborhood?

203
00:17:27,951 --> 00:17:29,584
No. No.

204
00:17:29,585 --> 00:17:31,719
Not too far away
from here though.

205
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,855
Can I go unpack?

206
00:18:08,389 --> 00:18:10,658
Hey do you have, uh...
Do you have the Wi-Fi code?

207
00:18:11,927 --> 00:18:14,262
I told you. There is
no connectivity here.

208
00:18:15,396 --> 00:18:16,797
Don't worry.

209
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:19,434
At certain point I'm gonna have
to go and find some place as well.

210
00:18:20,468 --> 00:18:23,437
I don't feel like I properly
prepared for this trip.

211
00:18:23,438 --> 00:18:25,273
So, uh, what's the plan?

212
00:18:26,374 --> 00:18:27,941
Well,

213
00:18:27,942 --> 00:18:31,312
I was planning to go and visit one of
the places where Hemingway stayed at.

214
00:18:32,513 --> 00:18:33,613
You guys wanna come?

215
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:35,347
Nah I'm gonna pass.

216
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:38,719
I've been thinking more
rum, cigars, you know.

217
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,554
Okay.

218
00:18:40,788 --> 00:18:42,222
I wanna come.

219
00:18:46,661 --> 00:18:47,795
It sounds like a great...

220
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:49,796
great plan.

221
00:18:49,797 --> 00:18:52,799
Sure.
Hey, you can smoke your cigars tonight.

222
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:55,535
Leaving in five.

223
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:40,813
We should go in there later.

224
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:45,894
What address are you
looking for?

225
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:57,822
This is my house.

226
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,732
What?
This is my house.

227
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:04,913
Do you want to see my house?

228
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:06,706
I Speak Spanish.

229
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,340
Twenty dollars.

230
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:12,462
This is the bedroom.

231
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:13,838
Yes, look...

232
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:16,675
Martha, Hemingway's wife...

233
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:19,052
his wife wanted--
his wife--

234
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:20,804
she wanted a safe place.

235
00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:24,808
Look, the most important
thing of all.

236
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:27,143
This is a true gem.

237
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:31,898
This here was written
by Hemingway.

238
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,818
The dining room is over there.

239
00:20:53,117 --> 00:20:55,551
Hey where did you go?
You disappeared on us.

240
00:20:55,552 --> 00:20:58,454
I was just looking around
trying to find something.

241
00:20:58,455 --> 00:20:59,857
Did you?

242
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:01,058
I think so.

243
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:01,859
Look!

244
00:21:05,896 --> 00:21:07,563
Cool.

245
00:21:07,564 --> 00:21:08,866
You know what that means?

246
00:21:13,937 --> 00:21:15,004
You about ready?

247
00:21:15,005 --> 00:21:15,772
What?

248
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,808
Ready for what?

249
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:21,043
To go out. Karen's almost ready.

250
00:21:21,044 --> 00:21:24,480
No, no. I can't
go out right now.

251
00:21:24,481 --> 00:21:26,115
I need to find a place
with the internet.

252
00:21:26,116 --> 00:21:28,718
The hell you can't! I went to
the Hemingway thing for you!

253
00:21:28,719 --> 00:21:30,485
The least you could
do is go out with us!

254
00:21:30,486 --> 00:21:33,089
I really need to get a jump
on this as soon as possible.

255
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:35,524
No, what you need
to do is relax.

256
00:21:36,626 --> 00:21:37,895
You need a drink.

257
00:21:41,031 --> 00:21:44,166
Can't you find a stopping
spot or something, man?

258
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:45,334
We are going to your
favorite restaurant.

259
00:21:45,335 --> 00:21:49,572
Good. Good. It's a really
cool place. You'll like it.

260
00:21:53,976 --> 00:21:55,844
Um...

261
00:21:55,845 --> 00:21:56,879
So...

262
00:21:58,481 --> 00:22:00,215
Is tonight gonna be the night?

263
00:22:00,216 --> 00:22:05,720
No. I don't... This doesn't feel right and
the date's off. You know, it's cloudy out.

264
00:22:05,721 --> 00:22:06,923
Hey, guys. You ready?

265
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,591
You coming with us, Carlos?

266
00:22:09,592 --> 00:22:11,192
No, no.

267
00:22:11,193 --> 00:22:14,863
You know. As you can see I have a couple
of things for the time right now, so.

268
00:22:14,864 --> 00:22:17,833
You know, even Hemingway used to
take breaks and drink sometimes.

269
00:22:18,768 --> 00:22:20,535
You should listen
to her. She's smart.

270
00:22:22,637 --> 00:22:23,672
Come on. Let's go.

271
00:22:43,725 --> 00:22:45,160
Hey, hey! Speak English?

272
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,283
-I speak Spanish.
-That's good, brother.

273
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:48,493
Hey, I got a little bit
of everything.

274
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:50,620
Look, I've got PPG and girls
if you need them.

275
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,163
I'm looking for internet.

276
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:55,708
Internet? That's expensive
and hard to find.

277
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,085
It's only available
in the hotels.

278
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:58,503
How much would it be?

279
00:22:58,503 --> 00:22:59,838
Five.

280
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:00,922
Okay, let's go.

281
00:23:00,922 --> 00:23:02,423
All right, it's nearby.

282
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:03,800
Follow me.

283
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:06,970
Come on.

284
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,429
Well, Raul, let me tell you.

285
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:12,350
You only have to add oil,
water, and onion,

286
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,810
and everything
comes out perfect.

287
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,603
Excuse me a moment.

288
00:23:17,272 --> 00:23:19,524
-What a surprise! My nephew.
-Aunt Conchita.

289
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:21,192
Nice to see you. How are you?

290
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:22,735
-How are you doing?
-And my sister?

291
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:23,820
-Good, good, good.
-What are you doing around here?

292
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,989
Nothing.
Look, I've brought someone.

293
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:27,574
Yes? Can they be trusted?

294
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:28,741
Of course, Auntie.

295
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:29,951
-How is this going to go?
-Like always.

296
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:31,828
Okay, then. Come in.
Don't be shy.

297
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:33,121
-Come in, brother.
-Come in.

298
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,251
Look.

299
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:41,379
This isn't much. But it's
something for your stomach.

300
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:43,673
Thank you.

301
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:46,885
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

302
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:50,847
Well, what are you doing?

303
00:23:51,973 --> 00:23:55,310
I'm working on an investigation
about this place.

304
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,357
I know that place.

305
00:24:03,401 --> 00:24:04,903
That place is shady.

306
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:06,279
Don't go in there.

307
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:07,864
Shady?

308
00:24:07,864 --> 00:24:09,824
Yes, shady.
It's complicated.

309
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:12,493
People that go in
don't come out.

310
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:14,162
They disappear.

311
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:16,205
If you don't know, don't go in.

312
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,207
Get out of there.

313
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:35,887
The... the internet
has been incredible.

314
00:26:35,887 --> 00:26:37,346
You gotta relax.
Here, have some.

315
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:38,473
Take it.

316
00:26:38,473 --> 00:26:41,017
-I needed this.
-Of course.

317
00:26:41,017 --> 00:26:45,063
It's good for your health.

318
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:48,524
-Where do you get this rum?
-At my friend's house.

319
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:50,610
...with this, and done.

320
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,445
Do you know what happens?

321
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:55,531
All women want is...

322
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,575
-Money. Money.
-Money. Money. Of course.

323
00:26:57,575 --> 00:27:01,037
Here. Have a little more,
and you'll be a lot better.

324
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,081
Good?

325
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,001
I'm liking it a lot.

326
00:28:03,537 --> 00:28:06,139
You haven't said a word
about my new Cuban look, man.

327
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,108
Oh that's a Cuban look right there?
Yeah.

328
00:28:08,109 --> 00:28:09,542
Hah.

329
00:28:09,543 --> 00:28:10,610
I got it off the street. You are
actually worried about that look?

330
00:28:10,611 --> 00:28:11,544
No.
Yes.

331
00:28:11,545 --> 00:28:13,112
It is legit Cuban gear.
Ha, seriously?

332
00:28:13,113 --> 00:28:17,082
Sure, we got gypped, fine. And he's
embarrassing me on the streets of Havana.

333
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:18,884
I've seen these pants everywhere,
everyone is wearing them.

334
00:28:18,885 --> 00:28:20,886
Everywhere in Havana.
Yeah, of course.

335
00:28:20,887 --> 00:28:23,956
Carlos, I think you need to take
us on a tour of your... city.

336
00:28:23,957 --> 00:28:27,226
I wish I could, but you guys have
to understand I'm working here.

337
00:28:27,227 --> 00:28:28,927
That's the main reason
why I came here, to work.

338
00:28:28,928 --> 00:28:30,296
As you can see
he's here to work.

339
00:28:30,297 --> 00:28:34,266
Yeah, believe it or not I'm finding
great things along the process.

340
00:28:34,267 --> 00:28:35,501
Really?
Yeah.

341
00:28:35,502 --> 00:28:36,635
Tell us about it.

342
00:28:36,636 --> 00:28:39,138
Well... You know, I mean...

343
00:28:39,139 --> 00:28:40,907
I don't know, important
things like...

344
00:28:43,343 --> 00:28:46,911
I don't want you guys
to think I'm getting nuts.

345
00:28:46,912 --> 00:28:48,980
Oh, we know you are nuts.
You can just go on.

346
00:28:48,981 --> 00:28:50,150
It's a little late for that.

347
00:28:52,017 --> 00:28:54,086
I found this section
of the book I have.

348
00:28:55,187 --> 00:28:56,389
It is description

349
00:28:57,424 --> 00:28:59,392
about a place, a house.

350
00:29:00,326 --> 00:29:01,327
Abandoned house.

351
00:29:02,595 --> 00:29:05,963
Apparently that place was
shut down by the '58th

352
00:29:05,964 --> 00:29:08,600
when the police found five
bodies in the basement.

353
00:29:08,601 --> 00:29:10,402
Now, Hemingway was here

354
00:29:11,403 --> 00:29:14,639
and I believe he was looking
very closely into this

355
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,242
because he was doing some
research for a book or something.

356
00:29:19,445 --> 00:29:21,213
The manuscript I have

357
00:29:22,348 --> 00:29:24,183
is a sort of diary

358
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:27,919
that he was using
to keep track in this case.

359
00:29:29,254 --> 00:29:31,955
If I can prove this...

360
00:29:31,956 --> 00:29:35,393
This... This is perf.
I can get this published.

361
00:29:35,394 --> 00:29:36,395
You got my attention.

362
00:29:37,329 --> 00:29:38,529
Sounds good!

363
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:40,431
So what happened
to the dead bodies?

364
00:29:40,432 --> 00:29:42,232
They were mutilated.

365
00:29:42,233 --> 00:29:43,234
Nice.

366
00:29:43,602 --> 00:29:46,170
Right. For the story of course.

367
00:29:47,539 --> 00:29:48,439
Yeah.

368
00:29:49,307 --> 00:29:52,243
So there's only
one last thing to do.

369
00:29:53,411 --> 00:29:56,279
You may go to the house
and check it out.

370
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,348
As a matter of fact it is
very close to our place.

371
00:29:58,349 --> 00:29:59,516
Perfect.

372
00:29:59,517 --> 00:30:01,618
Close? How close?
Mm-hm.

373
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:02,653
Blocks away.

374
00:30:04,122 --> 00:30:05,989
We have no excuse.

375
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:07,957
That's why we didn't
stay at the hotel.

376
00:30:07,958 --> 00:30:10,293
So this guy could
go to the house.

377
00:30:10,294 --> 00:30:12,430
Sneaky, sneaky Carlos.

378
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,228
What are you doing, weirdo?
Shh!

379
00:31:20,162 --> 00:31:22,598
Hold on, let me turn the light on.
No, no, don't, don't!

380
00:31:24,533 --> 00:31:26,669
Just
come over here. Come.

381
00:31:36,378 --> 00:31:37,613
What are you staring at?

382
00:31:40,516 --> 00:31:41,983
You see that guy?

383
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,187
He's gone.

384
00:31:49,692 --> 00:31:51,391
You guys, what are you doing?

385
00:31:51,392 --> 00:31:53,461
Honey, go back to bed.
I'll be right there.

386
00:31:55,564 --> 00:31:57,065
Great. Get some sleep.

387
00:32:00,368 --> 00:32:02,169
He's gone.

388
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,204
Alright?

389
00:33:11,705 --> 00:33:12,739
Will you...

390
00:33:13,874 --> 00:33:15,074
Will you marry me?

391
00:33:20,914 --> 00:33:22,582
Is that a yes?
It's yes.

392
00:34:24,876 --> 00:34:27,778
Carlos! We have cause
for celebration!

393
00:34:27,779 --> 00:34:29,346
Just got engaged!

394
00:34:29,347 --> 00:34:31,749
Nothing? Really?
Carlos?

395
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:32,684
Did you hear me?

396
00:34:33,818 --> 00:34:34,685
I don't feel that
you're grasping... Look!

397
00:34:34,686 --> 00:34:36,855
...the full magnitude
of this moment.

398
00:34:37,856 --> 00:34:39,524
You have to see something.

399
00:34:41,626 --> 00:34:42,761
What do you got?

400
00:34:45,262 --> 00:34:46,797
Just look.

401
00:34:46,798 --> 00:34:49,632
Oh, it's all starting
to make sense now.

402
00:34:49,633 --> 00:34:51,300
Who is she?

403
00:34:51,301 --> 00:34:53,003
Alright, where did you get it?

404
00:34:53,004 --> 00:34:55,973
Someone just slided
it under the door.

405
00:34:55,974 --> 00:34:58,608
Probably a mistake. It's a neighbor
or something. No, Karen. Karen.

406
00:34:58,609 --> 00:34:59,743
It's not a mistake.

407
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:03,747
See that handwriter?
You see it?

408
00:35:07,418 --> 00:35:08,685
It's the same.

409
00:35:08,686 --> 00:35:10,185
Okay.

410
00:35:10,186 --> 00:35:13,423
Nice. Progress, right? Now we got two
reasons to celebrate. Now, can we go?

411
00:35:13,424 --> 00:35:15,392
No, we're not
celebrating anything.

412
00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:17,760
There's no reason to Ce...

413
00:35:17,761 --> 00:35:19,662
Don't you see what's
happening here?

414
00:35:19,663 --> 00:35:20,363
Really?

415
00:35:21,431 --> 00:35:23,365
You cannot see it?

416
00:35:23,366 --> 00:35:25,400
They know what I'm
doing, this is a statement.

417
00:35:25,401 --> 00:35:27,770
They're trying to tell me something.
Like that guy from yesterday,

418
00:35:27,771 --> 00:35:29,671
he was standing right there.
You saw him.

419
00:35:29,672 --> 00:35:31,908
For an hour looking at
me, is that normal to you?

420
00:35:31,909 --> 00:35:33,375
Hey, what guy?

421
00:35:33,376 --> 00:35:36,913
It was some weirdo
watching Carlos. I don't know.

422
00:35:36,914 --> 00:35:39,715
Look, it's Cuba, man.
It's... It's to be expected.

423
00:35:39,716 --> 00:35:42,951
Like somebody is watching me all the
time. I'm being surveyed all the time.

424
00:35:42,952 --> 00:35:44,720
Somebody's after
me, I can feel it.

425
00:35:44,721 --> 00:35:48,690
Okay, you are starting to sound a little
paranoid, Carlos. No, it's not paranoid. Look!

426
00:35:48,691 --> 00:35:50,760
Calm down, man! Fuck!

427
00:35:52,528 --> 00:35:54,296
I'm sorry.

428
00:35:54,297 --> 00:35:55,597
Whatever.

429
00:35:55,598 --> 00:35:56,532
Crazy.

430
00:35:59,602 --> 00:36:00,837
Dude, what the fuck?

431
00:36:02,972 --> 00:36:04,339
I'm sorry.

432
00:36:06,341 --> 00:36:08,477
You know what? You
know I love you but...

433
00:36:11,513 --> 00:36:12,915
Get your shit together, man.

434
00:36:58,659 --> 00:37:01,694
Maybe we can row on these
little boats, super cheap.

435
00:37:01,695 --> 00:37:02,997
Oh, probably not.

436
00:37:02,998 --> 00:37:04,065
Take a look at that.

437
00:37:08,702 --> 00:37:09,969
What do you...
What do you want...?

438
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:13,673
The number in the building. It
matches for the one at pictures.

439
00:37:13,674 --> 00:37:15,475
So what, man? What...

440
00:37:15,476 --> 00:37:18,011
You got to be kidding me.
I'm so done with this.

441
00:37:18,012 --> 00:37:22,549
The same house. Same number. Same building.
Same street. Same everything. Don't you see it?

442
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:25,385
That woman, whoever she is,
she came here because of that.

443
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,555
Can't you just let it
go, brother? Just...

444
00:37:28,556 --> 00:37:30,690
What do you mean
let it go, John?

445
00:37:30,691 --> 00:37:32,992
John, I wanna go home.

446
00:37:32,993 --> 00:37:34,560
Baby, please.
Just come sit down.

447
00:37:34,561 --> 00:37:36,329
No, I said I wanna
go home right now.

448
00:37:37,998 --> 00:37:41,834
I wanna celebrate and Carlos has been
acting crazy since he got here so we can't.

449
00:37:41,835 --> 00:37:43,635
So let's get the
fuck out of here.

450
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:48,941
Listen, I'm sorry to bother you with all this,
but seriously there's something behind this.

451
00:37:48,942 --> 00:37:51,544
I can feel it... I mean
this is not normal.

452
00:37:52,445 --> 00:37:55,080
If you're so worried about her why
don't you just go to the police?

453
00:37:55,081 --> 00:37:58,483
What am I gonna tell them?
They're not gonna listen to me.

454
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,185
Right now I don't wanna
fucking listen to you.

455
00:38:00,186 --> 00:38:03,755
Well, just... Just help
me in, that's all.

456
00:38:03,756 --> 00:38:05,123
Help you in where?!

457
00:38:05,124 --> 00:38:07,860
I need to get into that building.
I need to see what's inside.

458
00:38:07,861 --> 00:38:09,695
Alright, John.

459
00:38:09,696 --> 00:38:13,031
If Carlos wants to go into that building we're
gonna go into the building to see what's inside.

460
00:38:13,032 --> 00:38:13,933
Let's go.

461
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:15,735
Now.

462
00:38:45,831 --> 00:38:47,698
How are we gonna get in?

463
00:38:47,699 --> 00:38:49,768
I already tried the
door. It's locked.

464
00:39:03,148 --> 00:39:04,515
Told you I tried.

465
00:39:08,954 --> 00:39:10,688
Thought you said
this was locked.

466
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,491
It was locked.

467
00:39:15,026 --> 00:39:16,961
Hello? Hello?

468
00:39:19,163 --> 00:39:21,866
It's not bad, you know.
It needs a little paint.

469
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,768
Little touch-up.

470
00:39:28,673 --> 00:39:30,508
It's real. It's real marble.

471
00:39:31,742 --> 00:39:32,777
Very nice.

472
00:39:45,256 --> 00:39:47,657
Let us see what's up here.

473
00:40:21,291 --> 00:40:22,858
Carlos?

474
00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:23,827
I'm here.

475
00:40:39,775 --> 00:40:41,809
What's that?

476
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:43,246
I have no idea.

477
00:40:50,853 --> 00:40:51,620
Fuck!

478
00:40:53,055 --> 00:40:54,056
Come on!

479
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,627
Hello!

480
00:40:59,628 --> 00:41:00,595
Hello!

481
00:41:04,833 --> 00:41:05,666
Hello!

482
00:41:06,869 --> 00:41:08,303
Can anyone hear us?

483
00:41:17,146 --> 00:41:18,945
There has to
be another exit.

484
00:41:18,946 --> 00:41:21,615
Did you boy Ernest say anything
about these doors lock up, huh?

485
00:41:21,616 --> 00:41:22,917
Is that in the manuscript?

486
00:41:31,059 --> 00:41:32,193
What is this?

487
00:41:36,731 --> 00:41:37,799
Just great.

488
00:41:41,002 --> 00:41:43,171
"There is no hunting

489
00:41:45,006 --> 00:41:47,674
like the hunting of man.

490
00:41:48,876 --> 00:41:52,712
And those who have hunted..."

491
00:41:53,814 --> 00:41:56,183
It's a quote from Hemingway.

492
00:41:56,184 --> 00:41:57,750
Oh, really?

493
00:41:57,751 --> 00:41:58,819
What does it mean?

494
00:42:00,288 --> 00:42:02,422
What paint...
Wait.

495
00:42:02,423 --> 00:42:04,124
Wait, don't touch that.

496
00:42:05,826 --> 00:42:07,861
"...for anything else."

497
00:42:10,764 --> 00:42:11,998
Of course. Alright.

498
00:42:15,368 --> 00:42:16,670
Worth a shot.

499
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:18,939
How are we gonna
get out of here?

500
00:42:20,006 --> 00:42:22,675
There has to be
an exit somewhere.

501
00:42:22,676 --> 00:42:24,743
That would be great...
I'm about done with this...

502
00:42:32,285 --> 00:42:33,652
What is this?

503
00:42:39,426 --> 00:42:40,759
What...

504
00:42:48,468 --> 00:42:50,102
Where are we going, Carlos?

505
00:42:51,237 --> 00:42:53,372
We're going down the hallway.

506
00:42:53,373 --> 00:42:54,773
Are you crazy?

507
00:43:01,113 --> 00:43:05,217
Looks to me like...
we need to follow the lights.

508
00:43:12,992 --> 00:43:15,759
We don't know who's
turning on these lights.

509
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,229
I think we should go find him.
Think he's out there.

510
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:21,432
There's no exit out
there. There is no exit.

511
00:43:21,433 --> 00:43:23,734
We need to just go through
the hallway and find an exit.

512
00:43:23,735 --> 00:43:25,736
Carlos, I'm not going
anywhere with you.

513
00:43:25,737 --> 00:43:27,838
I'm sick and tired of your bullshit.
You got us into this...

514
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,409
Listen, I didn't ask you to...
Guys, that's enough. Focus.

515
00:44:14,352 --> 00:44:15,252
Wait.

516
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:18,888
It halts.

517
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:21,124
What's wrong?
It stopped working...

518
00:44:55,091 --> 00:44:57,092
That one.

519
00:44:57,093 --> 00:44:58,027
I don't know.

520
00:45:20,249 --> 00:45:22,317
I'm gonna go inside,
just take a look.

521
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:23,185
Okay.

522
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:28,224
I'll just go and see first.

523
00:45:35,564 --> 00:45:37,565
Clear?
It's clear.

524
00:45:37,566 --> 00:45:38,567
It's clear.

525
00:45:56,384 --> 00:45:57,585
What is this place?

526
00:46:00,188 --> 00:46:01,356
Baby, I don't know.

527
00:46:05,893 --> 00:46:09,363
Come on! Carlos! Carlos!

528
00:46:09,364 --> 00:46:11,098
Carlos!

529
00:46:11,099 --> 00:46:12,899
Help!

530
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,302
Help!
Carlos!

531
00:46:15,603 --> 00:46:17,338
Hey, John.

532
00:46:17,339 --> 00:46:19,205
Help!
John...

533
00:46:19,206 --> 00:46:20,308
Hey! Karen!

534
00:46:23,445 --> 00:46:25,111
Carlos!

535
00:46:25,112 --> 00:46:26,346
Babe!

536
00:46:26,347 --> 00:46:27,314
Babe!

537
00:46:32,086 --> 00:46:33,620
What's...

538
00:46:33,621 --> 00:46:34,955
What's going on, guys?

539
00:46:42,463 --> 00:46:43,997
Fuck! Fuck!

540
00:46:50,637 --> 00:46:51,638
<i>Welcome!</i>

541
00:46:52,806 --> 00:46:56,610
<i>You stepped through that
door at your own free will.</i>

542
00:46:57,944 --> 00:46:59,612
<i>So now</i>

543
00:46:59,613 --> 00:47:01,881
<i>the game must begin.</i>

544
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:04,317
<i>Good luck.</i>

545
00:47:06,219 --> 00:47:09,655
<i>You have sixty
seconds to your start</i>

546
00:47:09,656 --> 00:47:12,158
<i>before I set them loose on you.</i>

547
00:47:14,093 --> 00:47:15,395
<i>I suggest</i>

548
00:47:16,462 --> 00:47:18,064
<i>you use your time</i>

549
00:47:19,165 --> 00:47:20,266
<i>wisely.</i>

550
00:47:39,585 --> 00:47:40,386
Run!

551
00:48:46,684 --> 00:48:47,551
John?

552
00:48:49,153 --> 00:48:51,222
Hey, John. Is that you?

553
00:49:59,488 --> 00:50:00,756
What?

554
00:50:00,757 --> 00:50:03,859
Where's Carlos? Where's Carlos?
We should go find him. Sh.

555
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:05,060
Be quiet.

556
00:50:41,162 --> 00:50:42,329
John, please.
Shhh.

557
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:43,599
We should get out...

558
00:51:05,853 --> 00:51:09,222
We can't rescue... Please.
Hear to me. He's here... Shhh.

559
00:51:09,223 --> 00:51:11,291
Look at me. Shhh.

560
00:51:11,292 --> 00:51:13,192
We're gonna make it
out of here. Okay?

561
00:51:13,193 --> 00:51:14,362
Okay.
Okay.

562
00:51:17,197 --> 00:51:18,765
Okay.

563
00:51:18,766 --> 00:51:19,867
Alright, here we go.

564
00:51:29,542 --> 00:51:30,845
Go!

565
00:51:49,729 --> 00:51:51,197
Oh, shit!

566
00:52:01,306 --> 00:52:02,408
Go!

567
00:52:48,754 --> 00:52:49,621
Wait!

568
00:53:06,871 --> 00:53:08,505
Go!

569
00:54:56,946 --> 00:54:57,947
Come in!

570
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:02,016
How are you doing?

571
00:55:02,017 --> 00:55:04,185
Please don't take it...
Babe, I got to take it...

572
00:55:04,186 --> 00:55:06,420
We got to leave.
Are you alright?

573
00:55:06,421 --> 00:55:07,856
I can't move, just
take the damn thing here...

574
00:55:09,191 --> 00:55:11,758
It's going to bleed a lot though!
It hurts!

575
00:55:11,759 --> 00:55:13,794
Oh, shit!
Carlos!

576
00:55:13,795 --> 00:55:14,962
Are you okay?

577
00:55:14,963 --> 00:55:17,765
Oh, shit, the door!
Hold the door!

578
00:55:28,743 --> 00:55:30,011
Oh, lord, Carlos!

579
00:55:33,681 --> 00:55:34,983
What?

580
00:55:37,619 --> 00:55:39,619
Okay... Okay.

581
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:40,587
Right, okay.

582
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:43,791
Look at the venting!

583
00:55:55,869 --> 00:55:56,970
Through the venting!

584
00:57:45,676 --> 00:57:46,543
Stop!

585
00:57:48,046 --> 00:57:49,381
Why are you doing this to us?

586
00:57:53,251 --> 00:57:55,252
You need to play the game.

587
00:57:55,253 --> 00:57:57,288
We just... We just want to go.

588
00:57:58,589 --> 00:57:59,890
Nobody goes home.

589
00:58:26,083 --> 00:58:27,251
<i>Get up!</i>

590
00:58:28,986 --> 00:58:30,686
<i>And finish it!</i>

591
00:58:43,267 --> 00:58:45,668
They are not far
from the next room.

592
00:58:46,903 --> 00:58:50,339
Now, get up.

593
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:53,276
<i>Go after them and do it.</i>

594
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:21,002
I got you. Come on.

595
00:59:21,003 --> 00:59:22,771
I can't.

596
00:59:23,705 --> 00:59:24,906
I can't.
Keep moving.

597
00:59:25,907 --> 00:59:27,042
I can't...

598
00:59:27,943 --> 00:59:29,844
I can't. I can't.
Shh.

599
00:59:29,845 --> 00:59:30,846
Come on.

600
00:59:39,387 --> 00:59:40,422
That's alright.

601
00:59:44,292 --> 00:59:45,994
I shouldn't have
brought you here...

602
00:59:48,396 --> 00:59:50,098
I shouldn't have
brought you here.

603
00:59:52,267 --> 00:59:53,968
Just keep moving.

604
00:59:53,969 --> 00:59:54,970
Okay?

605
00:59:56,838 --> 00:59:57,838
Come on.

606
01:00:12,019 --> 01:00:13,388
Come on.

607
01:00:14,322 --> 01:00:15,222
Come on.

608
01:00:29,136 --> 01:00:30,737
Come on!

609
01:00:30,738 --> 01:00:31,839
Go!

610
01:00:37,011 --> 01:00:38,179
Let's go, let's go!

611
01:00:39,413 --> 01:00:40,247
Come on!
Come on!

612
01:00:43,217 --> 01:00:44,185
Carlos!

613
01:00:47,454 --> 01:00:48,721
No!

614
01:00:51,392 --> 01:00:52,159
God...

615
01:00:53,092 --> 01:00:54,027
No!

616
01:01:36,835 --> 01:01:38,971
It is a glorious day.

617
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:49,815
We got to go.

618
01:01:51,149 --> 01:01:52,351
We've got to go, okay?

619
01:02:41,399 --> 01:02:42,900
What is this place?

620
01:02:59,049 --> 01:03:02,085
They are in the meat room.

621
01:03:40,590 --> 01:03:41,524
Don't fucking move!

622
01:03:44,694 --> 01:03:45,960
Who are you people?

623
01:03:45,961 --> 01:03:46,895
Who are you?

624
01:03:48,531 --> 01:03:51,032
I'm no one.
What is this?

625
01:03:51,033 --> 01:03:52,067
The game.

626
01:03:53,001 --> 01:03:54,069
What game?

627
01:03:55,270 --> 01:03:57,438
The game you chose to play.
No!

628
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:58,707
Oh, yes.

629
01:03:58,708 --> 01:04:00,375
You found the book.

630
01:04:00,376 --> 01:04:02,043
You followed it here.

631
01:04:02,044 --> 01:04:03,645
Like everyone else before you.

632
01:04:05,047 --> 01:04:06,615
How do we get out of here?
How do we get out of here?

633
01:04:08,951 --> 01:04:09,518
You don't.

634
01:04:10,686 --> 01:04:13,389
<i>It's impossible.</i>

635
01:04:23,064 --> 01:04:24,031
John.

636
01:04:25,334 --> 01:04:26,267
Let's go...

637
01:04:27,603 --> 01:04:28,604
Let's go.

638
01:06:02,662 --> 01:06:04,497
You broke the rules.
No.

639
01:06:05,732 --> 01:06:07,199
I can fix it.

640
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,035
I can play the game.

641
01:06:59,384 --> 01:07:01,451
John... John!

642
01:07:01,452 --> 01:07:02,287
John...

643
01:07:03,721 --> 01:07:04,521
John...

644
01:07:04,522 --> 01:07:06,657
John, John! Look at me!

645
01:07:06,658 --> 01:07:07,592
Oh, no!

646
01:07:11,496 --> 01:07:12,463
John!

647
01:09:16,384 --> 01:09:17,752
Comfortable, yes?

648
01:09:49,616 --> 01:09:52,286
This is going to be
long and painful.

649
01:10:41,868 --> 01:10:44,537
Clever girl!

650
01:11:01,553 --> 01:11:02,354
No, Sir!

651
01:11:03,488 --> 01:11:05,457
We didn't expect that
to happen, Sir.

652
01:11:08,094 --> 01:11:09,361
Yes, Sir.

653
01:11:10,629 --> 01:11:14,031
I can guarantee that she will
not leave this place alive, Sir.

654
01:11:14,032 --> 01:11:16,034
And if she does,
she won't get far.

655
01:11:21,139 --> 01:11:22,941
All games have ended, Sir.

656
01:11:24,509 --> 01:11:25,910
No, Sir.

657
01:11:25,911 --> 01:11:27,412
No survivors.

658
01:11:32,784 --> 01:11:34,752
The other set of books?

659
01:11:34,753 --> 01:11:36,586
Shipping out tonight, Sir.

660
01:11:36,587 --> 01:11:40,357
They should reach their destination
within the next 48 hours, Sir.

661
01:11:42,894 --> 01:11:44,929
Don't worry, Sir.

662
01:11:44,930 --> 01:11:47,431
We'll take
care of her, Sir.

663
01:11:49,433 --> 01:11:50,734
We always do, Sir.

664
01:14:23,818 --> 01:14:25,485
Your fucking game is over!

665
01:15:24,771 --> 01:15:26,022
Hey, Camacho.

666
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:28,024
Do you think
we're in the right place?

667
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:29,859
This is the place she indicated.

668
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:31,778
And you believed her?

669
01:15:31,778 --> 01:15:34,072
Her story is difficult
to believe.

670
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:36,074
But you never know.

671
01:15:36,074 --> 01:15:38,576
Those Americans come to Cuba and
who knows what they get into?

672
01:15:38,576 --> 01:15:40,412
There is nothing here.

673
01:15:41,538 --> 01:15:42,789
I don't see anything.

674
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:46,918
Well, if someone was here,
they didn't leave a trace.

675
01:15:48,253 --> 01:15:49,546
This place is clean.

676
01:15:50,130 --> 01:15:51,214
Gonzalez, do me a favor.

677
01:15:51,214 --> 01:15:52,757
Go get the woman
and bring her in here.

678
01:16:14,426 --> 01:16:16,295
Madam,
there's nothing here.

679
01:16:16,727 --> 01:16:17,728
No blood...

680
01:16:18,663 --> 01:16:20,364
No room with monitors...
There's nothing.

681
01:16:21,833 --> 01:16:22,834
You have to believe me.

682
01:16:24,268 --> 01:16:24,902
You have to!

683
01:16:27,939 --> 01:16:30,241
My friends, they... were here.

684
01:16:31,776 --> 01:16:33,978
These people, they...
They did this to me!

685
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:36,948
They killed them.

686
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:40,783
They killed my
boyfriend, please.

687
01:16:40,784 --> 01:16:42,452
They tried to kill me.

688
01:16:42,453 --> 01:16:43,919
Please, you have to believe me!

689
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:45,156
Calm down, okay?

690
01:16:46,324 --> 01:16:48,724
We couldn't find anything
you said in your statement.

691
01:16:48,725 --> 01:16:50,960
I'll show you. Let me show you, okay?
I'll show you. I'll show you...

692
01:16:50,961 --> 01:16:52,296
Calm down, madam. Calm down!

693
01:16:52,901 --> 01:16:55,278
Calm, be calm.

694
01:16:55,299 --> 01:16:56,334
Let me show you? Okay?

695
01:16:58,168 --> 01:16:59,703
I'm not making this up.

696
01:17:02,172 --> 01:17:04,107
Please! You have to believe me!

697
01:17:07,110 --> 01:17:09,346
It was here. It was all here.

698
01:17:14,217 --> 01:17:15,985
He was...

699
01:17:15,986 --> 01:17:17,053
He was here!

700
01:17:18,384 --> 01:17:20,095
Calm down.

701
01:17:22,305 --> 01:17:24,015
Calm down.

702
01:17:22,459 --> 01:17:25,793
No, but John was here, he was!
He was... he was here.

703
01:17:25,794 --> 01:17:28,830
Madam. Madam, quiet. Okay?

704
01:17:28,831 --> 01:17:30,699
No, no, you have to believe
me, please! Please!

705
01:17:31,106 --> 01:17:32,816
Let's take her to the airport.

706
01:17:32,816 --> 01:17:34,943
Let's get her out of here, okay?
1

707
01:17:35,205 --> 01:17:37,641
Madam? Madam!
John was here! No! He was...

708
01:17:40,510 --> 01:17:41,877
You have to believe me!

709
01:19:55,107 --> 01:19:56,542
Miss Johnson.

710
01:20:00,513 --> 01:20:01,947
Please, don't scream.

711
01:20:03,582 --> 01:20:04,517
Please...

712
01:20:06,118 --> 01:20:07,319
Please...

713
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:09,354
Relax, Miss Johnson.

714
01:20:09,355 --> 01:20:12,224
If I wanted to hurt you,
I would have done so already.

715
01:20:14,959 --> 01:20:17,862
On the contrary, I'm
here to congratulate you.

716
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:20,433
You should be proud of yourself.

717
01:20:22,133 --> 01:20:25,271
You're the first to make it out
of our event in one piece.

718
01:20:27,038 --> 01:20:30,509
The rules of our little game are
simple and must be abided at all times.

719
01:20:32,410 --> 01:20:35,280
No one lives to talk
about the game.

720
01:20:36,915 --> 01:20:37,583
No one.

721
01:20:40,151 --> 01:20:41,953
You broke that rule.

722
01:20:43,288 --> 01:20:44,422
You won

723
01:20:45,523 --> 01:20:47,392
but at no avail, I'm afraid.

724
01:20:48,927 --> 01:20:49,961
Who are you?

725
01:20:51,062 --> 01:20:52,630
Who I am doesn't matter.

726
01:20:53,631 --> 01:20:55,200
What matters is this:

727
01:20:57,469 --> 01:20:59,303
No matter how far you run,

728
01:20:59,304 --> 01:21:02,540
no matter where you
try to hide, we will be there,

729
01:21:03,708 --> 01:21:05,042
Miss Johnson.

730
01:21:06,678 --> 01:21:08,178
Nothing ends

731
01:21:09,246 --> 01:21:10,515
unless we say so.

732
01:21:12,082 --> 01:21:13,418
Do you understand?

733
01:21:19,123 --> 01:21:22,092
Now, these are the new rules.

734
01:21:23,728 --> 01:21:26,130
You will leave
this place in two hours.

735
01:21:27,364 --> 01:21:30,367
Two hours and we'll...
we'll start hunting you down.

736
01:21:34,638 --> 01:21:39,376
Ah, you just lost four
seconds, Miss Johnson.

737
01:21:42,579 --> 01:21:45,382
I'll see you on the other
side, Miss Johnson.
