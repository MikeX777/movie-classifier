1
00:00:13,194 --> 00:00:15,541
I have always known
exactly what I'm worth.

2
00:00:15,575 --> 00:00:16,852
$1 Million.

3
00:00:18,095 --> 00:00:21,271
2 million! 3 million!

4
00:00:21,305 --> 00:00:25,792
3,245,000.

5
00:00:25,827 --> 00:00:28,554
That's how much I had
to pay to keep you.

6
00:00:28,588 --> 00:00:30,970
And you are worth it.

7
00:00:31,004 --> 00:00:32,351
You are worth all of it.

8
00:00:35,595 --> 00:00:37,597
You know what that means, right?

9
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:39,461
Means you get to stay here,

10
00:00:39,496 --> 00:00:41,912
means you don't have
to go to your mom's.

11
00:00:41,946 --> 00:00:44,915
Means I get to
see you every day.

12
00:00:44,949 --> 00:00:46,296
Airplanes?

13
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:47,849
We can do airplanes.

14
00:00:47,883 --> 00:00:51,024
We can build any
airplane you want

15
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:54,269
because I'm not going
to work today or ever.

16
00:00:55,512 --> 00:00:57,893
It's Christmas and
we're gonna do airplanes

17
00:00:57,928 --> 00:01:00,033
and we're gonna make 'em fly.

18
00:01:01,242 --> 00:01:05,108
$3,245,000.

19
00:01:05,142 --> 00:01:06,350
That's what he paid my mom

20
00:01:06,385 --> 00:01:09,008
for sole custody
after the divorce.

21
00:01:09,042 --> 00:01:12,080
What I didn't know was
he only divorced her.

22
00:01:13,254 --> 00:01:14,910
He didn't divorce the office.

23
00:01:14,945 --> 00:01:16,612
What do you mean he
backed out of the deal?

24
00:01:16,636 --> 00:01:19,018
He doesn't get to
back out of the deal.

25
00:01:19,052 --> 00:01:22,780
He needs to deliver
500,000 novelty armadillos

26
00:01:22,815 --> 00:01:23,988
before New Year's

27
00:01:24,023 --> 00:01:27,268
or I'll see him in court
from now until July.

28
00:01:27,302 --> 00:01:30,029
Oh, he wants to talk
sphincter molds, does he?

29
00:01:30,063 --> 00:01:31,755
I'll tell him about
sphincter molds.

30
00:01:31,789 --> 00:01:34,033
You tell him that I've
been doing sphincter molds

31
00:01:34,067 --> 00:01:35,793
since before he was born.

32
00:01:35,828 --> 00:01:37,278
What can I say?

33
00:01:37,312 --> 00:01:39,176
You can't divorce your mistress.

34
00:01:39,211 --> 00:01:40,211
June!

35
00:01:41,316 --> 00:01:43,076
Stop playing with that stuff.

36
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:45,527
The semester starts today.

37
00:01:45,562 --> 00:01:48,875
What? No, it's just my kid
and her danged airplanes.

38
00:01:51,395 --> 00:01:53,949
I actually thought 3 million
meant he really loved me.

39
00:01:55,641 --> 00:01:57,850
Now, I think he was
just a bad negotiator.

40
00:02:02,993 --> 00:02:04,477
Here's another
thing I'm sure of,

41
00:02:04,512 --> 00:02:07,066
nothing I do here
matters at all.

42
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,895
My dad's got a dozen companies

43
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,276
and the instant I get a diploma,

44
00:02:10,311 --> 00:02:12,520
he's gonna stick me in a
corner office somewhere

45
00:02:12,554 --> 00:02:14,625
with a thick salary
and that's that.

46
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,627
I'll never have to
worry about a thing.

47
00:02:17,525 --> 00:02:19,906
Not a thing.

48
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:31,055
Hey, uh, I really
need that back.

49
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:33,575
Angle of incidence.

50
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,128
Excuse me?

51
00:02:35,163 --> 00:02:37,106
Well, this is an old Wright
Brothers box glider, right?

52
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,339
Mm-hmm.

53
00:02:38,373 --> 00:02:39,132
They used to call it
angle of incidence

54
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:40,375
but today it's called-

55
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,559
Angle of attack.
Yes, I'm aware.

56
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,861
Um, could you just
give that back? Please-

57
00:02:43,896 --> 00:02:46,933
See if you go over that,
the wing loses lift,

58
00:02:46,968 --> 00:02:48,797
you get loss of
airflow over the wing,

59
00:02:48,832 --> 00:02:50,844
which would lead directly to
an abrupt loss of altitude-

60
00:02:50,868 --> 00:02:52,732
Okay, look, I'm very impressed

61
00:02:52,767 --> 00:02:53,985
that you read
further than I did.

62
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:56,460
That's, that's awesome.

63
00:02:56,495 --> 00:02:57,875
But that's due in two minutes.

64
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,152
- Okay?
- You know

65
00:02:59,187 --> 00:03:00,533
this can go a lot
farther, right?

66
00:03:00,568 --> 00:03:02,097
I mean, you've really
compromised your lift here.

67
00:03:02,121 --> 00:03:02,915
- But- - Look, I don't need it

68
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:03,950
to go farther.

69
00:03:03,985 --> 00:03:06,090
I just need it to go 30 feet.

70
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,057
Just one little
tweak to the wing-

71
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:09,162
Uh, no. No messing with it.

72
00:03:09,197 --> 00:03:10,854
That is due.

73
00:03:10,888 --> 00:03:12,407
But it could be so much better.

74
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:17,343
Look, whoever you
are, I don't care.

75
00:03:17,378 --> 00:03:18,275
Okay?

76
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,828
It's just a grade.

77
00:03:19,863 --> 00:03:21,865
I don't need to go
round the world.

78
00:03:23,073 --> 00:03:24,799
Just need it to pass.

79
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,939
But it's an airplane.

80
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:29,079
It's just a grade.

81
00:03:34,498 --> 00:03:35,292
Oh, come on.

82
00:03:35,327 --> 00:03:36,224
What are you? Seven?

83
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:37,501
I gotta get that turned in.

84
00:03:37,536 --> 00:03:38,892
And look, if you wanna
take one home to daddy

85
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:40,228
and play there, that's fine.

86
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:41,609
But that one is not a toy.

87
00:03:44,197 --> 00:03:44,991
No, no.

88
00:03:45,026 --> 00:03:46,130
Come on. No.

89
00:03:46,165 --> 00:03:47,339
No. Come on.

90
00:03:47,373 --> 00:03:47,856
Please do not.

91
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:48,685
Ah! No.

92
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:49,719
What are you doing?

93
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,487
You better go get
that. It's due.

94
00:04:19,094 --> 00:04:21,165
Is this your project?

95
00:04:22,719 --> 00:04:23,719
You get an A.

96
00:04:28,725 --> 00:04:31,244
You know how some
people are like car problems

97
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:33,592
or annoying relatives?

98
00:04:33,626 --> 00:04:36,215
They just keep turning up.

99
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,222
You are applying
arbitrary standards

100
00:04:43,256 --> 00:04:45,293
to get your favored
result knowing full well

101
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:47,882
that comparable risks are
tolerated all the time.

102
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:51,230
And you are ignoring the
fact that risk is cumulative

103
00:04:51,264 --> 00:04:52,887
and will add up to
unacceptable levels

104
00:04:52,921 --> 00:04:54,129
within that timeframe.

105
00:04:54,164 --> 00:04:55,614
While you
seem to believe

106
00:04:55,648 --> 00:04:56,867
that the organization can
only do one thing right.

107
00:04:56,891 --> 00:04:58,582
And you do not understand

108
00:04:58,617 --> 00:05:00,446
that it is a question
of priorities.

109
00:05:00,481 --> 00:05:01,965
And those are clearly
spelled out in-

110
00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:03,311
Time!

111
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:05,348
Enough about the seating chart.

112
00:05:05,382 --> 00:05:08,074
Let's move on to
the actual debate.

113
00:05:10,801 --> 00:05:14,115
But then one day,
one wonderful day,

114
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:19,051
you move on and you'll
never, ever, ever

115
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,984
have to deal with that arrogant,

116
00:05:21,018 --> 00:05:23,435
stuck up, selfish jerk again-

117
00:05:45,664 --> 00:05:46,837
- Hello everyone.
- So?

118
00:05:46,872 --> 00:05:50,082
Welcome to
this year's graduation.

119
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,946
So is not a five-syllable word.

120
00:05:54,017 --> 00:05:58,470
So. Business?

121
00:05:58,504 --> 00:06:00,264
Really? Business major?

122
00:06:03,544 --> 00:06:05,511
That's kind of surprising.

123
00:06:07,202 --> 00:06:09,412
Didn't know I had to get
your approval for it.

124
00:06:10,343 --> 00:06:11,483
Like, business?

125
00:06:11,517 --> 00:06:12,932
I mean really.

126
00:06:12,967 --> 00:06:15,797
I mean, I, I would've
figured you for aeronautics.

127
00:06:15,832 --> 00:06:19,352
Figuring wrong
seems to be a habit of yours.

128
00:06:19,387 --> 00:06:22,908
Not just aeronautics
though. Like valedictorian.

129
00:06:22,942 --> 00:06:25,531
Or at least with honors, right?

130
00:06:28,292 --> 00:06:29,292
I mean, right?

131
00:06:30,674 --> 00:06:32,400
Even the guy that
forgot his hat can see

132
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:34,885
that you are way too
smart for business.

133
00:06:36,335 --> 00:06:38,993
Is this your warped way
of giving me a compliment?

134
00:06:39,027 --> 00:06:41,444
Is this your warped
way of receiving one?

135
00:06:45,965 --> 00:06:48,140
Fine. Let's just say it.

136
00:06:49,382 --> 00:06:50,867
You're bone-chillingly smart.

137
00:06:52,109 --> 00:06:54,595
And I did not think for a moment

138
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:57,908
that it would be for business.

139
00:06:59,082 --> 00:07:00,877
Explain to me

140
00:07:00,911 --> 00:07:03,120
why it's your expectations
I should meet?

141
00:07:04,363 --> 00:07:07,090
Well, then whose
expectations are you meeting?

142
00:07:07,124 --> 00:07:10,334
'Cause if it's not your
own either, then come on.

143
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:13,752
You're just coasting.

144
00:07:13,786 --> 00:07:16,720
Like an F-16 being
used as a glider.

145
00:07:22,105 --> 00:07:24,314
Are you having some
sleepless nights?

146
00:07:24,348 --> 00:07:27,041
Thinking about all the
places you won't be employed?

147
00:07:27,075 --> 00:07:28,318
Excuse me?

148
00:07:28,352 --> 00:07:31,770
Broadcast, you
majored in broadcast,

149
00:07:31,804 --> 00:07:36,844
not tech, not new media,
broadcast, with honors.

150
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,743
Well, my apologies on
behalf of those of us

151
00:07:39,778 --> 00:07:41,469
who have an actual plan.

152
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:42,712
Broadcast?

153
00:07:42,746 --> 00:07:45,093
Like big antennas on mountains

154
00:07:45,128 --> 00:07:47,855
and endless reruns
of "Lawrence Welk."

155
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:50,409
In the age of streaming,
really?

156
00:07:50,443 --> 00:07:52,618
Were the newspapers not
hopeless enough for you?

157
00:07:52,653 --> 00:07:55,828
Oh, what, you're saying you've
never watched TV before?

158
00:07:55,863 --> 00:07:57,002
Honestly, no.

159
00:07:57,036 --> 00:07:58,382
Growing up there
was a big screen

160
00:07:58,417 --> 00:08:01,006
in every room of the
house, all streaming.

161
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,665
That's not even the future.
That's the recent past.

162
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:05,814
I mean, what do you
think you're gonna do?

163
00:08:05,838 --> 00:08:07,322
Exhume Walter Cronkite?

164
00:08:07,357 --> 00:08:11,119
You know, some
of us have actual ideas.

165
00:08:11,154 --> 00:08:12,327
Yeah.

166
00:08:12,362 --> 00:08:13,881
And some of us have
actual earnings.

167
00:08:14,951 --> 00:08:17,160
Go ahead. Say what you want.

168
00:08:17,194 --> 00:08:19,438
I've had a job since day one.

169
00:08:19,472 --> 00:08:21,026
What do you got lined up?

170
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,513
I've got resumes out.

171
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,756
Lined up.

172
00:08:30,414 --> 00:08:32,140
Well, that's lovely.

173
00:08:32,175 --> 00:08:33,359
You can make the
world a better place

174
00:08:33,383 --> 00:08:36,248
by being unemployed with honors.

175
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:42,841
Well, wherever I
end up, I'll be flying.

176
00:08:44,394 --> 00:08:45,637
You'll just be coasting.

177
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,778
Happy graduation.

178
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:18,601
You're what?

179
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,958
I'm not coming in tomorrow, Dad.

180
00:09:20,982 --> 00:09:22,846
You can't take vacation now.

181
00:09:22,881 --> 00:09:25,228
It's not a vacation. I quit.

182
00:09:25,262 --> 00:09:26,367
You what now?

183
00:09:26,401 --> 00:09:27,886
Quit. Quit.

184
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,887
Q-U-I-T.

185
00:09:28,921 --> 00:09:30,129
Look it up in the dictionary.

186
00:09:30,164 --> 00:09:32,373
Quit is not in our
family vocabulary.

187
00:09:32,407 --> 00:09:35,203
Yeah. Well, maybe you
should learn a new language.

188
00:09:35,238 --> 00:09:36,929
Tell me straight.

189
00:09:36,964 --> 00:09:38,897
Is this about money?

190
00:09:38,931 --> 00:09:41,244
Because if it is, good deal.

191
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:42,531
We can just add
another zero to your-

192
00:09:42,555 --> 00:09:44,627
Dad, it's really not.

193
00:09:44,661 --> 00:09:46,249
Your mom?

194
00:09:46,283 --> 00:09:48,147
Your mom's been talking to you.

195
00:09:48,182 --> 00:09:50,287
Mom hasn't given me anything
other than postcards

196
00:09:50,322 --> 00:09:52,082
in the last 15 years
and you know it.

197
00:09:52,117 --> 00:09:53,083
Private jet, huh?

198
00:09:53,118 --> 00:09:54,326
I'll get you the key.

199
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,052
Dad, I don't want
anything from you.

200
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:03,576
I just wanna fly
instead of coasting.

201
00:10:03,611 --> 00:10:04,611
Okay?

202
00:10:06,303 --> 00:10:07,303
Okay.

203
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,411
We're good on this, right?

204
00:10:11,274 --> 00:10:12,896
I mean, we're, we're good?

205
00:10:12,931 --> 00:10:14,691
Oh yeah. Yeah, we're good.

206
00:10:16,003 --> 00:10:18,039
So you got another job?

207
00:10:18,074 --> 00:10:19,523
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

208
00:10:19,558 --> 00:10:23,044
Beachwood & Haggle.
Mid-sized investment place.

209
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:25,702
I'll be doing the
client outreach thing.

210
00:10:25,737 --> 00:10:27,290
Great.

211
00:10:27,324 --> 00:10:29,154
Good for you and all that.

212
00:10:29,188 --> 00:10:31,052
I know you'll do great.

213
00:10:31,087 --> 00:10:32,087
Yeah.

214
00:10:58,977 --> 00:11:01,634
Come in. Come in.

215
00:11:03,015 --> 00:11:06,605
June, I have good news.
I just sold the company.

216
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:08,538
You're getting a promotion.

217
00:11:08,572 --> 00:11:09,572
A big one.

218
00:11:11,127 --> 00:11:12,127
I resign.

219
00:11:20,412 --> 00:11:21,412
Kids.

220
00:11:22,794 --> 00:11:24,036
Hi, Mr. Kelgood.

221
00:11:24,071 --> 00:11:26,729
I'm calling about the
client-facing job,

222
00:11:26,763 --> 00:11:28,489
wondering if it's
still available.

223
00:12:31,655 --> 00:12:32,553
What is it?

224
00:12:32,587 --> 00:12:33,899
My name is Allison. This is-

225
00:12:38,248 --> 00:12:39,732
Jeeper's crow, Dad.

226
00:12:39,767 --> 00:12:41,976
Hey, now we made a
lot of people happy today.

227
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,840
Yeah. Well, you sure
didn't make me happy.

228
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,404
Well, maybe
that's your own fault.

229
00:12:45,428 --> 00:12:46,947
You ever think about that?

230
00:12:46,981 --> 00:12:49,259
Just don't. I am not the
one with the problem here.

231
00:12:49,294 --> 00:12:50,813
You are the one
with the problem.

232
00:12:50,847 --> 00:12:52,815
I'm also the
one who's employed

233
00:12:52,849 --> 00:12:55,300
and there's no reason
you couldn't be too.

234
00:12:55,334 --> 00:12:56,508
Don't you dare.

235
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,165
Don't I dare. What?

236
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:00,270
Don't you dare try
and keep this up.

237
00:13:00,305 --> 00:13:01,582
I will outlast you.

238
00:13:01,616 --> 00:13:03,239
I will find something.

239
00:13:03,273 --> 00:13:04,273
Where?

240
00:13:06,242 --> 00:13:07,899
We can never be bought.

241
00:13:09,003 --> 00:13:11,350
That's right folks.
Nobody owns us.

242
00:13:11,385 --> 00:13:13,180
No one can buy us.

243
00:13:13,214 --> 00:13:16,493
We only answer to
viewers like you.

244
00:13:16,528 --> 00:13:21,257
Our city's only public
television station since 1969.

245
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:24,570
Always independent,
right from the start.

246
00:13:24,605 --> 00:13:26,849
We'll always give you our best

247
00:13:26,883 --> 00:13:31,267
because you've always given us
your best, viewers like you.

248
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,548
Sweetheart?

249
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:37,582
Where?

250
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:42,899
Just you try and find out.

251
00:13:42,934 --> 00:13:43,969
Wait, what?

252
00:14:11,445 --> 00:14:12,791
Hello?

253
00:14:14,793 --> 00:14:16,484
Hello. Anybody?

254
00:14:18,866 --> 00:14:19,866
Hello?

255
00:14:21,489 --> 00:14:26,563
Hello? Hello?

256
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,360
Hello?

257
00:14:32,535 --> 00:14:33,535
Anybody?

258
00:14:39,369 --> 00:14:40,369
Hello.

259
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,130
Hi. Excuse me.

260
00:14:44,374 --> 00:14:45,548
Hi. Hi, excuse me.

261
00:14:45,582 --> 00:14:47,377
For crying
out loud child.

262
00:14:47,412 --> 00:14:48,585
Sorry.

263
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,942
- Really, sorry.
- What is it you want?

264
00:14:49,966 --> 00:14:52,520
Um, well, hi, I'm
June Schroeder.

265
00:14:52,555 --> 00:14:54,143
I called ahead and
left a message.

266
00:14:54,177 --> 00:14:56,904
Well, don't come in
with the garbage, girl.

267
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:58,226
Go around front
like a human being.

268
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,321
Well, I tried,
but it was locked.

269
00:15:14,335 --> 00:15:15,335
Hello?

270
00:15:17,925 --> 00:15:19,375
Hello, are you in there now?

271
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:23,103
Whom shall
I say is calling?

272
00:15:23,137 --> 00:15:25,484
It's
me. June Schroeder.

273
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,177
We literally just
met around the back.

274
00:15:30,006 --> 00:15:31,006
Finally.

275
00:15:31,904 --> 00:15:33,354
Do you have an appointment?

276
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:37,703
Uh, no. Like I said, I, I
called ahead and left a message.

277
00:15:37,738 --> 00:15:39,015
If all you need is the pleasure

278
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,637
of talking to our
answering service,

279
00:15:40,672 --> 00:15:42,191
you can do that at any time.

280
00:15:42,225 --> 00:15:43,502
No appointment necessary.

281
00:15:44,641 --> 00:15:46,436
I just wanna talk to
someone in charge.

282
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:49,232
Whom shall I say is calling?

283
00:15:51,752 --> 00:15:54,927
Look, you can stop
playing games with me now.

284
00:15:56,032 --> 00:15:57,723
I've had a look
around this place.

285
00:15:57,758 --> 00:15:59,898
It is anything but busy, okay?

286
00:16:01,037 --> 00:16:05,041
But you know,
it sure looked to me

287
00:16:05,076 --> 00:16:07,526
like you were digging
up something out back

288
00:16:07,561 --> 00:16:10,426
that you maybe weren't
supposed to have.

289
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:14,154
So I will get through to someone
in charge sooner or later.

290
00:16:14,188 --> 00:16:16,846
Might as well make it sooner
while I'm more willing

291
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,538
to keep quiet about
certain things, huh?

292
00:16:24,543 --> 00:16:27,339
Well, you got through
sooner than you thought.

293
00:16:27,374 --> 00:16:28,996
That's right. I'm in charge.

294
00:16:30,308 --> 00:16:32,655
First the head of the
board left, then the board,

295
00:16:32,689 --> 00:16:35,796
then the general manager,
and then the station manager.

296
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:39,179
And who do you think they
dumped all their decisions on?

297
00:16:40,628 --> 00:16:43,217
Don't even think about trying
to play games with me, kiddo.

298
00:16:46,531 --> 00:16:47,946
So,

299
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,948
you admit you could
really use some help then?

300
00:16:51,329 --> 00:16:53,400
You wanna know why my
checkbook's staying shut?

301
00:16:53,434 --> 00:16:54,953
You never argue.

302
00:16:54,987 --> 00:16:56,620
Well, you know,
most places, Mr. Leech,

303
00:16:56,644 --> 00:16:57,932
wouldn't consider that
very professional.

304
00:16:57,956 --> 00:16:59,820
I've got all the
help I can stand.

305
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,893
What just got into you?

306
00:17:05,688 --> 00:17:07,759
Hold it. Wait a minute.

307
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,588
How do you think
we handled things

308
00:17:09,623 --> 00:17:12,384
on the set of "The
Woking Mysteries?"

309
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:15,939
Arguments, that's how. We
weren't afraid to argue.

310
00:17:15,974 --> 00:17:18,494
Yeah, I, I heard how things
went down on that set.

311
00:17:18,528 --> 00:17:20,806
Stuff of legend. Am I right?

312
00:17:20,841 --> 00:17:22,739
Yeah, like Mt. Vesuvius.

313
00:17:22,774 --> 00:17:26,018
Keeping things peaceful
here. Mr. Leech, I-

314
00:17:26,053 --> 00:17:29,091
Well, look who still
can't close a deal?

315
00:17:30,471 --> 00:17:32,508
What are you doing here?

316
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:35,062
What is she doing here?

317
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:38,410
So tell me, are you actively
saying the wrong things

318
00:17:38,445 --> 00:17:40,723
or are you just forgetting
to say the right ones?

319
00:17:40,757 --> 00:17:44,002
Like how this station is number
42 in the national market.

320
00:17:44,036 --> 00:17:46,187
And that's pretty good for out
of 300 something affiliates.

321
00:17:46,211 --> 00:17:48,144
You know, I led with
that little detail.

322
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:49,076
Thank you.

323
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:50,560
Well, there's your problem.

324
00:17:50,595 --> 00:17:52,562
Anyone can lead with
something generic.

325
00:17:52,597 --> 00:17:53,677
What are you gonna come up with

326
00:17:53,701 --> 00:17:55,013
that means something to him?

327
00:17:55,047 --> 00:17:56,566
I did my homework. Okay.

328
00:17:56,601 --> 00:17:57,636
Well, he had a series.

329
00:17:57,671 --> 00:17:59,397
I know I heard that much.

330
00:17:59,431 --> 00:18:01,306
Don't suppose you were
planning on acknowledging that.

331
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,848
Actually, as a matter of fact,

332
00:18:02,883 --> 00:18:05,575
I have three charts
on it right here.

333
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:07,612
Old news, old news.

334
00:18:07,646 --> 00:18:09,855
What are you gonna come
up with that's new?

335
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:12,375
What's the new demo
on the streaming site?

336
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:15,171
What's the new rebrand on
the compilation series?

337
00:18:15,206 --> 00:18:17,518
I mean, is he really
thinking about these things?

338
00:18:17,553 --> 00:18:20,245
Or is it all just, "Welcome
to the '90s again."

339
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,903
Claire, what is she doing here?

340
00:18:25,664 --> 00:18:29,634
Don't mind me. I'm just
signing this enormous check.

341
00:18:29,668 --> 00:18:32,809
Well, not too enormous.

342
00:18:32,844 --> 00:18:35,364
Just a little something.

343
00:18:35,398 --> 00:18:38,677
A little pledge for the month.

344
00:18:38,712 --> 00:18:42,198
See now I know, you
people give a darn.

345
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:45,132
Well, thank you
Mr. Leech. I'd...

346
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:47,893
I'll be seeing a lot more
of you around here, right?

347
00:18:49,999 --> 00:18:54,624
So now let's go shoot.

348
00:18:59,871 --> 00:19:03,219
Claire, what's going on here?

349
00:19:03,254 --> 00:19:04,358
Job interview.

350
00:19:05,532 --> 00:19:08,742
So if I hire her,
what am I getting?

351
00:19:09,605 --> 00:19:10,813
I'm right here.

352
00:19:10,847 --> 00:19:12,021
He's your reference.

353
00:19:13,436 --> 00:19:14,989
Well?

354
00:19:15,024 --> 00:19:18,061
I guarantee you that
she doesn't understand

355
00:19:18,096 --> 00:19:21,064
the first thing about
working in broadcast,

356
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:23,998
aside from maybe what
she Googled last night.

357
00:19:24,033 --> 00:19:25,276
Well, six months ago,

358
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,519
all I knew how to
do was scheduling.

359
00:19:27,554 --> 00:19:28,624
Anything else?

360
00:19:30,729 --> 00:19:31,834
She's a royal pill.

361
00:19:33,111 --> 00:19:34,111
Observed.

362
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:39,497
And anything else?

363
00:19:44,053 --> 00:19:45,053
She's smart.

364
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,436
She's real smart.

365
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:50,611
That we can work with.

366
00:19:53,131 --> 00:19:55,961
This can keep us going
for another week,

367
00:19:55,996 --> 00:19:57,308
including her salary.

368
00:19:58,585 --> 00:19:59,586
Wanna stick around?

369
00:20:00,621 --> 00:20:01,621
Get more pledges.

370
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,735
So.

371
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:12,668
So.

372
00:20:12,702 --> 00:20:14,325
- So...
- Ugh.

373
00:20:16,948 --> 00:20:18,329
This is where you ended up.

374
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:21,894
Do you always give people grief
for saving your workplace?

375
00:20:21,918 --> 00:20:24,611
Is it too much to hope

376
00:20:24,645 --> 00:20:26,406
that you actually
did Google something

377
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,993
about working in
broadcast last night?

378
00:20:28,028 --> 00:20:29,512
- Or...
- Look.

379
00:20:29,547 --> 00:20:31,467
Didn't I just hear that
guy say you have a shoot?

380
00:20:33,447 --> 00:20:35,035
- Yes.
- Hmm.

381
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:36,519
Yes he did.

382
00:20:36,554 --> 00:20:38,797
As a matter of fact,
since you work here now,

383
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,490
you should come sit
in on it, newbie.

384
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,253
Hmm.

385
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,985
Hello, movie lovers everywhere.

386
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,469
I'm Cary Leech,

387
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:59,749
star of "The Reverend
Woking Mysteries"

388
00:20:59,784 --> 00:21:03,788
and your host for this
edition of "Weekend Classics."

389
00:21:03,822 --> 00:21:07,964
Tonight's movie stars the
infamous Charlie Chaplin.

390
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:10,139
A giant of the silent screen,

391
00:21:10,173 --> 00:21:13,936
he almost made it in talkies
before leaving the U.S.

392
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:16,628
to take over Germany
and start World War II.

393
00:21:17,871 --> 00:21:20,183
It wasn't long before
his next picture,

394
00:21:20,218 --> 00:21:24,153
"The Scarlet Empress"
inadvertently helped launch

395
00:21:24,187 --> 00:21:26,811
the Red Scare in his
native U.S. of A.

396
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,059
How you feeling?

397
00:21:36,821 --> 00:21:38,167
My brain hurts.

398
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:42,827
This, this cannot be
your business model.

399
00:21:42,861 --> 00:21:46,037
Just let him spout nonsense
introducing old movies

400
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,902
so he'll, he'll make a
donation every once in a while.

401
00:21:48,936 --> 00:21:51,283
Not donations, pledges.

402
00:21:52,284 --> 00:21:53,527
We call 'em pledges.

403
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,011
Ew. Don't say pledge.

404
00:21:55,046 --> 00:21:57,117
That gives me
sorority flashbacks.

405
00:21:59,188 --> 00:22:01,604
Well, it's what we
got going on for now.

406
00:22:02,985 --> 00:22:05,367
Unless you know somebody with
some really deep pockets.

407
00:22:06,609 --> 00:22:10,302
Um, let's just say no
to that.

408
00:22:10,337 --> 00:22:12,650
Yep. Me neither.

409
00:22:14,065 --> 00:22:17,517
So one week to get him to
open his checkbook again.

410
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:22,245
It's not our only
deadline, but, yeah.

411
00:22:23,315 --> 00:22:24,534
And the only two
things he cares about

412
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:27,458
are being on screen
and watching us fight,

413
00:22:27,492 --> 00:22:29,943
and one of which he
already has by default.

414
00:22:31,082 --> 00:22:32,082
Yeah.

415
00:22:36,018 --> 00:22:39,401
So, are we gonna fight?

416
00:22:45,545 --> 00:22:46,546
Just try and keep up.

417
00:22:48,582 --> 00:22:50,204
Yeah. Remember to
tell yourself that.

418
00:23:01,906 --> 00:23:03,873
Broadcast. Point me to it.

419
00:23:04,978 --> 00:23:06,842
You mean, you mean
like streaming?

420
00:23:47,158 --> 00:23:49,056
All right, let's get
our foreign programming

421
00:23:49,091 --> 00:23:50,644
converted over to NTSB,

422
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:54,337
resolution 16x9 in 1920 by 24p.

423
00:23:56,236 --> 00:23:57,168
Wow.

424
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:58,410
Yeah, just gotta say,

425
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:02,691
none of what you just said
made any sense at all.

426
00:24:06,867 --> 00:24:08,973
Wait, so you're telling me

427
00:24:09,007 --> 00:24:11,665
that you tried to learn
about modern electronics

428
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,771
in a printed volume?

429
00:24:13,805 --> 00:24:15,876
What's wrong with a book?

430
00:24:15,911 --> 00:24:17,568
Mm, lots of books.

431
00:24:17,602 --> 00:24:19,570
You didn't even start
with Google? Come on.

432
00:24:19,604 --> 00:24:22,400
Would you look at
this stuff? It's old.

433
00:24:22,434 --> 00:24:24,298
Okay. But it's not that old.

434
00:24:25,161 --> 00:24:26,922
It's just specialized.

435
00:24:26,956 --> 00:24:29,165
Like, really specialized.

436
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:31,858
Honestly, I'm not even sure

437
00:24:31,892 --> 00:24:34,101
if you could find what
you're looking for on Google.

438
00:24:35,517 --> 00:24:37,356
Are you saying the exact
thing you just suggested

439
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,106
would not have even worked?

440
00:24:39,141 --> 00:24:42,213
What I'm saying is
it's a craft, you know?

441
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:43,594
It's its own craft.

442
00:24:43,628 --> 00:24:46,493
And I spent four years
learning this stuff in college,

443
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:49,047
and you thought that you
were gonna cram it all in

444
00:24:49,082 --> 00:24:50,532
in an all-nighter.

445
00:24:50,566 --> 00:24:52,810
Some of us like to get
a head start, okay?

446
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,329
Whatever. Let's just start now.

447
00:24:57,366 --> 00:24:58,470
Okay.

448
00:24:58,505 --> 00:25:00,438
So live switching.

449
00:25:00,472 --> 00:25:01,957
Yes, live switching.

450
00:25:01,991 --> 00:25:03,096
I remember that.

451
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,615
Yeah.

452
00:25:04,649 --> 00:25:06,769
So I bet you're looking for
a great big switch, right?

453
00:25:07,963 --> 00:25:08,963
Yeah.

454
00:25:11,829 --> 00:25:14,210
Of course. Mouse clicks.

455
00:25:14,245 --> 00:25:15,384
Mm-hmm.

456
00:25:15,418 --> 00:25:17,006
Because everything's
a computer now.

457
00:25:17,041 --> 00:25:18,249
- Yeah- - Okay.

458
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:20,182
Even airplanes are
great big computers now.

459
00:25:22,391 --> 00:25:24,255
Now you're just being mean.

460
00:26:07,194 --> 00:26:09,127
Uh-uh. No, no way.

461
00:26:09,162 --> 00:26:11,026
Yes. Yes you did.

462
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,199
You missed that cue.

463
00:26:12,234 --> 00:26:13,822
Oh, 'cause you miscued me.

464
00:26:13,856 --> 00:26:17,377
I did miscue you once,
but it was not that time.

465
00:26:17,411 --> 00:26:19,621
Right, so if I can't
trust your cues,

466
00:26:19,655 --> 00:26:20,943
I have to figure
them out on my own.

467
00:26:20,967 --> 00:26:22,554
You're getting
hung up on one cue.

468
00:26:22,589 --> 00:26:23,728
You said so yourself,

469
00:26:23,763 --> 00:26:25,799
there's no second
takes when you're live.

470
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,145
Hey, love birds.

471
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:30,459
We've got "Miles
Gloriosus" back in an hour.

472
00:26:30,493 --> 00:26:31,771
Get ready for showtime.

473
00:26:35,567 --> 00:26:36,567
Showtime.

474
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:38,398
Hmm.

475
00:26:38,432 --> 00:26:40,883
Well, what can we come up with?

476
00:26:42,264 --> 00:26:43,584
You're seriously
trying to tell me

477
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:46,302
that you wanna do a
zoom-to-medium closeup

478
00:26:46,337 --> 00:26:47,925
in the middle of camera two?

479
00:26:47,959 --> 00:26:49,754
Yes. Yes, it's perfect.

480
00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:51,825
Read the script. It's
the exact right moment.

481
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,378
I've read the script and no,

482
00:26:53,413 --> 00:26:55,933
you still understand nothing
about screen grammar.

483
00:26:55,967 --> 00:26:58,763
Oh, please. To heck
with the screen grammar.

484
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:00,109
Ride the fricking moment.

485
00:27:00,144 --> 00:27:01,559
What do you mean by the moment?

486
00:27:01,593 --> 00:27:02,491
- I mean- - There's a formula.

487
00:27:02,525 --> 00:27:03,803
- Ride the- - You follow it.

488
00:27:03,837 --> 00:27:05,390
The screen grammar is important.

489
00:27:05,425 --> 00:27:06,678
- I don't know why.
- I've been doing this

490
00:27:06,702 --> 00:27:08,014
- way longer than you.
- Oh,

491
00:27:08,048 --> 00:27:09,267
- here we go again with that.
- So let's go.

492
00:27:09,291 --> 00:27:10,706
Let's not forget,

493
00:27:10,741 --> 00:27:11,890
you wouldn't even be
here if it wasn't for me.

494
00:27:11,914 --> 00:27:13,157
Mm-hmm.

495
00:27:13,191 --> 00:27:15,780
Okay, first of
all, a little low.

496
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,096
I am telling you she is
not at Haggle's anymore.

497
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:24,582
Now, I know somebody in this
town knows where she's working.

498
00:27:24,616 --> 00:27:26,135
You stop putting me off.

499
00:27:28,137 --> 00:27:31,796
Don't give me that,
wouldn't hire her crap.

500
00:27:31,831 --> 00:27:34,834
They'd be idiots not to hire
her. They'd all be idiots.

501
00:27:34,868 --> 00:27:36,318
And they're even bigger idiots

502
00:27:36,352 --> 00:27:38,389
if they think they can
hide her beneath a bushel.

503
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:40,667
Now, do you have some more
news for me, or do you not?

504
00:27:43,256 --> 00:27:44,775
Yeah, that's what I thought.

505
00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:46,569
Enjoy the coal in your stocking.

506
00:27:49,262 --> 00:27:50,850
And that wraps up our showing

507
00:27:50,884 --> 00:27:53,991
of one of the most holly-jolliest
movies of all time.

508
00:27:54,025 --> 00:27:56,545
Doesn't it just warm
your heart folks?

509
00:27:56,579 --> 00:27:58,064
I watch that one

510
00:27:58,098 --> 00:28:01,619
and I just want to go to
sleep smiling every time.

511
00:28:01,653 --> 00:28:04,449
We'll be back next week with
another "Holly Jolly Hour"

512
00:28:04,484 --> 00:28:07,107
that will bring your whole
family together once more.

513
00:28:07,142 --> 00:28:10,076
I would like to thank
everyone here at KPRP

514
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:13,320
for making this possible,
including Claire Rubin,

515
00:28:13,355 --> 00:28:17,117
our everything that needs
done, she does it person.

516
00:28:17,152 --> 00:28:21,777
And we got Declan
Riordan, our producer.

517
00:28:21,812 --> 00:28:23,503
I'll give you something
to be thankful for

518
00:28:23,537 --> 00:28:24,987
you holly jolly son-of-a-

519
00:28:25,022 --> 00:28:29,543
And new on the team, June
Schroeder.

520
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:35,135
Oh, it's our most wonderful
time of the year, folks.

521
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,004
What are you grateful for?

522
00:28:45,007 --> 00:28:46,698
KPRP Public
Television, how can I-

523
00:28:46,733 --> 00:28:49,218
Is this how you treat
all your important calls?

524
00:28:51,013 --> 00:28:52,359
Excuse me?

525
00:28:52,394 --> 00:28:54,085
Yeah. Well, don't
worry about it.

526
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,398
Nobody's any better these days.

527
00:28:56,432 --> 00:28:58,331
Just gimme the man in charge.

528
00:28:58,365 --> 00:29:01,437
- The what?
- The man in charge.

529
00:29:01,472 --> 00:29:04,544
You think I got all day to
fuel your office gossip?

530
00:29:07,236 --> 00:29:08,444
Whom shall I say his calling?

531
00:29:08,479 --> 00:29:10,412
John Schroeder.

532
00:29:10,446 --> 00:29:13,518
Yeah, that's right,
the John Schroeder.

533
00:29:13,553 --> 00:29:14,554
Schroeder?

534
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:16,107
Yeah.

535
00:29:16,142 --> 00:29:18,627
I bet you regret dragging
your feet now, don't you?

536
00:29:18,661 --> 00:29:20,629
Well, nevermind.

537
00:29:20,663 --> 00:29:22,113
Just gimme the man in charge

538
00:29:22,148 --> 00:29:24,357
and we can forget your
little fit ever happened.

539
00:29:26,877 --> 00:29:28,223
One moment, please, sir.

540
00:29:32,089 --> 00:29:33,089
June?!

541
00:29:34,677 --> 00:29:36,541
Oh, no. No, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

542
00:29:38,095 --> 00:29:40,062
So you do know him?

543
00:29:40,097 --> 00:29:42,858
How did he find out
I'm working here?

544
00:29:42,893 --> 00:29:44,066
You told him.

545
00:29:44,101 --> 00:29:45,147
Hey, I don't even know the guy.

546
00:29:46,172 --> 00:29:47,242
Family?

547
00:29:48,588 --> 00:29:50,417
He's my dad.

548
00:29:50,452 --> 00:29:53,144
Your dad.

549
00:29:53,179 --> 00:29:55,664
The John Schroeder is your dad.

550
00:29:55,698 --> 00:29:57,735
Oh, so now you know him.

551
00:29:57,769 --> 00:29:59,185
Well, we know of him.

552
00:29:59,219 --> 00:30:01,083
He's kind of famous.

553
00:30:01,118 --> 00:30:02,705
Guy like that,

554
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:05,847
he could make all of our problems
disappear with one pledge.

555
00:30:06,951 --> 00:30:10,023
He's not
calling to pledge.

556
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,405
- He's calling to buy.
- Buy what?

557
00:30:12,439 --> 00:30:13,820
Everything. Everything.

558
00:30:13,855 --> 00:30:15,270
It doesn't matter.

559
00:30:15,304 --> 00:30:17,686
The station, everything
in it, you, me, him.

560
00:30:18,445 --> 00:30:19,930
And he does realize

561
00:30:19,964 --> 00:30:22,044
that's not something that
can actually happen, right?

562
00:30:24,313 --> 00:30:25,313
That's true.

563
00:30:26,626 --> 00:30:28,811
That's true. That that can't
actually happen, right Claire?

564
00:30:28,835 --> 00:30:30,606
But please tell me that
can't actually happen.

565
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:32,390
No. No, it can't.

566
00:30:32,425 --> 00:30:34,185
Charter's not set up that way.

567
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,119
Although, he could
push for a few things

568
00:30:37,154 --> 00:30:39,397
in exchange for a
large enough pledge.

569
00:30:39,432 --> 00:30:41,192
But even then
there'd be pushback.

570
00:30:43,885 --> 00:30:46,266
He's not gonna settle
for less than everything.

571
00:30:47,819 --> 00:30:49,936
So you're saying there's no
point in making nice with him

572
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,099
and hoping he'll pledge?

573
00:30:55,586 --> 00:30:56,586
Pity.

574
00:30:57,657 --> 00:31:00,384
Just please don't
make me talk to him.

575
00:31:06,459 --> 00:31:10,014
What?

576
00:31:10,049 --> 00:31:12,465
- Okay, moving on.
- Yeah.

577
00:31:12,499 --> 00:31:13,776
- Stress ball.
- No.

578
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:15,916
Yes.

579
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,034
Hello.

580
00:31:30,069 --> 00:31:31,277
And thank you for calling

581
00:31:31,311 --> 00:31:33,244
the voice activated
answering service

582
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:36,144
for KPRP Public Television.

583
00:31:36,178 --> 00:31:39,802
Please state the name of
the person you wish to call.

584
00:31:39,837 --> 00:31:41,114
You want me to what?

585
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,288
I'm sorry.

586
00:31:42,322 --> 00:31:44,152
I don't understand that command.

587
00:31:44,186 --> 00:31:46,775
Please state the name of
the person you wish to call.

588
00:31:46,809 --> 00:31:48,639
Just get me the front desk.

589
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:51,435
I'm sorry, I don't
understand that command.

590
00:31:51,469 --> 00:31:53,644
Please state the name of
the person you wish to-

591
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:55,404
Front desk!

592
00:31:55,439 --> 00:31:58,131
I'm sorry, I don't
understand that command.

593
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,339
Please state the name of-

594
00:31:59,374 --> 00:32:01,169
Front desk! Front
desk, already.

595
00:32:01,203 --> 00:32:02,964
Front desk.

596
00:32:02,998 --> 00:32:04,206
At the sound with the tone,

597
00:32:04,241 --> 00:32:07,416
the time will be 10
minutes past the hour.

598
00:32:07,451 --> 00:32:10,074
Finally, something diff-

599
00:32:10,109 --> 00:32:11,282
Wait, what?

600
00:32:11,317 --> 00:32:13,146
Would you like to take
this brief survey?

601
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:16,184
No, don't
do this to me.

602
00:32:16,218 --> 00:32:18,807
It's been years since I've
been in phone tree purgatory.

603
00:32:18,841 --> 00:32:21,154
You've just qualified
for an exciting offer.

604
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:25,296
Front desk, you stupid miserable
piece of silicon trash.

605
00:32:25,331 --> 00:32:26,573
What's so hard about that?

606
00:32:26,608 --> 00:32:29,956
Just get me the stupid
stinking front desk.

607
00:32:29,991 --> 00:32:32,510
Have you considered
switching wireless carriers?

608
00:32:32,545 --> 00:32:33,373
Ah!

609
00:32:33,408 --> 00:32:35,099
Front desk. Front desk.

610
00:32:35,134 --> 00:32:36,721
If you don't gimme
the front desk,

611
00:32:36,756 --> 00:32:38,758
I will leave you for
hobos on skid row.

612
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:40,553
Please enter the
last four digits of

613
00:32:40,587 --> 00:32:43,970
- your social security number.
- Ah!

614
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:49,010
Just get lost, you stupid,
stinking pile of transistors.

615
00:32:49,044 --> 00:32:52,323
Just get lost and, and goodbye.

616
00:32:52,358 --> 00:32:54,394
Goodbye. And get lost too.

617
00:32:59,434 --> 00:33:04,301
Hello, you
have an important reminder.

618
00:33:15,484 --> 00:33:17,003
All right, Miss Radio Voice.

619
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:18,246
Show your darn face

620
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,282
before I waylay your
boss on his way home.

621
00:33:21,835 --> 00:33:23,458
Whom shall
I say is calling?

622
00:33:23,492 --> 00:33:24,907
You know who's here.

623
00:33:24,942 --> 00:33:26,771
I told you once,
I told you twice,

624
00:33:26,806 --> 00:33:29,636
and I ain't gonna tell you
a darn thing ever again.

625
00:33:29,671 --> 00:33:31,811
Well, thank
goodness for that.

626
00:33:31,845 --> 00:33:32,743
Have a good day, sir.

627
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:34,331
Wait, what? No, hold on.

628
00:33:34,365 --> 00:33:35,987
Hold on. Get back on here.

629
00:33:36,022 --> 00:33:38,197
You miserable,
little minimum wage-

630
00:33:38,231 --> 00:33:39,784
Excuse me.

631
00:33:41,131 --> 00:33:43,340
Claire, sweetie. Guess who?

632
00:33:45,583 --> 00:33:47,378
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

633
00:33:47,413 --> 00:33:49,794
Where do you think
you're going, beautiful.

634
00:33:49,829 --> 00:33:51,831
This is a closed set.

635
00:33:51,865 --> 00:33:53,729
Yeah, you
try and talk smart to me

636
00:33:53,764 --> 00:33:56,111
after I get a
signature on these.

637
00:33:56,146 --> 00:33:57,146
Oh, those.

638
00:33:57,975 --> 00:33:58,975
Oh, of course.

639
00:34:00,564 --> 00:34:04,740
Always have time for my
fans, even the noisy ones.

640
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:09,676
And remember, if you're
going scalp these,

641
00:34:09,711 --> 00:34:11,816
don't settle for
less than a grand.

642
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:22,413
- Hello, darling.
- Hello.

643
00:34:22,448 --> 00:34:25,209
- You look ravishing today.
- Well, thank you.

644
00:34:25,244 --> 00:34:26,797
How are you Charmer?

645
00:34:28,143 --> 00:34:29,455
We're late. We're late again.

646
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:30,559
And I am not the reason.

647
00:34:30,594 --> 00:34:31,802
Um, yes, you are.

648
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:33,873
And you're not about to
pin this on me, okay?

649
00:34:33,907 --> 00:34:35,737
All right. Pardon
me, Mr. Leech.

650
00:34:35,771 --> 00:34:38,326
Declan here was just having
some technical difficulties

651
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,328
- at his workstation.
- Oh, pardon me, Mr. Leech,

652
00:34:40,362 --> 00:34:41,960
but it seems that June
here has forgotten

653
00:34:41,984 --> 00:34:43,883
how to format a shooting script,

654
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:46,161
which as you know, is very
important for her job.

655
00:34:46,196 --> 00:34:48,129
Okay, well, pardon
me, Mr. Leech,

656
00:34:48,163 --> 00:34:51,097
Declan has forgotten how
to stick to a call time.

657
00:34:51,132 --> 00:34:52,443
Shall we head for makeup?

658
00:34:52,478 --> 00:34:55,101
By which I mean make
up for his delays.

659
00:34:55,136 --> 00:34:56,723
What she's saying
is absolutely false.

660
00:34:56,758 --> 00:34:57,976
I've never missed a
call time, Mr. Leech.

661
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,725
- Don't listen to him.
- But come with us.

662
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,416
We gotta go, okay?

663
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:00,417
Bye Claire.

664
00:35:00,451 --> 00:35:01,659
- I understand-
- Listen to me-

665
00:35:01,694 --> 00:35:03,120
that call times are of
the utmost importance

666
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:04,638
- Call time is very important-
- And treating you like

667
00:35:04,662 --> 00:35:09,253
- a star is what really matters.
- As you well know from your-

668
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,986
You got another one of those?

669
00:35:26,684 --> 00:35:29,342
I mean, he doesn't
honestly think

670
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,551
that "The Wizard of
Oz" switched to color

671
00:35:31,586 --> 00:35:33,450
because they ran out of
black and white film.

672
00:35:33,484 --> 00:35:34,484
Does he?

673
00:35:36,453 --> 00:35:40,077
Honestly, who can
say.

674
00:35:40,111 --> 00:35:41,111
Oh. Gimme that.

675
00:35:46,704 --> 00:35:50,432
I mean, we didn't
always do this right?

676
00:35:50,467 --> 00:35:52,434
Just give some loud mouth

677
00:35:52,469 --> 00:35:55,851
a permanent platform
to spout lunacy from?

678
00:35:55,886 --> 00:35:58,371
Because if I wanted that,
I could just call home.

679
00:36:00,442 --> 00:36:01,442
No.

680
00:36:02,686 --> 00:36:05,102
No. This place
used to have a rep.

681
00:36:05,136 --> 00:36:06,586
Good one.

682
00:36:08,864 --> 00:36:11,177
Award-winning programs,

683
00:36:11,212 --> 00:36:13,352
valuable community
institutions, all that.

684
00:36:14,974 --> 00:36:16,838
You can't tell from
looking around today.

685
00:36:16,872 --> 00:36:19,565
Dumped all the archives just
before I got here. So...

686
00:36:26,606 --> 00:36:27,676
All of them?

687
00:36:54,393 --> 00:36:55,911
What are those?

688
00:36:57,637 --> 00:36:58,637
Legacy.

689
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
We made that?

690
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,696
We used to every year.

691
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:25,631
One Christmas spectacular
was all we needed

692
00:37:25,665 --> 00:37:30,325
and then we'd get in enough
pledges for the next 12 months.

693
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:35,330
Local history, local
politics, documentaries,

694
00:37:36,435 --> 00:37:37,919
the stuff that
made a difference.

695
00:37:38,989 --> 00:37:40,439
Why'd you stop?

696
00:37:40,473 --> 00:37:42,855
The board wanted to go edgy.

697
00:37:42,889 --> 00:37:45,927
Thought these fancy
concerts were too expensive.

698
00:37:45,961 --> 00:37:49,310
Wanted to cut it to the
bone and do more with less.

699
00:37:50,414 --> 00:37:52,761
Instead, we ended up
doing less with less.

700
00:37:52,796 --> 00:37:54,729
And now we're doing
next to nothing.

701
00:37:56,455 --> 00:37:58,491
So where's the board now?

702
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,010
Where do you think?

703
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:02,530
Bailed once they realized
how badly they'd screwed up,

704
00:38:02,564 --> 00:38:05,843
and believe me, nobody was
volunteering to replace them.

705
00:38:10,192 --> 00:38:12,402
Well, let's do one
of these again.

706
00:38:15,232 --> 00:38:17,717
Oh, come on. How hard can it be?

707
00:38:17,752 --> 00:38:19,167
"How hard can it be?"

708
00:38:19,201 --> 00:38:21,100
"How hard can it be?" she says.

709
00:38:22,481 --> 00:38:27,037
Sweetie, we earned those 12
months every single time.

710
00:38:28,141 --> 00:38:29,073
Do you have any
idea what it takes

711
00:38:29,108 --> 00:38:31,144
to stage a show like that?

712
00:38:31,179 --> 00:38:32,767
No. So tell me.

713
00:38:32,801 --> 00:38:33,975
My word.

714
00:38:36,011 --> 00:38:38,980
Multiple cameras,
live switching,

715
00:38:39,014 --> 00:38:42,224
on location, music clearances.

716
00:38:42,259 --> 00:38:44,675
Kept the lawyers busy for weeks.

717
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:47,195
Plus, it looks like we
always had a star name

718
00:38:47,229 --> 00:38:48,472
to host the show.

719
00:38:48,507 --> 00:38:50,025
That's right.

720
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,959
Star power or the closest
thing to it at this level.

721
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:57,343
Mayor, some big news
anchor, somebody.

722
00:38:57,378 --> 00:39:01,036
And who is gonna give
us the time of day now?

723
00:39:01,071 --> 00:39:03,970
Plus we don't have much
time to work with anyway.

724
00:39:04,005 --> 00:39:06,041
Christmas is practically here.

725
00:39:06,076 --> 00:39:07,733
So let's do it next Christmas.

726
00:39:07,767 --> 00:39:10,598
No, there is no next year.

727
00:39:10,632 --> 00:39:12,531
We've got a mortgage
on this dump

728
00:39:12,565 --> 00:39:16,120
and we have burned through
every trick for putting it off.

729
00:39:16,155 --> 00:39:19,986
Either we come up with a huge
chunk of change by New Year's,

730
00:39:20,021 --> 00:39:25,060
or we go dark for the
first time in five decades.

731
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:26,717
New Year's?

732
00:39:26,752 --> 00:39:28,409
It's a hard deadline?

733
00:39:29,479 --> 00:39:30,687
As hard as they come.

734
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:36,865
Do you two want to be employed
after the balloon drop?

735
00:39:40,869 --> 00:39:43,424
Get that man to pledge.

736
00:39:55,332 --> 00:39:56,332
New Year's.

737
00:39:58,162 --> 00:39:59,162
Yeah.

738
00:40:00,717 --> 00:40:02,097
You got any bright ideas?

739
00:40:06,274 --> 00:40:09,277
Well, he's already
paying this much

740
00:40:09,311 --> 00:40:10,658
to see us squabble, right?

741
00:40:12,073 --> 00:40:13,419
Let's kick it up a notch.

742
00:40:14,938 --> 00:40:16,457
Kick it up.

743
00:40:16,491 --> 00:40:17,837
Play for blood.

744
00:40:17,872 --> 00:40:19,736
So far we've been pretty nice.

745
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:21,358
I don't think we've
been very nice.

746
00:40:21,392 --> 00:40:23,256
There are definitely
places you could've gone

747
00:40:23,291 --> 00:40:25,396
and you didn't
because you're nice.

748
00:40:26,432 --> 00:40:27,329
Face it.

749
00:40:27,364 --> 00:40:29,573
Nice, just won't do it anymore.

750
00:40:29,608 --> 00:40:32,334
Well, June, I, I just don't
think it's a very good-

751
00:40:32,369 --> 00:40:34,026
Daddy issues. Hit
me with those.

752
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:36,407
You'll have material for days.

753
00:40:36,442 --> 00:40:37,833
Okay, come on now, gimme
something I can work with.

754
00:40:37,857 --> 00:40:39,100
June, seriously?

755
00:40:39,134 --> 00:40:40,353
- I don't think it's-
- Declan, you've seen

756
00:40:40,377 --> 00:40:41,897
what I go back to if
I can't stay here.

757
00:40:47,626 --> 00:40:51,422
If you can't do it for the
station, then do it for me.

758
00:41:00,328 --> 00:41:02,848
Open the door. I got
your heart's desire.

759
00:41:02,882 --> 00:41:04,273
You brought
George Clooney?

760
00:41:04,297 --> 00:41:07,404
Oh wait, no, I...

761
00:41:15,308 --> 00:41:17,587
I bring you nectar and ambrosia.

762
00:41:19,278 --> 00:41:21,798
That's a terrible
name for a rock band.

763
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,432
I bring you the glorious
wines of nature.

764
00:41:35,466 --> 00:41:37,261
If those
weren't metaphorical,

765
00:41:37,296 --> 00:41:38,573
you might've stood a chance.

766
00:41:38,608 --> 00:41:39,919
Wait. I, I would?

767
00:41:42,508 --> 00:41:43,508
Ah!

768
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,532
Hey, Big John.

769
00:42:08,189 --> 00:42:09,189
Whoa.

770
00:42:11,192 --> 00:42:13,677
Clean up on aisle five.

771
00:42:13,712 --> 00:42:15,265
What in the world was...

772
00:42:16,715 --> 00:42:19,165
You hog!

773
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,167
It's not even nine
o'clock in the morning.

774
00:42:21,202 --> 00:42:22,099
You get a off this property.

775
00:42:22,134 --> 00:42:23,756
- Ah!
- Get, get, get!

776
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:26,759
Oh, Cary dear.

777
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:29,969
- I'm so sorry about that.
- Oh, no worries.

778
00:42:30,004 --> 00:42:32,109
I know this is a
good neighborhood.

779
00:42:32,144 --> 00:42:34,008
Well, usually.

780
00:42:44,674 --> 00:42:45,674
So.

781
00:42:46,468 --> 00:42:47,468
So?

782
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:50,333
So.

783
00:42:51,888 --> 00:42:53,683
That's your idea?

784
00:42:53,717 --> 00:42:56,306
You can feel free to start
praising it at any time.

785
00:42:57,790 --> 00:43:01,242
We've got our biggest name
talent sitting right over there

786
00:43:01,276 --> 00:43:03,658
and you wanna shoot him
like a '90s talk show.

787
00:43:03,693 --> 00:43:06,385
Yeah. That was a great
era of television.

788
00:43:06,419 --> 00:43:08,767
That was almost
older than you are.

789
00:43:08,801 --> 00:43:10,113
Who is gonna watch that?

790
00:43:10,147 --> 00:43:12,149
Oh, I don't know. Everyone.

791
00:43:12,184 --> 00:43:14,738
This is television.
There is no everyone.

792
00:43:15,601 --> 00:43:16,671
What group?

793
00:43:16,706 --> 00:43:18,052
Which age?

794
00:43:18,086 --> 00:43:21,572
Kids, parents, grandparents,
everyone in between.

795
00:43:21,607 --> 00:43:23,333
Okay? People crave this stuff.

796
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:25,991
Families don't watch
things together anymore.

797
00:43:26,025 --> 00:43:27,337
What century are you from?

798
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:29,684
They can, they can.

799
00:43:29,719 --> 00:43:31,237
And they do.

800
00:43:31,272 --> 00:43:34,620
- Name one. Name one family.
- I'll give you one family.

801
00:43:34,655 --> 00:43:37,312
- Mine.
- Yeah. One weird family.

802
00:43:37,347 --> 00:43:40,212
Yeah. We
were weird, all right.

803
00:43:40,246 --> 00:43:43,733
Me, Mom, and a jar of
ashes on the mantle

804
00:43:43,767 --> 00:43:44,872
that used to be Dad.

805
00:43:46,045 --> 00:43:48,634
Car accident, in case
you were wondering.

806
00:43:48,669 --> 00:43:50,498
Oh, I was four, by the way

807
00:43:50,532 --> 00:43:52,431
and Mom had to keep working.

808
00:43:52,465 --> 00:43:54,916
So the time that
we spent together

809
00:43:54,951 --> 00:43:57,712
was mostly watching
KPRP kids programs

810
00:43:57,747 --> 00:43:58,748
early in the morning.

811
00:43:59,956 --> 00:44:01,785
That's what we
did together most.

812
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:03,856
So, yeah, we watched it.

813
00:44:04,995 --> 00:44:07,032
And lots of us still would.

814
00:44:07,066 --> 00:44:09,482
Don't you dare think otherwise.

815
00:44:11,726 --> 00:44:14,142
Come on, don't let him win.

816
00:44:18,353 --> 00:44:19,838
What if I said you were lucky?

817
00:44:19,872 --> 00:44:22,772
- Lucky?
- Lucky.

818
00:44:22,806 --> 00:44:24,187
At least your mom
cared about you.

819
00:44:24,221 --> 00:44:25,153
At least she didn't leave.

820
00:44:25,188 --> 00:44:26,672
She left every single day.

821
00:44:26,707 --> 00:44:29,399
And came back. Not
everyone's does.

822
00:44:30,503 --> 00:44:32,505
So what do you
think of that? Huh?

823
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,438
What have we got
for kids like that?

824
00:44:34,473 --> 00:44:37,614
Uh, June, your dad stuck around.

825
00:44:37,648 --> 00:44:39,581
Yeah, sure. He stuck around.

826
00:44:39,616 --> 00:44:40,928
At least his face did.

827
00:44:40,962 --> 00:44:42,377
His brain? Gone.

828
00:44:42,412 --> 00:44:43,654
Always somewhere else.

829
00:44:43,689 --> 00:44:46,554
At the office, around
the globe, just gone.

830
00:44:46,588 --> 00:44:48,497
At least when your mom was
with you, she was present.

831
00:44:48,521 --> 00:44:50,592
Don't you dare start
making comparisons, okay?

832
00:44:50,627 --> 00:44:52,560
At least your dad is alive.

833
00:44:52,594 --> 00:44:54,700
I would've swapped.
You get that?

834
00:44:54,735 --> 00:44:57,047
There are times I
would've swapped.

835
00:44:57,082 --> 00:44:58,576
At least you know your dad
didn't wanna leave you.

836
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,983
June! You...

837
00:45:08,852 --> 00:45:09,852
Say it.

838
00:45:10,854 --> 00:45:13,167
Whatever it is, just say it.

839
00:45:13,201 --> 00:45:14,685
Say it, say it.

840
00:45:21,382 --> 00:45:23,280
If you were like
this all the time,

841
00:45:24,765 --> 00:45:26,076
I can definitely see why.

842
00:45:30,771 --> 00:45:33,152
- Ah, June.
- What did you say?

843
00:45:35,534 --> 00:45:36,777
What did you say?

844
00:45:39,262 --> 00:45:42,748
I was seven. Seven.

845
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,785
What seven-year-old
deserves that?

846
00:45:45,889 --> 00:45:48,892
To have her mom walk out
and her dad checkout.

847
00:45:49,893 --> 00:45:51,205
And it never stopped.

848
00:45:51,239 --> 00:45:53,690
Not in middle school,
not in high school,

849
00:45:53,724 --> 00:45:55,934
not even graduating
with fricking honors.

850
00:45:55,968 --> 00:45:57,418
Not for one second

851
00:45:57,452 --> 00:45:59,765
was I ever more important
than a line on a spreadsheet.

852
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:03,734
And you wanna know
the worst part?

853
00:46:03,769 --> 00:46:07,946
He paid to keep me so
I felt like I owed him.

854
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:10,086
Like it was some kind of
debt I had to pay back.

855
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,432
You think student loans are bad?

856
00:46:11,466 --> 00:46:13,158
Try having to pay
back a debt like that.

857
00:46:13,192 --> 00:46:14,573
So don't you try and tell me

858
00:46:14,607 --> 00:46:16,333
that I had it any
better than you.

859
00:46:18,335 --> 00:46:21,649
I'm sorry your dad
is gone. I really am.

860
00:46:23,168 --> 00:46:24,894
But at least he
didn't hang around

861
00:46:24,928 --> 00:46:27,103
making whatever
problems you had worse.

862
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:34,455
What a scene. Ha!

863
00:46:34,489 --> 00:46:36,595
What a scene.

864
00:46:36,629 --> 00:46:38,735
I don't have a check
big enough for that one.

865
00:46:38,769 --> 00:46:41,703
I'm serious. I don't
have a check big enough.

866
00:46:43,015 --> 00:46:44,741
I need to go talk
to some people.

867
00:46:45,949 --> 00:46:46,949
Too much?

868
00:46:51,713 --> 00:46:53,992
Nah. That's not too much.

869
00:46:58,789 --> 00:47:00,343
Now, just gimme a few days.

870
00:47:00,377 --> 00:47:02,621
A few days. No more.

871
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:04,830
And you'll be hearing
from everyone.

872
00:47:04,865 --> 00:47:06,521
Everyone.

873
00:47:06,556 --> 00:47:08,489
Oh, and this time,

874
00:47:08,523 --> 00:47:12,700
don't forget what a shooting
script is, huh?

875
00:47:14,391 --> 00:47:15,391
Whew.

876
00:47:25,816 --> 00:47:26,990
June, hey, are you okay?

877
00:47:27,025 --> 00:47:27,646
Look, I, I know what
I said was just-

878
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,440
No, I'm fine.

879
00:47:28,474 --> 00:47:29,993
I'm, really, I'm fine.

880
00:47:31,581 --> 00:47:32,996
Just, we got it, right?

881
00:47:33,031 --> 00:47:36,034
Come on, please
tell me we got it.

882
00:47:36,068 --> 00:47:37,104
We got it.

883
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:42,764
Yes.

884
00:47:42,799 --> 00:47:45,664
Excuse me. I think
your Uber is elsewhere.

885
00:47:45,698 --> 00:47:47,977
You are a callous, rude,

886
00:47:48,011 --> 00:47:50,117
mean little excuse
for a thespian.

887
00:47:50,151 --> 00:47:52,291
Whoa, I've had some
bad reviews before,

888
00:47:52,326 --> 00:47:54,880
but that was a little over
the top, don't you think?

889
00:47:54,915 --> 00:47:56,778
You think this is
Hollywood? Huh?

890
00:47:56,813 --> 00:47:59,402
You think you can just
walk away from anything?

891
00:47:59,436 --> 00:48:02,232
Because, because you're
the big-shot star.

892
00:48:02,267 --> 00:48:03,451
There's no stunt
double out here.

893
00:48:03,475 --> 00:48:05,477
There's no one to
take the fall for you.

894
00:48:06,478 --> 00:48:08,307
Can you cry on cue?

895
00:48:08,342 --> 00:48:09,481
Huh?

896
00:48:09,515 --> 00:48:11,828
- Can you cry on cue?
- Yes. Yes.

897
00:48:11,862 --> 00:48:13,347
Good.

898
00:48:13,381 --> 00:48:15,556
Because if you ever make
my little girl cry again,

899
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:18,490
you're not only gonna cry on
cue, you're gonna cry off cue

900
00:48:18,524 --> 00:48:20,664
and for the entire running time,

901
00:48:20,699 --> 00:48:24,013
you fourth-rate, Z-grade

902
00:48:24,047 --> 00:48:26,360
certified-farm-fresh,
organic actor.

903
00:48:26,394 --> 00:48:28,983
Whoa.

904
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,168
I felt it.

905
00:48:42,997 --> 00:48:44,205
I really felt it.

906
00:48:45,896 --> 00:48:46,897
I did it.

907
00:48:50,832 --> 00:48:51,832
You did what?

908
00:48:54,215 --> 00:48:57,839
- Um...
- You did what?

909
00:48:57,874 --> 00:48:59,634
Oh my God, I can't believe this.

910
00:48:59,669 --> 00:49:01,267
Just when I thought you'd
finally run out of ways

911
00:49:01,291 --> 00:49:02,741
to royally screw up my life,

912
00:49:02,775 --> 00:49:04,674
you go and invent
a totally new one.

913
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:06,365
Hey, I'm just trying to help.

914
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,091
Trying and failing.

915
00:49:08,126 --> 00:49:11,232
Do you get that last
part, Dad? Failing.

916
00:49:11,267 --> 00:49:13,338
Look around and listen
for once in your life.

917
00:49:13,372 --> 00:49:15,961
Do I seem any happier when
you pull this stupid stuff?

918
00:49:15,996 --> 00:49:18,274
Well, maybe if you learned
a little gratitude.

919
00:49:18,308 --> 00:49:20,276
Gratitude? For what?

920
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:21,863
Do you think I was grateful

921
00:49:21,898 --> 00:49:24,556
for every day you spent
screaming on the phone

922
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:26,316
instead of being with me?

923
00:49:26,351 --> 00:49:28,767
Because whoever was on
the other end of the line

924
00:49:28,801 --> 00:49:30,907
was always more
important than me.

925
00:49:30,941 --> 00:49:33,427
Hey. I paid $3
million for you.

926
00:49:33,461 --> 00:49:35,498
Shut up about the
$3 million, Dad.

927
00:49:35,532 --> 00:49:37,362
You made that back in a month.

928
00:49:37,396 --> 00:49:39,812
You could've retired 15
years ago and you didn't

929
00:49:39,847 --> 00:49:41,883
because nothing is
as important to you

930
00:49:41,918 --> 00:49:45,404
as thinking that the sun doesn't
rise unless you crow at it.

931
00:49:45,439 --> 00:49:47,751
I gave you everything I could.

932
00:49:47,786 --> 00:49:50,754
Yeah, I
guess you did, Dad.

933
00:49:52,135 --> 00:49:53,792
Just not anything that mattered.

934
00:49:55,932 --> 00:49:58,452
- What do I need to do?
- Nothing. Nothing.

935
00:49:58,486 --> 00:50:00,281
Absolutely nothing.

936
00:50:00,316 --> 00:50:01,800
Just stop trying.

937
00:50:01,834 --> 00:50:05,010
That is the only way you'll
stop making things worse.

938
00:50:05,045 --> 00:50:06,563
But I gotta do something.

939
00:50:06,598 --> 00:50:08,082
Too late, Dad.

940
00:50:08,117 --> 00:50:11,120
Just, too late.

941
00:50:21,095 --> 00:50:22,407
So I take it we now know

942
00:50:22,441 --> 00:50:24,581
why Cary Leech
dropped off the map.

943
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,143
Okay. Yep.

944
00:50:34,177 --> 00:50:36,179
We're not gonna wallow
in our own pity here.

945
00:50:36,214 --> 00:50:38,285
So let's go.

946
00:50:39,493 --> 00:50:41,495
There's only one thing
that can fix this.

947
00:50:43,324 --> 00:50:44,324
Breakfast for dinner.

948
00:50:46,362 --> 00:50:47,362
Let's go.

949
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:49,572
Let's go, people.

950
00:50:49,606 --> 00:50:50,676
Andele. Get a move on.

951
00:51:03,655 --> 00:51:04,552
No, no, no.

952
00:51:04,587 --> 00:51:06,071
This is diet suicide.

953
00:51:06,106 --> 00:51:07,624
Look at this.

954
00:51:08,591 --> 00:51:09,591
I don't care.

955
00:51:14,804 --> 00:51:15,598
Can I have some of this?

956
00:51:15,632 --> 00:51:16,806
Syrup?

957
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,635
Okay. Young metabolisms.

958
00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:19,809
I'm in. Let's do this.

959
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:25,884
Oh my gosh.

960
00:51:27,437 --> 00:51:28,542
More bacon, anyone?

961
00:51:30,647 --> 00:51:31,890
Evil.

962
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:37,516
Mm!

963
00:51:37,551 --> 00:51:39,173
Better?

964
00:51:39,208 --> 00:51:42,211
I, I've never felt better
or worse in my life.

965
00:51:42,245 --> 00:51:43,557
Yeah, I hope you don't want

966
00:51:43,591 --> 00:51:45,248
a brainstorming
session right now,

967
00:51:45,283 --> 00:51:48,113
'cause I'm gonna be in a
gluttonous hangover until tomorrow.

968
00:51:48,148 --> 00:51:49,148
I wasn't.

969
00:51:50,288 --> 00:51:54,223
More of a glad to be
still alive session.

970
00:51:55,845 --> 00:51:57,605
It's the only place
that's open this early.

971
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:01,609
Early enough for my mom to
take me before her shifts.

972
00:52:03,232 --> 00:52:04,312
It's the only place
we ever ate out

973
00:52:04,336 --> 00:52:08,029
so it's a special place.

974
00:52:14,864 --> 00:52:15,864
Claire,

975
00:52:19,834 --> 00:52:21,664
we need to do the
Christmas concert.

976
00:52:22,596 --> 00:52:24,080
Interesting fantasy.

977
00:52:24,114 --> 00:52:26,186
I'm serious. We need to.

978
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:30,086
Well, the necessity's not
in question, only the means.

979
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,088
We'll think of something.

980
00:52:32,122 --> 00:52:33,193
That is not a plan.

981
00:52:34,021 --> 00:52:35,712
It's Christmas music, right?

982
00:52:35,747 --> 00:52:38,198
I mean, all that famous stuff
is already public domain.

983
00:52:38,232 --> 00:52:40,821
We can make a program
out of anything we want.

984
00:52:40,855 --> 00:52:43,651
Sure. But who's
gonna arrange it?

985
00:52:43,686 --> 00:52:45,964
More importantly,
who's gonna perform it?

986
00:52:45,998 --> 00:52:47,862
I don't know.
We'll find people.

987
00:52:47,897 --> 00:52:51,072
And we're right back
to, that is not a plan.

988
00:52:51,107 --> 00:52:52,626
This is TV. Okay?

989
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:55,594
And this is not crap
TV either. This is PBS.

990
00:52:55,629 --> 00:52:57,424
That has to mean something.

991
00:52:57,458 --> 00:52:59,667
Yeah, it means we're broke.

992
00:52:59,702 --> 00:53:03,844
It means they'll know we're
not solely about the money.

993
00:53:03,878 --> 00:53:04,948
Um, technically-

994
00:53:04,983 --> 00:53:06,674
- Shut up, Declan.
- Okay.

995
00:53:09,988 --> 00:53:13,060
You know what? Fine, fine.

996
00:53:13,094 --> 00:53:15,545
You wanna plan? Here's the plan.

997
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:17,098
I will find someone,

998
00:53:17,133 --> 00:53:19,549
you two can sit around in a
sugar coma for all I care.

999
00:53:19,584 --> 00:53:22,483
But I am betting
my entire salary,

1000
00:53:22,518 --> 00:53:24,313
which, is really not that much,

1001
00:53:24,347 --> 00:53:26,625
but I am betting
my entire salary

1002
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:28,386
that there is at least one,

1003
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:31,320
one really awesome
musician out there

1004
00:53:31,354 --> 00:53:33,874
who would cross
oceans to get on PBS.

1005
00:53:33,908 --> 00:53:34,908
Mm-hmm.

1006
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:38,464
For PBS!

1007
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:44,816
She's got a lot of energy today.

1008
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:47,370
No more coffee for
her.

1009
00:53:56,206 --> 00:53:58,554
Hello? Mr. Krauss.

1010
00:53:58,588 --> 00:54:00,349
I'm a
general music director!

1011
00:54:00,383 --> 00:54:02,005
Okay. I'm sorry.

1012
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,352
I'm sorry. Mr?

1013
00:54:03,386 --> 00:54:05,768
I'm a
general music director!

1014
00:54:05,802 --> 00:54:06,976
Wait, what was that?

1015
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,048
I'm a
general music director!

1016
00:54:10,082 --> 00:54:15,122
Okay, Mr. Aubur-general-music-director.

1017
00:54:16,434 --> 00:54:18,194
My name is June Schroeder

1018
00:54:18,228 --> 00:54:23,268
and I am a television producer
at KPRP Public Television.

1019
00:54:24,373 --> 00:54:27,030
And we would like to
put your choir on TV.

1020
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:32,967
Good morning, ma'am.
Hi. How are you?

1021
00:54:33,002 --> 00:54:36,868
We hear you lead the
best orchestra in-

1022
00:54:38,387 --> 00:54:39,284
Oh, no, no, ma'am.

1023
00:54:39,319 --> 00:54:40,906
I, I'm not selling insurance.

1024
00:54:40,941 --> 00:54:42,770
I'm with PBS.

1025
00:54:44,358 --> 00:54:48,155
No, not PS5, PBS.

1026
00:54:48,189 --> 00:54:51,089
I can't get you a PS5. Sorry.

1027
00:54:51,123 --> 00:54:52,953
Please, sir, I,
I have no control

1028
00:54:52,987 --> 00:54:56,163
over when they play the
Louis Valois Orchestra

1029
00:54:56,197 --> 00:54:57,958
and, and I really don't care-

1030
00:54:59,994 --> 00:55:03,032
No, sir, I have no idea what
he's like off the air. Mm-mm.

1031
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:05,793
Ma'am, I, I really
don't have a PS5.

1032
00:55:05,828 --> 00:55:07,450
Really sorry about that,

1033
00:55:07,485 --> 00:55:09,452
but what I wanted to
talk to you about is-

1034
00:55:10,971 --> 00:55:13,801
No. No, I am not hoarding
them to scalp on eBay.

1035
00:55:13,836 --> 00:55:15,285
Why would I do that?

1036
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:19,773
I have no idea what he
was like in music school.

1037
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:21,430
Nope. No.

1038
00:55:21,464 --> 00:55:22,362
Uh-uh.

1039
00:55:22,396 --> 00:55:24,640
Ma'am. Please.

1040
00:55:24,674 --> 00:55:28,402
I am a television
producer.

1041
00:55:28,437 --> 00:55:30,611
My buddy cannot get you a PS5

1042
00:55:30,646 --> 00:55:33,131
because I don't have
a buddy with a PS5.

1043
00:55:35,271 --> 00:55:37,066
You wanna know what
we're gonna do?

1044
00:55:38,999 --> 00:55:41,070
Here's what we're gonna do.

1045
00:55:41,104 --> 00:55:42,658
Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's right.

1046
00:55:44,004 --> 00:55:48,388
You and me. You and me,
Aubur-general-music-director.

1047
00:55:49,561 --> 00:55:53,945
We are gonna take
Louis Valois down.

1048
00:55:53,979 --> 00:55:58,570
You are right. I have PS5s.

1049
00:55:59,744 --> 00:56:04,058
I have so many PS5s.

1050
00:56:04,093 --> 00:56:06,060
I have despised him too.

1051
00:56:06,095 --> 00:56:08,477
Mm-hmm. Oh yeah.

1052
00:56:08,511 --> 00:56:11,134
With his waltzes and his fiddles

1053
00:56:11,169 --> 00:56:16,036
and his, his, um, mincing harps.

1054
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:19,453
It just started with
a few, you know,

1055
00:56:19,488 --> 00:56:22,974
and then I just, I
just couldn't stop.

1056
00:56:23,008 --> 00:56:27,116
Boxes and truckloads
and warehouses,

1057
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:30,153
filling up my garage,
the attic, the basement.

1058
00:56:30,188 --> 00:56:33,881
At last. I know how
to make him pay.

1059
00:56:33,916 --> 00:56:36,850
And only your talent
can do it.

1060
00:56:36,884 --> 00:56:39,611
I don't even know if my pets
are still alive in there.

1061
00:56:40,957 --> 00:56:45,548
Just lost. Lost in
all of my PS5s.

1062
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:49,897
Will you really
take that many PS5s?

1063
00:56:49,932 --> 00:56:52,521
Are you sure you can't take
more? Please take more?

1064
00:56:57,905 --> 00:56:59,182
Thank you.

1065
00:56:59,217 --> 00:57:02,116
Yes. We can rule together.

1066
00:57:05,844 --> 00:57:06,707
Hi.

1067
00:57:06,742 --> 00:57:07,950
Hi.

1068
00:57:07,984 --> 00:57:09,617
- Uh, how's it going?
- Oh, perfect. Perfect.

1069
00:57:09,641 --> 00:57:10,849
Absolutely perfect.

1070
00:57:10,884 --> 00:57:12,206
We have all the music
you could ever want.

1071
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:13,852
We just have to find 500 PS5s

1072
00:57:13,887 --> 00:57:15,820
and Louis Valois'
violin on a pike.

1073
00:57:15,854 --> 00:57:17,338
How about you?

1074
00:57:17,373 --> 00:57:18,971
Uh, great. It looks like
we might have a venue.

1075
00:57:18,995 --> 00:57:21,895
It's not a definite yes, but
something other than an no.

1076
00:57:21,929 --> 00:57:22,758
Okay, well let's go.

1077
00:57:22,792 --> 00:57:24,035
- Let's go. C'mon.
- Okay.

1078
00:57:24,069 --> 00:57:25,288
Move, move, move. Oh,
wait, I'm outta coffee.

1079
00:57:25,312 --> 00:57:26,772
You probably don't
need more. It's okay.

1080
00:57:37,393 --> 00:57:39,257
Oh my.

1081
00:57:41,362 --> 00:57:42,432
It's perfect.

1082
00:57:43,364 --> 00:57:45,919
It's perfect.

1083
00:57:49,854 --> 00:57:52,166
Wow, this has always been here?

1084
00:57:52,201 --> 00:57:54,203
Why have you never
used it before?

1085
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:56,481
Hey, I wasn't here before.

1086
00:57:56,516 --> 00:57:58,103
Plus, I think that
they tried to,

1087
00:57:58,138 --> 00:58:00,554
but they could never
get a deal done for it-

1088
00:58:00,589 --> 00:58:04,247
Oh my goodness. Would you just
listen to those acoustics?

1089
00:58:04,282 --> 00:58:07,009
Hello World! Here we are!

1090
00:58:07,043 --> 00:58:09,529
Can you imagine what the choir

1091
00:58:09,563 --> 00:58:11,323
is gonna sound like under that?

1092
00:58:12,359 --> 00:58:13,774
- And the orchestra?
- Uh, June-

1093
00:58:13,809 --> 00:58:15,120
We could do better than this.

1094
00:58:15,155 --> 00:58:16,984
You hear me? We
could not do better.

1095
00:58:17,951 --> 00:58:21,713
Well, if you can't do better,

1096
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:25,096
you have a good reason
for meeting our price.

1097
00:58:27,892 --> 00:58:31,861
So I'm sure you're aware,
we're not a very large station.

1098
00:58:31,896 --> 00:58:34,243
You are a station who
has had a half a century

1099
00:58:34,277 --> 00:58:35,658
to build an endowment.

1100
00:58:36,901 --> 00:58:39,075
Yes. Well, you
know how that goes.

1101
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:40,387
Keeps you in business

1102
00:58:40,421 --> 00:58:41,882
but you can't go on any
shopping sprees with it.

1103
00:58:41,906 --> 00:58:44,011
Do you have any idea

1104
00:58:44,046 --> 00:58:46,842
what the wedding demand
is for a place like this?

1105
00:58:46,876 --> 00:58:49,189
Oh, I'm sure it's
a wonderful place-

1106
00:58:49,223 --> 00:58:51,812
Do you have any
idea what people pay

1107
00:58:51,847 --> 00:58:53,745
for those sorts of things?

1108
00:58:55,022 --> 00:58:57,956
And I'm sure a little
classy TV exposure

1109
00:58:57,991 --> 00:58:59,440
would be just the thing-

1110
00:58:59,475 --> 00:59:03,824
Ms. Schroeder, this
building is a century old

1111
00:59:03,859 --> 00:59:08,898
and is visible from virtually
everywhere in the city.

1112
00:59:10,313 --> 00:59:14,110
Exactly what makes you think
exposure is anything we need?

1113
00:59:15,698 --> 00:59:18,908
We've had our struggles,
and I'm sure you have too.

1114
00:59:18,943 --> 00:59:20,323
We really feel
that this could be

1115
00:59:20,358 --> 00:59:22,498
- an excellent collaboration-
- Ms. Schroeder,

1116
00:59:22,532 --> 00:59:26,019
so far you have failed
to present any scenario

1117
00:59:26,053 --> 00:59:30,575
that does not represent
a certain short-term cost

1118
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:34,648
to this church in
exchange for dubious

1119
00:59:34,683 --> 00:59:38,445
and highly-uncertain
long-term gains.

1120
00:59:38,479 --> 00:59:41,551
So unless you are prepared

1121
00:59:41,586 --> 00:59:45,763
to meet our standard rate
for an outside event,

1122
00:59:45,797 --> 00:59:49,629
I suggest your time would be
better employed elsewhere.

1123
00:59:52,666 --> 00:59:55,082
I don't suppose
there's anything else

1124
00:59:55,117 --> 00:59:57,740
that could possibly
change your mind?

1125
00:59:57,775 --> 01:00:01,986
Unless you intend to march
Cary Leech through our door,

1126
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:04,160
I'm afraid you're
out of options.

1127
01:00:05,058 --> 01:00:06,611
Cary Leech?

1128
01:00:06,646 --> 01:00:11,512
Child, don't pretend to
have any idea who that is.

1129
01:00:12,168 --> 01:00:13,549
It's before your time.

1130
01:00:13,583 --> 01:00:15,965
You mean our Cary Leech?

1131
01:00:17,587 --> 01:00:22,662
What do you mean,
"Our Cary Leech?"

1132
01:00:23,766 --> 01:00:27,011
You first. Show me
your Cary Leech.

1133
01:00:27,045 --> 01:00:30,773
I am not accustomed
to taking demands.

1134
01:00:30,808 --> 01:00:32,741
Get used to it. Show me.

1135
01:00:42,682 --> 01:00:45,339
And the murderer is one of you.

1136
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,240
Huh?

1137
01:00:51,621 --> 01:00:52,830
I say!

1138
01:00:52,864 --> 01:00:55,729
Oh, it's all quite
simple, really.

1139
01:00:55,764 --> 01:00:57,662
Now, your late father
was left-handed,

1140
01:00:57,697 --> 01:00:59,146
was he not Miss Fairfax?

1141
01:00:59,181 --> 01:01:00,561
- Hm?
- Huh?

1142
01:01:00,596 --> 01:01:03,633
Knowing that then, perhaps
you can explain to me

1143
01:01:03,668 --> 01:01:05,290
how he could possibly have heard

1144
01:01:05,325 --> 01:01:08,190
the huntsman's call,
Lord Shepperton?

1145
01:01:25,138 --> 01:01:26,864
Your turn.

1146
01:01:26,898 --> 01:01:29,349
What's this about Cary Leech?

1147
01:01:32,007 --> 01:01:33,940
He will be hosting the special.

1148
01:01:35,079 --> 01:01:38,910
From here?

1149
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:40,084
Mm-hmm. That's right.

1150
01:01:40,118 --> 01:01:41,602
He'll be announcing every song,

1151
01:01:41,637 --> 01:01:44,191
telling stories from
set, meeting new fans.

1152
01:01:44,226 --> 01:01:45,710
And so help me,

1153
01:01:45,745 --> 01:01:48,092
that man signs everything
I put in front of him.

1154
01:01:48,126 --> 01:01:52,613
But as for the from here part,

1155
01:01:52,648 --> 01:01:56,376
well that's not really
up to me now, is it?

1156
01:02:00,725 --> 01:02:03,245
I cannot believe that you
just lied in a church.

1157
01:02:03,279 --> 01:02:04,591
I mean in a church, June.

1158
01:02:04,625 --> 01:02:06,075
It's not a lie yet, okay?

1159
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:07,974
Not if we can get
Cary Leech back.

1160
01:02:08,906 --> 01:02:11,080
June, he's bunkered somewhere.

1161
01:02:11,115 --> 01:02:12,875
I mean off the grid
for all we know.

1162
01:02:12,910 --> 01:02:14,470
He's probably got a
thousand-acre estate

1163
01:02:14,497 --> 01:02:17,052
somewhere in Sun Valley that
we'll never be able to find.

1164
01:02:17,086 --> 01:02:19,295
Well, what addresses
do we have for him?

1165
01:02:19,330 --> 01:02:20,676
None.

1166
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:22,920
All correspondence goes
through his lawyer.

1167
01:02:24,059 --> 01:02:25,957
All right, well
what's his address?

1168
01:02:33,171 --> 01:02:35,415
His lawyer works
out of an apartment?

1169
01:02:37,693 --> 01:02:39,419
I guess I always kind of assumed

1170
01:02:39,453 --> 01:02:41,145
he had a better
lawyer than this.

1171
01:03:02,891 --> 01:03:04,720
What do you want now?

1172
01:03:04,754 --> 01:03:05,755
Oh!

1173
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:08,413
Hey! Leech!

1174
01:03:08,448 --> 01:03:10,864
Come on, open up.
What is going on?

1175
01:03:10,899 --> 01:03:12,072
Get on in here.

1176
01:03:23,981 --> 01:03:28,192
Right, first thing
I wanna know is,

1177
01:03:28,226 --> 01:03:29,469
how did you find me?

1178
01:03:30,884 --> 01:03:33,818
For years, I have battled
to preserve my anonymity,

1179
01:03:33,853 --> 01:03:38,858
yet somehow, you have penetrated
the wilyest of defenses.

1180
01:03:39,548 --> 01:03:41,481
So lay out the trail.

1181
01:03:41,515 --> 01:03:45,174
What gossamer thread of clues
did you follow to get here?

1182
01:04:01,466 --> 01:04:04,676
So I'm gonna go way out on
a limb here and just assume

1183
01:04:04,711 --> 01:04:06,920
that there was never
any big check coming.

1184
01:04:06,955 --> 01:04:07,955
Meh.

1185
01:04:09,612 --> 01:04:12,270
Oh, don't get too sore.

1186
01:04:12,305 --> 01:04:14,721
I always knew your
fighting was fake.

1187
01:04:15,964 --> 01:04:20,140
I just admired the performance.

1188
01:04:20,175 --> 01:04:21,693
How did you even get here?

1189
01:04:22,832 --> 01:04:24,569
I mean, the residuals
from your show must be-

1190
01:04:24,593 --> 01:04:26,388
Not so much anymore.

1191
01:04:27,837 --> 01:04:30,702
But I'd like to think that
what I had, I spent well.

1192
01:04:33,153 --> 01:04:36,087
Okay.

1193
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:39,815
Well, um, anything to get
on the air one last time?

1194
01:04:40,574 --> 01:04:41,817
For some of us,

1195
01:04:41,851 --> 01:04:44,164
there's only one place
we're ever truly happy.

1196
01:04:46,304 --> 01:04:47,443
I got nothing for you.

1197
01:04:53,035 --> 01:04:55,244
Maybe you still do, actually.

1198
01:04:57,557 --> 01:05:00,042
We're throwing a big
Christmas concert

1199
01:05:00,077 --> 01:05:02,596
like the station used
to do in the old days,

1200
01:05:02,631 --> 01:05:04,322
and we want you to host it.

1201
01:05:05,875 --> 01:05:09,086
Oh, no. No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

1202
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:11,329
No, negative. Uh-uh.

1203
01:05:11,364 --> 01:05:13,711
Nope. Nope, nope.

1204
01:05:13,745 --> 01:05:14,781
Nein.

1205
01:05:14,815 --> 01:05:15,851
Why not?

1206
01:05:17,197 --> 01:05:20,200
You think I'm showing my face
around that studio of yours

1207
01:05:20,235 --> 01:05:23,272
while that psychopath
is out there?

1208
01:05:23,307 --> 01:05:26,068
You only just caught
me before I blew town.

1209
01:05:26,103 --> 01:05:28,484
Find me some other PBS station

1210
01:05:28,519 --> 01:05:32,212
that still fills time with
"The Woking Mysteries."

1211
01:05:32,247 --> 01:05:34,007
This is to save the station.

1212
01:05:34,801 --> 01:05:36,147
This could be big.

1213
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:38,115
Your big closing act.

1214
01:05:38,149 --> 01:05:40,289
Oh, if that loon shows up,

1215
01:05:40,324 --> 01:05:42,429
it'll be a closing
act all right.

1216
01:05:42,464 --> 01:05:44,638
And I don't intend
to star in it.

1217
01:05:45,777 --> 01:05:47,469
We-we'll get the police on it.

1218
01:05:47,503 --> 01:05:51,749
Have you never seen a
single episode of my series?

1219
01:05:51,783 --> 01:05:53,371
The bobbies are useless.

1220
01:05:54,510 --> 01:05:56,754
How did he hear the
huntsman's call?

1221
01:05:59,584 --> 01:06:00,584
What's that?

1222
01:06:02,691 --> 01:06:05,073
How did he hear the
huntsman's call?

1223
01:06:06,419 --> 01:06:07,834
I remember that one.

1224
01:06:08,835 --> 01:06:10,457
Come on.

1225
01:06:10,492 --> 01:06:13,012
How did he hear the
huntsman's call?

1226
01:06:16,118 --> 01:06:17,118
How?

1227
01:06:18,845 --> 01:06:22,607
Hmm. I'll tell you how.

1228
01:06:24,023 --> 01:06:26,094
'Twas the moors who done it.

1229
01:06:26,128 --> 01:06:27,750
Aye, the moors.

1230
01:06:27,785 --> 01:06:31,099
The misty moors where
screams are swallered

1231
01:06:31,133 --> 01:06:33,515
and murder rings clear.

1232
01:06:33,549 --> 01:06:35,379
'Twas there you set the trap.

1233
01:06:35,413 --> 01:06:36,414
Give him a nudge.

1234
01:06:37,588 --> 01:06:38,761
- Okay.
- N-no. Stay.

1235
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:41,592
So you laid it.

1236
01:06:41,626 --> 01:06:43,766
You laid the trap and waited.

1237
01:06:43,801 --> 01:06:46,838
Knowing full well he'd
be done in for sure

1238
01:06:46,873 --> 01:06:49,600
by that gouty foot of his.

1239
01:06:49,634 --> 01:06:53,293
And once he was,
you'd lay your hands

1240
01:06:53,328 --> 01:06:57,228
on the greatest treasure
in lower Shropshire,

1241
01:06:57,263 --> 01:07:02,130
his mighty collection
of taxidermed hamster.

1242
01:07:02,164 --> 01:07:03,831
- Who wrote this crap?
- Shh. Give him a nudge.

1243
01:07:03,855 --> 01:07:05,892
Confess, sir.

1244
01:07:05,926 --> 01:07:09,482
Confess and the magistrate
may go easy on ya.

1245
01:07:09,516 --> 01:07:11,932
Confess and spare
the bloody wretch

1246
01:07:11,967 --> 01:07:14,521
who now answers for your
crimes on the gallows.

1247
01:07:14,556 --> 01:07:15,798
Are we seriously airing this?

1248
01:07:15,833 --> 01:07:16,833
Confess!

1249
01:07:19,457 --> 01:07:21,114
Reverend, he's getting away.

1250
01:07:23,116 --> 01:07:24,704
Um, who's this now?

1251
01:07:27,224 --> 01:07:29,226
The accomplice.

1252
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:31,504
The accomplice?

1253
01:07:31,538 --> 01:07:33,022
Aye! The accomplice!

1254
01:07:34,714 --> 01:07:36,336
Come on.

1255
01:07:47,416 --> 01:07:50,143
So whom would you
say is calling?

1256
01:07:51,213 --> 01:07:52,939
I don't believe we've met.

1257
01:07:52,973 --> 01:07:54,251
Hi.

1258
01:07:54,285 --> 01:07:55,493
I am the John Schroeder

1259
01:07:55,528 --> 01:07:58,427
who just might be the
worthwhile human being.

1260
01:07:59,601 --> 01:08:00,533
Really?

1261
01:08:00,567 --> 01:08:02,155
Stranger things have happened.

1262
01:08:03,294 --> 01:08:05,986
My wildest fantasies
don't get that wild.

1263
01:08:06,021 --> 01:08:07,264
What are you here for?

1264
01:08:07,298 --> 01:08:09,128
Because you're sure
not buying anything.

1265
01:08:09,162 --> 01:08:10,957
I could buy you dinner.

1266
01:08:10,991 --> 01:08:14,271
And just what do you think you
are buying along with that?

1267
01:08:14,305 --> 01:08:16,204
Conversation, company.

1268
01:08:17,032 --> 01:08:17,964
Come on.

1269
01:08:17,998 --> 01:08:19,414
It's been a long time

1270
01:08:19,448 --> 01:08:21,726
since I've had anything
other than a business dinner.

1271
01:08:22,589 --> 01:08:23,694
A very long time.

1272
01:08:25,661 --> 01:08:27,249
You think I trust you?

1273
01:08:27,284 --> 01:08:28,975
The only thing you need to trust

1274
01:08:29,009 --> 01:08:31,460
is that I won't run
out on the check.

1275
01:08:31,495 --> 01:08:33,152
And I am a good tipper.

1276
01:08:34,877 --> 01:08:36,120
Come on.

1277
01:08:36,155 --> 01:08:37,684
I've been hanging
around here long enough

1278
01:08:37,708 --> 01:08:41,298
to know it's just you and the
younglings running the place.

1279
01:08:41,332 --> 01:08:43,817
And before them, mostly you.

1280
01:08:46,441 --> 01:08:47,925
Come on.

1281
01:08:47,959 --> 01:08:50,652
Your good deeds have been
punished long enough.

1282
01:08:50,686 --> 01:08:52,240
Let's go get us something good.

1283
01:08:56,347 --> 01:08:57,762
The accomplice!

1284
01:08:57,797 --> 01:08:59,212
Aye, you, sir.

1285
01:08:59,247 --> 01:09:00,765
It was always you.

1286
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:03,389
You and your red right hand.

1287
01:09:03,423 --> 01:09:05,460
Oh, you thought you
had it, did you?

1288
01:09:05,494 --> 01:09:06,944
Thought you free and clear,

1289
01:09:06,978 --> 01:09:10,706
with that trail of clues from
here to Aberdeen.

1290
01:09:10,741 --> 01:09:12,639
Nay, sir. Nay.

1291
01:09:12,674 --> 01:09:14,503
And again, I say nay.

1292
01:09:15,884 --> 01:09:19,853
Oh, justice is
visited upon ya, sir.

1293
01:09:19,888 --> 01:09:22,822
Justice in the sight of
the parish constabulary

1294
01:09:22,856 --> 01:09:25,514
and the Anglican parsonage.

1295
01:09:25,549 --> 01:09:28,483
Now, open the gates
and move aside.

1296
01:09:29,277 --> 01:09:30,761
Move aside!

1297
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:42,842
What a scene. What a scene.

1298
01:09:43,739 --> 01:09:45,051
Let's do another take.

1299
01:09:45,085 --> 01:09:47,122
Okay, as much as I'd
love to see that again,

1300
01:09:47,156 --> 01:09:48,537
we have bigger
scenes to get done.

1301
01:09:48,572 --> 01:09:49,918
Right. Right.

1302
01:09:49,952 --> 01:09:52,161
What's next on the
day outta days?

1303
01:09:52,196 --> 01:09:53,818
Um, you have to go see a nun.

1304
01:09:57,615 --> 01:09:59,134
Uh-huh.

1305
01:09:59,168 --> 01:10:01,481
No, Bishop, I had not heard

1306
01:10:01,516 --> 01:10:05,209
about the buses coming
in from the convent.

1307
01:10:05,244 --> 01:10:09,006
Um, we, we never dreamed
that Mr. Leech's presence

1308
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:11,836
would cause this kind
of disruption.

1309
01:10:11,871 --> 01:10:13,528
So yes. Yes.

1310
01:10:13,562 --> 01:10:17,566
Naturally, we will have
crowd control in place.

1311
01:10:17,601 --> 01:10:19,085
Don't you worry.

1312
01:10:19,119 --> 01:10:21,018
We are very aware of
how rowdy nuns can be.

1313
01:10:21,052 --> 01:10:25,678
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1314
01:10:25,712 --> 01:10:27,024
Mm-hmm?

1315
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:31,270
We will get you his autograph
most discreetly. Goodbye.

1316
01:10:32,754 --> 01:10:35,584
Okay. Crowd control,

1317
01:10:36,792 --> 01:10:37,792
exclamation point.

1318
01:10:41,866 --> 01:10:45,974
The concert's tomorrow, and
you're just sitting there?

1319
01:10:47,251 --> 01:10:48,563
What else is there to do?

1320
01:10:49,736 --> 01:10:51,151
I don't know. Something.

1321
01:10:51,186 --> 01:10:52,498
There's always something.

1322
01:10:53,775 --> 01:10:57,261
Something to get ahead
of, a problem to fix,

1323
01:10:57,296 --> 01:10:58,814
something that could go better.

1324
01:11:00,333 --> 01:11:02,059
You never did AP
classes, did you?

1325
01:11:03,405 --> 01:11:06,235
Can we not have that
discussion again, please?

1326
01:11:06,270 --> 01:11:07,454
Well, there's something
that they tell you

1327
01:11:07,478 --> 01:11:09,446
when you take AP classes.

1328
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:12,069
"Before the big
test never cram."

1329
01:11:13,277 --> 01:11:14,174
Really?

1330
01:11:14,209 --> 01:11:15,209
Oh, really.

1331
01:11:16,211 --> 01:11:17,730
Yeah, those tests
were pretty big

1332
01:11:17,764 --> 01:11:20,249
so if you didn't know the
material the night before,

1333
01:11:20,284 --> 01:11:23,563
one long night of cramming
wouldn't help one bit.

1334
01:11:24,909 --> 01:11:28,637
And you, June, just put
together one heck of a project.

1335
01:11:29,466 --> 01:11:30,466
A really big one.

1336
01:11:36,265 --> 01:11:40,097
Okay, so if you didn't
cram before the big test,

1337
01:11:40,994 --> 01:11:41,995
then what'd you do?

1338
01:11:44,135 --> 01:11:45,896
Put it outta your mind.

1339
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:47,380
Let it go for one night.

1340
01:11:49,796 --> 01:11:50,796
Go out somewhere.

1341
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:59,254
Go out like, like where?

1342
01:12:02,913 --> 01:12:04,777
You might need some
warmer clothes.

1343
01:13:32,071 --> 01:13:35,661
So there's a human being
under that awful mustache.

1344
01:13:35,695 --> 01:13:36,695
Who'd have thought?

1345
01:13:38,905 --> 01:13:40,148
It doesn't bother you?

1346
01:13:41,494 --> 01:13:44,497
I mean, there he is, being
all friendly with her.

1347
01:13:44,532 --> 01:13:47,224
Doesn't seem he was ever
really that friendly with you.

1348
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:52,091
If he wants to be friendly
with her, he can go for it.

1349
01:13:52,954 --> 01:13:54,438
I, on the other hand,

1350
01:13:54,473 --> 01:13:56,647
am nowhere near ready to
be friendly with him yet.

1351
01:13:58,511 --> 01:13:59,719
Is it too much to hope

1352
01:13:59,754 --> 01:14:01,825
that maybe she's
just leading him on,

1353
01:14:01,859 --> 01:14:04,241
you know, get a big
pledge out of him?

1354
01:14:04,275 --> 01:14:06,657
You've been working for Cary
Leech too long.

1355
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:09,039
Camera's on, check's
signed. Easy peasy.

1356
01:14:10,627 --> 01:14:11,627
Well, not my dad.

1357
01:14:12,594 --> 01:14:14,872
He always gets
something for his money.

1358
01:14:14,907 --> 01:14:17,599
Well, that was the
Outsider they were in.

1359
01:14:17,634 --> 01:14:19,567
Definitely not fast food.

1360
01:14:19,601 --> 01:14:20,982
For a nice evening,

1361
01:14:21,016 --> 01:14:22,535
he'd call that a good price.

1362
01:14:24,364 --> 01:14:27,057
Has he ever paid for
something and not gotten it?

1363
01:14:27,091 --> 01:14:28,091
Like ever?

1364
01:14:29,128 --> 01:14:31,613
Hmm. He paid $3
million for me.

1365
01:14:33,304 --> 01:14:36,618
Yeah. Yeah,
you heard that right.

1366
01:14:36,653 --> 01:14:39,172
$3 million to avoid
joint custody.

1367
01:14:40,588 --> 01:14:44,108
Well, what in the world
did he not get from that?

1368
01:14:44,143 --> 01:14:47,422
Um, I don't know.

1369
01:14:48,872 --> 01:14:51,495
All I've ever brought
him is disappointment,

1370
01:14:51,530 --> 01:14:55,326
distraction, annoyance,
the list goes on.

1371
01:14:55,361 --> 01:14:56,983
Well, he's a fool.

1372
01:14:57,018 --> 01:14:58,467
You hear me?

1373
01:14:58,502 --> 01:15:00,435
He got the bargain of a century.

1374
01:15:00,469 --> 01:15:01,643
Okay?

1375
01:15:01,678 --> 01:15:04,335
$3 million for another
10 years with you.

1376
01:15:05,474 --> 01:15:07,753
Gosh, I would've paid
so much more than that.

1377
01:15:07,787 --> 01:15:10,203
- Shut up.
- I mean it.

1378
01:15:10,238 --> 01:15:12,896
I've watched you
and you are amazing.

1379
01:15:12,930 --> 01:15:14,173
Simply amazing.

1380
01:15:14,967 --> 01:15:16,140
Just stop.

1381
01:15:16,175 --> 01:15:17,452
What?

1382
01:15:17,486 --> 01:15:19,661
Hasn't anyone ever
told you that?

1383
01:15:19,696 --> 01:15:20,696
Anyone at all?

1384
01:15:21,698 --> 01:15:24,977
Because got news
for ya: it's true.

1385
01:15:26,426 --> 01:15:29,015
I would've paid that much
for 10 more days with you.

1386
01:15:29,050 --> 01:15:32,467
10 minutes. Literally
anytime at all.

1387
01:15:32,501 --> 01:15:33,537
I'd take that deal.

1388
01:15:35,401 --> 01:15:36,401
Declan.

1389
01:15:40,268 --> 01:15:41,407
Okay! Uh!

1390
01:15:41,441 --> 01:15:42,650
It's getting really late.

1391
01:15:42,684 --> 01:15:43,720
We, we gotta go.

1392
01:15:43,754 --> 01:15:45,204
Uh, g-go where?

1393
01:15:45,238 --> 01:15:46,964
Final exam's
tomorrow. Remember?

1394
01:15:46,999 --> 01:15:48,621
We gotta gotta get lots of rest.

1395
01:15:48,656 --> 01:15:50,692
Come on, let's go. Here we go.

1396
01:15:50,727 --> 01:15:53,350
- Let's go.
- I'm coming. Okay.

1397
01:16:01,323 --> 01:16:03,463
Aubur-general-music-director.

1398
01:16:03,498 --> 01:16:07,744
Not conductor, director.
Yes, we have to get it right.

1399
01:16:07,778 --> 01:16:10,436
June, first violin
says that the sanctuary

1400
01:16:10,470 --> 01:16:12,403
is three degrees too cold.

1401
01:16:12,438 --> 01:16:14,474
Tell him we're heating it up.

1402
01:16:14,509 --> 01:16:16,235
Can't heat a building
this big that fast.

1403
01:16:16,269 --> 01:16:17,477
So just tell him that

1404
01:16:17,512 --> 01:16:18,444
and by the time he
thinks of it again,

1405
01:16:18,478 --> 01:16:20,273
he'll have adjusted.

1406
01:16:20,308 --> 01:16:21,516
What? No.

1407
01:16:21,550 --> 01:16:23,656
Nuns do not get
priority seating.

1408
01:16:25,106 --> 01:16:28,212
Hey, hey! Red lights
on the woodwinds not purple.

1409
01:16:28,247 --> 01:16:29,628
It's Christmas. Remember?

1410
01:16:30,732 --> 01:16:32,044
I do not care how
scary they are.

1411
01:16:32,078 --> 01:16:34,080
Nuns do not get
priority seating.

1412
01:16:35,323 --> 01:16:37,049
Just bring him around
during intermission.

1413
01:16:37,083 --> 01:16:38,637
We'll do an extra
meet and greet.

1414
01:16:38,671 --> 01:16:40,466
Trust me. He'll agree to it.

1415
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:41,329
Circuit panels.

1416
01:16:41,363 --> 01:16:43,020
Geez, Claire.

1417
01:16:43,055 --> 01:16:44,401
What now?

1418
01:16:44,435 --> 01:16:46,575
Well, the church caretaker's
a little concerned

1419
01:16:46,610 --> 01:16:49,440
about everything we're plugging
into his circuit panels.

1420
01:16:50,579 --> 01:16:53,134
For the last time, we
have run the numbers.

1421
01:16:53,168 --> 01:16:56,378
Everything is fine as long as
nobody plugs in anything else.

1422
01:16:56,413 --> 01:16:59,796
Caretaker says those cords
are running pretty warm.

1423
01:16:59,830 --> 01:17:01,590
Call it free heating.

1424
01:17:02,522 --> 01:17:03,592
What is all this?

1425
01:17:03,627 --> 01:17:07,873
Fan mail from nuns.

1426
01:17:09,702 --> 01:17:10,702
Claire. Ugh.

1427
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:17,261
Oh, is that more for me to sign?

1428
01:17:17,296 --> 01:17:19,160
No, not now.
We're on in three.

1429
01:17:19,194 --> 01:17:21,852
Declan, camera three is
getting the closeups. Not two.

1430
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:23,129
Come on. Get 'em sorted.

1431
01:17:25,476 --> 01:17:27,340
Oh, I can't wait
till this is over.

1432
01:17:28,514 --> 01:17:30,550
Well, June, if you
weren't doing this,

1433
01:17:30,585 --> 01:17:32,691
what would you be doing?

1434
01:17:32,725 --> 01:17:35,555
Probably having a nice quiet
night before Christmas Eve.

1435
01:17:35,590 --> 01:17:38,144
Where's
the fun in that?

1436
01:17:40,664 --> 01:17:43,184
I know, I, I can see
you're stressed out.

1437
01:17:43,218 --> 01:17:46,152
But June, do you really
think you'd be happy

1438
01:17:46,187 --> 01:17:49,466
if somehow you were being
prevented from doing this?

1439
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:51,986
If you never even
had the choice.

1440
01:17:54,505 --> 01:17:56,231
You'd be miserable,
wouldn't you?

1441
01:17:56,266 --> 01:17:57,785
Wouldn't you?

1442
01:17:57,819 --> 01:18:00,960
You'd be miserable if you
never even had the chance.

1443
01:18:05,171 --> 01:18:06,171
Yeah?

1444
01:18:11,039 --> 01:18:12,765
We're on in two. We gotta go.

1445
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,880
Also, you're doing a meet
and greet during remission.

1446
01:18:14,905 --> 01:18:16,804
Meet and greet?
That means pictures.

1447
01:18:16,838 --> 01:18:18,253
- I-I better- - Come on!

1448
01:18:18,288 --> 01:18:19,461
Just come on. Come on.

1449
01:18:21,325 --> 01:18:22,292
June, where's our star?

1450
01:18:22,326 --> 01:18:23,707
Uh, he's right behind me.

1451
01:18:23,742 --> 01:18:25,605
He's right behind... Cary!

1452
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:26,641
Coming. Coming.

1453
01:18:26,675 --> 01:18:28,022
I just had to make sure that-

1454
01:18:28,056 --> 01:18:29,540
No more taking care of.

1455
01:18:29,575 --> 01:18:31,139
- On your mark first position.
- I didn't know

1456
01:18:31,163 --> 01:18:32,336
there was a meet and greet.

1457
01:18:32,371 --> 01:18:33,935
I had to make sure that
my phone was ready-

1458
01:18:33,959 --> 01:18:36,064
On your mark.

1459
01:18:36,099 --> 01:18:37,031
Okay, quiet everyone.

1460
01:18:37,065 --> 01:18:38,135
Hold for countdown.

1461
01:18:39,102 --> 01:18:40,241
Everybody good? Okay.

1462
01:18:41,173 --> 01:18:43,278
Live on air in 10.

1463
01:18:43,313 --> 01:18:44,624
What? No, it's fine.

1464
01:18:44,659 --> 01:18:45,453
Nine.

1465
01:18:45,487 --> 01:18:46,557
No, no.

1466
01:18:46,592 --> 01:18:47,638
Everything's
calibrated. It's fine.

1467
01:18:47,662 --> 01:18:49,043
- Eight.
- Electrical meter.

1468
01:18:49,077 --> 01:18:50,423
What electrical meter?

1469
01:18:50,458 --> 01:18:51,631
Seven.

1470
01:18:51,666 --> 01:18:52,850
No, there's, it's not possible.

1471
01:18:52,874 --> 01:18:53,989
There's nothing else
on that circuit.

1472
01:18:54,013 --> 01:18:55,428
Six.

1473
01:18:55,463 --> 01:18:56,474
I- I said there's nothing
else on that circuit.

1474
01:19:00,744 --> 01:19:02,125
Check all the circuits.

1475
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:03,954
Ch-check all the circuits now.

1476
01:19:18,555 --> 01:19:23,077
No!

1477
01:19:39,887 --> 01:19:41,302
Hello?

1478
01:19:42,441 --> 01:19:43,856
Anyone?

1479
01:19:45,133 --> 01:19:46,133
Anyone at all?

1480
01:19:53,521 --> 01:19:54,591
Anyone?

1481
01:19:56,731 --> 01:19:57,628
Anyone at-

1482
01:19:57,663 --> 01:19:58,663
Oh! Ugh!

1483
01:20:00,217 --> 01:20:03,980
You just had to
plug in your phone.

1484
01:20:04,014 --> 01:20:06,120
Oh my gosh. Is it okay?

1485
01:20:06,154 --> 01:20:08,053
I have so many pictures on that.

1486
01:20:10,124 --> 01:20:13,886
Um, I guess it's
not that important.

1487
01:20:15,301 --> 01:20:16,716
Reset for take two?

1488
01:20:18,753 --> 01:20:20,720
There is no take two.

1489
01:20:20,755 --> 01:20:21,755
What? Uh...

1490
01:20:23,344 --> 01:20:26,036
Oh, um,

1491
01:20:27,624 --> 01:20:31,007
so anything I can do?

1492
01:20:33,457 --> 01:20:37,254
Kids, uh, I don't want this

1493
01:20:37,289 --> 01:20:39,325
to be the last thing
the station ever does.

1494
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:44,296
Can't we think of something?

1495
01:21:28,167 --> 01:21:32,068
Live on air in three, two...

1496
01:21:35,692 --> 01:21:36,692
Ah.

1497
01:21:38,902 --> 01:21:41,284
Hello, friends of KPRP.

1498
01:21:42,699 --> 01:21:46,772
I'm afraid I bring news
of disappointment tonight.

1499
01:21:46,806 --> 01:21:50,258
Our Christmas
concert cannot go on

1500
01:21:50,293 --> 01:21:53,641
as scheduled and
planned.

1501
01:21:53,675 --> 01:21:56,506
We're very sorry to
have let you down.

1502
01:21:58,128 --> 01:21:59,128
Um,

1503
01:22:00,924 --> 01:22:05,618
since there won't
be a broadcast,

1504
01:22:05,653 --> 01:22:08,518
there won't be any
pledge drive either.

1505
01:22:09,898 --> 01:22:14,006
Anyone who wants to contribute
can do so on our website.

1506
01:22:14,869 --> 01:22:18,355
But we expect that this will be

1507
01:22:18,390 --> 01:22:22,670
KPRP's last broadcast.

1508
01:22:24,465 --> 01:22:29,470
We want to thank you for
supporting us for 47 years.

1509
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:37,374
For half a century we
have brought you our best.

1510
01:22:37,409 --> 01:22:39,514
And

1511
01:22:41,137 --> 01:22:44,105
I guess we all knew it
couldn't last forever.

1512
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:48,523
So I'm Cary Leech,

1513
01:22:48,558 --> 01:22:53,597
on behalf of everyone here
from KPRP, signing off.

1514
01:22:57,291 --> 01:23:00,708

June?

1523
01:24:41,188 --> 01:24:42,603
Hey, Dad.

1524
01:24:42,637 --> 01:24:43,637
What is it?

1525
01:24:44,777 --> 01:24:46,158
It must be almost midnight.

1526
01:24:47,125 --> 01:24:48,298
This won't take long.

1527
01:24:50,473 --> 01:24:51,853
You've won.

1528
01:24:53,441 --> 01:24:54,994
I've what?

1529
01:24:55,029 --> 01:24:56,029
You've won.

1530
01:24:57,894 --> 01:24:58,894
You were right.

1531
01:25:00,241 --> 01:25:01,794
So just do what you do best.

1532
01:25:01,829 --> 01:25:03,313
Sign a check.

1533
01:25:03,348 --> 01:25:06,109
I'll be at a desk working
for you by morning.

1534
01:25:06,144 --> 01:25:07,731
What are you talking about?

1535
01:25:07,766 --> 01:25:10,941
KPRP. They're
still taking pledges.

1536
01:25:10,976 --> 01:25:12,184
So?

1537
01:25:12,219 --> 01:25:13,841
So make one. And
I'm yours again.

1538
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:17,327
Just make it a big one.

1539
01:25:17,362 --> 01:25:18,639
You want me to what now?

1540
01:25:18,673 --> 01:25:20,606
Go to the website,
make a pledge.

1541
01:25:20,641 --> 01:25:22,160
Just get it done already.

1542
01:25:23,195 --> 01:25:24,921
But, but you...

1543
01:25:24,955 --> 01:25:28,752
But what? You have trouble
taking yes for an answer now?

1544
01:25:28,787 --> 01:25:30,029
But?

1545
01:25:30,064 --> 01:25:31,583
Well spit it out.
What's the problem?

1546
01:25:33,171 --> 01:25:35,552
But I don't think that's
really what you want.

1547
01:25:35,587 --> 01:25:37,692
Don't even try to
tell me what I want.

1548
01:25:37,727 --> 01:25:38,980
You've never had
a clue what I want

1549
01:25:39,004 --> 01:25:41,386
so there's no reason to
think you can start now.

1550
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:44,975
You care about what I want,

1551
01:25:46,045 --> 01:25:47,046
then listen to me.

1552
01:25:48,047 --> 01:25:49,047
I just told you.

1553
01:25:51,258 --> 01:25:53,018
I- I'll get the accountants

1554
01:25:53,052 --> 01:25:56,401
to do that first thing tomorrow.

1555
01:25:56,435 --> 01:25:59,093
I'll be in first thing tomorrow.

1556
01:26:00,508 --> 01:26:02,545
Merry Christmas, I guess.

1557
01:26:03,891 --> 01:26:04,891
Yeah.

1558
01:26:05,927 --> 01:26:07,135
Merry Christmas.

1559
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:24,705
You didn't.

1560
01:26:26,707 --> 01:26:28,778
That's a heck of a
way to say thank you.

1561
01:26:28,812 --> 01:26:30,814
June, I didn't want this.

1562
01:26:30,849 --> 01:26:32,299
I don't recall asking you.

1563
01:26:32,333 --> 01:26:34,473
Look, we, we can figure
something else out.

1564
01:26:34,508 --> 01:26:36,095
Declan, we're out of time.

1565
01:26:36,130 --> 01:26:37,614
Outta luck and outta favors.

1566
01:26:38,926 --> 01:26:41,446
At least now I don't
have to find 500 PS5s.

1567
01:26:43,551 --> 01:26:46,244
What is it you've been telling
me this whole time then?

1568
01:26:46,278 --> 01:26:48,763
You've been acting like this
is a fate worse than death.

1569
01:26:48,798 --> 01:26:50,248
But whenever things get hard,

1570
01:26:50,282 --> 01:26:52,733
you just pull the rip cord
on the golden parachute, huh?

1571
01:26:52,767 --> 01:26:54,700
You know what? Sure.

1572
01:26:54,735 --> 01:26:56,392
Go ahead and think that.

1573
01:26:56,426 --> 01:26:57,600
Talk yourself into it.

1574
01:26:57,634 --> 01:26:59,084
We're so clever.
We can have it all.

1575
01:26:59,118 --> 01:27:00,810
What was this to you? Huh?

1576
01:27:00,844 --> 01:27:02,121
What was this job to you?

1577
01:27:03,364 --> 01:27:04,607
Just another play thing.

1578
01:27:05,642 --> 01:27:06,816
Just another toy plane

1579
01:27:06,850 --> 01:27:08,345
that happens to be
someone else's grade.

1580
01:27:08,369 --> 01:27:10,613
Do not go there. We're
not playing anymore.

1581
01:27:10,647 --> 01:27:11,683
This wasn't just a show!

1582
01:27:11,717 --> 01:27:13,616
Yeah, you're right. It's not.

1583
01:27:13,650 --> 01:27:15,273
Look, if you have
faith in the team,

1584
01:27:15,307 --> 01:27:16,757
then you stick with the team.

1585
01:27:16,791 --> 01:27:18,241
So do you believe
in this or not?

1586
01:27:18,276 --> 01:27:19,518
Declan, grow up.

1587
01:27:19,553 --> 01:27:21,762
I grew up when I was four, June.

1588
01:27:21,796 --> 01:27:23,073
I had to.

1589
01:27:23,108 --> 01:27:24,972
Yeah. Well I
wasn't far behind.

1590
01:27:28,458 --> 01:27:29,458
June,

1591
01:27:31,012 --> 01:27:32,151
stick with us.

1592
01:27:33,014 --> 01:27:34,119
Please. Come on.

1593
01:27:35,672 --> 01:27:36,672
We can do this.

1594
01:27:39,435 --> 01:27:40,677
You don't have a clue.

1595
01:27:46,752 --> 01:27:47,752
So

1596
01:27:49,203 --> 01:27:51,516
You gonna clean out
your office or should I?

1597
01:27:55,382 --> 01:27:57,832
You won't find anything
worth coming back for.

1598
01:28:14,608 --> 01:28:16,264
Anything I need to know about?

1599
01:28:17,990 --> 01:28:21,304
Yeah, we'll be shutting down

1600
01:28:21,339 --> 01:28:23,341
the servers ourselves tonight.

1601
01:29:28,095 --> 01:29:29,096
Um, ahem.

1602
01:29:31,305 --> 01:29:33,445
I never did do much
with the IT people.

1603
01:29:34,929 --> 01:29:36,241
I don't even know
where to start.

1604
01:29:36,275 --> 01:29:37,275
It's okay.

1605
01:29:39,762 --> 01:29:40,935
Order of operations.

1606
01:29:42,350 --> 01:29:44,732
First we're gonna start
with the graphic station

1607
01:29:44,767 --> 01:29:46,803
that is overlays
and lower-thirds.

1608
01:29:46,838 --> 01:29:49,323
And then we're gonna move on
to the secondary stations.

1609
01:29:54,362 --> 01:29:55,674
What's with this one?

1610
01:29:57,158 --> 01:29:58,746
Uh, that's for the website.

1611
01:29:58,781 --> 01:30:01,128
It looks like it
might be overloaded.

1612
01:30:01,162 --> 01:30:04,545
Overloaded? As in too many
people are trying to access it?

1613
01:30:04,580 --> 01:30:07,306
Yeah, but it, it'll redirect
through a different server.

1614
01:30:07,341 --> 01:30:08,341
It's okay.

1615
01:30:10,758 --> 01:30:12,011
Why is everybody
and their cousin

1616
01:30:12,035 --> 01:30:13,658
logging onto us right now?

1617
01:30:13,692 --> 01:30:17,489
Isn't this how we get pledges
now? Through the website?

1618
01:30:29,846 --> 01:30:33,401
Oh-

1619
01:30:33,436 --> 01:30:38,476
My.

1620
01:30:42,721 --> 01:30:44,343
We are, we're saved.

1621
01:30:45,897 --> 01:30:48,209
Declan! Look at those numbers.

1622
01:30:49,383 --> 01:30:52,317
We're set for years.

1623
01:30:52,351 --> 01:30:53,939
You beautiful man, you.

1624
01:30:55,285 --> 01:30:58,634
- Oh, Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1625
01:31:23,521 --> 01:31:24,901
Welcome back, sweetie.

1626
01:32:18,196 --> 01:32:19,680
Yes?

1627
01:32:19,715 --> 01:32:21,382
Geez, where you
been, land of no phones?

1628
01:32:21,406 --> 01:32:22,614
Is that your plane?

1629
01:32:22,649 --> 01:32:23,442
Yeah. Yeah.

1630
01:32:23,477 --> 01:32:24,858
It's my first one.

1631
01:32:24,892 --> 01:32:26,214
A hobby shop gouged
me pretty good,

1632
01:32:26,238 --> 01:32:27,688
day before Christmas and all.

1633
01:32:27,723 --> 01:32:29,621
You should not be
buying things like that.

1634
01:32:29,656 --> 01:32:32,693
My dad isn't gonna give $1
more than he absolutely has to.

1635
01:32:32,728 --> 01:32:34,592
We don't need it.

1636
01:32:34,626 --> 01:32:36,801
We are not taking his money.

1637
01:32:36,835 --> 01:32:37,802
What do you mean?

1638
01:32:37,836 --> 01:32:40,667
Pledges, June. We got pledges.

1639
01:32:40,701 --> 01:32:43,048
Thousands and
thousands of pledges.

1640
01:32:44,187 --> 01:32:45,924
So many, we don't even
know how many there are.

1641
01:32:45,948 --> 01:32:48,229
It'll take us that long to get
'em off the backup servers.

1642
01:32:48,260 --> 01:32:49,710
But the concert was a bust.

1643
01:32:49,745 --> 01:32:51,885
And they came through anyway.

1644
01:32:51,919 --> 01:32:53,000
You hear me, June Schroeder?

1645
01:32:53,024 --> 01:32:55,682
We asked and they gave.

1646
01:32:55,716 --> 01:32:57,476
The whole city wants
us to stick around.

1647
01:32:57,511 --> 01:33:00,203
And all because one clever girl

1648
01:33:00,238 --> 01:33:02,102
said, "Let's not pack it in.

1649
01:33:02,136 --> 01:33:03,586
Let's go up to the bell tower

1650
01:33:03,621 --> 01:33:06,589
and let's at least have the
decency to say goodbye."

1651
01:33:07,970 --> 01:33:10,489
Uh, Declan, have you ever
flown one of these before?

1652
01:33:10,524 --> 01:33:12,215
- What's up?
- Because if not,

1653
01:33:12,250 --> 01:33:13,389
you probably don't know how

1654
01:33:13,423 --> 01:33:14,918
to handle updraft
between city buildings.

1655
01:33:14,942 --> 01:33:16,782
Honestly, I'm just surprised
I got this off the ground

1656
01:33:16,806 --> 01:33:18,290
without getting arrested.

1657
01:33:18,325 --> 01:33:20,672
Okay, well you should
probably land it quickly.

1658
01:33:20,707 --> 01:33:21,707
Declan.

1659
01:33:22,432 --> 01:33:24,020
Declan, go starboard.

1660
01:33:24,055 --> 01:33:24,952
Starboard? D-d-d-

1661
01:33:24,987 --> 01:33:26,160
Go starboard right now!

1662
01:33:26,195 --> 01:33:27,482
'Cause, I-I-I don't
really know how-

1663
01:33:27,506 --> 01:33:30,164
Pull up. Pull up before you...

1664
01:33:37,965 --> 01:33:39,760
Nice going, Declan.

1665
01:34:29,258 --> 01:34:32,848
June, I am so sorry. It's
just the updraft out there.

1666
01:34:32,882 --> 01:34:34,332
I don't really know.

1667
01:34:34,366 --> 01:34:35,057
And plus it, it's your dad's
building anyway and he-

1668
01:34:50,693 --> 01:34:54,317
We will not be needing
that.

1669
01:35:00,358 --> 01:35:02,222
Claire, honey. Spill it.

1670
01:35:02,256 --> 01:35:03,706
What are you not telling me?

1671
01:35:05,777 --> 01:35:06,916
No joke.

1672
01:35:08,090 --> 01:35:10,713
Now darling, let
me pitch you this.

1673
01:35:10,748 --> 01:35:14,234
Reverend Woking in America.

1674
01:35:14,268 --> 01:35:17,375
We are miles from making
any of those decisions.

1675
01:35:17,409 --> 01:35:19,170
Gotta get 'em in quick, right?

1676
01:35:19,204 --> 01:35:24,244
So what happens is, Woking
is called out of retirement

1677
01:35:25,521 --> 01:35:28,627
to chase down the dastardly
Flower Pot Killer.

1678
01:35:28,662 --> 01:35:32,700
He kills entirely
with flower pots.

1679
01:35:32,735 --> 01:35:35,807
Hmm.

1680
01:35:37,498 --> 01:35:38,498
Producers!

1681
01:35:39,777 --> 01:35:43,125
I've just had the most
wonderful idea for a revival.

1682
01:35:43,159 --> 01:35:45,817
How about ideas for
rebuilding the studio?

1683
01:35:45,852 --> 01:35:47,795
That's what we're supposed
to be working on, right?

1684
01:35:47,819 --> 01:35:49,648
Projects like this,

1685
01:35:49,683 --> 01:35:51,133
you've gotta get
a good lead time.

1686
01:35:51,167 --> 01:35:53,929
Uh-huh, and how about the lead
time on those contractors?

1687
01:35:53,963 --> 01:35:55,285
You're perfect for
that. You're a star.

1688
01:35:55,309 --> 01:35:57,242
You can marker, right?

1689
01:36:03,593 --> 01:36:07,080
Funny thing, nobody bothered
to clean out your desk.

1690
01:36:21,473 --> 01:36:22,889
What are you thinking?

1691
01:36:22,923 --> 01:36:24,649
Get out of the road!

1692
01:36:27,652 --> 01:36:29,309
Hey, buddy. Get out of here.

1693
01:36:29,343 --> 01:36:30,620
Bro!

1694
01:36:48,259 --> 01:36:51,055
Wow.

1695
01:36:51,089 --> 01:36:52,369
Someone's getting in the spirit.

1696
01:36:52,401 --> 01:36:54,472
Yeah.

1697
01:36:55,335 --> 01:36:56,577
Claire insisted on the hat.

1698
01:36:56,612 --> 01:36:57,993
Ah.

1699
01:36:58,027 --> 01:36:59,028
What do you think?

1700
01:36:59,063 --> 01:37:00,547
Oh, never looked better.

1701
01:37:01,789 --> 01:37:02,652
Okay, yeah.

1702
01:37:02,687 --> 01:37:05,621
Here.

1703
01:37:05,655 --> 01:37:07,071
- Oh, thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

1704
01:37:08,279 --> 01:37:10,281
You know, for putting
this on last minute,

1705
01:37:10,315 --> 01:37:12,559
it is not a bad Christmas party.

1706
01:37:12,593 --> 01:37:14,009
It's better than not bad.

1707
01:37:15,010 --> 01:37:16,977
It's better than great.

1708
01:37:17,012 --> 01:37:18,772
It's amazing.

1709
01:37:18,806 --> 01:37:21,119
And you need to learn
to take some credit

1710
01:37:21,154 --> 01:37:23,742
because you're the one who
put this whole thing together.

1711
01:37:28,333 --> 01:37:30,163
We have a lot of
work to do, don't we?

1712
01:37:30,197 --> 01:37:32,510
Yeah, but forget about that.

1713
01:37:34,063 --> 01:37:39,103
For now, it's Merry
Christmas, darling.

1714
01:37:41,933 --> 01:37:42,933
Let's fly.
