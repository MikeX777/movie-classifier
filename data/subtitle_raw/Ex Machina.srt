You're leaving me here?

00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,729
This is as close
as I'm allowed
to get to the building.

6
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,485

Hey-

Dude!

29
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,206
I've been
so looking forward
to this week with you.

30
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,521
Come in. Come on in.

31
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,601
Thanks.

32
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,329
You want something
to eat or drink
after yourjourney?

00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,771
No. No, thanks,
I'm fine.
Sure?

34
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,921
Yeah.

35
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,401
To be honest,
I thought we'd have, uh,

36
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,602
breakfast together,
but, um...

37
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,647
I can't really
eat anything.

38
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,762
I got the mother
of all fucking hangovers.
Oh, yeah?

wouldn't even believe.

a heavy night,

41
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,210
I, uh, compensate
the next morning.

42
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,409
Exercise. Anti-oxidants.
You know?

43
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,130
Yeah, sure.

44
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,170
Was it a good party?

45
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,928
Party?
Yeah. Wasn't there a party?

46
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,084
There wasn't a party.

47
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,161
Sorry.

48
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,726
Caleb, I'm just gonna
throw this out there,
so it's said, okay?

49
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,887
You're freaked out.

50
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,689
I am?
Yeah.
You're freaked out,

51
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,966
by the helicopter

52
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,326
and the mountains
and the house,

53
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,811
because it's all
so super-cool.

54
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,564
You're freaked out by me,
to be meeting me,

55
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,365
having this conversation
in this room,
at this moment. Right?

56
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,887
And I get that.
I get the moment
you're having, but...

57
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,886
Dude, can we just
get past that?

58
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,608
Can we just be two guys?
Nathan and Caleb.

59
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,445
Not the whole
employer-employee thing.

60
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,691
Yeah, okay.
Yeah?

00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,966
Yes. Uh, yeah.

00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,568
It's good to
meet you, Nathan.
(CLAPS HANDS)

It's good to
meet you, too, Caleb.

64
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,881
I guess the first thing
I should do is
explain your pass.

65
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,490
Now, it's simple enough.

66
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,688
It opens some doors
and it doesn't open others.

67
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,444
And that just makes
everything easy
for you, right?

68
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,567
Uh, yes.

69
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,444
Yeah, 'cause you're like,
"Oh, fuck, I'm in
someone else's house.

70
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,806
"Can I do this,
can I do that?"

71
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,928
And this card,
it just takes
all that worry away.

72
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,209
If you try a door
and it stays shut,
okay, it's off-limits.

73
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,568
You try another door
and it opens,
then it's for you.

74
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,369
Let's try this one.

Yeah.

78
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,885
It's your room.

79
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,809
You got a bed here.

80
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,642

86
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,564
What?
Sorry?

87
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,206
There's something wrong.
What's wrong?

88
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,646
There's nothing wrong.

89
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,291
It's the windows.

90
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,000
You're thinking
there's no windows.

91
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,521
It's subterranean.

92
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,602
It's not cozy,
it's claustrophobic.

93
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,409
No. No way. I wasn't
thinking that.

94
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,086
I was thinking,
"This is really cool."

95
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,766
Caleb, there's a reason
there are no windows
in this room.

96
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,211
There is?
Uh-huh.

97
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,524
This building
isn't a house.

98
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,602
It's a research facility.

is enough fiber optic cable

about what I'm researching,

102
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,130
I want to share it with you.

103
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,524
In fact, I want to
share it with you so much,
it's eating me up inside.

104
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,682

I need you
to do for me first.

do you know what

Yeah.

131
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,722
I know what
the Turing Test is.

132
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,124
It's when a human
interacts with a computer.

133
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,726
And if the human
doesn't know

134
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,246
they're interacting
with a computer,

135
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,321
the test is passed.

136
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,048
And what does
a pass tell us?

137
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,243
That the computer has
artificial intelligence.

in a Turing Test.

Only Nathan.

161
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,848
Then I guess we're both
in quite a similar position.

162
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,406
Haven't you met
lots of new people before?

163

know my name.

that I'm a machine.

Sure.

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,726
One what?

180
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,602
One year or one day?
One.

181
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,761
When did you learn
how to speak, Ava?

182
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,128
<i>I always knew
how to speak,</i>

183
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,007
<i>and that's strange,
isn't it?</i>

184
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,601
Why?

185
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,209
Becauselanguage
is something that
people acquire.

186
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,122
Well,
some people believe

187
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,804
language exists
from birth.

188
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,561
And what is learned
is the ability
to attach words

189
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,041
and structure to
the latent ability.
Do you agree with that?

190
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,965
<i>I don't know.</i>

191
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,206
<i>Will you come back
tomorrow, Caleb?</i>

192
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,321
<i>Yes.</i>

193
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,481
(CHUCKLES)

194
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,966
Good.

195
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,968
Oh, man,
she's fascinating.

196
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,651
When you talk to her,
you're just...

197
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,330
Through the looking glass.

198
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,366
"Through the looking glass."
Wow.

199
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,569
You're good
with words, Caleb.
You're quotable.

200
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,886
Actually, that's
someone else's quote.

201
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,850
You know, I wrote down
that other line
you came up with.

202
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,046
The one about how

203
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,924
if I've invented a machine
with consciousness,

204
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,525
I'm not a man, I'm God.

205
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,840
I don't think
that's exactly what I...

206
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,127
I just thought,
"Fuck, man,
that is so good."

207
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,601
When we get to
tell the story. You know?

208
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,409
I turned to Caleb,

209
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,126
and he looked up at me
and he said,

210
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,440
"You're not a man,
you're God."

211
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,965
(STUTTERS) Yeah,
but I didn't say that.

212
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,766

214
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,961
You're impressed.

215
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,208
(LAUGHING) Yes. Yes.

216
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,281
Although...
Although? (LAUGHING)

217
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,649
There's a qualification
to you being impressed?

218
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,200
No, there's no
qualification to her.

219
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,927
Uh, it's just
in the Turing Test,

220
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,123
the machine should be
hidden from the examiner.

221
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,810
No,no,no,
we're way past that.

222
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,291
If I hid Ava from you,

223
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,647
so you just
heard her voice,
she would pass for human.

224
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,610
The real test is to show you
that she's a robot

225
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,490
and then see
if you still feel
she has consciousness.

226
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,607
Mmm.

227
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,085
Yeah, I think
you're probably right.

228
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,441
(CHUCKLES)

229
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,486
Her language abilities,
they're incredible.

230
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,531
The system is stochastic.
Right?

231
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,409
It's non-deterministic.

232
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,686
At first I thought
she was mapping

233
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,525
from internal semantic form
to syntactic tree-structure

234
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,840
and then getting
linearized words.

235
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,685
But then I started
to realize the model
was some kind of hybrid.

236
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,966
Caleb.

237
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,641
No?

238
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,088
I understand that
you want me to
explain how Ava works.

239
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,362
But I'm sorry,
I'm not gonna be
able to do that.

240
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,171
Try me. I'm hot
on high-level abstraction.

241
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,050
It's not because I think
you're too dumb.

242
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,242
It's because I want to have
a beer and a conversation
with you.

243
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,367
Not a seminar.

244
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,807
(CHUCKLES)
Yeah. Sorry.

245
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,601
No, it's okay.
You're all right.

How do you feel
about her?

249
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,204
Nothing analytical.

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,807
Just how do you feel?

251
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,801
I feel

252
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,648
that she's fucking amazing.

253
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,126

through conversation
is kind of a closed loop.

It's a closed loop?
Yeah.

320
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,369
Like testing
a chess computer

00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,329

How else do you test

323

Well, it depends.

324
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,808
You know, I mean,
you can play it

325
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,247
to find out if it makes
good moves, but, uh...

326
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,681
But that won't
tell you if it knows

327
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,125
that it's playing chess.

328
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,204
And it won't tell you
if it knows what chess is.

329
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,522
Uh-huh. So it's
simulation versus actual.

Yes. Yeah.

331

And I think being
able to differentiate
between those two

332
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,209

you want me to perform.

how you felt about her

a great answer.

about you?

to be my friend?

355
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,881
Of course.

356
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,809
Will it be possible?

357
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,321
Why would it not be?

358
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,201
Our conversations
are one-sided.

359
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,008
You ask
circumspect questions
and study my responses.

360
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,721
Yes.

361
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,484
You learn about me

362
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,881
and I learn nothing
about you.

363
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,211
That's not a foundation
on which friendships
are based.

364
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,641
So what? You want me
to talk about myself?

365
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,725
Yes.
(CHUCKLES)

366
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,526
(STAMMERS) Where...

367
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,129
Okay, where do I start?

368
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,249
It's your decision.

369
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,560
I'm interested to see
what you'll choose.

370
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,961
Hmm.

371
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,088
Okay, Ava.

372
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,366
Well,

373
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,766
you know my name.

374
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,082
Yes.
I'm 26.

375
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,048
I work at Nathan's company.

376
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,523
Do you know
what his company is?

377
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,931
Blue Book.

378
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,202
Named after
Wittgenstein's notes.

379
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,090
It's the world's
most popular
internet search engine,

380
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:13,449
processing an average
of 94% of all internet
search requests.

381
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,603
That's exactly right.

382
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,162
Where do you live, Caleb?

383
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,528
Brookhaven, Long Island.

384
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,644
Is it nice there?

385
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,371
It's okay.

386
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,691
I got an apartment.
It's kind of small.

387
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,725
It's very small.

388
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,610
But, uh, it's a five-minute
walk to the office

389
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,286
and a five-minute
walk to the ocean,

390
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,805
which I like.

391
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,845
Are you married?

392
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,646
Um...

393
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,241
No.

394
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,164
Is your status single?

395
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,561
Yes.

396
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,083
What about your family?

397
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,324
(SIGHS) I grew up
in Portland, Oregon.

398
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,725
No brothers or sisters.

399
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,164
My parents were both
high school teachers.

400
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,606
And if we're getting
to know each other,

401
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,808
I guess I should tell you
they're both dead.

402
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,522
Car crash when I was 15.

403
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,601
In fact, I was
in the car with them.

404
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,011
Back seat.

405
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,763
But it was the front
that got the worst of it.

406
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,766
I'm sorry.

407
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,571
It's all right.

408
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,369
I spent a long time
in the hospital afterward.

409
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,444
Like nearly a year.

410
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,523
And I got into coding.

411
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,761
And by the time
I got to college,
I was pretty advanced.

412
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,368
An advanced programmer.

413
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,207
Yes.

414
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,800
Like Nathan.

415
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,006
Yes.

416
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,647
No.

417
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,486
It's different.

418
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,882
Nathan wrote
the Blue Book base code
when he was 13.

419
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,691
Which, if you
understand code,

420
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,366
what he did was like
Mozart or something.

421
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,124
Do you like Mozart?

422
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,406
I like Depeche Mode.

423
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,766
Do you like Nathan?

424
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,921
Yes, of course.

425
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,208
Is Nathan your friend?
My friend?

426
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,611
I... Yeah, I hope so.

427
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,205
A good friend?

428
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,164
CALEB: Um, yeah.

429
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,924
VVeH,no,no,no,
I mean, not a good friend.

430
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,162
A good friend is, uh...

431
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,925
We only just met
each other, you know.

432
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,686
So it takes time
to be able to, um...

433
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,607
To get to know
each other, I guess.

FEMALE <i>AUTOMATED</i> VOICE:
<i>Power cut.

435
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,846
Caleb.

436
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,205
You're wrong.

437
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,810
Wrong about what?

438
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,121
Nathan.

439
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,251
In what way?

440
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,764
He isn't your friend.

441
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,171
Excuse me?

442
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,040
I'm sorry, Ava,
I don't understand.

443
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,482
You shouldn't trust him.

444
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,331
You shouldn't trust
anything he says.

445
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,530
FEMALE <i>AUTOMATED</i> VOICE:
<i>Power restored.</i>

446
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,926
And if we made
a list of books

447
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,849
or works of art
which we both know,

448
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,810
it would form the ideal
basis of a discussion.
(CHIMES)

449
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,450
lsthatokay?

450
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,641
Caleb?

451
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,047
Mmm-hmm.

452
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,121
Yeah.

453
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,566
Good.

454
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,527
CALEB: Thank you.

455
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,647
Oh, shit! Are you
fucking kidding me?

456
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,329
Did it get on you?
No, no, it's, uh...

457
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,081
It's all right.
I got it.

458
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,651
Dude, you're wasting
your time talking to her.

459
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,848
She doesn't
understand English.
Just give her the napkin.

460
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,486
Sorry.

461
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,287
It's like a firewall
against leaks.

462
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,044
It means I can talk
trade secrets over dinner

463
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,202
and know
it'll go no further.

464
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,691
It also means that
I can't tell her that

465
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,489
I'm pissed when she's
so fucking clumsy

466
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,449
that she spills wine
over my house guest.

467
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,488
I think she gets
that you're pissed.

468
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,927
Yeah? Good.
Because I am pissed.

469
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,885
Hey, Kyoko.

470
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,600
Go-go.

471
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,685
It's funny.

472
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,326
You know.

473
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,762
No matter
how rich you get,

474
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,722
shit goes wrong.
You can't insulate
yourself from it.

475
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,241
(SIGHS)

476
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,562
I used to think
it was death and taxes
you couldn't avoid,

477
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,688
but it's actually
death and shit.

478
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,922
It's like these
power cuts.

479
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,289
You would not believe
how much I spent on
the generator system,

480
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,249
but I keep getting
failures every day.

481
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,606
Do you know
why they happen?

482
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,767
No.

483
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,410
The system was supposed
to be bulletproof,

484
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,881
but obviously the guys
that installed it
fucked something up.

485
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,770
Can't you just get them
to come back?

486
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,162
No. There's too much
classified stuff here.

487
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,766
So after the job was done,
I just had them all killed.

488
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,847
AnywaY-

489
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,048
Here's to your
second day, buddy.

490
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,120
Cheers.

491
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,606
Cheers.

492
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,570
So how did it go?
What do you have
to report?

493
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,891
You saw how the day went,
didn't you?

494
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,129
I mean, I assume
youWe,uh,

495
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,050
watching on the CCTV.

496
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,964
Sure. But I want to
hear your take on it.

497
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,564
Yeah, there was
one interesting thing
that happened with Ava today.

498
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,041
Yeah?
Yeah.

499
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,084
She made a joke.

500
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,523
Right. When she threw
your line back at you.
(CHUCKLES)

501
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,726
About being interested
to see what she'd choose.

502
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,040
Yeah, I noticed that, too.

503
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,691
Yeah, and it got me
thinking, it's, uh...

504
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,603
In a way,
it's the best
indication of Al

505
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,762
that I've seen
in her so far.

506
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,042
It's discretely complicated.

507
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,211
It's like, um...
It's kind of non-autistic.

508
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,925
What do you mean?

509
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,010
She could only do that
with an awareness

510
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,003
of her own mind,

511
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,645
and also
an awareness of mine.

512
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,161
Oh, she's aware
of you all right.
(CHUCKLES)

513
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,850
And what about
the power cut?

514
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,969
Sorry?
The power cut.

515
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,930
It's the only part
that I couldn't see.

516
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,651
Cameras fail,
I lose audio, the works.

517
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,884
So what happened?

518
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,686
Nothing.

519
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,481
Nothing? She didn't
remark on it at all?

520
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,841
No.

521
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,891
Not really.

522
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,246
Oh.

523
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,046
Hey-

524
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,287
Hey-

525
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,281
You want to see
something cool?

526
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,887
This is where
Ava was created.

527
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,489
Go ahead.
Take a look.

528
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,646
Sorry.

529
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,321
If you knew
the trouble I had

530
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,887
getting an Al
to read and duplicate
facial expressions.

531
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,569
You know how
I cracked it?

532
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,246
I don't know
how you did any of this.

533
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,569
Every cell phone,
just about,

534
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,122
has a microphone,
camera and a means
to transmit data.

535
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,405
So I turned on
every microphone
and camera

536
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,369
across the entire
fucking planet

537
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,684
and I redirected the data
through Blue Book. Boom!

538
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,323
Limitless resource of vocal
and facial interaction.

539
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,403
You hacked
the world's cell phones?

540
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,041
Yeah. And all
the manufacturers knew
I was doing it, too.

541
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,247
But they couldn't accuse me

542
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,847
without admitting
they were doing it
themselves.

543
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,166
Here,

544
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,684
we have her mind.

545
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,730
Structured gel.

546
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,285
I had to get away
from circuitry.

547
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,725
I needed something
that could

548
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,605
arrange and rearrange
on a molecular level,

549
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,921
but keep its form
when required.

550
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,485
Holding for memories.

551
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,130
Shifting for thoughts.

552
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,245
This is your hardware?

553
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,600
<i>Wetware.</i>

554
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,846
And the, uh, software?

555
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,768
Well, I'm sure
you can guess.

556
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,607
Blue Book.

557
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,722
Here's the weird thing
about search engines.

558
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,211
It was like

559
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:20,525
striking oil in a world
that hadn't invented
internal combustion.

560
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,206
Too much raw material.
Nobody knew
what to do with it.

561
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,562
You see, my competitors,

562
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,130
they were fixated
on sucking it up

563
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,447
and monetizing via shopping
and social media.

564
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,284
They thought that
search engines were

565
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,771
a map of what
people were thinking.

566
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,724
But actually they were a map
of how people were thinking.

567
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,840
Impulse.

568
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,846
Response.

569
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,241
Fluid.

570
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,331
Imperfect.

571
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,805
Patterned.

572
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,286
Chaotic.

573
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,685
I drew the picture
of something specific.

574
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,285
As you asked.

575
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,561
You said it would be
interesting to see
what I would draw.

576
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,204
Is it interesting?

577
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,969
Yes. it is.

578
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,211
You've never been
outside this building?

579
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,607
No.

580
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,527
You've never
walked outside?

581
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:46,124
I've never been
outside the room
I am in now.

582
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,882
Where would you go
if you did go outside?

583
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,601
(CHUCKLES)

584
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,930
I'm not sure.

585
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,648
There are so many options.

586
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:01,081
Maybe a busy pedestrian
and traffic intersection
in a city.

587
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,124
A traffic intersection?

588
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,964
Is that a bad idea?

589
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,884
No. Uh...

590
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,803
It wasn't what
I was expecting.

591
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,406
A traffic intersection
would provide a concentrated

592
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,323
but shifting view
of human life.

593
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,320
People watching.

594
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,807
Yes.

595
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,881
Mmm.

596
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,810
We could go together.

597
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,651
It's a date.

598
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,887
There's something else
I wanted to show you.

599
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,841
Okay-

600
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,850
You might think
it's stupid.

601
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,846
I don't think I will.
Whatever it is.

602
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,485
Then close your eyes.

603
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,521
Okay-

604
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,964
Now open your eyes.

605
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,365
How do I look?

606
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,160
You look

607
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,921
good.

608
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,402
This is what I'd wear
on our date.

609
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,931
Right. First a traffic
intersection.

610
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,690
Then maybe a show.

611
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,808
I'd like us
to go on a date.

612
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,689
Yeah. Yeah.

613
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,164
It would be fun.

614
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,366
Are you attracted to me?

615
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:57,047
What?
Are you attracted to me?

616
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,006
You give me indications
that you are.

617
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,645
I do?
Yes.

618
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,370
How?
Micro expressions.

619
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,487
Micro expressions.

620
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,404
The way your eyes
fix on my eyes and lips.

621
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,722
The way you hold my gaze

622
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,726
or don't.

623
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,204
Do you think about me
when we aren't together?

624
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,249
Sometimes at night,

625
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,764
I'm wondering if you're
watching me on the cameras.

626
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,009
And I hope you are.

627
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,847
Now your micro expressions
are telegraphing discomfort.

628
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:52,411
I am not sure
you'd call them micro.

629
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,250
I don't want to
make you feel
uncomfortable.

630
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,326
CALEB: I got a question.

631
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,046
NATHAN: Okay.
CALEB: Why did you
give her sexuality?

632
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,842
An Al doesn't need
a gender.

633
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,162
She could have been
a gray box.

634
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,363
Hmm. Actually,
I don't think that's true.

635
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,244
Can you give an example
of consciousness,

636
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,049
at any level,
human or animal,

637
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,929
that exists without
a sexual dimension?

638
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,527
They have sexuality
as an evolutionary
reproductive need.

639
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,602
What imperative
does a gray box have

640
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,842
to interact
with another gray box?

641
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,090
Can consciousness exist
without interaction?

642
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,807
Anyway,
sexuality is fun, man.

643
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,805
If you're gonna exist,
why not enjoy it?

644
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,370
What? You want to
remove the chance

645
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,721
of her falling in love
and fucking?

646
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,040
And in answer to
your real question,

647
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,809
you bet she can fuck.

648
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,046
What?

649
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,202
In between her legs,
there's an opening,

650
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,567
with a concentration
of sensors.

651
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,121
You engage them
in the right way,

652
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,521
creates a pleasure response.

653
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,806
So if you wanted
to screw her,

654
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,888
mechanically speaking,
you could.

655
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,689
And she'd enjoy it.

656
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,085
That wasn't
my real question.

657
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,725
Oh, okay. Sorry.

658
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,283
My real question was,

659
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,168
did you give her sexuality

660
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,890
as a diversion tactic?

661
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:17,961
I don't follow.

662
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,281
Like a stage magician
with a hot assistant.

663
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:23,091
So a hot robot
who clouds your ability
to judge her Al?

664
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,685
Exactly. So...

665
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,362
Did you program her
to flirt with me?

666
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,965
If I did,
would that be cheating?

667
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,565
Wouldn't it?

668
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,240
(SIGHS)

669
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,688
Caleb, what's your type?

670
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,209
Of girl?
No, of salad dressing.

671
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,850
Yeah, of girl.
What's your type of girl?

672
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,406
You know what?
Don't even answer that.
Let's say it's black chicks.

673
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,761
Okay, that's your thing.

674
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,882
For the sake of argument,
that's your thing, okay?

675
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,564
Why is that your thing?

676
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,969
Because you did
a detailed analysis
of all racial types

677
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,930
and you cross-referenced
that analysis with
a points-based system?

678
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,001
No!

679
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,611
You're just attracted
to black chicks.

680
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:05,090
A consequence of
accumulated external stimuli

681
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,285
that you probably
didn't even register
as they registered with you.

682
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:11,045
Did you program her
to like me, or not?

683
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:14,688
(SIGHS) I programmed her
to be heterosexual.

684
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,402
Just like you were
programmed to be
heterosexual.

685
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:18,766
Nobody programmed me
to be straight.

686
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,241
You decided to be straight?
Please.

687
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,924
Of course
you were programmed.

688
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,809
By nature or nurture,
or both.

689
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,729
And to be honest, Caleb,
you're starting to
annoy me now,

690
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,842
because this is
your insecurity talking.

691
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,490
This is not your intellect.

692
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,730
Come with me.

693
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,001
(CHIMES)

694
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,642
You know
this guy, right?

695
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,604
Jackson Pollock.
Jackson Pollock.
That's right.

696
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:49,966
The drip painter.

697
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,088
Okay. He let
his mind go blank,

698
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,083
and his hand go
where it wanted.

699
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,202
Not deliberate,
not random.

700
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,089
Some place in between.

701
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,367
They called it
automatic art.

702
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,808
Let's make this
like Star Trek, okay?

703
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,530
Engage intellect.

704
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,281
Excuse me?

705
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,600
I'm Kirk. Your head's
the warp drive.

706
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,682
Engage intellect.

707
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:15,044
What if Pollock
had reversed
the challenge?

708
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,726
What if
instead of making art

709
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,290
without thinking,
he said, "You know what?

710
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,964
"I can't paint anything,

711
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,361
"unless I know exactly
why I'm doing it."

712
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,522
What would have happened?

713
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,765
He never would have
made a single mark.

714
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,487
Yes! You see,
there's my guy,
there's my buddy,

715
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:36,211
who thinks before
he opens his mouth.

716
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,925
He never would have
made a single mark.

717
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:45,684
The challenge is
not to act automatically.

718
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,925
It's to find an action
that is not automatic.

719
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,890
From painting,
to breathing, to talking,

720
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,045
to fucking.

721
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,244
To falling in love.

722
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:05,248
And for the record,
Ava's not pretending
to like you.

723
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,322
And her flirting
isn't an algorithm
to fake you out.

724
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,684
You're the first man
she's met that isn't me.

725
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,762
And I'm like
her dad, right?

726
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,164
Can you blame her
for getting a crush on you?

727
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,805
No, you can't.

728
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,842
When I was in college,
I did a semester
on Al theory.

729
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:48,284
There was
a thought experiment
they gave us.

730
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,484
It's called
"Mary in the Black
and White Room."

731
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,929
Mary is a scientist,

732
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,806
and her specialist
subject is color.

733
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,881
She knows everything
there is to know about it.

734
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,200
The wavelengths.

735
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:05,884
The neurological effects.

736
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,606
Every possible property
that color can have.

737
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,965
But she lives in
a black and white room.

738
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:17,320
<i>She was born there
and raised there.</i>

739
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,403
<i>And she can only observe
the outside world</i>

740
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,881
on a black and white monitor.

741
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,525
And then one day
someone opens the door.

742
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,364
<i>And Mary walks out.</i>

743
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,368
<i>And she sees a blue sky.</i>

744
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,442
<i>And at that moment,
she learns something</i>

745
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,761
<i>that all her studies
couldn't tell her.</i>

746
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:45,930
<i>She learns
what it feels like
to see color.</i>

747
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,930
The thought experiment
was to show the students

748
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,288
the difference
between a computer
and a human mind.

749
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,488
The computer is Mary
in the black
and white room.

750
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:01,291
The human is when
she walks out.

751

759
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,568

Don't you think
it's possible that
he's watching us?

Right now?

770
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,690
That the blackouts
are orchestrated,

771
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,000
so he can see
how we behave

772
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,923
when we think
we're unobserved.

773
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,524
I charge my batteries

I didn't win

I wasn't

783
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,001
part of a lottery.
I was selected.

784
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:28,362
It's obvious,
once I stop to think.

785
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,568
Why would you randomly
select an examiner

786
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,369
for the Turing Test?

787
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:35,762

789
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:40,044
The competition
was a smokescreen.

790
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:42,805
I didn't want
anyone to know
what I was doing here,

793
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:49,728
I needed someone
that would ask
the right questions.

794
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,131

01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:57,283
Ava...
Will it be bad?

888
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,001
I don't know.

889
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:02,765
Do you think
I might be switched off,

890
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,609
because I don't function
as well as I'm supposed to?

891
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:08,321
Ava, I don't know
the answer to
your question.

892
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,445
It's not up to me.

893
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,443
Why is it up to anyone?

894
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,971
Do you have people
who test you and might
switch you off?

895
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:19,202
No, I don't.
Then why do I?

Do you want to be with me?

901
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,529
Why did you make Ava?

902
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:19,806
That's an odd question.

903
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:21,325
Wouldn't you,
if you could?

904
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:23,966
Maybe.

905
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:27,930
I don't know.

(SCOFFS)

907
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,086
I'm asking
why you did it.

908
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,561
Look, the arrival of strong
artificial intelligence

909
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:37,001
has been inevitable
for decades.

910
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:40,250
The variable was
"when," not "if."

911
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:43,642
So I don't see
Ava as a decision,
just an evolution.

912
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:51,162
I think it's the next model

913
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:54,331
that's gonna be
the real breakthrough.

914
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,650
The singularity.

915
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:58,161
Next model?

916
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,245
After Ava.

917
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:06,002
I didn't know
there was gonna be
a model after Ava.

918
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,608
Yeah, why? You thought
she was a one-off?

919
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:13,562
No, I knew there must
have been prototypes.
So I...

920
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:18,369
I knew she wasn't the first,
but I thought maybe the last.

921
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:21,410
Well, Ava doesn't exist
in isolation any more
than you or me.

922
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:22,601
She's part
of a continuum.

923
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:24,330
So Version 9.6 and so on.

924
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:26,920
And each time they get
a little bit better.

925
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:35,967
When you make a new model,
what do you do
with the old one?

926
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,524
Well, I, uh,

927
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:41,524
download the mind,
unpack the data.

928
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,884
Add in the new routines
I've been writing.

929
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:50,123
And to do that you end up
partially formatting,
so the memories go.

930
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:53,285
But the body survives.

931
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:55,203
And Ava's body
is a good one.

932
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,043

noticed that I've been

somewhat overdoing it
recently.

1042

you go right ahead,

1050
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,809

is when you tell me

1051
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,484
