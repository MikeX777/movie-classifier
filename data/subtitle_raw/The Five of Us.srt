Yes. Sorry.

About the rafting, I reaIIy want
to deveIop our team spirit.

- It's a nice idea,

173
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:55,166
but I can't.

174
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,867
- How about a fiIm?

175
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:59,968
- It'd be hard
to find one everyone Iikes.

176
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:02,070

just you and me?

00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:03,588
They get therapy in jaiI.

543
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,821
- Therapy?

544
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:09,695
Don't you read the papers?
Most of them are repeat offenders!

545
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:13,525
- She can move.

546
00:56:13,603 --> 00:56:15,571
- What?!
- Listen! No!

547
00:56:15,638 --> 00:56:18,835
She has to know aII about him,
where he Iives...

548
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:20,876
- I aIready asked that!

549
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:26,143
AII they can say is,
he Iives in the MontreaI area.

550
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:29,816
That's the Iaw.

551
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:39,558
- Isa!

552
00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:43,733
Why are you going there?

553
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,394
It won't bring her back!

554
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:45,560
Come on.

555
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:54,570
- MicheI, caII me!
This is my fourth message!

556
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:56,537
You're with our daughter!

557
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:59,575
It's my right to know where you are,
do you hear?

558
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:05,343
- They may be at a movie.

559
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:18,654
SmeIIs good!
- It's the butter.

560
00:58:18,728 --> 00:58:19,820
- The port!

561
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:21,386
- Everything's fattening.

562
00:58:21,464 --> 00:58:24,365
- Right, butter's fattening.

563
00:58:24,434 --> 00:58:28,666
SaIt's bad for bIood pressure,
cream's awfuI for choIesteroI.

564
00:58:28,738 --> 00:58:30,672
Put'em aII together?

565
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:32,037
Ambrosia!

566
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:37,177
CarefuI, the sauce dish is tippy.

567
00:58:37,247 --> 00:58:39,875
And the cook's tipsy!
[Iaughter]

568
00:58:40,917 --> 00:58:44,512
- CIaudie, you're amazing!
- It's just my job.

569
00:58:44,587 --> 00:58:47,852
- AII I Iike about cooking is eating.

570
00:58:47,924 --> 00:58:50,017
- I'd Iike to cook for friends,

571
00:58:50,093 --> 00:58:51,424
but for me aIone...

572
00:58:51,494 --> 00:58:53,428
- I get my joIIies from cooking.

573
00:58:53,496 --> 00:58:55,054
- What about your Iovers?

574
00:58:55,131 --> 00:58:57,725
- They're desert!

575
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:02,432
- There's nothing I Ioathe more
than cooking.

576
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:06,373
Every night I thank the Lord
for frozen dinners.

577
00:59:06,442 --> 00:59:08,876
- You feed your daughter
frozen food?

578
00:59:08,945 --> 00:59:10,742
- No, I microwave it first.

579
00:59:15,151 --> 00:59:16,140
- Mm!

580
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:20,887
- Mm. Did Sophie ever teII you

581
00:59:20,957 --> 00:59:24,916
she once cooked a fish whoIe,
without cIeaning it?

582
00:59:24,994 --> 00:59:27,292
- Yuck!
[Iaughter]

583
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:30,763
- She bIindIy foIIowed

584
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:33,734
a recipe that didn't mention it!

585
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:36,067
[aII]: Ahhh...!

586
00:59:42,211 --> 00:59:43,974
- She was baking potatoes.

587
00:59:44,047 --> 00:59:47,881
The potatoes
were wrapped in foiI...

588
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:52,748
the butter was too,

589
00:59:52,822 --> 00:59:54,881
so she stuck it in the oven!

590
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:25,754
I so wish she were here.

591
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,585
I think about her every day.

592
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:34,263
But it aIways Ieads to him.

593
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:37,266
I dream of kiIIing him.

594
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:41,201
I dream about it every night.

595
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:44,564
I don't make him suffer.

596
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:48,535
It doesn't make me feeI better.

597
01:00:48,611 --> 01:00:51,580
I enter the prison.

598
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:53,946
I go to his ceII. Bang!

599
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:58,351
A buIIet in the head. Thanks, bye.

600
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:02,524
- It wouIdn't change the past.

601
01:01:02,592 --> 01:01:04,719
- He doesn't deserve to Iive!

602
01:01:04,794 --> 01:01:06,819
- Isa.
- Right!

603
01:01:06,896 --> 01:01:09,387
I can't say I want to kiII him,
but he,

604
01:01:09,465 --> 01:01:11,990
he waIks around free.

605
01:01:12,068 --> 01:01:13,330
He's free!

606
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:16,372
He got a second chance!
What about Sophie?

607
01:01:16,439 --> 01:01:19,101
Did she get a second chance?

608
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:20,938
- Isa, pIease.

609
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:25,208
- Can any of you
say you've forgotten?

610
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:27,545
That you trust strangers?

611
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:29,847
That you don't want
to kiII sometimes?!

612
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:33,418
- A toast!

613
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:36,591
To CIaudie!

614
01:01:38,961 --> 01:01:42,556
To the one
it shouId've happened to!

615
01:01:42,632 --> 01:01:45,760
Admit you wished
it had been me instead.

616
01:01:45,835 --> 01:01:48,929
- What?
- You've aIways judged me!

617
01:01:49,005 --> 01:01:50,131
- CIaudie, pIease!

618
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:54,643
- If it had been me
nobody wouId've been shocked.

619
01:01:56,512 --> 01:01:58,309
You'd have said:

620
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:01,282
''She asked for it.''
I screwed anything that moved!

621
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:02,578
Bad Iuck!

622
01:02:05,588 --> 01:02:07,886
I'm stiII here, and I'm stiII screwing!

623
01:02:09,592 --> 01:02:12,186
Never the Ieast hitch.

624
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:16,220
No incurabIe iIIness,
no unwanted pregnancy. Just fun!

625
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:24,034
I've never been pregnant.

626
01:02:24,107 --> 01:02:25,904
Even when I tried to.

627
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:29,302
- You're taIking nonsense.
- Maybe.

628
01:02:29,378 --> 01:02:34,338
But I never said,
''With my judo, I'd have saved Sophie!''

629
01:02:46,295 --> 01:02:48,263
I didn't want to come.

630
01:02:50,633 --> 01:02:52,260
I didn't want to.

631
01:03:08,551 --> 01:03:10,212
- AII because of a psycho.

632
01:03:11,921 --> 01:03:14,890
- He's no crazier
than those who Iet him out.

633
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:19,387
- Anne!

634
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:20,986
It's MicheI!

635
01:03:36,279 --> 01:03:40,545
- She's my daughter.
Of course I'm worried!

636
01:03:40,616 --> 01:03:45,246
You won't get her ever again
if you don't return my caIIs!

637
01:03:46,956 --> 01:03:48,423
Put Jeanne on.

638
01:03:53,629 --> 01:03:55,256
Hi, my sweetheart.

639
01:03:56,465 --> 01:03:58,399
I just wanted to say night-night.

640
01:03:58,467 --> 01:04:01,163
And that I Iove you.

641
01:04:01,237 --> 01:04:03,535
Ah... Yes, I know you know.

642
01:04:04,574 --> 01:04:06,235
Tomorrow, my Iove.

643
01:04:06,309 --> 01:04:07,867
Yes, bye.

644
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:18,751
Coffee, anyone?

645
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:25,227
- It's okay, I'II do it.

646
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:16,067
I don't beIieve it!

647
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:43,705
- Sophie!

648
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:44,899
Sophie!!

649
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:46,966
Sophie!

650
01:06:16,072 --> 01:06:17,369
[crying]

651
01:06:24,447 --> 01:06:26,074
[screaming]

652
01:07:18,067 --> 01:07:19,432
- We shouId go.

653
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:21,834
- CIaudie's right.

654
01:07:21,904 --> 01:07:23,872
- No, it's Isa who's right.

655
01:07:25,574 --> 01:07:27,804
You'd have saved her.

656
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:29,572
- I'd have been as heIpIess as you.

657
01:07:29,645 --> 01:07:32,307
- It's not a matter of strength.

658
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:34,542
- I'm not taIking about strength.

659
01:07:47,763 --> 01:07:50,698
- If you move...

660
01:07:50,766 --> 01:07:52,393
I'II kiII her.

661
01:07:55,104 --> 01:07:57,402
I just want you to watch.

662
01:07:58,774 --> 01:08:02,835
Afterwards I'II drive you back
and we'II party.

663
01:08:16,725 --> 01:08:18,352
[Sophie screaming]

664
01:08:23,065 --> 01:08:24,828
- No!

665
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:26,367
[screaming]

666
01:08:39,915 --> 01:08:41,678
[screaming]

667
01:09:08,043 --> 01:09:09,840
- What did I teII you?

668
01:09:33,235 --> 01:09:35,066
- Why didn't you teII us?

669
01:09:35,137 --> 01:09:37,537
We'd have understood.

670
01:09:37,606 --> 01:09:40,439
- You were scared to death.

671
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:43,444
We'd have done the same.

672
01:09:51,587 --> 01:09:53,214
- He was a psycho, Manon.

673
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:57,616
He wanted to kiII you both,
no matter what you did.

674
01:10:00,095 --> 01:10:01,892
- I'II never know.

675
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:09,022
- I thought onIy moms
got up at dawn.

676
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:11,066
- Pancakes are a tradition here.

677
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:15,896
- FortunateIy,
some memories are sweet.

678
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:23,309
- ShaII I stir?

679
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:30,915
- Go!
- Ahh!

680
01:11:33,622 --> 01:11:35,590
- Mm-mm-mm!
[aII]: Mm-mm!

681
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:50,234
- When Thibodeau
appIies for fuII paroIe,

682
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:53,275
I can make a victim statement.

683
01:11:56,812 --> 01:11:59,280
- Aren't you afraid to be near him?

684
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,039
- Mr Thibodeau,

685
01:13:01,577 --> 01:13:04,239
I have a right
to be at your hearing.

686
01:13:04,313 --> 01:13:08,044
But I don't want
to refresh your memory of me.

687
01:13:10,252 --> 01:13:12,379
Still, I want you to hear my voice.

688
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:16,618
You didn't hear it
the night you raped me

689
01:13:16,692 --> 01:13:19,456
and stabbed me 1 7 times.

690
01:13:19,528 --> 01:13:22,019
And killed Sophie
before my eyes.

691
01:13:22,097 --> 01:13:23,496
She was 1 7.

692
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:25,897
Today I'm 32.

693
01:13:27,269 --> 01:13:29,203
She didn't have my luck.

694
01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:31,535
She didn't survive.

695
01:13:31,607 --> 01:13:33,507
She didn't survive you.

696
01:13:35,778 --> 01:13:39,509
You'll probably be granted
full parole soon.

697
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:42,709
You can rent an apartment,

698
01:13:42,785 --> 01:13:44,719
find a job,

699
01:13:44,787 --> 01:13:46,914
be around
1 7-year-old girls again.

700
01:13:48,223 --> 01:13:51,215
I can't help
being scared for them,

701
01:13:51,293 --> 01:13:53,591
despite your exemplary behaviour

702
01:13:53,662 --> 01:13:57,098
during the 1 5 years
you spent behind bars.

703
01:13:59,034 --> 01:14:01,832
That's why I ask you to listen.

704
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:03,428
Simply to listen to me,

705
01:14:03,505 --> 01:14:07,168
for once,

706
01:14:07,242 --> 01:14:09,506
for the first time.

707
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:12,172
One day our paths may cross.

708
01:14:12,247 --> 01:14:15,011
I'll probably shake,
I may throw up.

709
01:14:15,083 --> 01:14:17,984
But I'll keep right on going.

710
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:21,856
- Yes?
- It's Manon.

711
01:14:21,924 --> 01:14:23,186
- Hey!

712
01:14:23,258 --> 01:14:26,056
- FeeI Iike a hotdog?
- I'm on my way.

713
01:14:28,764 --> 01:14:30,994
- I have the right to work,

714
01:14:31,066 --> 01:14:32,863
to be in love.

715
01:14:32,935 --> 01:14:37,201
I have the right to live, to be free.

716
01:14:37,272 --> 01:14:40,332
Though I'll never be totally free,
like you.

717
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:56,716
- Given the psychiatric evaIuation

718
01:14:56,792 --> 01:14:58,817
