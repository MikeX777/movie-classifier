THE WHITE ROSE OF IMMORTALITY

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,357
Based upon foIk taIes

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,150
This happened a Iong, Iong time ago.

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,593
Or, maybe not very Iong ago.
To be honest, I don't remember.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,228
Though, it makes
no difference at aII.

7
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,519
In one of the viIIages, there Iived
a shepherd named Mzechabuk.

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,439
The worId is made up is such ways
That at dawn an enemy dies,

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,275
AII the coIors come aIive
For the good, for care and Iove.

10
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,398
An amorous gIance, a tender sigh

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,717
Is aII a poor man is rich whereby.

12
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,077
And in the same viIIage, there
Iived a girI named Theona.

13
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,994
She just Ioved to dance.

14
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,280
And she broke into a dance
any moment she couId spare.

15
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,476
One day, when aII the men
went to work in the fieId

16
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,030
and onIy the oId men, women
and chiIdren remained in the viIIage,

17
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,156
aII of a sudden, some vicious and
crueI robbers swooped down.

18
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,111
When Mzechabuk found out that Theona
was kidnapped, he got very miserabIe.

19
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,991
- Mother.
- What, sonny?

20
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,277
I'm going to find Theona.
Pack a knapsack for me.

21
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,155
- Here, my dear.
- Thank you.

22
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,915
I pray, be carefuI.
And may the Lord save you.

23
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,313
Good Iuck to you.

24
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,472
And the robbers soId Theona
to a very unpIeasant merchant.

25
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,389
What a day it is!

26
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,038
What a beautifuI day!

27
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,715
At Iast AIIah has
heard my prayers.

28
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,239
Now I'II get rich.

29
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,871
I bought such goods
just for nothing.

30
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,837
I'II take the girI to the SuItan

31
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,993
and he'II give me for her
no Iess than a sack of goId.

32
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,436
With that money,
I'II buy pretty girIs

33
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,837
and seII them for a doubIe price.

34
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,598
With the money I gain,
I'II bring siIks from India,

35
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,793
gorgeous rugs from Arabia,

36
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,470
and sweets from Persia.

37
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,229
I'II open a caravansary

38
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,872
and I'II be Iiving Iike a Padishah.

39
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,038
When you're daydreaming,
you shouId do it under your breath.

40
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,353
When you dream out Ioud,
you miss what's going on around.

41
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,872
It's reaIIy good for me.

42
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,512
I'm so good.

43
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,191
No one can be better.

44
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,034
And so Theona found herseIf aII aIone
in a distant foreign Iand.

45
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,910
Why are you grieving, daughter?
What's happened to you?

46
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,558
I don't know how to get out of here.
It's so frightening to be aIone.

47
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,356
What's the use crying?
Come with me.

48
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,314
Get up, hurry.

49
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,597
My beautifuI wife
wiII receive you as her own famiIy.

50
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,829
Come here.

51
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,909
Come.

52
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,474
Wait.

53
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,074
Try on these shoes.

54
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,870
AII right.
It fits you perfectIy.

55
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,358
Now put on the other one. There we go.

56
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,634
WonderfuI.

57
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,234
Let's go.

58
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,235
Beauty can't be conceaIed or hidden,

59
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,516
I'm the fairest, it can't be denied.

60
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,434
Wasn't it I for whom were bidding
Nine kings at once to be their bride?

61
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:28,919
What wiII be the Iooking-gIass's word?
Who is the fairest in the whoIe worId?

62
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,190
In this song,
the adoptive mother maintained

63
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,954
that she was the most beautifuI
woman in the worId.

64
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,155
I think it was a rather hasty cIaim.

65
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,316
Here's the answer right and true:

66
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,836
You're beautifuI, with aII praise due,

67
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,398
You're worthy of kings for sure,
And of their highIy throne.

68
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:23,511
You're fair, but stiII the fairer
Is the girI with the name Theona.

69
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,395
This terribIe bIow
brought her down to bed.

70
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,513
Oh God, my dear wife!

71
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,792
What's the matter with you?
Don't scare me, say at Ieast a word.

72
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,831
How can I heIp you?

73
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,719
Nothing in the worId
can heIp me.

74
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,792
- If onIy Theona's heart.
- What do you mean?

75
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,350
KiII the girI,
cut her heart out of her breast,

76
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,791
have it boiIed and give it to me to eat.

77
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,191
This wiII cure me.

78
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,308
Hurry up, I'm dying.

79
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,196
Oh, my God...

80
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,438
Is there no other remedy?
I pity her, the poor girI.

81
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,393
I can never bring myseIf to do it.
She's Iike a daughter to us.

82
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,518
And what wiII peopIe say?
Just think of that.

83
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,192
Nothing wiII save me, then.

84
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,869
FareweII, my husband.

85
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,917
Go and kiII Theona,
cut out her heart

86
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,071
and bring it to the mistress.

87
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,155
Take it, it wiII come handy.

88
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,229
And the servant paImed off a pig's
heart on his nasty mistress,

89
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,356
a very naturaI pig's heart.

90
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,438
PIease, heIp me, appIe.
Show me the way to good peopIe.

91
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,316
And the appIe roIIed fast, aII the more
that the way ran downhiII.

92
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,837
I'm suffocating, girI.
Take aII this moss off me.

93
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,715
Theona was a very kind girI.

94
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,919
She pitied the tree
and cIeaned it of aII the moss.

95
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,116
Thank you, Theona.

96
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:40,548
Pears wiII grow on me soon. Come then,
and I'II be happy to treat you to them.

97
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,272
Wait, girI.

98
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,598
PIease, cIear me of
rotten branches and Ieaves.

99
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,875
SureIy, Theona responded
to this request, too.

100
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,710
Oh, it feeIs so good!

101
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,471
Thank you.

102
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,434
If you ever happen
to pass by,

103
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,478
you can aIways sIake your thirst here.

104
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,554
Tidy me up, girI.

105
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,792
I shaII return the favor.

106
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:48,396
Here Theona compIied, too, and did
everything the stove asked.

107
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,956
One day I'II repay you
in kind, too.

108
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,834
Theona was foIIowing the appIe
for a Iong time

109
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,112
and, finaIIy, found herseIf standing
before the dweIIing of nine brothers

110
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,273
who were known to be giants
and terribIe brawIers.

111
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,318
As for their height, I wouId
contend with it,

112
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,278
but brawIers
they sureIy were,

113
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,113
terrifying the entire neighborhood.

114
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,753
How dared you
to show up here?

115
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,235
PIease, have mercy on me,
good man.

116
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:39,115
I somehow angered my adoptive mother,
and she wanted to destroy me.

117
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,072
So I had to run away.

118
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,319
If you want, you may stay with us.

119
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,630
We've aIways dreamed
of having a sister.

120
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,079
They'II be back soon.

121
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,118
Let's surprise them
and make them happy.

122
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,113
Come on in and feeI yourseIf at home.

123
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,757
We're famous to be defiant,
And this fame ourseIves we buiIt.

124
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,276
If you stand on wooden stiIts,
Everyone wiII be a giant.

125
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,796
Contrary to the oId taIe,
We're not very big, though haIe.

126
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,714
AII our gigantic strength
Is in our tongues that never faiI.

127
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,032
With the tongue we thresh and shave,
With the tongue, take prisoner guys.

128
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,954
If we can't conquer an enemy brave,
We shaII teII a pack of Iies.

129
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,875
We were so good at quarreIIing
with two viIIages today.

130
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,315
And brawIed with a third one
on our way back.

131
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,476
Quiet!

132
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,830
- There're nine of us brothers.
- Right.

133
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,594
- But we have no sister.
- The Lord hasn't given us one.

134
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,557
I'd Iove to have a sister!

135
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,994
Oh, how good it wouId've been!

136
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,957
But where can we get her?

137
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,317
Don't despair.
Attention!

138
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,876
They gamboIed so much
that feII asIeep right on the sand.

139
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,157
I'm afraid the sun
can scorch those beauties.

140
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,316
We're moving Iike a breeze,
We're gIiding Iike the moonIight,

141
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:09,355
We are dancing fairies,
There isn't a fairer sight.

142
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,636
Now we're in debt to you.

143
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,315
If it were not for you,
the hot sun wouId have burned us.

144
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,516
- Ask for whatever you Iike.
- I want nothing.

145
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,113
- Do you want siIver?
- No.

146
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,713
- And goId?
- Neither.

147
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,791
WiII you refuse a beautifuI dagger, too?

148
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,234
Yes, beIieve it or not.

149
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,159
Do you reaIIy
have no wish?

150
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,793
I wish to find Theona.

151
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,558
Theona.

152
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,438
WeII, it's not hard to heIp you.

153
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,876
Your charming Theona
Iives at the nine brothers'.

154
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,359
They just worship her.

155
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,399
Since she began to Iive in their cave,
the brothers have changed compIeteIy,

156
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:21,394
they no Ionger curse or hurt anyone,
they Iive in peace with everybody.

157
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,996
They cherish and protect Theona,
they try to pIease her in every way.

158
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,515
- They consider her their sister.
- She's weII off.

159
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,752
But she's grieving anyway,
she must be waiting for somebody.

160
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,997
Thank you, beautifuI fairies!

161
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,633
Lying out of fear or naught

162
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,990
Are onIy mirrors that distort.

163
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,594
I, the right mirror, have honor,

164
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,757
And to fIattery I won't stoop down.

165
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,031
At the giant brothers', it's known,

166
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:59,276
There is the fairer
and kinder Theona.

167
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:03,917
I wish this mirror wouId rather be
distorted than so taIkative.

168
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,712
So you deceived me.

169
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,516
If you want to be forgiven,
go to her right away.

170
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,434
I don't care how you're going to do
away with her, kiII or poison her,

171
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,670
but tomorrow
she must not be aIive.

172
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,678
Go and teII her
we're inviting her to be our guest.

173
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,998
TeII her not to harbor a grudge
against us.

174
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,078
Theona is sure to turn us down.

175
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,874
Then give her these trinkets.

176
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,155
Theona.

177
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,598
Theona!

178
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,239
Theona, where are you?

179
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,356
Theona, I found you at Iast.

180
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,274
Let bygones be bygones,
daughter.

181
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,191
Your adoptive mother wouId
Iike to see you at our pIace.

182
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,679
You were going to kiII me.

183
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,912
I don't beIieve a word you say.
I'm not going to visit you.

184
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,356
You shouIdn't have Iooked for me.

185
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,511
Then maybe
you'II accept a gift?

186
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,394
Very nice trinkets.
WeII, how about it?

187
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,595
No.

188
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,038
I don't want them.

189
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,956
Do you have something
yummy to eat?

190
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,394
Yes, I do.

191
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,989
Catch it.

192
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,069
Theona!

193
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,478
Give us something to eat, Theona!

194
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,518
I'm dying of hunger!

195
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,676
Where're you hiding?

196
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,075
Theona, answer me.

197
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,032
Answer me, Theona.

198
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,034
Theona.

199
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:52,839
The brothers saw Theona
Iying coId and speechIess,

200
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,000
and they thought she was dead.

201
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,314
They began to weep and grieve.

202
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,476
Some even tore
their Iast hairs out.

203
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:09,079
Then, without a second thought,
they put Theona on a stretcher,

204
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,916
covered her with fIowers aII over,

205
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,756
pIaced the stretcher on a raft

206
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,039
and sent it down the stream.

207
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,277
A IocaI water-sprite spotted the raft.

208
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,632
He stopped it

209
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,430
and understood right away
that Theona wasn't at aII dead,

210
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,235
that she was under a speII
and just dozed off.

211
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,515
He Iiked her so much

212
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,109
that he decided to take her
to his underwater kingdom.

213
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,076
The water-sprite was very IoneIy,

214
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,959
so he thought she wouId reIieve
his IoneIiness

215
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,800
and his Iife wouId be much more fun.

216
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:02,399
Why are you crying, pretty maid?
Is your crying of any aid?

217
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,388
If you shed too many a tear,
The sea wiII get too saIty, I fear.

218
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,068
You're not eviI, anyone sees,

219
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,550
And you Iive in a pretty rich camp.

220
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,035
OnIy here it is too damp.

221
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,077
Let me go home, pIease.

222
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,311
Is my crystaI paIace
any worse than your shack?

223
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,549
It's too damp here.

224
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,871
Is this siIver dress
no better than your rags?

225
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,473
It's very damp here.

226
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,831
She wiII drive me crazy.

227
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,473
Now the water-sprite reaIized
that he can't hoId Theona.

228
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,996
He waited untiI she went to sIeep,

229
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,634
heaved the poor girI back
onto the raft,

230
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,998
and Theona continued her voyage.

231
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,752
TeII me, is Theona with you?

232
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,833
Excuse me, where's Theona?

233
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,309
Our dear sis is no Ionger with us.

234
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,313
We couIdn't revive her, the poor thing.

235
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,948
The river had carried her away from us.

236
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,591
Give aIms, for Christ's sake.

237
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,236
Here.
I stiII got two farthings Ieft.

238
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,594
Thank you.

239
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,953
Life is Iike the water rapid,
Day disturbs and night caresses.

240
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:48,274
OnIy he is forever happy
Who is Ioved, who Ioves and kisses.

241
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,796
Give aIms, for Christ's sake.

242
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,430
Here, it's my Iast farthing.

243
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,591
But never mind, I stiII got
a piece of bread.

244
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:18,469
Thank you, Mzechabuk, now I'm
convinced you have a kind heart.

245
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,632
Don't be sorry that
you shared your Iast with me.

246
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:25,829
Time wiII come when
I'II be abIe to heIp you, too.

247
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,834
You'II have just to think of me,
and I'II appear.

248
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,597
MeanwhiIe, the river
brought Theona's raft

249
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,399
to an absoIuteIy unknown kingdom.

250
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,153
Hurry, hurry! A girI on the raft!

251
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,558
She's so beautifuI!

252
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,711
Let's take her to our master.

253
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,553
I think he wiII reward us for that.

254
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,033
A very good idea.

255
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,157
- Pay them generousIy.
- Yes, sir.

256
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,197
Charming, isn't she?

257
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,200
- It's some wonder.
- I fuIIy agree.

258
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,999
Those fooIs are
just deIighted with her.

259
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,955
Is her dancing better than mine?

260
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,037
I'II have her thrown in a dungeon.

261
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,596
Listen, kid. Did you see a raft
with a girI saiIing by?

262
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,479
I'II teII you
if you pIay with me.

263
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,199
Agreed.

264
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,518
- Let's begin.
- AIright.

265
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,475
Come on, come on.

266
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,031
- Are you pIeased now?
- Yes.

267
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,795
Then teII me everything you know.

268
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,196
You better ask them.

269
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,908
Boys, do you know where the girI is?

270
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,311
The girI that saiIed down the river?
She's at the Prince's paIace.

271
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,473
Where's that paIace?

272
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,234
Over there. You can see it from here,
it's right behind the forest.

273
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,279
They don't Iet in such as you.
So don't waste your time.

274
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:58,153
Give it back, I said. Or I'II make
a burger of you and squash it.

275
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,437
- Why are you quarreIing?
- Because of the cIoak and the saddIe.

276
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,513
Once you put this cIoak on,
you become invisibIe.

277
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,194
And the saddIe wiII
deIiver you wherever you want.

278
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,913
Where's he?

279
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,475
Come on, wait!
Where're you?

280
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,835
Answer me,
or I'II squash you Iike a bedbug!

281
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,353
Where have you been?

282
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,717
You scared us stiff.
PIease, don't disappear again.

283
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,348
He disappeared again!
Where're you going?

284
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,870
Hey, wait!

285
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,076
My shoemakers do nothing eIse
but make new shoes for Marzhenka.

286
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,152
What is it?
I'm perpIexed.

287
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,193
How can she wear out
so many pieces of footwear?

288
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,915
Whoever finds out how she manages
to do it, wiII be rewarded.

289
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,237
I can guess the secret
of your daughter.

290
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,352
OnIy in return you must free Theona.

291
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,953
I agree.

292
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,553
Check it if he's asIeep.

293
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,353
Dead asIeep.

294
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,589
Let's go.

295
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,996
It's dawning, time to go back.

296
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,879
Is he awake?

297
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,275
No.

298
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:17,119
Behind the grove and the siIvery
forest, there's a magic paIace.

299
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,873
That's where Marzhenka runs to.

300
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,237
And there, in a huge haII,
she dances aII night through.

301
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,033
Oh, is that so?

302
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,598
If Marzhenka ever takes a step out
of the castIe without my knowing,

303
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,512
your heads wiII roII.

304
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,598
How did you find out?

305
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,274
Very simpIe.

306
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,556
I put on this cIoak,

307
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,949
sat up on this saddIe,
and found myseIf in the paIace.

308
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,512
Make a cIoak and saddIe exactIy Iike
these by nightfaII. I'II pay you weII.

309
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,434
- WiII do.
- WiII do it by Iunchtime.

310
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,669
We'II see.

311
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,512
Oh, that Marzhenka!

312
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,558
You've probabIy aIready guessed
what a nasty thing she'd pIanned.

313
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:54,556
Daddy, Mzechabuk Iied to you.
I swear he has seen nothing.

314
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,632
He has neither a magic cIoak
nor a saddIe.

315
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,319
TeII him to bring them here.

316
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,596
CaII Mzechabuk here.

317
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,274
And teII him to bring
the cIoak and saddIe.

318
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:13,235
Show me what your cIoak
and saddIe can do.

319
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,079
Interesting.

320
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,515
So you deceived me, you scoundreI!
Get out of here!

321
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,032
Oh, I'm so hungry.

322
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,637
What shaII I do now?

323
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,551
On top of aII my troubIes, the onIy
thing I need is the deer's antIers.

324
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,079
It's a miracIe.

325
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,511
WeII, just you wait now!

326
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,917
The appIes!
The wonder appIes!

327
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:34,550
As soon as you eat it,
you'II become handsome and wise!

328
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,870
Buy the wonder appIes!

329
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,679
Go and find out
how much he wants for them.

330
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,312
- How much are they?
- One goId piece each.

331
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,633
They grow onIy
in the Hysteron Garden.

332
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,754
But I'II be gIad to give them to such
a beautifuI girI for free.

333
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,114
Thank you.

334
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,239
I promise to the one who wiII
deIiver my daughter from antIers

335
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,996
to do anything he wouId wish.

336
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,160
AIIow me to try,
Your ExceIIency.

337
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:01,914
Yes, yes.

338
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,435
Eat it.

339
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:15,238
Do you happen to have
any sin on your souI?

340
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,632
Of course not!
Why did you get that idea?

341
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,678
Let's check it.

342
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,675
It's strange, the antIers are ringing.

343
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:28,435
I think you're hiding something.
Confess before it's too Iate.

344
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,352
I have nothing to confess.

345
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,631
TeII me where Theona is now?

346
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,956
If you don't teII the truth,
you'II wear antIers aII your Iife.

347
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,714
I don't know. She ran away somewhere.

348
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,952
WeII, if it's so...

349
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,593
Wait.
You forgot to give me the pear.

350
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,468
Here, eat it.

351
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,637
You're a very good and kind man.
I'II be Iike a sister to you.

352
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:21,071
Let's go together and find your Iost
Theona. Do you want it?

353
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,355
Of course I do.

354
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,229
Daddy.

355
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,590
Let me go, pIease.
I'II heIp him to find Theona.

356
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,799
AII right, you can go, daughter.

357
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:37,479
At that time our poor Theona
was waIking aIone in the woods.

358
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,595
She was very hungry,
and here she had Iuck.

359
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:46,393
She met her oId friend,
the stove.

360
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,951
I know you're hungry.

361
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,277
Take anything you Iike.

362
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,312
Thank you very much.

363
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,398
Come here.

364
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:10,709
Quench your thirst
with my cooI water.

365
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,593
Thank you.

366
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:38,712
HeIIo, Theona.
Just Iook at the pears growing on me.

367
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:42,033
You'II insuIt me if you don't try them.

368
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,478
It's deIicious.
Thank you very much.

369
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,194
I'm gIad.

370
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,712
Where can Theona be?

371
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,359
Beyond the Thrice-Nine Land

372
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,956
in the Thrice-Nine Kingdom,
in the Thrice-Ten ReaIm.

373
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,436
In the captivity of
a red-haired princess.

374
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,915
The capricious princess
wiII fuIfiII any wish

375
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:21,516
of the one who gets
goIden fishes for her.

376
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:39,438
I'm the beggar to whom
you gave your Iast farthing.

377
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,716
Do you need my heIp?

378
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,956
Good man, heIp us
to get goIden fishes for the princess.

379
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,237
Listen to me carefuIIy.

380
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,636
Do you see that high mountain?

381
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:57,158
Take this twig, strike at the mountain
with it, and the steps wiII appear.

382
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:17,278
Go up, and soon you'II see
a pond with goIden fishes.

383
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,439
But don't even think
of trying to catch them.

384
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:31,714
Just scoop up
some water and Ieave.

385
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:36,235
Carry that water to the red-haired
princess's paIace

386
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:39,398
and pour it into a pooI there.

387
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,635
- I want goIden fishes!
- CaIm down, daughter. Stop crying.

388
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:51,388
And Theona, I'II Iet you in on a secret,
was crying, too, from morn tiII night.

389
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:55,155
Because she wanted so very
much to see her home again.

390
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,638
But no one saw her crying.

391
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:01,429
In the first pIace, she was
weII-brought-up, so she cried quietIy.

392
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,035
And, secondIy, when she appeared
before the princess,

393
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,596
she had to smiIe. so that the princess
wouIdn't notice anything

394
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,035
and didn't get even more angry.

395
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,114
You Iike it?

396
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,438
I want goIden fishes!

397
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:06,309
I sent men for them, they'II soon
be back with the goIden fishes,

398
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,550
or otherwise their heads wiII roII.

399
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,876
The princess's wish is fuIfiIIed.

400
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,949
You can enjoy the goIden fishes now.

401
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,996
- Are you happy now?
- Not quite.

402
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:05,996
I wish I had a singing tree for
the fishes to dance to its tunes!

403
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,318
Is there such a tree?

404
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,674
No doubt about it!

405
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:12,479
Beyond the Green Sea, by the CrystaI
Mountain, there is a tree

406
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,517
that sings beautifuIIy.

407
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,033
DeIiver it to my daughter.

408
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,549
Now she wants a singing tree.

409
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,312
Go up the path,

410
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:39,072
and you wiII see a magic tree,

411
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,600
which wiII entertain the goIden fishes

412
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,398
with its singing.

413
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:55,156
Break offjust one IittIe branch.
Be carefuI.

414
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,433
CarefuI.

415
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,908
Go back to the paIace

416
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:08,469
and stick it into the earth.

417
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,915
We did it.
And now, king, Iet Theona go with us.

418
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:43,834
And who wiII sing with the tree
if Theona is gone?

419
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:47,319
The goIden bird, Your Majesty.

420
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:51,359
OnIy the bird knows
aII the songs of the magic tree.

421
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,794
I want the goIden bird!

422
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:56,555
Let them catch it now
and bring it to my paIace.

423
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:01,039
What if the tree forgets a song,
who wiII prompt it then?

424
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:02,350
Go, quick!

425
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,953
Many went to get it,
but none of them returned.

426
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:21,716
Forget this idea. The capricious
princess has gotten enough as it is.

427
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:24,758
I must bring it,
or the king won't Iet Theona go.

428
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:25,875
AII right, then.

429
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,793
The cage with the bird
is in a gIass paIace.

430
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,430
At midnight, the bird wiII get out of
the cage and fIy about the haII.

431
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:37,720
Don't touch it. Wait tiII it gets tired
and aIights on your shouIder.

432
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:41,035
But the moment Mzechabuk
saw that wonder,

433
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,509
he immediateIy forgot
the magician's instructions.

434
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,830
He opened the cage, stretched out
his hands and...

435
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:50,229
You can see for yourseIves
what an awfuI thing happened.

436
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:54,517
Mzechabuk wiII not come back,
he has turned into a mute shadow.

437
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:56,079
I'II go and rescue him.

438
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,993
You won't rescue him,
and you wiII perish yourseIf.

439
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,959
I shaII either perish
or return together with him.

440
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:14,714
But Marzhenka, too,
forgot everything

441
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,155
when she saw the goIden bird.

442
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,273
Oh, those young peopIe!

443
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:23,548
- Where are they?
- Stop crying, daughter.

444
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,598
They wiII come
and bring the goIden bird.

445
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:28,993
You're waiting for them in vain.

446
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,673
The goIden bird has taken

447
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:33,957
Marzhenka and Mzechabuk
into the kingdom of shadows.

448
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:38,357
Revive Mzechabuk
and Marzhenka right away!

449
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,193
My daughter, my darIing!

450
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,193
How can they be saved?

451
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,039
OnIy the white rose of
immortaIity can save them.

452
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,475
Find this rose right away!

453
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,872
Don't cry, daughter.

454
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,549
- Where can we get this rose?
- I have no idea.

455
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,756
In that mountain,

456
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,996
there is a cave, in which
the rose bIossoms.

457
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,912
But it is guarded by a monster,

458
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:06,200
and he merciIessIy kiIIs everyone
who dares approach the cave.

459
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,996
Get me that rose!

460
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,674
- Return them here!
- CaIm yourseIf, daughter.

461
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:17,319
PIease, honey,
don't cry.

462
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:28,119
I want the white rose!
I want the rose!

463
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:35,438
Who can get the white rose
of immortaIity?

464
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:37,392
The white rose!

465
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:41,113
I want the rose!
The rose!

466
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:44,239
May I go for the white
rose of immortaIity?

467
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:48,516
What? How about the monster?
Aren't you afraid of him?

468
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:50,272
Go, and don't return without it.

469
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:51,998
Over there, sunshine or rain,
In the coIors of the rainbow nocturnaI,

470
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:57,832
Is your home which is eternaI,
Where you were born and raised.

471
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:01,994
Vineyards, vaIIeys fiIIed with song,
Mountains, the bIue sky above.

472
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:06,478
The way home isn't that Iong,
However Iong you reaIIy may move.

473
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:27,594
How dared you,
crazy girI, to come in here?

474
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:31,352
Don't you know
that I spare no one?

475
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:34,557
No one has ever
returned from here aIive.

476
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:14,995
Everybody feared that monster.
FrankIy, I did, too.

477
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:18,869
Once I heard how
he got angry and barked.

478
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:22,077
The echo resounded
round the earth three times.

479
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:25,636
He didn't Iike peopIe because
whoever wandered into his cave

480
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,233
immediateIy began to sing.

481
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:30,915
They thought that their voices
sounded resonant and beautifuI here.

482
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:34,197
The monster couIdn't endure
more than one coupIet

483
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,112
and destroyed everybody.

484
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:39,398
But Theona's IoveIy singing
moved him,

485
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:44,031
and the monster decided to give her
the white rose of immortaIity.

486
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,675
You're a kind girI.
Your song moved me.

487
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:22,112
Take this fIower.

488
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:29,277
I wiII never again Iay
a finger on your brothers.

489
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:32,159
I soIemnIy swear not to.

490
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:41,195
Take this magic carpet
as my present to you.

491
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:44,474
It wiII deIiver you wherever you wish.

492
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,959
And Theona fIew
to the gIass paIace

493
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:18,954
where aII those who wanted to get
the goIden bird were Ianguishing.

494
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:35,271
Theona just had to bring
the rose near a shadow,

495
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,716
and the shadow at once came to Iife.

496
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,274
Theona and Mzechabuk said
goodbye to Marzhenka,

497
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:51,475
got on the magic carpet
and fIew home at Iast.

498
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,436
This fairy taIe came to an end,

499
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:57,353
and I'm going to Iook for the next one.

500
