1
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,840
<i>My life is a long and profitable</i>
<i>road to idiocy.</i>

2
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,240
<i>As a teenager, I knew I was an idiot.</i>

3
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,680
<i>A few years later, I discovered</i>
<i>that I was not the only one.</i>

4
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,480
<i>At almost 35, I am convinced</i>
<i>that we are not only all idiots:</i>

5
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,360
<i>is that we never cease to be.</i>

6
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,960
-He's always late. Let's toast!
-Congratulations, Godfather!

7
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,200
-Drink!
-He's here.

8
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,720
You're late, Pere-Lluc.

9
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,040
-The meal is ready.
-I've had a few gin and tonics.

10
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,600
-Godfather, for you.
-Is it for me? Thank you.

11
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,840
Don't I get a drink?

12
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,840
-I'm going to the toilet for a moment.
-Perfect.

13
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,920
It's his prostate.
He doesn't want me to tell.

14
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,000
One second.

15
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,040
Friends, are we all here?

16
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,520
One second.

17
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,480
Idiocy is like a woodworm
that eats away at us to the end.

18
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,360
At fifteen, we are hopeless idiots.

19
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,080
It's like a mold that sets at that age,
and so on until you die.

20
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,960
That's why I don't have children.
Nor do I think I ever will.

21
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,880
I won't create more idiots.

22
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,040
-Very well.
-Yes, thank goodness.

23
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,160
One second.

24
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,800
Today, a special day
in our working calendar,

25
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,840
I want to make an act of atonement.

26
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,680
Just as the Lord sacrificed himself
by giving his life for us,

27
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,320
I, by way of public
and symbolic embarrassment…

28
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,480
I offer up my willy.

29
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,960
I'll unzip my fly

30
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,079
and I will deposit my virile member here.

31
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:20,839
Near the meatball, in the stew,
like any other sausage. Here.

32
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,120
And, with this carver

33
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,920
that fate has put
on this stage beforehand…

34
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,640
Dude, don't do it.
You will be disgraced forever.

35
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,440
Stop, will you?

36
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,280
<i>I'm dizzy and bored with myself,</i>
<i>hence this show of childishness.</i>

37
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,120
<i>We cannot forget that I'm an idiot.</i>

38
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,400
Hand that over, enough with the joke.

39
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,080
Excuse me.

40
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,640
You have the worst ideas!

41
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,640
Why are you so quiet?

42
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,120
Oh, I think I've peed myself.

43
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,360
<i>After a life of intense idiocy,</i>
<i>can you know you've hit rock bottom?</i>

44
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,120
<i>Experience proves otherwise:</i>
<i>You can always be a bigger idiot.</i>

45
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,680
<i>My case is proof of this.</i>
<i>This is the only way to explain</i>

46
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,960
<i>an incident as embarrassing, immature,</i>
<i>and exhibitionist as today's.</i>

47
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,920
<i>Barcelona, Mediterranean city,</i>
<i>ancient and Olympic capital.</i>

48
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,080
<i>Proud</i>

49
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,480
<i>and full of indigenous inhabitants</i>
<i>who they say lack the character</i>

50
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,440
<i>of Europe's major cities.</i>

51
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,560
<i>But even so, they won't leave.</i>

52
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,920
<i>Disorientated, she welcomes outsiders</i>
<i>who brand her as provincial.</i>

53
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,760
<i>They don't accept her as she is,</i>
<i>and not as they would like her to be.</i>

54
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,120
<i>But even so, they stay.</i>

55
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:21,280
<i>Barcelona is a lady who rejuvenated</i>
<i>with the Olympic facelift</i>

56
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,040
<i>and that he doesn't understand why now</i>
<i>every day feels like Monday.</i>

57
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,040
<i>She doesn't know why they want to take</i>
<i>her VIP card of world history.</i>

58
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,000
<i>Between, one thing and another,</i>

59
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,920
<i>floating like beggars' turds</i>
<i>in the oily water.</i>

60
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,360
<i>People are trying to survive.</i>
<i>Including myself.</i>

61
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,640
<i>A listener with a voice, but without vote.</i>

62
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,680
<i>Pere-Lluc? I'm Peyró. Bad news, kid.</i>

63
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,080
<i>I'm sorry to tell you this,</i>
<i>but Nicco Zenone died.</i>

64
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,840
<i>I've just arrived from Buenos Aires</i>
<i>and they told me.</i>

65
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,600
<i>It seems to have been in December.</i>

66
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,200
<i>Nicco, the great Nicco.</i>

67
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,120
<i>Known to the public</i>
<i>for its wonderful shows.</i>

68
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,240
<i>But he was the most generous friend</i>
<i>I've ever had.</i>

69
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,880
<i>Actor and theater director,</i>
<i>pure Argentinian.</i>

70
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,480
Not for the sake of reasoning,

71
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,920
although I came to think of it
as perfection.

72
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,720
<i>Work made him travel</i>
<i>and that's how we met.</i>

73
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,360
<i>He lived in San Telmo, Buenos Aires,</i>
<i>with Vera, his wife.</i>

74
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,240
<i>We made an effort</i>
<i>to maintain our friendship</i>

75
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,880
<i>calling each other often, but we went</i>
<i>months without seeing each other.</i>

76
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,960
<i>We'd been seeing each other</i>
<i>once a year for over ten years.</i>

77
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,040
What's left, I chew or swallow it.
You can also…

78
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,800
<i>I once spent three weeks</i>
<i>with them in Buenos Aires.</i>

79
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,320
You know what?

80
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,000
Freedom is demonstrated by sharing it.

81
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,120
A lonely man ends up
being unsupportive and inhuman.

82
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,520
Two years ago,
he overcame a very bad hepatitis.

83
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,000
I was never afraid to die.

84
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,240
But the anguish of death did make me
shit my pants several times.

85
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,160
You're as unoriginal as everyone else.

86
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,960
<i>I could show up there unannounced,</i>
<i>even if they weren't there.</i>

87
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,280
<i>The door remained the same,</i>
<i>wide open for travelers.</i>

88
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,280
<i>His presence in my life was,</i>
<i>to put it idiotically,</i>

89
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,760
<i>a branch to hold on to</i>
<i>so I wouldn't fall off the cliff.</i>

90
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,440
<i>Now the branch has broken off.</i>

91
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,520
Buenos Aires, Argentina.
Vera and Nicco Zenone, Umberto Primo.

92
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,039
<i>I'll feel calmer if I call</i>
<i>his wife at midnight.</i>

93
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,240
<i>Luckily for both of us, I can't reach her.</i>

94
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,360
<i>I am sad and I go out to drink</i>
<i>to the health of my late friend.</i>

95
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,240
<i>I keep thinking that Nicco is dead.</i>

96
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,360
<i>It is a treacherous attack,</i>
<i>an immense swindle.</i>

97
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,720
Dammit.

98
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,080
Are you hurt?

99
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,440
We could go to a pharmacy if you like.
The blow does not look good.

100
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,280
Well, sorry. I have to keep working.

101
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,160
RUSSIAN CIRCUS

102
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,960
Hello.

103
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,480
At the Gelida.

104
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,880
Don't be late, okay? I'm tired.

105
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,560
Well, maybe.

106
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,320
Well, tomorrow you will see.
It's just three streets.

107
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,800
Just three streets.

108
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,640
<i>I work with my godfather.</i>

109
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,040
<i>He has converted his former agency</i>

110
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,200
<i>in business academy</i>
<i>and stock market consultancy.</i>

111
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,760
Obesity as a risk factor. Listen.

112
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,640
<i>Thank goodness I had him.</i>
<i>He picked me up at my worst moment.</i>

113
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,480
<i>I had just left teaching</i>

114
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,440
<i>and, being an idiot,</i>
<i>had not foreseen alternatives.</i>

115
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,840
<i>I organize courses and conferences</i>
<i>with quite good results.</i>

116
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,400
…colon, kidney, endometrial,
and esophageal tumors

117
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,040
can be attributed to overweight
and lack of physical exercise.

118
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,120
A more active lifestyle is needed,

119
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,000
both physically and intellectually.

120
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,360
You look poorly.

121
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,080
-I don't usually have friends die on me.
-Pere-Lluc?

122
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,000
Human beings, like animals,
create bonds of affection.

123
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,080
The monkeys love and hate
each other, but cannot ponder.

124
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,120
-So what?
-No. You're a mess.

125
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,000
More than when your father died.
You were very young and he was old.

126
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,560
Now you're older
and the dead man is your age.

127
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,400
Remember the dead and help his relatives,
they need it most.

128
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,720
If you were really friends.

129
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,040
By the way, what's this bump?

130
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,760
Nothing. I hit my head with a ladder.

131
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,640
Your skin is very thin.

132
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,480
Sometimes I think that when you
were a hippie you took something weird

133
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,360
and the effect still lasts.

134
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,680
<i>My godfather has made his fortune</i>
<i>by sensing the sign of the times:</i>

135
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,960
<i>Money.</i>

136
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,240
<i>I have two friends.</i>

137
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,040
<i>Jordina Valldejolí,</i>
<i>my godfather's right-hand woman.</i>

138
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,080
<i>She got married, had a child,</i>
<i>divorced, and now lives with her child.</i>

139
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:23,040
<i>We're very fond of each other,</i>
<i>which is more than many couples have.</i>

140
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,400
<i>Once we made love.</i>
<i>She was very sad and lonely.</i>

141
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,800
<i>We embraced and one thing led to another.</i>

142
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,360
<i>She is actually in love with Àlex Mallol,</i>

143
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,600
<i>my second friend</i>
<i>and third pillar of the Càrdenas office.</i>

144
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,880
<i>A secret love and lived in silence,</i>

145
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,440
<i>because he is a peaceful guy</i>
<i>but unsentimental.</i>

146
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,440
<i>He lives a, apparently placid,</i>
<i>married life.</i>

147
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,080
<i>Àlex and I are old friends.</i>
<i>We shared a house about 15 years ago.</i>

148
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,000
<i>He's as big an idiot as I am,</i>
<i>but he manages failure differently.</i>

149
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,720
<i>I'm often introduced to girls.</i>

150
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,680
<i>I met my last girlfriend through Jordina.</i>

151
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,440
<i>It was my record time as a couple:</i>
<i>Eight and a half months.</i>

152
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:09,160
<i>She put up with me because,</i>
<i>with a payroll, idiocy was easier on her.</i>

153
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,200
-Yes, it was silly!
-I told you: "Anyone but Silvia."

154
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:17,160
<i>She said that she couldn't live</i>
<i>with someone emotionally unstable.</i>

155
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,880
<i>I once slept with a radical feminist</i>
<i>who was dating one of my best friends.</i>

156
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,920
<i>He had gone to Mexico</i>
<i>on an initiation trip,</i>

157
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,320
<i>with no return date.</i>

158
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:37,560
Penetration and passionate kissing
and/or French kissing is forbidden.

159
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,760
-Sorry, what?
-Yes.

160
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,480
It's an intolerable assault on my body.
Besides, I'm in love with Xavi.

161
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,680
It's not incompatible nor contradictory.

162
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,840
Men are savages.

163
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,200
As long as our vaginas
are lubricated for penetration

164
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,040
and we keep your mouths tight
around your penises,

165
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,560
you don't want or need anything else.

166
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,840
<i>I didn't argue with her.</i>
<i>Deep down I agreed.</i>

167
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,440
<i>That's how we used to sleep together,</i>
<i>which was what we both wanted.</i>

168
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,680
<i>I agreed to make love to her</i>
<i>without penetrating or kissing her.</i>

169
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,080
<i>The rest of the immense possibilities</i>
<i>remained open.</i>

170
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,360
<i>My love life</i>
<i>has always been fits and starts.</i>

171
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,280
<i>It's been over three years</i>
<i>since my last stable relationship.</i>

172
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,080
Beautiful.

173
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,000
<i>Since then, a few achievements</i>
<i>in blood and fire, to keep appearances.</i>

174
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,880
<i>My fetishes are like those of many people</i>
<i>in quality and quantity.</i>

175
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:40,720
<i>Well, you could say that I have</i>
<i>a certain propensity for masturbation,</i>

176
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,280
<i>but no big deal.</i>

177
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,440
<i>I remember Nicco, as alive as I am.</i>

178
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,600
<i>It's madness.</i>
<i>Five months thinking he was alive,</i>

179
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,760
<i>and me, not a fucking premonition,</i>
<i>no fucking telepathy.</i>

180
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,400
<i>The Rondas are perfect to avoid thinking.</i>

181
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,960
<i>I merge in and start driving in circles</i>
<i>like a carousel horse.</i>

182
00:17:09,598 --> 00:17:13,000
<i>It's a miracle to go always forward</i>
<i>and end up at the origin.</i>

183
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,960
<i>Now I understand the navigators</i>
<i>who proved that the Earth was round.</i>

184
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
<i>Like a dog that has lost the scent,</i>
<i>I smell the girl again.</i>

185
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,040
-How are you?
-Long live Barça.

186
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,520
Yeah.

187
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,680
Erm, well…

188
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,000
I saw you working a few days ago
and I'm interested in hiring you.

189
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,600
I even followed you
for a while to see how you did it.

190
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,960
I don't remember you.

191
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,920
The company is run by a lady
and her husband, talk to them.

192
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,200
Of course.

193
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,280
-Well, she really works, doesn't she?
-Yes.

194
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,520
And even more so as the boss.
She likes her job.

195
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,720
There are nights when we compete
and she always wins.

196
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,720
I don't really mind that.
But I don't have much more.

197
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,440
Do you know what I would do with
the fucking banners if I won the lottery?

198
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,720
Yes.

199
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,840
-Where is she?
-Having some coffee. She'll be back soon.

200
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,440
I'll call her tomorrow.

201
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,440
In five minutes, you will be able to talk.

202
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,640
No, don't worry. Besides, it's late
and I'm not from around here.

203
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,600
-Long live Barça.
-Yes.

204
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,040
I'd like to know what to say.

205
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,520
I'd like to know what to say.

206
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,120
A Beefeater gin and tonic, please.

207
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,960
Could you serve her
a Beefeater gin and tonic?

208
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,600
<i>The most rewarding</i>
<i>thing about being an idiot</i>

209
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,440
<i>is that it allows you not to waste</i>
<i>your time justifying your actions.</i>

210
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,760
Excuse me, have you
been waiting for a long time?

211
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,520
Come in, please. Come in.

212
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,960
ENTRANCE

213
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:18,200
I had gone out for a moment.
Well, then that's it. How can I help you.

214
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,640
Oh, haven't we met before?

215
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,720
Erm, yes. The other night
I bumped into your ladder.

216
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:30,480
-That's true. How's the blow?
-Well, there it is. Better, it's better.

217
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,280
Yeah… Are you interested in any
of the services we offer?

218
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,800
<i>I like it very much.</i>

219
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,320
<i>To be addressed so politely</i>
<i>excites me terribly.</i>

220
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,080
<i>I feel like I'm in a film</i>
<i>of the Nouvelle Vague.</i>

221
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,680
Forgive me, but I'll forget it.
I am taking stock.

222
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,880
You should know that
we are among the best in the business.

223
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,480
But… There's always a but, isn't there?

224
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,080
My husband and I won't hang

225
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,680
a single banner
that goes against our ideas.

226
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,240
And, if the matter is urgent,
we're unable to attend to you right now.

227
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,040
That's fine. No problem, I don't even know
what to put on the banners.

228
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:08,840
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Don't you know what you want to announce?

229
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,800
Indeed.

230
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,680
The city only allows banners of cultural
or political interest.

231
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,480
Of course. I knew that already.

232
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:25,080
I see what you mean! You're saying that
you don't know how to draft or design it.

233
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,640
Precisely.

234
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,160
And while you ponder on that,
you want to compare companies.

235
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,520
-To buy time, right?
-Yes.

236
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,280
All right, here's the difference.

237
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,840
Others will try to convince
you that canvas is best

238
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,920
and they'd be right, it's traditional.
But it costs ten times more.

239
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,680
Here we work on a special
German plastic that imitates canvas.

240
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,400
Same performance,
but much more competitively priced.

241
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,840
Do you have the slightest
idea what to announce?

242
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,240
-No.
-No…

243
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,920
-Well, this is all a bit weird.
-Yes, but don't worry.

244
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,760
I just want to know the prices
and payment terms and…

245
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,240
It depends on many things.

246
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,040
It depends on the material we choose,
the quantity, the colors, the season.

247
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,200
We must know if you'll bring your banners

248
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,760
or if you'd like the printing
and hanging service.

249
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,800
The cost varies greatly in these cases.

250
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,600
It will seem reasonable
no matter what it is.

251
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,800
Well, if you haven't designed
the banner yet, it's best to wait.

252
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,480
<i>I feel like a disgusting slug.</i>

253
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,360
<i>I wouldn't want her to mature</i>
<i>the idea that I'm an idiot.</i>

254
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,920
<i>She'll discover it in time.</i>

255
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,360
<i>There's no rush.</i>

256
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,000
I've thought it over,
I'll order the work from you.

257
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,800
Plastic banner imitating canvas.

258
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,400
Ah, congratulations. It seems like
a practical and intelligent decision.

259
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,720
Wait a minute.

260
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,680
Here. In addition to the rates,
you will find a bank form.

261
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,560
Take your time to read it.
It refers to very favorable credits.

262
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,640
I don't think you'll get one, you don't
have a clear project, but you could try.

263
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,240
It would be terrible
if everyone thought so.

264
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,440
-Especially people without a penny.
-Don't worry, you'll see.

265
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,080
Once the core of the message is clear,
everything else will come to you.

266
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,320
Of course.

267
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,320
Yes?

268
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,240
<i>-Pere-Lluc?</i>
-Vera!

269
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,560
Nicco had a fatal heart attack.

270
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,320
<i>He was sitting in his rocking chair.</i>

271
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,560
<i>Naked because it was summer</i>
<i>and no one could see him.</i>

272
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,200
Nicco?

273
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,040
Nicco!

274
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,280
Nicco Zenone.

275
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,160
<i>I was tortured by the uncertainty.</i>

276
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,680
The fact that I didn't know if it could
have been in my hands to save him.

277
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:47,640
<i>I wanted someone to come and punish me.</i>
<i>To punish me hard.</i>

278
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,520
Vera, you have to promise to come
and visit me.

279
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,360
<i>For now it will be difficult.</i>

280
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,560
<i>-Farewell, my friend. Goodbye.</i>
-Goodbye.

281
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,920
<i>I must calm down, I must forget Nicco.</i>

282
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,800
<i>Now it's time to focus on the girl,</i>
<i>banners, vans, and husband.</i>

283
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,120
<i>They are well located,</i>
<i>they will not escape.</i>

284
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:17,080
Stress is an ongoing problem
with many negative effects,

285
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,400
not only for mental health,
but also for physical health.

286
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,760
Gastrointestinal problems,
cardiovascular problems, headaches…

287
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,960
<i>I've prepared for the course thoroughly.</i>

288
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,560
<i>But I find it hard to concentrate.</i>

289
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,080
A low-stress worker is synonymous
with a more productive worker.

290
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:42,080
I don't know what you
want it for and I won't ask.

291
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:46,440
But when dealing with banks,
you don't know how it will turn out.

292
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,280
I could endorse you,
but be aware of the consequences.

293
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,000
I take no responsibility.

294
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,560
Opening up to banking
is like asking for a grant.

295
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,640
They always want you
to show them everything,

296
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,680
that you appear before them,
fiscally, stark naked.

297
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,720
They want the last four tax returns.

298
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,200
They are not interested in the fifth.
Do you know why? I'll tell you.

299
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,680
Because it is time-barred.

300
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,800
They don't care if you were
a model citizen five years ago

301
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,920
or the greatest swindler of the century.

302
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,320
Banks are like God:

303
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,560
They ask for everything and,
in the end, they refuse you credit.

304
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,760
How much do you need?

305
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,720
Twelve thousand. A couple million.

306
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,560
Fuck.

307
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,920
<i>Now what?</i>

308
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,760
<i>It's time to return home.</i>
<i>There is a limit to idiocy.</i>

309
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,200
<i>But not mine.</i>

310
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:28,760
<i>After years and years of practice it</i>
<i>is immense, gigantic, colossal, bulimic.</i>

311
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,040
-When does the film start?
-At half past.

312
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,400
Shall we eat dinner?

313
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,760
<i>I'm pushing my luck too hard.</i>
<i>That's enough.</i>

314
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,120
<i>I'm aroused by what I've done.</i>

315
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:04,000
<i>The worst thing is, the further away I am,</i>
<i>the less remorse I have.</i>

316
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,360
<i>After years of lethargy,</i>
<i>my life is no longer placid and confusing.</i>

317
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:23,720
<i>My idiocy, indomitable, active, playful,</i>
<i>pushes me to return to her house.</i>

318
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,160
<i>One, one hundred, one thousand,</i>

319
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,720
<i>one million times.</i>

320
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,400
<i>I'm aroused by knowing</i>

321
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,840
<i>that even as a criminal voyeur</i>
<i>I'll be no big deal.</i>

322
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,520
<i>And that, in the short to medium term,</i>
<i>I will end up failing.</i>

323
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,280
<i>I enter a world of sensations</i>
<i>unknown but true,</i>

324
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,600
<i>made of the barest</i>
<i>and most penetrating reality,</i>

325
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,800
<i>that gives form, substance,</i>
<i>and meaning to existence.</i>

326
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:08,000
<i>It's as if I pushed a button</i>
<i>and everything sped up.</i>

327
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:13,600
<i>One of the drawbacks of being an idiot</i>
<i>is that you tend to slow life down.</i>

328
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,280
<i>And, if you get careless,</i>
<i>like me in recent years,</i>

329
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,640
<i>you fall into the absolute vital zero</i>
<i>almost without realizing it.</i>

330
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,040
<i>Perhaps I've found my own way</i>
<i>of atonement.</i>

331
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,240
<i>I must atone for the idiocy</i>
<i>of reaching 35 and having nothing.</i>

332
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,240
<i>Ours is a generation of idiots</i>
<i>that no one will talk about.</i>

333
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,360
<i>A generational black hole.</i>

334
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,200
<i>By spying on her, I will atone.</i>

335
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,800
<i>Expiating, I will spy on her.</i>

336
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,560
I've been leading a double life for days.

337
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,280
-I've fallen in love with a girl.
-What?

338
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,800
And since I don't have the balls
to talk to her, I spy on her.

339
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,240
You're weird, huh? You're weird.

340
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,120
You drive the Rondas
like an amusement park,

341
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,680
you show your cock in public
and now you're doing illegal surveillance.

342
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,920
Since you can't avoid it,
take advantage of it, right?

343
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Yes? What do you mean, smart guy?

344
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,880
You are just like John Merrick,
the Elephant Man: A monster.

345
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,280
And in spite of the misfortune,
do you know what the advantage is?

346
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,600
I don't know.

347
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,040
We normal people think that those
who have been screwed by life,

348
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,720
with a serious physical problem,
they are rather wise guys.

349
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,560
-Do you think so?
-Yes!

350
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,360
We take it for granted that,
being so, they are above pettiness.

351
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,840
And even of evil.

352
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,000
Their hatred is accepted, forgiven

353
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:01,240
and many consider it a sign
of the greatness of their spirit.

354
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:05,960
The more fucked up they are,
the wiser and better we see them.

355
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,800
-So what?
-Put yourself in their shoes.

356
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,600
Think what they can do
to the 99% of us normal.

357
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,800
I find it exaggerated, hypocritical,
cynical, and bastardic.

358
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,400
Think what you want, but that's
the way it is. And you are the same.

359
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,120
No, sorry. You confuse being weird
with being an idiot.

360
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,200
But you know what?
Tonight I will spy on her again.

361
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:42,200
<i>He always has weed on him.</i>
<i>Smoking, for him, is communication.</i>

362
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,760
<i>Like talking on the phone for others.</i>

363
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,880
<i>Sometimes you have to guess</i>
<i>whether he's sad or stoned.</i>

364
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,280
<i>One advantage of being an idiot</i>
<i>is not having to justify yourself 100%.</i>

365
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,440
<i>And one drawback is that you accumulate</i>
<i>mistakes faster than others.</i>

366
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:24,960
<i>As I've grown more confident,</i>
<i>I have become more and more daring.</i>

367
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:42,199
<i>Only an idiot would prowl the house</i>
<i>in this weather.</i>

368
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,320
<i>I am less and less careful.</i>

369
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,240
<i>It is clear that she's suspicious.</i>

370
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,600
<i>And determined as she is,</i>
<i>with or without a husband,</i>

371
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,040
<i>my days as a spy are numbered.</i>

372
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,520
No, please!

373
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,440
No, please!

374
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
No!

375
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,120
-Please…
-No…

376
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:42,800
-No! Please. No!
-Shut…

377
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,560
If you don't stop screaming, I'll smash
your face into the ground. Shut up!

378
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,760
Shut up. Like that.
So, good. Don't get scared.

379
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:55,760
I'm not going to hurt you. I am no thief.
Look, let's do something.

380
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:00,120
Now, I'm going to let you go
and I'm going to stand back there.

381
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,160
Calmly. I will remain seated.
Without moving. I will do nothing.

382
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,640
Okay? Can you hear me?
Do whatever you want with me.

383
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,320
Tie me up, call the police,
whatever you want.

384
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,160
Understood? Nod if you understood me.

385
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,760
Very well.

386
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,160
I'll let you go now.

387
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:25,440
See? That's it. It's all right.

388
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,960
It's all right…

389
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:50,320
That's it. See? It's all right.
I won't do anything.

390
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,840
Damn!

391
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,360
Fuck…

392
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,360
Will you please fucking call someone?

393
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,360
No. Please, no.

394
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,920
You've been hanging around
the house lately, haven't you?

395
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,800
Yes.

396
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,480
Why? We don't have anything of value.

397
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,040
I'm no thief.

398
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,640
-You're not?
-No.

399
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,120
What are you then?

400
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,440
A harmless idiot.

401
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,160
How many times have you spied on me?

402
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,880
-Not many.
-What have you seen?

403
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,560
Just you.

404
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,880
-Me?
-Yes, I've watched you working.

405
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,320
How you clean the house,
how you rule your life.

406
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,560
You look happy.

407
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,400
You're crazy. Happy? Screw you.

408
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,560
The whole story of the banners…
Was it a lie?

409
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,240
-Yes.
-All to talk to me?

410
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Yes.

411
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,480
You're a bastard, man.

412
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,360
I don't forgive you, do you understand?
Who the fuck do you think you are!

413
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,440
If you want everyone to look at you,
go to a bridge and jump!

414
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,360
I don't want everyone to look at me.

415
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,200
You just want me to look at you.

416
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,840
-Yes.
-Let's see if I understand.

417
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,000
One night I split your head open
with my ladder

418
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,840
and you fell in love platonically.

419
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,280
Is that it?

420
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,200
More or less.

421
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,400
Things don't work that way.

422
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,440
How do they work?

423
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:45,200
Leave me alone. I'm sick
of people like you, for fuck's sake.

424
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,640
It's okay.

425
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,760
No.

426
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,920
I don't want to see you anymore!

427
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,880
<i>Better for all. She inside</i>
<i>and me outside, as it should be.</i>

428
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,720
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>I do want to see more of her.</i>

429
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,280
<i>And I will.</i>

430
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,000
Don't worry, it's me.
I used Godfather's keys.

431
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,240
Dude, you are so screwed.

432
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,680
You almost gave yourself pneumonia.

433
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,400
-You took quite a blow to the head.
-It is nothing.

434
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,840
-Stay in bed today.
-No…

435
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,120
I wouldn't be surprised if
you were really anemic.

436
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,480
You, a graduate,
a civil servant of the Generalitat,

437
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,480
secondary school teacher on leave,
instructor at Càrdenas,

438
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,160
what mess have you gotten into?

439
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:26,520
Chicken consommé
with egg yolk and a little cognac.

440
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,520
-Eat it and go to sleep.
-Jordina…

441
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,840
And don't get up. You have a fever.

442
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,200
-I'm not hungry.
-All of it.

443
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,440
<i>Pere-Lluc.</i>

444
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,000
<i>Pere-Lluc.</i>

445
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,360
<i>Pere-Lluc.</i>

446
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,880
Nicco…

447
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,840
Relax, it's me.

448
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:04,440
-I brought Àlex to keep you company.
-Thank you, Jordina.

449
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,080
Hey! That's a lot!

450
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:13,000
Maybe I've gone a bit overboard
with the cognac, but don't make a fuss.

451
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,960
It will do you good to sleep.

452
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,920
And it's good cognac.
It won't be bad for you. Come on, baby.

453
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,400
<i>What a whore!</i>
<i>She got me drunk to fuck in peace.</i>

454
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,120
<i>While I was here, in the flesh.</i>

455
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,760
<i>I wish them luck, especially her.</i>
<i>She'll need it.</i>

456
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,240
I don't mind you using
my flat to be with Alex.

457
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,680
But don't get me drunk. There's no need.

458
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,040
Don't get mad.
I promise you I didn't mean to do it.

459
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:12,120
I have waited so long for him
to make up his mind, and finally…

460
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,040
Poor Pere-Lluc.

461
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:25,720
Cheer up or you'll get really sick.
Depressions remove the body's defenses.

462
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,440
Anemia is very treacherous
and viruses are very nasty.

463
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,440
-Are you sure it wasn't the motorbike?
-No, it was with a stick.

464
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,720
By the same girl who
hit you with the ladder, right?

465
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,360
No, I hit myself with the ladder.

466
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,520
-Come on, man!
-Some loves kill.

467
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,720
<i>Not only am I an idiot, but I'm turning</i>
<i>into a predictable, textbook psychopath.</i>

468
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,360
Sorry.
Listen for a moment. No, don't be afraid.

469
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,600
Bastard, son of a bitch!
Following me again?

470
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,200
Or did you find me by chance?

471
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,880
Yes and no. I was on my way home,
I saw you and I couldn't help but stop.

472
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,800
I wanted to thank you.

473
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,920
-What are you talking about?
-No, listen!

474
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,800
It's the least I can do
after your generosity.

475
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,920
You didn't report me.

476
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,920
<i>We lying idiots</i>
<i>know how to be very convincing.</i>

477
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,400
Oh, really? The other day
was the other day and today is today.

478
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,040
Don't push your luck.

479
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,720
My husband's coming to pick me up,
he's on his way.

480
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,880
He knows everything. He'll kill you!

481
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:29,400
-I'm not sure.
-Forget me, for fuck's sake.

482
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,200
Excuse me,
can you give this card to that girl?

483
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:41,920
Thank you.

484
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,880
I want you to see
that I'm not afraid of you.

485
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,920
I'm not afraid of you.

486
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,400
So be careful,
there are a lot of people here.

487
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,600
In two seconds everyone
would be on to you.

488
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:12,040
In all the confusion, maybe I'd poke
your eye out with my nail file.

489
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:15,120
-You don't need to be so convoluted.
-Of course, I forgot.

490
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,160
You'd lean your head on the bar
and offer me your eye yourself.

491
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,400
Yes.

492
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,560
Pere-Lluc Solans.
Why are you giving me this?

493
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,080
-So you can see that you've got me.
-I don't want you at all.

494
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,680
-It could be fake.
-Yes, but it's not.

495
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,840
It isn't.

496
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,280
So it wasn't a lie that you were working
in some kind of academy?

497
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,320
I've never met anyone like you before.

498
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,080
I'm really waiting for my husband,
it's true!

499
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:57,000
We work at night and sometimes
it is difficult to organize our schedules.

500
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,400
Won't you say anything?

501
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,080
Aren't you afraid to meet him?

502
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:07,240
Yes, very much. No one likes to have
their face smashed in, but…

503
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,680
-I would consider it fair compensation.
-What do you want? To make a fuss?

504
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,160
No. Let me just be with you for a while.

505
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,800
In silence, if you like.
You can slap me if you want.

506
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,960
Dammit…

507
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,520
You'll help me kill time.

508
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,280
Since you're a clown,
you'll distract me for a while.

509
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,000
But you are a dangerous drunk.
Do you always go for all or nothing?

510
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,360
No, never. Quite the contrary.

511
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,360
It is curious that…

512
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,080
It's so easy to do something
that five minutes earlier

513
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,440
you would have considered crazy.

514
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,640
When people are lonely
they go to the cinema or to the theater.

515
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,160
Or to a bar, but not to harass others.

516
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,920
What did you see while
you were spying on me?

517
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,120
How you sunbathed.

518
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,600
How you prepared dinner,
how you did your manicure.

519
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,160
-Nothing else?
-Nothing.

520
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,840
Pigs like you only want
to see naked chicks.

521
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,920
I assure you that this is not the case.

522
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,200
I have never touched a fly in my life

523
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,480
and you forced me to bring out
my most disgusting side.

524
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,120
Both today and the other day.

525
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,480
And I'll never forgive
you for that, asshole!

526
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,840
<i>She's pissed off.</i>

527
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:31,320
<i>Like when they get angry in comic strips</i>
<i>and they draw thunder and lightning.</i>

528
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,440
<i>I'm shaking with arousal</i>
<i>and I don't want her to notice.</i>

529
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,840
What's wrong? I'm leaving too.
Today my husband is away.

530
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,560
-How will you get home?
-What do you care?

531
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,680
Taxi!

532
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:08,720
<i>I have always let chance organize my life.</i>

533
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,760
<i>I have left myself adrift</i>
<i>in everyday life.</i>

534
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:19,840
<i>My inner contradictions</i>
<i>come to the surface.</i>

535
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:25,000
<i>This makes the core of my character</i>
<i>all the more evident and magnificent:</i>

536
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,520
<i>Idiocy.</i>

537
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:30,480
<i>But, right now, chance always goes</i>
<i>in the same direction.</i>

538
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,120
<i>Life, with its impassive flow,</i>
<i>leads me to this girl.</i>

539
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,480
<i>It would take an iron will to stop myself.</i>

540
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,280
Are you bring it or not?

541
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:01,120
Do you know what? Forget it.
I have to go. Goodbye.

542
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:08,040
<i>So I settle in, as if playing dead at sea.</i>

543
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,960
<i>Close your eyes</i>

544
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:14,240
<i>and ten minutes later you open them</i>
<i>to see where the tide has taken you.</i>

545
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:18,280
<i>It's always at night</i>
<i>and I'm parked next to her van.</i>

546
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,000
<i>It's as easy as that.</i>

547
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,440
<i>Over time, she relaxes.</i>

548
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,840
<i>Curiosity gets the best of her.</i>

549
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,640
-Don't you like insecure people?
-Huh? No way.

550
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:34,120
In fact, if anything,
I see insecurity everywhere.

551
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,240
Some mornings I'm not sure
if I'll find myself in the mirror.

552
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,880
Everyone thinks they're different
from who they are.

553
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:43,160
We tend to see ourselves as
we would like to be, not as we are.

554
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,160
Really?

555
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,080
Of course, otherwise none of us
would have enough patience

556
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,360
to stand ourselves as we are.

557
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,400
<i>I don't think she has many friends.</i>

558
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,520
<i>Maybe the ones she has</i>
<i>are no good for her.</i>

559
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:59,240
<i>When she speaks to me, it often seems</i>
<i>that she speaks to herself.</i>

560
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:02,360
The main difference between
living in a couple and not…

561
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:05,600
When you pick someone up and go to bed,
they undress you.

562
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,600
If you live with someone,
you undress yourself and wait.

563
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,560
For the record,
this happens to all couples.

564
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,960
I have read that a person in love
always ends up looking ridiculous.

565
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:21,720
The opportunities for ridicule
multiply 24 hours a day.

566
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:26,000
If you're going to do it…
You might as well do it for love, right?

567
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:27,480
I like to know that.

568
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:31,280
When was the last time you made
a fool of yourself over love?

569
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,440
I don't know.

570
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,120
I have to go. My husband is already here.

571
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,960
Well, good luck.

572
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,560
And don't be so stubborn, man.
You're paying, right?

573
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:49,640
<i>I think she has forgiven me</i>

574
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,520
<i>and that she doesn't want to stab</i>
<i>my eye anymore.</i>

575
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:57,920
Thank you. There are 32 banners left.
32 banners with studs.

576
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,680
Wooden… How wide is it?

577
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,160
-Darling.
-Hello.

578
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:28,600
My back hurts from climbing the ladder.

579
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:32,560
I can't find that part of the street.
The guide must be old.

580
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,520
<i>I'm a suicidal idiot and this girl,</i>

581
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,640
<i>as well as blonde, beautiful,</i>
<i>determined, and sexy,</i>

582
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,440
<i>is a bit of a whore.</i>

583
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:37,920
<i>But I don't care.</i>

584
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,400
<i>I'm starting to be happy</i>
<i>with my dependence.</i>

585
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,880
I'm off to lunch.

586
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:50,160
-I am very angry with you.
-Why?

587
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,840
You still haven't asked me
how it's going with Àlex.

588
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,200
You are selfish.

589
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:57,720
Sorry, I'm asking you now.
It was for the sake of discretion.

590
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,000
It's a lie, but it doesn't matter.

591
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,160
-How are you doing?
-I can't talk about it yet.

592
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,560
Then?

593
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:09,680
Just because I can't talk about it doesn't
mean I don't appreciate that you care.

594
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,920
-Shall we?
-Yes, let's go.

595
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,080
You will never understand anything.

596
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:22,320
Jordina is tense.
Does your wife know you two are doing it?

597
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,400
No.

598
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,560
-Do you plan to tell her?
-No.

599
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,640
Will you tell Jordina
that you won't tell her?

600
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:29,720
No.

601
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:33,760
-Do you love Jordina?
-Yes. No. Oh, I don't know.

602
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,280
-She is crazy about you.
-Yes.

603
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,520
I don't understand. Why don't you give in?

604
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:44,120
Because I know the process by heart
and it bores me.

605
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:47,720
You don't understand because
you have no experience.

606
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:48,800
Thank you.

607
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,040
I am skeptical. I despise our times.

608
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:56,120
In the face of immorality these days,
I can only think: "Ha, ha, ha."

609
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,640
-"Ha, ha, ha?"
-Yes, a hearty laugh.

610
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:05,800
I only get to the bottom of things
if they are filtered by my skepticism.

611
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:10,040
-Can you define "skepticism?"
-No.

612
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:13,280
It's an attitude marked
by the systematic trend

613
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:16,000
to doubt what others think is right.

614
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,440
And what do I find?

615
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,160
So, what do I find?

616
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:22,880
You show up in love
and demand that I behave like you.

617
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,840
Don't insult my intelligence.

618
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:28,000
Only fools base their existence on love.
Which is ephemeral.

619
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,800
And that, as a vital motor,
it is lazy and boring.

620
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,080
And reactionary.

621
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,720
We are not Americans, in love with love.

622
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:38,720
<i>My friend is my reflection.</i>
<i>I look at him and I see myself.</i>

623
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,200
Americans are childish,
fall in love and get together.

624
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,960
And, at the first problem, they divorce.
The easy solution. Why?

625
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,400
Because in love it is enough
to like each other,

626
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,240
and be charming.

627
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:53,960
And in a couple, you have to put up
with each other's faults to be happy.

628
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:57,320
-Stoically.
-Yes. What is love?

629
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:01,080
It is a dialogue between friends
and enemies, identities, and differences.

630
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:06,040
It is a struggle between similarities
and differences, which is why we suffer.

631
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:07,600
I don't mind suffering.

632
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,840
I do. I'm fed up.
I don't know if I want to risk it.

633
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,000
Jordina senses this and becomes sad.

634
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,560
<i>I put up with the sermons.</i>

635
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:17,120
<i>His dream is a world</i>

636
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,920
<i>in which to plant football fields full</i>
<i>of marijuana.</i>

637
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,760
Do you know what the soul is like?

638
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:25,200
It has the shape, color,
and substance of a Palamós shrimp.

639
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,400
I'll prove it.

640
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,480
But you said the world was a fish stock.

641
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:32,800
Of course. Prawns make a good broth.
The broth of the soul.

642
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,520
I'm very impressed.

643
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:39,680
Because the truth of life impresses,
it is attractive, it provokes vertigo.

644
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:44,320
And, according to you, what form
does love take? Rock mussel shape?

645
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,920
Love is nothing. It doesn't exist.

646
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,640
It's an invention of the rich
that we poor people did not even consider.

647
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:55,240
We poor people are a collective,
and collectives do not fall in love.

648
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:58,760
-I am poor and in love.
-You, poor thing?

649
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:01,240
If anything, poor soul,

650
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:04,920
that in the global era you still believe
that love gives meaning to your life.

651
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,120
You've never done well with girls.
It is too late. You're weird, man.

652
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:13,800
And you? You can't say whatever you want
about me just because I'm an idiot.

653
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:18,360
Don't get angry, take it easy.
I have to go.

654
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:23,360
Hey, thanks for lending me your flat.
I got a copy of the key.

655
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,160
<i>Mr. Solans, could you come by the office?</i>

656
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,400
<i>We want to talk about the contract</i>
<i>of the banners.</i> Thank you.

657
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:37,480
Dammit!

658
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,640
You sure came quickly.

659
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,640
You're probably wondering
why I let you touch me.

660
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:05,040
Don't get your hopes up,
I wanted to avoid tragedy.

661
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:08,880
Thank you very much.

662
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,440
Don't be cynical.

663
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,040
I've grown used to you.

664
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,360
You're good for scaring off drunks.

665
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,120
You don't have a big physical presence,
but you slow them down a bit.

666
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:23,760
The truth is that when I waited alone,
I was bored out of my mind.

667
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:29,440
Yes? What's going on?

668
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:34,120
As you wish. Yes, fine. See you later.

669
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,880
That was my husband, he doesn't know
when he'll be back.

670
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:40,040
They took both vans and left me here.

671
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:43,280
If you want I'll take you home.
I don't have any plans.

672
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:46,960
Take me? What are you saying?
I don't have a helmet.

673
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,080
No problem. I'll go get one,
and come back.

674
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,040
It's ten minutes, while you close shop.

675
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,400
Jordina.

676
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,600
-What's wrong?
-It's me.

677
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,640
-Did something happen?
-No.

678
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,680
-I need a favor.
-What?

679
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,720
-Can I borrow your car?
-Yes.

680
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:15,000
Look, here.

681
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:19,240
-I won't be back when you leave.
-Don't worry, we'll take a taxi.

682
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:20,440
-Seriously?
-Yes.

683
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:30,720
My husband won't be home until very late.

684
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:35,200
I don't know if you had plans,
but we could have dinner together.

685
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,840
I'll lift your punishment
for a couple of hours.

686
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,320
Then I'll call home so he'll for me.

687
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,480
Gentlemen.

688
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,480
-The sandwich?
-Thanks.

689
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:55,840
To the banners.

690
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,320
That's right, to the banners.

691
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,080
Well, I got married three years ago.

692
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,760
I came from Valladolid with the clothes
on my back,

693
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,640
now I have a cat to scare mice away,
and a tiny bunny.

694
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:11,200
My house is very cold, it's very humid.
And we spend a lot on heating.

695
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,960
The doors don't close properly
and the heat gets out.

696
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,560
The wood furnace is great.

697
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,320
In my building they think I'm mad.

698
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,360
Oh, really? I'm not surprised.

699
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,320
I want to change
all the building's windows

700
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:26,920
and change them for white PVC,
but there is no way. I always lose votes.

701
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:33,160
-You don't know anything about me.
-Well, what I know is enough.

702
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:36,880
You're right because
my story isn't very bright…

703
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,400
My husband treats me like a queen.
The company is…

704
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,840
The culmination of a dream
of professional independence.

705
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,240
Do you know what I hate about him?

706
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:49,720
He often makes me nervous
and he never knows why.

707
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,920
And that makes me even more nervous.

708
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:55,040
-Well, I hardly ever argue.
-You don't?

709
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:58,120
No, because if the issue is secondary,
I agree with them.

710
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,200
Of course.

711
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,000
And if it's important, it's very hard
to change their minds.

712
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,440
-It's not worth arguing.
-You're right.

713
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:11,080
Look at him, he's a real philosopher.
A stalker, a spy…

714
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:12,280
And a philosopher.

715
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:15,880
<i>I look at her and I'm salivating.</i>
<i>This is a delicate issue.</i>

716
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:18,600
<i>I feel like the wolf</i>
<i>in Little Red Riding Hood.</i>

717
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,360
<i>I am really sick.</i>

718
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:31,320
Did you see how they looked at me?
I have been on the verge of…

719
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:40,560
<i>I give her a kiss in two stages.</i>
<i>Sweet first. Then abrupt, deep.</i>

720
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:49,120
<i>It's exhibitionist,</i>
<i>immature, ostentatious,</i>

721
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,920
<i>and annoying,</i>
<i>because we are no longer children.</i>

722
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:07,160
<i>With our mouths glued together,</i>
<i>we survive by breathing through our noses.</i>

723
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:19,640
<i>After two cyanotic minutes</i>
<i>and 30 seconds, we stopped.</i>

724
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:24,400
You're not a poet too?

725
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:28,240
-No.
-Good.

726
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:31,640
I liked the taste of your mouth,
but poetry lowers my libido.

727
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,720
And a kiss means nothing.

728
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:16,040
Thank you.

729
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,120
I don't have condoms.

730
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:24,680
I do.

731
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,320
<i>I utter an incantation, mentally,</i>

732
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:34,360
<i>in case it seems like poetic prose</i>
<i>and lowers her libido.</i>

733
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:38,000
<i>Earthquakes, typhoons, floods, disasters,</i>

734
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:41,680
<i>calamities, cataclysms, catastrophes,</i>
<i>or simple hardships.</i>

735
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,320
<i>Let them come and catch me in the act.</i>

736
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,600
<i>Let them carry me back and forth</i>
<i>as the sea.</i>

737
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:52,200
<i>Let them turn me inside out</i>
<i>and outside in.</i>

738
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,920
<i>My skin to be turned inside out</i>
<i>like a sock.</i>

739
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Let them come, I'm waiting for them!

740
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:04,960
What do you want?

741
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:08,240
I am going through a confusing time.
Don't take advantage of me.

742
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,000
I've been wanting to be with you for days.

743
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:47,080
I knew it would happen, sooner or later.

744
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,640
But I never would have taken
the first step.

745
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,560
The lady has already paid.
She took a cab ten minutes ago.

746
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:28,440
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

747
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,960
<i>The first station of my Via Crucis</i>
<i>was to spy on her.</i>

748
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:47,120
<i>The second was to follow her</i>
<i>and trust that she would talk to me.</i>

749
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:49,600
<i>The third,</i>

750
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:53,080
<i>meeting each other when she works,</i>
<i>knowing she's expecting me.</i>

751
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:57,080
<i>Because now she informs me</i>
<i>where she will be and at what time.</i>

752
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:01,120
<i>She doesn't slap me anymore.</i>
<i>We don't argue, we don't even talk.</i>

753
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,400
<i>Now we fuck.</i>

754
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:08,920
<i>It's the most idiotic Via Crucis</i>
<i>in history. It is the anti-Via Crucis.</i>

755
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:18,480
<i>Circumstantial love in a car,</i>
<i>as if the world were coming to an end.</i>

756
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:26,640
<i>Like two homeless tramps,</i>
<i>we make the most of every nook and cranny.</i>

757
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:35,320
<i>It is impossible to explain</i>
<i>such a contrast of feelings.</i>

758
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:44,840
<i>It is provoked by the intimate mixture</i>
<i>of pleasure and fear.</i>

759
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:53,640
<i>Or the pleasure and difficulty</i>
<i>of achieving it.</i>

760
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:02,040
<i>Or, simply, the pleasure and,</i>
<i>all around, the dirt or the cold.</i>

761
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:07,240
<i>Perhaps she, like me is also afraid</i>

762
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:11,000
<i>of ending up living immersed</i>
<i>in an existential inertia,</i>

763
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:12,840
<i>neither dead nor alive.</i>

764
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:21,520
<i>Living neither in the present</i>
<i>nor in the past,</i>

765
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,440
<i>nor in the future.</i>

766
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:30,640
<i>Kept by our idiocy</i>
<i>in a continuous unconsciousness,</i>

767
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:35,120
<i>slimy, gelatinous, with an expiry date.</i>

768
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:43,680
<i>Every time I try to talk,</i>
<i>she tells me to shut up.</i>

769
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:50,000
<i>She makes love to me with a tragic sense.</i>

770
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:54,480
<i>She has entered my life in such</i>
<i>an unselfish, and affectionate way…</i>

771
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:57,320
<i>I don't understand. I'm just an idiot.</i>

772
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:00,120
<i>The sooner she realizes this,</i>
<i>the better for everyone.</i>

773
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,680
<i>A flash goes through my head.</i>

774
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:11,400
<i>Nothing indicates that she thinks of me</i>
<i>not one-hundredth of what I think of her.</i>

775
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:17,640
<i>I know that all this cannot last forever.</i>

776
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,760
<i>It is the sensation of being absorbed.</i>

777
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:29,000
<i>The usual impulse that gets me</i>
<i>into trouble.</i>

778
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:43,760
<i>Our sex is ugly, dirty, ragged, wretched.</i>

779
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,200
-Yes?
-You called me.

780
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:02,200
It must have been my wife.
She's not here, but she won't be long.

781
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:07,040
-You can't stay and wait, I'm closing.
-Don't worry. I will be back.

782
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:10,840
If you know what you want to advertise,
we can provide our services.

783
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:13,680
Even if we do not share the message 100%.

784
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:22,480
-Hello, have you been waiting for long?
-No.

785
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:30,360
-You don't look good.
-I just didn't sleep very well tonight.

786
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:32,440
My husband will be out all day.

787
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:36,320
Have you seen?
I have an important business lunch.

788
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:40,120
This makes me look serious, so I'm not
treated as my husband's secretary,

789
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:42,120
nothing makes me more nervous.

790
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:52,680
I have always been faithful to my husband.

791
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:55,080
Always, until now.

792
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
But I feel very good with you.

793
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:03,840
I have very little past, no future,
and almost no present.

794
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,040
I'll have to find another suit.

795
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:12,120
If you want us to keep making
love on the sly, we'll do it. Wherever.

796
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:14,760
What do you think about chance?

797
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:17,960
You mean because of our meeting?

798
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:20,640
You think it's a stroke of fate,
don't you?

799
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:22,120
Why not?

800
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:26,399
You are stimulated by the thought of fate.
You find it romantic.

801
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:28,200
Not me.

802
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:30,960
For me, it's the result that counts.

803
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,200
Chance doesn't exist.

804
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:35,479
We only have…

805
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:39,560
A small piece of insight
into one aspect of life.

806
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:44,160
We think that something is the result
of chance

807
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:47,319
but there could be a unifying thread that,
by stretching it,

808
01:09:47,399 --> 01:09:50,200
would show a cause-effect relationship.

809
01:09:50,279 --> 01:09:51,479
Come on, woman.

810
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:54,640
So, it was inevitable that I would collide
with your ladder.

811
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:58,120
No, not inevitable, but possible.
And even likely.

812
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:03,160
Chance only exists in novels.
Full of chance encounters.

813
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:05,880
-Like ours.
-Our meeting was not fortuitous.

814
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:07,400
You were spying on me.

815
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:10,480
That triggered everything else
and now we are where we are.

816
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,320
Where is the chance?

817
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:15,200
-You are a romantic.
-Yes, I am.

818
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:18,360
That's the state of things.
That and nothing else.

819
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:26,480
<i>We idiots have ultra-sensitive ears.</i>

820
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:29,280
<i>I want to cry with gratitude.</i>

821
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:36,280
Farmacur are holding a cocktail party
and we have been invited.

822
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,760
If you want we can go.
We will have a good time.

823
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:40,400
Today I am a free girl.

824
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:42,280
How nice.

825
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:53,720
What is your name?

826
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:57,960
Sandra.

827
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:02,800
<i>Are you there, Pere-Lluc?</i>

828
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:06,480
<i>I want to tell you that I'm closing</i>
<i>the flat in San Telmo.</i>

829
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:09,360
<i>I haven't lived there for a long time</i>
<i>and I'm leaving it.</i>

830
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:12,760
<i>In memory of Nicco,</i>
<i>I kept it open for more than six months.</i>

831
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:14,520
<i>Rummaging around I found things</i>

832
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:18,200
<i>and wanted to give them to his friends,</i>
<i>as a token to remember him by.</i>

833
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:23,600
-Thank you for coming.
-Thank you for having us.

834
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:32,960
I'll go get some drinks.

835
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:46,320
Hi, can I have a couple of drinks?

836
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:48,920
Come.

837
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:55,960
-Thanks.
-Who is that?

838
01:11:57,160 --> 01:12:00,760
The inventor of the Cadiblop,
the multi-purpose sponge chair.

839
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:04,120
Utility or aesthetics?

840
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:07,680
This dilemma, for me,
at the beginning of the 21st century,

841
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:10,120
simply does not exist.

842
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:13,360
A kettle is as useful as a watering can,

843
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:16,280
but we associate positive feelings with
the kettle,

844
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:17,920
such as warmth or well-being,

845
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,280
and neutral feelings
with the watering can.

846
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:22,080
Shall we go?

847
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:28,480
Result? We design beautiful teapots
made of noble materials

848
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:32,240
and watering cans are no more
than brass and plastic.

849
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:50,240
I love you
and I want to have children with you.

850
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:55,840
What should we would do now?

851
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:59,240
I'd have you over at my flat,
but some friends are squatting there.

852
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:00,520
I'll tell you about it.

853
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:03,240
Come on, get in.

854
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:11,320
-Pere-Lluc…
-What?

855
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:16,400
We should let everything
that is happening to us rest for a while.

856
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:18,680
What do you mean?

857
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:22,600
<i>Can you kick me just like that?</i>
<i>What has changed in an hour?</i>

858
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:25,680
<i>I don't know. I am an idiot.</i>

859
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,520
Go down. You can call a cab.

860
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,160
Pere-Lluc…

861
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:46,800
I'm going home.

862
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:49,600
I need a favor, don't ask questions.

863
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:52,200
And above all, do nothing.
Don't look for me.

864
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:54,080
Don't call me, I'll call you.

865
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:58,560
I'll call you, I promise. Can you hear me?

866
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:13,640
<i>Five sentences, five punches. Dammit.</i>

867
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,000
<i>Maybe it's all over.</i>

868
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:21,600
<i>I may not be able to make love</i>
<i>to you again on the sly in 20 minutes.</i>

869
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:27,520
<i>I was told to wait,</i>
<i>that you would call me back.</i>

870
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:31,520
<i>And, docile, I obey.</i>

871
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:35,640
<i>A month has passed and no sign of life.</i>

872
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:43,120
<i>If it weren't for my friends…</i>
<i>I've told them about Sandra.</i>

873
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,600
<i>To lighten the wait,</i>
<i>they try to distract me.</i>

874
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:46,800
<i>I'm delighted.</i>

875
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:51,080
No matter what I think,
it was 15 years ago, why?

876
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:54,000
Because we haven't done
anything useful, look at me.

877
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:56,880
-Come on, man!
-Yes, but it has been 15 years.

878
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,440
What have we been doing all this time?

879
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,640
<i>We're talking about 15 years ago,</i>

880
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:05,400
<i>when the same idiocy made us feel</i>
<i>metaphysical concerns.</i>

881
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:08,920
We did psychophonies
and everyone had heard something.

882
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,400
Or we tried astral travel.

883
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:14,360
We wanted to leave our body
in an unknown direction.

884
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:16,440
We concentrated, holding hands.

885
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:20,680
The preferred destinations
were the unverifiable: India,

886
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:23,080
Greenland… As far as Ganymede.

887
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:25,400
-Once… Do you remember, Àlex?
-Yes.

888
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:30,400
A lady assured us that she traveled
astrally to her village.

889
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:34,040
She told us that she saw her father
run over the dog with an R-4.

890
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:37,840
I can claim to be the inventor
of Catalan astral travel.

891
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:41,360
-Yes? What is it like?
-I'm serious, right?

892
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:44,720
It consists of getting out of the body,
but without going too far.

893
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:48,200
I was concentrating, starting to rise,
but I couldn't.

894
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:51,280
Try as I might, I never got past
the dining room ceiling.

895
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:54,440
He got stuck to the light fixture.

896
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:57,080
I never made it upstairs.

897
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:59,640
It's the first case in the history
of psychedelia

898
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:02,520
of astral travel of gallinaceous flight.

899
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:06,560
-Did you want to fly too?
-I don't remember anything.

900
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:08,840
I smoked a lot, then.

901
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:11,280
-Now, not even when high.
-What do you mean?

902
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:14,200
We can't even hide from
the fucking reality by smoking.

903
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:17,680
Human life is worth less than dog shit.

904
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,040
Is life worth so little?

905
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:24,000
I look at mine
and it seems so little to me…

906
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:27,520
I used to think that it was not
logical for life to happen this way.

907
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:29,480
Life could not be like that.

908
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:32,600
I thought that something would happen
that would make sense.

909
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:34,920
I sensed that I could live my whole life

910
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,360
without anything happening
and I got scared.

911
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:38,720
Then I had my son.

912
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:41,560
And I am no longer interested
in that issue.

913
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:45,640
It's stuck.

914
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:48,720
Sometimes it switches itself on and off.

915
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:51,200
If you hit the brakes, it'll start again.

916
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:54,760
-How do you stop it?
-I don't know, it does it on its own.

917
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:59,040
Sometimes, I say to my son: "Shall we get
on the motorway to listen to the CD?"

918
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:01,200
And he loves it.

919
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:08,640
<i>The adventure begins brushing our teeth.</i>

920
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:12,160
<i>We must take care, to avoid incidents.</i>

921
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:15,880
<i>On this long journey</i>
<i>That begins by reading.</i>

922
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:18,840
<i>A book is the luggage…</i>

923
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:21,280
<i>For overnight travel.</i>

924
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:25,520
<i>May your dreams come true.</i>

925
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,880
<i>Good night.</i>

926
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:35,200
<i>I miss Sandra very much.</i>

927
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,440
<i>Fucking shitty messages.</i>

928
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,800
<i>And, docile, I obey.</i>

929
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:48,680
<i>Until I behave like a bastard.</i>

930
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:52,760
-Shall we have dinner together?
-Yes.

931
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:54,120
Helena?

932
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:03,440
<i>I'm sure I keep my erection just</i>
<i>by thinking that Sandra is on top of me.</i>

933
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:11,960
It is not fair play.
She has taken a risk and I have not.

934
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:13,720
Quite the contrary.

935
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:17,200
To cum I thought about the girl I love.

936
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:20,360
I've been a son of a bitch.

937
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:23,760
It's not very nice to say that to someone
who just slept with you.

938
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:26,440
I guess not. That's why I had to tell you.

939
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:29,320
I know why I wanted to be with you.

940
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:32,000
I am alone, with grown-up children,

941
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:36,840
I work in Brussels and hadn't been back
in Barcelona in eight years.

942
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,520
I left a life here.

943
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:42,440
Now I'm back and I feel like a stranger.
I have no one.

944
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:45,200
Or who I have is as good as gone.
I am not interested.

945
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:50,400
I need affection, but intimate affection.
I thought you could give it to me.

946
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:53,640
At my age, I don't care about the risks.
But what about you?

947
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:57,280
-Why did you want to be with me?
-Why not?

948
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:00,720
I can be in love with Sandra
and feel free to be with you.

949
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,640
I have been waiting
for weeks for her call,

950
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:08,280
but I don't think it will ever come.

951
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:13,880
She told me not to call or look for her…
She will do it herself.

952
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:15,320
How long ago was this?

953
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:18,240
-One month.
-What do you want?

954
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:20,960
To take her away.

955
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:25,160
If she hasn't called in a month,
it's one of two things:

956
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:28,960
either she wants this to end
or she wants you to go looking for her.

957
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:31,400
She won't call.

958
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:39,800
Don't leave so soon.
What you have to do can wait a bit.

959
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:42,760
I'm going to Brussels tomorrow,
I won't bother you.

960
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:46,480
We may never see each other again.
But stay a little longer.

961
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:49,440
-It's impossible.
-I'm begging you.

962
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:52,880
Let's have another drink.
Just another drink.

963
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:56,760
-No!
-Fuck you, bastard.

964
01:19:57,680 --> 01:20:00,880
<i>And I would, if someone could tell me</i>
<i>the most direct way.</i>

965
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:07,040
<i>It's been months since I've done</i>
<i>the one thing I should be doing.</i>

966
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:10,120
<i>I don't understand myself.</i>
<i>I just left a magnificent woman.</i>

967
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:14,800
<i>I know I need to resolve</i>
<i>my relationship with Sandra.</i>

968
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:18,640
<i>I yearn…</i>

969
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:24,320
<i>I yearn…</i>

970
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:28,280
<i>I can't wait to get the hell out of here.</i>

971
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,040
<i>And what I do is go to Argentina.</i>

972
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:39,080
<i>Chasing Nicco.</i>

973
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:43,680
At first, Vera stayed.
Then she left. It's to be expected, right?

974
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:46,760
Now she comes from time to time,
but not on a regular basis.

975
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:51,240
I didn't even know Nicco had died.
If not, I would've come to the funeral.

976
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:54,480
He was taken to Chacarita.
It's far, but it's easy to get to.

977
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:58,720
You can take the underground.
And Vera? Do you know how to find her?

978
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:03,000
Too bad she's not here.
I think she left for London recently.

979
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:11,880
<i>Now that I've found him,</i>
<i>I don't know what to say.</i>

980
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:15,960
<i>Nicco does not leave me with a feeling</i>
<i>of tragedy and pain, on the contrary.</i>

981
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:18,520
<i>He offers me an atmosphere</i>
<i>of calmness and love.</i>

982
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:21,680
<i>With him,</i>
<i>I felt a little less like an idiot.</i>

983
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:25,480
<i>I'm leaving. Quiet and peaceful.</i>

984
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:32,960
<i>Now I know why I have come</i>
<i>to say goodbye to my friend.</i>

985
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:36,040
<i>It has been an essential shortcut</i>
<i>to get where I want to go.</i>

986
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:39,000
Hi, it's me.

987
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:40,800
<i>Hello.</i>

988
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:43,560
-Do you mind me calling.
<i>-No, did something happen?</i>

989
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:46,200
No.

990
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:49,040
<i>-Where are you?</i>
-Buenos Aires.

991
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:54,440
<i>-Ah, on holiday?</i>
-No, I am saying goodbye to my friend.

992
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:57,240
<i>-Are you okay?</i>
-Yes.

993
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:00,600
<i>-Do you feel better?</i>
-Yes.

994
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:02,720
<i>When do you plan to return?</i>

995
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:07,160
Well… tonight or tomorrow. I don't know,
it depends a bit on the flights.

996
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:11,680
<i>-Oh… Are you sure you're okay?</i>
-I'm sure.

997
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:14,360
My friend left me some marbles
as an inheritance.

998
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,320
-Can you hear them?
<i>-Yes.</i>

999
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,960
<i>-I think it's a good inheritance.</i>
-Me too.

1000
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:32,320
-Hi, it's me.
<i>-Hello, where are you now?</i>

1001
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,760
At the airfield… Well, the airport.

1002
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:38,440
<i>-Are you flying to Barcelona?</i>
-No, I'm going to Madrid. Can we talk?

1003
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:41,280
-<i>My husband picks me up in three minutes.</i>
-We have two…

1004
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:43,800
you'll have one left over to wait for him.

1005
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:46,400
Sandra?

1006
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:58,120
It's me again.

1007
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:01,120
<i>-Hello.</i>
-I see you are already in the office.

1008
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:03,520
<i>I came in early to go over</i>
<i>some delivery notes.</i>

1009
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:07,360
-And your husband?
<i>-He brought me here and left.</i>

1010
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:10,720
I am at the ae… No, I'm at…

1011
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:14,680
No, tell me… Well, I'm at Madrid airport.

1012
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:17,520
-I'm using a card, it won't get cut off.
<i>-Good.</i>

1013
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:20,640
<i>Thank you for calling.</i>
<i>When will you arrive?</i>

1014
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:23,800
I don't know. Around 21:00 p.m.
or so, why?

1015
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:27,800
-Sandra?
<i>-What?</i>

1016
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:32,840
-Maybe I'll call you back.
<i>-Sounds fine. Safe travels.</i>

1017
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:34,840
See you later.

1018
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:03,960
Yes, a month is enough time.

1019
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:10,520
Excuse me.

1020
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:16,160
You look tired.

1021
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,760
-Yes, it's been a long trip.
-Do you want an aspirin?

1022
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:22,120
Okay.

1023
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:24,960
I'll get you one. I'll be right back.

1024
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:34,000
<i>Is no one here?</i>
<i>Is it the answering machine?</i>

1025
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:40,280
<i>You hung up mid-sentence.</i>
<i>You know what? Goodbye and good riddance.</i>

1026
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:52,760
I have to deliver some material
with the van. Will you join me?

1027
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:54,600
Okay.

1028
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:03,720
-Wait, I'll drive.
-Very good.

1029
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:18,600
I feel like I just kidnapped you.

1030
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:24,120
It goes against my way of life,
but it is a case of force majeure.

1031
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:25,840
The exception that proves the rule.

1032
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:36,080
What are you thinking?

1033
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:38,960
Nothing important.

1034
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:42,760
The day I caught you spying on me,
you told me inaccurate things.

1035
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:45,840
Don't misunderstand me.

1036
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:50,600
I don't manage my own life and I'm not
a particularly happy or contented girl.

1037
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:53,160
At least no more than many other people.

1038
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:55,760
Do you understand?

1039
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:59,040
I understand.

1040
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:03,720
-Stop.
-What?

1041
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:04,800
Stop!

1042
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:06,360
-Here?
-Yes.

1043
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:45,040
<i>Life and I are two parallel lines,</i>
<i>each one on a pavement.</i>

1044
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,080
<i>I feel unable to cross to the other side.</i>

1045
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:54,840
<i>If the parallels only meet at infinity,</i>
<i>they are of no interest to me.</i>

1046
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:57,760
<i>We idiots don't have access to that.</i>

1047
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:17,640
<i>The closer it gets,</i>
<i>the more I feel pulled into the future.</i>

1048
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:20,480
<i>Knowing that I cannot</i>
<i>offer you guarantees,</i>

1049
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:22,920
<i>that love begins and ends, always.</i>

1050
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:30,520
<i>And that hope, all the hope in the world,</i>
<i>are smoke, just smoke.</i>

1051
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:38,360
<i>My life is a long and profitable</i>
<i>road to idiocy.</i>

1052
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:42,160
<i>Like a woodworm in the wood,</i>
<i>it corrodes us to the end.</i>

1053
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:45,480
<i>Time goes by and we don't change.</i>

1054
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:49,200
<i>And experience does not make us wiser,</i>
<i>but older.</i>

1055
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:05,480
<i>Love, in its absurdity,</i>

1056
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:09,040
<i>makes us allow ourselves to be tempted</i>
<i>by a cloud of optimism.</i>

1057
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:10,720
Pere-Lluc!

1058
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:19,440
<i>I am an afflicted and eager man,</i>

1059
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:26,600
<i>dedicated and grateful, hungry as a dog.</i>

1060
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:37,680
It's over.

1061
01:28:58,560 --> 01:28:59,760
We are leaving.

1062
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:11,200
<i>We idiots can only have faith,</i>
<i>hope, and charity.</i>

1063
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:14,960
<i>And a little love, because it's free.</i>
