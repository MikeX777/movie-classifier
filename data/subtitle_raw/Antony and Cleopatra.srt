1
00:04:11,247 --> 00:04:12,410
Enobarbus!

2
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:14,374
My friend Eros?

3
00:04:16,461 --> 00:04:17,837
Where is Mark Antony?

4
00:04:19,131 --> 00:04:20,590
Is walking in the garden.

5
00:04:29,893 --> 00:04:31,517
There are hard news come with this.

6
00:04:32,604 --> 00:04:34,395
Will desire your presence.

7
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:37,733
I'll bring him to hom

8
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,792
If it be love indeed, tell me how much.

9
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:02,091
There's beggary in the love that
can be reckon'd.

10
00:05:03,972 --> 00:05:07,590
I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved.

11
00:05:07,851 --> 00:05:11,683
Then must thou needs find out new
heaven, new earth.

12
00:05:15,568 --> 00:05:17,774
Nay, but this dotage of our general's
O'erflows the measure:

13
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,723
his captain's heart,which in the
scuffles of great fights hath burst

14
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:24,359
The buckles on his breast, reneges
all temper,

15
00:05:25,397 --> 00:05:28,769
And is become the bellows and the fan
To cool a gipsy's lust.

16
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:34,943
You shall see in him.

17
00:05:35,142 --> 00:05:38,242
The triple pillar of the world transform'd
Into a strumpet's fool

18
00:05:52,442 --> 00:05:54,150
News, my good lord, from Rome.

19
00:05:56,905 --> 00:05:58,696
What news from Rome?

20
00:05:59,116 --> 00:06:01,405
Let Rome in Tiber melt!

21
00:06:02,578 --> 00:06:07,454
and the wide arch of the ranged empire fall!
Here is my space..

22
00:06:08,292 --> 00:06:14,011
Kingdoms are clay: our dungy earth alike
Feeds beast as man:

23
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:19,873
the nobleness of life
Is to do thus

24
00:06:30,536 --> 00:06:32,820
speak not to us.

25
00:06:51,882 --> 00:06:54,171
Is Caesar with Antonius prized
so slight?

26
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,508
Sir, sometimes, when he is not Antony,

27
00:06:59,932 --> 00:07:04,310
He comes too short of that great quality
Which still should go with Antony

28
00:07:07,858 --> 00:07:13,557
Alexas, sweet Alexas,

29
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:17,608
where's the soothsayer
that you praised so to the queen?

30
00:07:18,036 --> 00:07:19,411
Soothsayer!

31
00:07:31,676 --> 00:07:33,051
Is this the man?

32
00:07:36,306 --> 00:07:37,966
Is't you, sir, that know things?

33
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:45,398
In nature's infinite book of secrecy
A little I can read

34
00:07:47,818 --> 00:07:49,313
Show him your hand.

35
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:56,235
Good sir, give me good fortune

36
00:07:57,037 --> 00:07:59,611
I make not, but foresee.

37
00:08:00,165 --> 00:08:01,957
Pray, then, foresee me one

38
00:08:04,962 --> 00:08:07,204
You shall be yet far fairer
than you are.

39
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:15,135
He means in flesh
Nay, hear him Good now, some excellent fortune!

40
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:21,098
Let me be married to three kings
in a forenoon, and widow them all:

41
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:28,232
let me have a child at fifty,
find me to marry me with Octavius Caesar,

42
00:08:28,446 --> 00:08:31,068
and companion me with my mistress

43
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,617
You shall outlive the lady
whom you serve

44
00:08:43,088 --> 00:08:47,216
O excellent! I love long life
better than figs.

45
00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:51,884
You have seen and proved a fairer former fortune
Than that which is to approach

46
00:08:59,898 --> 00:09:05,853
Out, fool! I forgive thee for
a witch.

47
00:09:30,223 --> 00:09:34,007
Fulvia thy wife first came
into the field....

48
00:09:35,562 --> 00:09:38,349
Against my brother Lucius?

49
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:42,434
and then, joinined their force 'gainst Caesar;
Who from Italy, drave them.

50
00:09:44,947 --> 00:09:47,403
Well, what worst?

51
00:09:47,992 --> 00:09:50,662
The nature of bad news infects
the teller..

52
00:09:50,996 --> 00:09:54,199
When it concerns the fool or coward.

53
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,664
On:Things that are past are done with me.
'Tis thus:

54
00:09:57,684 --> 00:09:59,982
Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,
I hear him as he flatter'd.

55
00:10:03,634 --> 00:10:08,957
Labienus This is stiff news--hath,
with his Parthian force,Extended Asia

56
00:10:09,203 --> 00:10:13,485
from Euphrates;His conquering banner
shook from Syria to Lydia and to Ionia; Whilst--

57
00:10:15,272 --> 00:10:17,312
Antony, thou wouldst say,

58
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,265
O, my lord!

59
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:23,361
Speak to me home, mince not the general tongue:
Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome;

60
00:10:24,114 --> 00:10:26,114
Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase

61
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:36,010
From Sicyon, ho, the news!

62
00:10:39,275 --> 00:10:43,673
Fulvia thy wife is dead

63
00:10:47,349 --> 00:10:48,725
Where died she?

64
00:10:48,934 --> 00:10:50,429
In Sicyon

65
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:57,144
Forbear me.

66
00:11:12,418 --> 00:11:14,458
There's a great spirit gone!

67
00:11:16,673 --> 00:11:19,129
Thus did I desire it:

68
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:27,931
What our contempt doth often hurl from us,
We wish it ours again;

69
00:11:29,395 --> 00:11:32,516
she's good, being gone;

70
00:11:38,822 --> 00:11:46,491
I must from this enchanting queen break off:
My idleness doth hatch

71
00:11:46,982 --> 00:11:48,982
Enobarbus!

72
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:54,714
What's your pleasure, sir?

73
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:56,757
I must with haste from hence.

74
00:11:57,468 --> 00:11:59,046
Why, then, we kill all our women:

75
00:11:59,846 --> 00:12:02,384
we see how mortal an unkindness
is to them;

76
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:04,390
if they suffer our departure,
death's the word.

77
00:12:04,851 --> 00:12:06,262
I must be gone.

78
00:12:06,478 --> 00:12:09,099
Under a compelling occasion,
let women die;

79
00:12:10,023 --> 00:12:14,068
it were
pity to cast them away for nothing;

80
00:12:14,362 --> 00:12:16,319
though, between them and a great cause,
they should be esteemed nothing.

81
00:12:16,572 --> 00:12:19,609
Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of
this, dies instantly;

82
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,995
I have seen her die twenty
times upon far poorer moment:

83
00:12:23,413 --> 00:12:25,425
I do think  death, which commits
some loving act upon her,

84
00:12:25,585 --> 00:12:28,128
she hath such a celerity in dying.

85
00:12:28,596 --> 00:12:30,641
She is cunning past man's thought.

86
00:12:30,841 --> 00:12:35,008
Alack, sir, no; her passions are made of nothing but
the finest part of pure love:

87
00:12:36,219 --> 00:12:39,865
we cannot call her
winds and waters sighs and tears;

88
00:12:40,264 --> 00:12:43,114
they are greater storms and tempests
than almanacs can report:

89
00:12:43,352 --> 00:12:44,943
Would I had never seen her.

90
00:12:45,562 --> 00:12:49,421
O, sir, you had then left unseen
a wonderful piece of work

91
00:12:50,777 --> 00:12:52,401
Fulvia is dead.

92
00:12:54,072 --> 00:12:55,187
Sir?

93
00:12:55,448 --> 00:12:56,991
My wife is dead.

94
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:58,856
Fulvia?

95
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:01,453
Dead.

96
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:06,418
Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice.

97
00:13:07,128 --> 00:13:10,622
If there were no more women but Fulvia,
then had you indeed a cut,

98
00:13:10,965 --> 00:13:13,828
and the case to be lamented:
this grief is crowned with consolation;

99
00:13:14,028 --> 00:13:17,095
The business she hath broached in the state
Cannot endure my absence.

100
00:13:17,431 --> 00:13:20,266
And the business you have broached
here cannot be without you;

101
00:13:20,518 --> 00:13:24,283
especially that of Cleopatra's, which
wholly depends on your presence.

102
00:13:24,856 --> 00:13:26,765
No more light answers.

103
00:13:27,025 --> 00:13:30,132
For not alone The death of Fulvia,
but the letters from  Rome petitioned us at home:

104
00:13:30,612 --> 00:13:35,999
Sextus Pompeius Hath given the dare to Caesar,
and commands The empire of the sea:

105
00:13:37,661 --> 00:13:42,979
The sides o' the world may danger:
Command the officers Our quick remove from hence.

106
00:14:02,898 --> 00:14:04,392
You may see, Lepidus

107
00:14:04,941 --> 00:14:08,030
from Alexandria this is the news:

108
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:13,167
he fishes, drinks, and wastes
The lamps of night in revel

109
00:14:13,367 --> 00:14:18,095
hardly gave audience, or
safed to think he had partners

110
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:22,707
you shall find there a man who
is the sum of all men' faults

111
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,590
Noble Octavius!

112
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,978
His faults in him seem as the
stars of heaven,

113
00:14:28,647 --> 00:14:31,051
More fiery by night's blackness;

114
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:36,460
hereditary, Rather than purchased;
what he cannot change,than what he chooses

115
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,593
You are too indulgent

116
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:42,713
Let us grant, it is not
Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy;

117
00:14:42,913 --> 00:14:44,602
To give a kingdom for a mirth;

118
00:14:44,902 --> 00:14:47,486
to sit and keep the turn of
tippling with a slave;

119
00:14:48,157 --> 00:14:51,916
To reel the streets at noon, and stand
With knaves that smell of sweat:

120
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:54,039
say this becomes him,

121
00:14:54,457 --> 00:14:56,457
As his composure must be rare indeed

122
00:14:56,608 --> 00:14:58,205
Whom these things cannot blemish,-

123
00:14:58,874 --> 00:15:00,434
yet

124
00:15:03,154 --> 00:15:08,318
must Antony no way excuse his faults, when we do bear
So great weight in his lightness.

125
00:15:09,888 --> 00:15:11,003
Here's more news.

126
00:15:11,348 --> 00:15:13,462
Thy biddings have been done;
Most noble Caesar

127
00:15:19,607 --> 00:15:21,342
Pompey is strong at sea;

128
00:15:21,878 --> 00:15:23,878
And it appears he is beloved of those
That only have fear'd Caesar:

129
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:32,537
I should have known no less.

130
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:39,878
No vessel can peep forth, but 'tis as soon
Taken as seen;

131
00:15:40,338 --> 00:15:42,794
For Pompey's name strikes more
Than could his war resisted.

132
00:15:45,552 --> 00:15:49,301
Antony,
Leave your lascivious wassails

133
00:15:52,226 --> 00:15:54,631
When thou once
Wast beaten from Modena,

134
00:15:55,707 --> 00:15:57,913
at thy heel
Did famine follow;

135
00:15:58,656 --> 00:16:03,615
thou didst drink The stale of horses, and the
gilded puddle that beasts would cough at

136
00:16:05,032 --> 00:16:11,172
Was borne so like a soldier, with patience more
than savages could suffer

137
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:12,998
'Tis pity of him

138
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:16,703
Let his shames quickly
Drive him to Rome:

139
00:16:17,262 --> 00:16:20,051
'tis time we twain
Did show ourselves i' the field;

140
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,880
Pompey
Thrives in our idleness.

141
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,195
To-morrow, Caesar,
I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly

142
00:16:28,295 --> 00:16:29,656
Both what by sea and land I ...

143
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:32,499
Till which encounter,
It is my business too. Farewell.

144
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:35,067
Farewell, my lord!

145
00:16:59,592 --> 00:17:04,878
If the great gods be just, they shall assist
The deeds of justest men

146
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,565
Thet Know, worthy Pompey.
They will not deny you

147
00:17:07,968 --> 00:17:09,333
I shall do well:

148
00:17:10,646 --> 00:17:13,511
The people love me, and the sea
is mine;

149
00:17:14,261 --> 00:17:17,161
My powers are crescent.

150
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:22,650
Mark Antony In Egypt sits at dinner,
and will make no wars out doors:

151
00:17:24,348 --> 00:17:26,820
Caesar gets money where
He loses hearts: Lepidus flatters both,

152
00:17:27,057 --> 00:17:28,868
but  neither  cares for him.

153
00:17:29,033 --> 00:17:31,196
Caesar and Lepidus are in the field:
a mighty strength they carry.

154
00:17:31,704 --> 00:17:33,650
Where have you this? 'tis false

155
00:17:33,773 --> 00:17:34,730
From Silvius, sir.

156
00:17:34,927 --> 00:17:36,358
He dreams:

157
00:17:36,927 --> 00:17:38,975
I know they are in Rome together,
Looking for Antony.

158
00:17:41,137 --> 00:17:47,315
But all the charms of love,Tie up the libertine
in a field of feasts, Keep his brain fuming;

159
00:17:49,621 --> 00:17:51,439
that Cleopatra
sauce his appetite

160
00:17:52,942 --> 00:17:54,650
Pompey!

161
00:17:55,904 --> 00:17:57,481
How now, Varrius!

162
00:17:57,697 --> 00:18:01,748
This is most certain that I shall deliver:
Mark Antony is every hour in Rome expected:

163
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:12,201
Menas, I did not think this amorous surfeiter
would have donn'd his helm For such a petty war:

164
00:18:14,424 --> 00:18:16,974
his soldiership
Is twice the other twain:

165
00:18:20,277 --> 00:18:25,886
that our stirring can from the lap
of Egypt's widow pluck
The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony.

166
00:18:26,437 --> 00:18:28,353
I cannot hope
Caesar and Antony shall well greet together:

167
00:18:28,773 --> 00:18:33,020
His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar;
His brother warr'd upon him;

168
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,404
I know not, Menas,Were't not that
we stand up against them all,

169
00:18:36,456 --> 00:18:40,262
'Twere pregnant they should square between
themselves;

170
00:19:45,941 --> 00:19:50,604
Good Enobarbus,entreat your captain
To soft and gentle speech

171
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:54,073
I shall entreat him
To answer like himself:

172
00:19:56,077 --> 00:20:00,455
if Caesar move him,Let Antony look over
Caesar's head And speak as loud as Mars.

173
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:03,682
Your speech is passion:
But, pray you, stir no embers up.

174
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,640
Welcome to Rome.

175
00:20:23,357 --> 00:20:24,638
Thank you

176
00:20:27,195 --> 00:20:28,654
Sit.

177
00:20:29,156 --> 00:20:30,650
Sit, sir.

178
00:20:34,203 --> 00:20:35,401
Nay, then

179
00:20:51,513 --> 00:20:55,891
I learn, you take things ill which are not so,
Or being, concern you not.

180
00:20:56,728 --> 00:21:00,746
I must be laugh'd at,If, or for nothing or a little,
I Should say myself offended,

181
00:21:01,441 --> 00:21:05,660
and with youChiefly i' the world;
when to sound your name It not concern'd me.

182
00:21:06,363 --> 00:21:09,354
My being in Egypt, Caesar,
What was't to you?

183
00:21:09,992 --> 00:21:12,705
No more than my residing here at Rome
Might be to you in Egypt:

184
00:21:13,329 --> 00:21:16,133
Your wife and brother
Made wars upon me;

185
00:21:16,315 --> 00:21:18,115
and  you were the word of war

186
00:21:20,382 --> 00:21:22,946
You do mistake your business;
my brother  makes his war against us both

187
00:21:23,769 --> 00:21:26,262
Of this my letters
Before did satisfy you.

188
00:21:26,784 --> 00:21:29,577
If you'll patch a quarrel,
It must not be with this.

189
00:21:29,777 --> 00:21:31,285
You patch'd up your excuses.

190
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,373
Not so, not so;

191
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:34,465
I 'm your partner in the cause !

192
00:21:39,358 --> 00:21:41,900
You have broken
The article of your oath

193
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,856
Soft, Caesar.

194
00:21:44,071 --> 00:21:45,614
which you shall never
Have tongue to charge me with.

195
00:21:45,823 --> 00:21:47,104
Caesar...

196
00:21:47,283 --> 00:21:49,325
No,Lepidus, let him speak:

197
00:21:49,582 --> 00:21:55,393
The honour is sacred which he talks on now,
Supposing that I lack'd it.

198
00:22:07,314 --> 00:22:10,099
But, on, Caesar;
The article of my oath.

199
00:22:11,393 --> 00:22:14,983
To lend me arms and aid when I required them;
The which you both denied.

200
00:22:16,857 --> 00:22:18,138
Neglected, rather;

201
00:22:18,401 --> 00:22:21,874
Truth is, that Fulvia,
To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;

202
00:22:25,361 --> 00:22:27,446
For which,I do here ask pardon
on my honour

203
00:22:28,995 --> 00:22:30,995
Noble spoken.

204
00:22:32,794 --> 00:22:36,134
If it might please you, enforce no further
The griefs between you

205
00:22:36,334 --> 00:22:38,490
Forget them quite

206
00:23:06,101 --> 00:23:08,101
For't cannot be We shall remain
in friendship, .

207
00:23:10,459 --> 00:23:13,261
Yet if I knew What hoop should hold us stanch,
from edge to edge

208
00:23:13,461 --> 00:23:15,253
O' the world I would pursue it.

209
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,215
Give me leave, Caesar,--.

210
00:23:18,467 --> 00:23:19,712
Speak, Agrippa!

211
00:23:19,968 --> 00:23:23,873
You have a sister by the mother's side,
Admired Octavia:

212
00:23:24,652 --> 00:23:27,652
great Mark Antony
Is now a widower!

213
00:23:27,852 --> 00:23:29,046
Say not so, Agrippa:

214
00:23:29,604 --> 00:23:33,834
If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof
Were well deserved of rashness.

215
00:23:34,818 --> 00:23:38,982
I am not married, Caesar: let me hear
Agrippa further speak

216
00:23:40,407 --> 00:23:44,619
To hold you in perpetual amity,
To make you brothers,

217
00:23:44,622 --> 00:23:46,457
and to knit your hearts
With an unslipping knot

218
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:50,392
take Antony
Octavia to his wife;

219
00:23:52,408 --> 00:23:54,240
beauty claims
No worse a husband than the best of men;

220
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:59,118
her  virtue and whose general graces speak
That which none else can utter.

221
00:23:59,318 --> 00:24:05,969
By this marriage,all little jealousies,
which now seem great,Would then be nothing.

222
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,600
Will Caesar speak?

223
00:24:11,859 --> 00:24:15,228
Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd
With what is spoke already

224
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:41,848
What power is in Agrippa,If I would say,
'Agrippa, be it so,'To make this good?

225
00:24:50,526 --> 00:24:52,021
The power of Caesar.

226
00:24:57,951 --> 00:25:03,631
and from this hour The heart of brothers govern
in our loves And sway our great designs!

227
00:25:11,466 --> 00:25:12,746
Let me have your hand.

228
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,209
There is my hand.

229
00:25:17,806 --> 00:25:21,582
A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother
Did ever love so dearly:

230
00:25:22,613 --> 00:25:26,875
let her live To join our kingdoms and our hearts;
and never Fly off our loves again!

231
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:31,268
Happily, amen!

232
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:38,946
I did not think to draw my sword
'gainst Pompey

233
00:25:39,051 --> 00:25:41,108
For he hath laid strange courtesies and great
Of late upon me

234
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:44,839
Time calls upon's:

235
00:25:45,099 --> 00:25:49,099
Of us must Pompey presently be sought,
Or else he seeks out us.

236
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:50,462
Where lies he?

237
00:25:50,634 --> 00:25:51,822
About the mount Misenum.

238
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:53,103
What is his strength by land?

239
00:25:53,395 --> 00:25:56,219
Great and increasing: but by sea
He is an absolute master

240
00:25:58,518 --> 00:26:00,594
Would we had spoke together!

241
00:26:03,982 --> 00:26:06,622
Haste we for it:

242
00:26:07,273 --> 00:26:10,622
Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, let's finish
The business we have spoken of.

243
00:26:11,366 --> 00:26:15,310
With most gladness:And do invite you to
my sister's view, Whither straight I'll lead you

244
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:24,417
Good Enobarbus!

245
00:26:25,631 --> 00:26:27,090
Welcome from Egypt, sir.

246
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:36,047
If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle
The heart of Antony,

247
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,847
Octavia is
A blessed lottery to him

248
00:26:49,699 --> 00:26:51,110
Charmian!

249
00:26:51,618 --> 00:26:52,780
Regina?

250
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:55,993
Give me to drink mandragora

251
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:58,363
Why, madam?

252
00:26:59,293 --> 00:27:04,417
That I might sleep out this great gap of time
My Antony is away

253
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:07,873
You think of him too much

254
00:27:08,428 --> 00:27:09,708
O, 'tis treason!

255
00:27:10,013 --> 00:27:11,388
Madam, I trust, not so

256
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,466
What's your highness' pleasure?

257
00:27:21,666 --> 00:27:27,260
Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure
In aught an eunuch has:

258
00:27:29,826 --> 00:27:31,570
Hast thou affections??

259
00:27:32,214 --> 00:27:33,573
Yes, gracious madam

260
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:35,202
Indeed!

261
00:27:35,458 --> 00:27:37,249
Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing

262
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:47,799
But have I fierce affections, and think
What Venus did with Mars

263
00:27:53,686 --> 00:27:57,408
O Charmian,
Where think'st thou he is now?

264
00:27:58,358 --> 00:28:05,191
Stands he, or sits he?
Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?

265
00:28:06,533 --> 00:28:10,160
O happy horse, to bear the weight
of Antony!

266
00:28:12,081 --> 00:28:15,248
Do bravely, horse! for you know
for whom you move

267
00:28:17,044 --> 00:28:20,044
The demi-Atlas of this earth,

268
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,140
And we shall talk before we fight.

269
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:09,302
Most meet
That first we come to words;

270
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:12,058
let us know
If 'twill tie up thy discontented sword,

271
00:29:12,439 --> 00:29:16,553
And carry back to Sicily much tall youth
That else must perish here.

272
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:22,927
To you all three,The senators alone
of this great world,
Chief factors for the gods,

273
00:29:23,127 --> 00:29:25,865
And that is it
Hath made me rig my navy;

274
00:29:26,256 --> 00:29:31,908
I  mean To scourge the ingratitude
that despiteful Rome cast on my noble father.

275
00:29:32,711 --> 00:29:38,118
Be pleased to tell us--For this is from the present--
how you take The offers we have sent you.

276
00:29:38,254 --> 00:29:39,332
There's the point

277
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:41,771
You have made me offer
Of Sicily, Sardinia;

278
00:29:43,392 --> 00:29:45,714
and I must
Rid all the sea of pirates;

279
00:29:46,099 --> 00:29:48,266
then, to send
Measures of wheat to Rome;

280
00:29:50,189 --> 00:29:52,091
this 'greed upon
To part with unhack'd swords

281
00:29:52,232 --> 00:29:53,894
That's our offer.

282
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:59,654
Know, then,I came before you here
a man prepared to take this offer:

283
00:30:01,368 --> 00:30:04,203
but Mark Antony
Put me to some impatience:

284
00:30:05,122 --> 00:30:09,666
though I lose The praise of it by telling,
When Caesar and your brother were at war,

285
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,538
Your mother came to Sicily and did find
Her welcome friendly.

286
00:30:17,177 --> 00:30:23,892
I have heard it, Pompey;And am well studied for
a liberal thanks Which I do owe you.

287
00:30:29,524 --> 00:30:34,815
Let me have your hand:
I did not think, sir, to have met you here

288
00:30:36,198 --> 00:30:39,650
The beds i' the east are soft; and thanks to you,

289
00:30:39,952 --> 00:30:42,787
That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither;
For I have gain'd by 't.

290
00:30:42,948 --> 00:30:43,788
Well met you!

291
00:30:43,936 --> 00:30:45,236
I hope so, Lepidus

292
00:30:46,876 --> 00:30:48,454
Thus we are agreed:

293
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:52,201
We'll feast each other ere we part; and let's
Draw lots who shall begin

294
00:30:52,571 --> 00:30:55,131
Or last, your fine Egyptian cookery
Shall have the fame

295
00:30:55,761 --> 00:30:59,095
I have heard that Julius Caesar
Grew fat with feasting there.

296
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:02,553
You have heard much

297
00:31:04,938 --> 00:31:10,692
I have fair meanings, sir
And I have heard, Apollodorus carried

298
00:31:10,779 --> 00:31:12,185
What, I pray you?

299
00:31:12,656 --> 00:31:15,172
A certain queen to Caesar in a
mattress

300
00:31:18,786 --> 00:31:21,999
I know thee now: how farest thou, soldier?

301
00:31:23,834 --> 00:31:28,080
I never hated thee: I have seen thee fight,
When I have envied thy behavior

302
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:32,306
I never loved you much; but I ha' praised ye,

303
00:31:33,261 --> 00:31:36,165
Aboard my galley I invite you all:
Will you lead, lords?

304
00:31:42,271 --> 00:31:46,214
We came hither to fight with you
For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking.

305
00:31:46,414 --> 00:31:48,728
Pompey doth this day laugh away
his fortune.

306
00:31:49,153 --> 00:31:51,442
If he do, sure, he cannot weep't
back again.

307
00:31:51,781 --> 00:31:53,530
You've said, sir.

308
00:31:54,028 --> 00:31:55,699
We looked not for Mark Antony
here:

309
00:31:56,077 --> 00:31:58,616
pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?

310
00:32:01,033 --> 00:32:02,731
Caesar's sister is called Octavia

311
00:32:03,002 --> 00:32:06,086
True, sir; she was the wife of
Caius Marcellus

312
00:32:06,631 --> 00:32:08,789
But she is now the wife of Marcus
Antonius

313
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:10,760
Pray ye, sir?

314
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,476
'Tis true

315
00:32:13,646 --> 00:32:15,852
Then is Caesar and he for ever
knit together

316
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:22,318
I would not prophesy so.
Octavia is of aholy, cold, and still conversation.

317
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,689
Who would not have his wife so?

318
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,235
Not  Mark Antony.

319
00:32:26,777 --> 00:32:28,196
He will to his Egyptian dish again

320
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:32,031
And thus it may be.
Come, sir, will you aboard?

321
00:32:51,805 --> 00:32:55,720
Thus do they, sir: they take the flow o' the Nile
By certain scales i' the pyramid;

322
00:32:59,355 --> 00:33:01,270
What manner o' thing is your crocodile?

323
00:33:10,242 --> 00:33:12,235
A toast to Lepidus!!

324
00:33:16,875 --> 00:33:18,369
Pompey, a word.

325
00:33:20,754 --> 00:33:22,794
Say in mine ear,what is't?

326
00:33:23,715 --> 00:33:27,132
Forsake thy seat, I do beseech
thee, captain, hear me speak a word.

327
00:33:28,846 --> 00:33:30,388
Forbear me till anon.

328
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:33,093
To Caesar!

329
00:33:34,394 --> 00:33:36,054
I could well forbear't.

330
00:33:45,781 --> 00:33:49,405
Go hang, sir, hang! Tell me of
that? away!

331
00:33:57,002 --> 00:34:00,387
If for the sake of merit you
will hear me, you arise from thy stool.

332
00:34:03,593 --> 00:34:05,301
I think thou'rt mad.

333
00:34:12,394 --> 00:34:14,434
Wilt thou be lord of all the world?

334
00:34:16,899 --> 00:34:18,014
What say'st thou?

335
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:21,811
Wilt thou be lord of the whole world?
That's twice.

336
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:26,526
How should that be?

337
00:34:29,663 --> 00:34:34,207
These three world-sharers,
these competitors,

338
00:34:34,731 --> 00:34:37,847
Are in thy vessel:

339
00:34:38,047 --> 00:34:43,215
let me cut the cable;
And, when we are put off, fall to their throats:

340
00:34:43,966 --> 00:34:45,753
All there is yours.

341
00:34:50,144 --> 00:34:53,513
Ah, this thou shouldst have done,
And not have spoke on't!

342
00:34:56,109 --> 00:35:00,544
In me 'tis villany;
In thee't had been good service.

343
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:09,062
being done unknown,
I should have found it afterwards well done;

344
00:35:11,919 --> 00:35:13,919
But must condemn it now.

345
00:35:17,298 --> 00:35:19,298
Drink!

346
00:35:27,321 --> 00:35:29,321
I'll pledge it for him, Pompey.

347
00:35:29,521 --> 00:35:31,600
Bear him away!

348
00:35:33,348 --> 00:35:34,648
Ha, my brave emperor!

349
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,928
Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals?

350
00:35:39,674 --> 00:35:41,308
Let's ha't, good soldier.

351
00:36:48,648 --> 00:36:50,409
What would you more?

352
00:36:51,068 --> 00:36:54,023
Good brother,let's ashore

353
00:36:54,614 --> 00:36:56,274
I'll try you on the shore.

354
00:37:00,078 --> 00:37:01,537
And shall, sir; give's your hand

355
00:37:04,166 --> 00:37:08,678
O Antony,we are friends.
Come, down into the boat.

356
00:37:23,312 --> 00:37:24,855
Take heed you fall not.

357
00:37:27,233 --> 00:37:28,692
These drums! these trumpets, flutes! what!

358
00:37:29,527 --> 00:37:34,375
sound and be hang'd, sound out

359
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,382
Captain, come

360
00:37:41,582 --> 00:37:43,041
Give me some music

361
00:37:43,334 --> 00:37:44,663
The music!

362
00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:51,703
music, moody food
Of us that trade in love.

363
00:37:53,227 --> 00:37:57,276
Let it alone; let's to billiards:
come, Charmian.

364
00:37:57,476 --> 00:38:00,433
My arm is sore; best play with Mardian

365
00:38:01,187 --> 00:38:03,283
As well a woman with an eunuch play'd
As with a woman.

366
00:38:03,979 --> 00:38:05,979
Come, you'll play with me, sir?

367
00:38:06,818 --> 00:38:08,194
As well as I can, madam

368
00:38:10,155 --> 00:38:12,362
I don't know..

369
00:38:14,494 --> 00:38:22,494
we'll to the river: there,my music playing far off,
I will betray Tawny-finn'd fishes

370
00:38:22,694 --> 00:38:25,627
and, as I draw them up,
I'll think them every one an Antony,And say

371
00:38:25,964 --> 00:38:31,125
'Ah, ha! you're caught

372
00:38:31,888 --> 00:38:36,052
'Twas merry when
You wager'd on your angling;

373
00:38:36,351 --> 00:38:40,939
when your diver Did hang a salt-fish
on his hook, which he With fervency drew up.

374
00:38:43,317 --> 00:38:46,482
That time...O times!

375
00:38:47,238 --> 00:38:48,317
O, from Italy

376
00:38:48,531 --> 00:38:49,480
Madam, madam

377
00:38:49,699 --> 00:38:51,110
Antonius dead

378
00:38:51,367 --> 00:38:53,360
If thou say so, villain,
Thou kill'st thy mistress

379
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:56,906
but well and free,
there is gold

380
00:38:57,249 --> 00:38:58,412
First, madam, he is well

381
00:38:58,625 --> 00:38:59,954
Why, there's more gold.

382
00:39:02,171 --> 00:39:05,754
But, sirrah, mark, we use
To say the dead are well

383
00:39:05,967 --> 00:39:07,794
bring it to that,
The gold I give thee

384
00:39:08,052 --> 00:39:11,219
will I melt and pour
Down thy ill-uttering throat!

385
00:39:11,431 --> 00:39:12,890
Good madam, hear me

386
00:39:15,352 --> 00:39:23,977
Well, go to, I will;
But there's no goodness in thy face

387
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,738
Will't please you hear me?

388
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,943
I have a mind to strike thee
ere thou speak'st:

389
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:36,580
Yet if thou say Antony lives, is well,
Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him,.

390
00:39:37,335 --> 00:39:39,126
Madam, he's well

391
00:39:39,379 --> 00:39:40,374
Well said

392
00:39:40,588 --> 00:39:41,537
And friends with Caesar

393
00:39:41,756 --> 00:39:43,085
Thou'rt an honest man

394
00:39:43,299 --> 00:39:45,173
Caesar and he are greater friends than ever

395
00:39:45,343 --> 00:39:46,886
Make thee a fortune from me

396
00:39:47,137 --> 00:39:48,216
But yet, madam

397
00:39:49,723 --> 00:39:51,099
I do not like 'But yet,

398
00:39:54,562 --> 00:40:00,422
Prithee, friend,Pour out the
pack of matter to mine ear,
The good and bad together:

399
00:40:01,019 --> 00:40:04,690
he's friends with Caesar:
In state of health thou say'st;
and thou say'st free

400
00:40:04,948 --> 00:40:06,740
Free, madam! no; I made no such report:

401
00:40:10,121 --> 00:40:13,455
He's bound unto Octavia

402
00:40:16,127 --> 00:40:18,037
For what good turn?

403
00:40:18,463 --> 00:40:20,005
For the best turn i' the bed

404
00:40:27,306 --> 00:40:30,640
Madam, he's married to Octavia

405
00:40:37,276 --> 00:40:43,445
The most infectious pestilence upon thee!
Good madam, patience

406
00:40:44,825 --> 00:40:49,404
I'll spurn thine eyes
I'll unhair thy head:stew'd in brine

407
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:54,917
Gracious madam,
I that do bring the news made not the match

408
00:40:55,212 --> 00:40:59,714
Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee,
And make thy fortunes proud:

409
00:41:00,509 --> 00:41:02,218
He's married, madam

410
00:41:02,637 --> 00:41:08,261
Rogue, thou hast lived too long!

411
00:41:09,269 --> 00:41:14,015
Good madam, keep yourself within yourself:
The man is innocent

412
00:41:14,483 --> 00:41:20,736
Some innocents 'scape not the thunderbolt.
Melt Egypt into Nile!

413
00:41:21,824 --> 00:41:25,490
and kindly creatures Turn all to serpents!

414
00:41:27,205 --> 00:41:34,584
Call the slave again:
Though I am mad, I will not bite him: call!

415
00:41:35,923 --> 00:41:37,750
He is afeard to come.

416
00:41:38,009 --> 00:41:39,634
I will not hurt him

417
00:41:47,269 --> 00:41:52,660
These hands do lack nobility, that they strike
A meaner than myself;

418
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:05,494
Come hither, sir.

419
00:42:09,585 --> 00:42:16,039
Though it be honest, it is never good
To bring bad news:

420
00:42:17,094 --> 00:42:18,552
Is he married?

421
00:42:18,762 --> 00:42:22,546
I cannot hate thee worser than I do,
If thou again say 'Yes

422
00:42:25,645 --> 00:42:27,554
He's married, madam.

423
00:42:29,232 --> 00:42:33,610
The gods confound thee! dost thou hold there still?

424
00:42:34,404 --> 00:42:35,780
Madam should I lie, ?

425
00:42:36,031 --> 00:42:41,109
I would thou didst,So half my Egypt were submerged
and made A cistern for scaled snakes!

426
00:42:42,872 --> 00:42:43,987
get thee hence!

427
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:45,666
I crave your highness' pardon

428
00:42:49,337 --> 00:42:50,832
He is married?

429
00:42:54,468 --> 00:42:57,422
he's married to Octavia

430
00:43:01,557 --> 00:43:10,863
The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome
Are all too dear for me:

431
00:43:16,701 --> 00:43:20,746
Iras,Charmian!

432
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:26,246
'tis no matter

433
00:43:29,882 --> 00:43:35,885
Go to the fellow, good Alexas;

434
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:39,914
bid him Report the feature of Octavia, her years,
The colour of her hair: bring me word quickly

435
00:43:42,941 --> 00:43:46,353
Let him for ever go:---

436
00:43:51,719 --> 00:43:53,023
-let him not

437
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:59,325
Mardian,bring me word how tall she is.

438
00:44:11,511 --> 00:44:17,052
In praising Antony, I have dispraised Caesar

439
00:44:17,976 --> 00:44:19,305
Many times, madam.

440
00:44:27,779 --> 00:44:30,566
I am paid for't now.

441
00:44:41,544 --> 00:44:45,328
You take from me a great part of myself;
Use me well in 't.

442
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:50,924
Sister, prove such a wife
As my thoughts make you,

443
00:44:52,598 --> 00:44:55,765
..

444
00:44:56,143 --> 00:44:59,310
..

445
00:44:59,647 --> 00:45:00,928
Anthony!

446
00:45:01,149 --> 00:45:02,857
..

447
00:45:03,109 --> 00:45:06,276
.. cherish'd.

448
00:45:08,324 --> 00:45:10,815
Make me not offended
In your distrust

449
00:45:11,243 --> 00:45:12,358
I have said.

450
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:13,900
So.

451
00:45:15,832 --> 00:45:18,204
,,,

452
00:45:18,835 --> 00:45:22,880
...

453
00:45:23,423 --> 00:45:26,793
...;

454
00:45:27,178 --> 00:45:31,674
...

455
00:45:39,316 --> 00:45:44,144
the gods keep you,
And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends

456
00:45:46,365 --> 00:45:48,026
Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well:

457
00:45:51,287 --> 00:45:52,830
The elements be kind to thee

458
00:45:54,249 --> 00:45:56,408
My noble brother!

459
00:46:01,048 --> 00:46:05,461
The April 's in her eyes: it is love's spring,
And these the showers to bring it on.

460
00:46:06,721 --> 00:46:08,513
No, sweet Octavia,
You shall hear from me still;

461
00:46:13,478 --> 00:46:14,807
Be cheerful

462
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:19,604
Come, sir, come;

463
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:21,367
I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love:

464
00:46:21,867 --> 00:46:24,515
Look, here I have you; thus I let you go,
and give you to the gods

465
00:46:27,369 --> 00:46:33,739
Adieu; be happy!

466
00:46:35,252 --> 00:46:39,581
Let all the number of the stars give light
To thy fair way!

467
00:46:39,781 --> 00:46:41,459
Farewell!

468
00:47:00,697 --> 00:47:02,191
Where is the fellow?

469
00:47:03,534 --> 00:47:05,242
Half afeard to come

470
00:47:05,995 --> 00:47:07,537
Go to, go to

471
00:47:10,875 --> 00:47:15,454
Come hither, sir.

472
00:47:17,924 --> 00:47:19,300
Most gracious majesty,--

473
00:47:23,264 --> 00:47:25,802
Did you behold Octavia?

474
00:47:26,267 --> 00:47:28,936
Ay, dread queen.

475
00:47:29,354 --> 00:47:30,765
Where?

476
00:47:31,022 --> 00:47:32,765
Madam, in Rome;

477
00:47:33,037 --> 00:47:37,037
I look'd her in the face, and saw her led
Between her brother and Mark Antony

478
00:47:37,237 --> 00:47:40,108
Is she as tall as me??

479
00:47:42,118 --> 00:47:43,577
She is not, madam.

480
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:49,075
Didst hear her speak?
is she shrill-tongued or low??

481
00:47:49,584 --> 00:47:52,585
Madam, I heard her speak;
she is low-voiced

482
00:47:57,802 --> 00:48:01,847
That's not so good:
he cannot like her long.

483
00:48:02,348 --> 00:48:04,590
Like her! O Isis! 'tis impossible

484
00:48:04,685 --> 00:48:08,521
I think so, Charmian: dull of
tongue, and dwarfish!

485
00:48:09,898 --> 00:48:11,974
What majesty is in her gait?

486
00:48:12,484 --> 00:48:14,976
Remember,
If e'er thou look'dst on majesty

487
00:48:15,237 --> 00:48:16,352
She creeps:

488
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:17,444
Is this certain?

489
00:48:17,657 --> 00:48:19,116
Or I have no observance

490
00:48:19,283 --> 00:48:21,609
Three in Egypt
Cannot make better note

491
00:48:22,037 --> 00:48:26,580
He's very knowing;
I do perceive't: there's nothing in her yet:

492
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:28,209
The fellow has good judgment

493
00:48:28,627 --> 00:48:29,908
Excelent.

494
00:48:30,087 --> 00:48:32,578
Guess at her years, I prithee.

495
00:48:33,925 --> 00:48:35,799
Madam,
She was a widow

496
00:48:36,052 --> 00:48:38,045
Widow! Charmian, hark?

497
00:48:38,304 --> 00:48:40,013
And I do think she's thirty

498
00:48:45,104 --> 00:48:50,609
Bear'st thou her face in mind? is't long or round

499
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:55,569
Round even to faultiness

500
00:48:56,032 --> 00:48:58,868
For the most part, too,
they are foolish that are so.

501
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:00,234
Her hair, what colour?

502
00:49:00,621 --> 00:49:04,785
Brown, madam: and her forehead
As low as she would wish it

503
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:10,125
There's gold for thee.
Thou must not take my former sharpness ill:

504
00:49:10,465 --> 00:49:13,799
I will employ thee back again; I find thee
Most fit for business:

505
00:49:14,094 --> 00:49:17,261
go make thee ready;
Our letters are prepared.

506
00:49:19,725 --> 00:49:21,219
A proper man

507
00:49:21,435 --> 00:49:22,550
Indeed, he is so:

508
00:49:24,272 --> 00:49:26,893
Why, methinks, by him,
This creature's no such thing

509
00:49:27,984 --> 00:49:29,395
Nothing, madam.

510
00:49:30,195 --> 00:49:32,900
The man hath seen some majesty, and should know.

511
00:49:33,573 --> 00:49:38,879
Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,
And serving you so long!

512
00:49:49,883 --> 00:49:51,675
All may be well enough

513
00:50:21,042 --> 00:50:24,957
The world and my great office will sometimes
Divide me from your bosom.

514
00:50:25,756 --> 00:50:29,291
All which time before the gods my knee shall bow
my prayers to them for you

515
00:50:32,263 --> 00:50:34,887
Good night, my Octavia,

516
00:50:35,893 --> 00:50:38,428
Read not my blemishes in the world's report:

517
00:50:39,771 --> 00:50:46,634
I have not kept my square; but that to come
Shall all be done by the rule.

518
00:50:55,664 --> 00:50:57,206
Good night.

519
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,668
Good night

520
00:51:31,912 --> 00:51:35,412
..

521
00:51:40,382 --> 00:51:45,378
eternity was in my lips and eyes....

522
00:52:17,337 --> 00:52:21,169
Now, sirrah; you do wish yourself in Egypt??

523
00:52:22,134 --> 00:52:30,723
Would I had never come from thence, nor you !!
Hie you to Egypt again

524
00:52:37,442 --> 00:52:40,479
Say to me,whose fortunes shall rise higher,
Caesar's or mine?

525
00:52:48,204 --> 00:52:49,699
Caesar's.

526
00:52:54,127 --> 00:52:56,250
Antony, stay not by his side.

527
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:58,969
thy spirit  is high unmatchable,
Where Caesar's is not;

528
00:52:59,145 --> 00:53:02,145
but, near him, thy angel Becomes a fear,
as being o'erpower'd

529
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:06,112
therefore make space enough between you

530
00:53:07,605 --> 00:53:09,034
Speak this no more.

531
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:19,826
To none but thee; no more, but when to thee.

532
00:53:22,075 --> 00:53:24,946
If thou dost play with him at any game,
Thou art sure to lose;

533
00:53:26,246 --> 00:53:29,829
and, of that natural luck,
He beats thee 'gainst the odds:

534
00:53:29,946 --> 00:53:35,879
I say, thy spirit
Is all afraid to govern thee near him

535
00:53:36,632 --> 00:53:40,132
But, he away, 'tis noble

536
00:53:47,061 --> 00:53:48,555
Get thee gone:

537
00:53:53,151 --> 00:53:55,476
Say to Ventidius I would speak with him:

538
00:54:00,784 --> 00:54:04,748
He hath spoken true: the very dice obey him

539
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:09,685
And in our sports my better cunning
faints under his chance

540
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:12,663
Ventidius!

541
00:54:14,429 --> 00:54:16,143
If I lose my honor I lose myself.

542
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:18,803
Sir.

543
00:54:19,054 --> 00:54:23,551
You must to Parthia:
your commission's ready;

544
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:25,803
Două zile rămase.

545
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:27,301
Sir...

546
00:54:37,032 --> 00:54:43,949
Though I made this marriage for my peace..
In the east my pleasure lies

547
00:54:54,176 --> 00:54:56,632
You stayed well by 't in Egypt?

548
00:54:58,848 --> 00:55:00,223
Ay, sir; we did .

549
00:55:00,516 --> 00:55:04,135
Eight wild-boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and
but twelve persons there?

550
00:55:04,854 --> 00:55:06,265
we had much more

551
00:55:07,566 --> 00:55:13,009
She's a most triumphant lady,
if report be square to her

552
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:16,936
When she first met Mark Antony, she pursed up
his heart

553
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:18,988
upon the river of Cydnus?

554
00:55:19,245 --> 00:55:21,985
yes,There she appeared indeed; I will tell you

555
00:55:23,625 --> 00:55:30,337
The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,
Burn'd on the water:

556
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,145
the poop was beaten gold;

557
00:55:33,444 --> 00:55:36,432
Purple the sails, and so perfumed that
The winds were love-sick

558
00:55:38,046 --> 00:55:39,427
the oars were silver

559
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:43,720
Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made
The water which they beat to follow faster,

560
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:45,450
As amorous of their strokes

561
00:55:48,943 --> 00:55:52,660
. For her own person,
It beggar'd all description:

562
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:57,219
she did lie
In her pavilion--cloth-of-gold of tissue

563
00:55:58,359 --> 00:56:01,359
O'er-picturing that Venus where we see
The fancy outwork nature:

564
00:56:02,932 --> 00:56:06,160
on each side her
Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,

565
00:56:07,575 --> 00:56:13,472
With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem
To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,

566
00:56:14,486 --> 00:56:16,486
And what they undid did

567
00:56:18,686 --> 00:56:20,809
O, rare for Antony!!

568
00:56:21,522 --> 00:56:25,603
Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,
So many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes,

569
00:56:25,902 --> 00:56:27,859
And made their bends adornings:

570
00:56:28,488 --> 00:56:31,427
at the helm
A seeming mermaid steers:

571
00:56:32,811 --> 00:56:35,286
the silken tackle
Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,

572
00:56:35,509 --> 00:56:38,509
That yarely frame the office.

573
00:56:39,709 --> 00:56:43,721
From the barge
A strange invisible perfume

574
00:56:44,339 --> 00:56:47,210
hits the sense
Of the adjacent wharfs.

575
00:56:47,467 --> 00:56:50,431
The city cast
Her people out upon her;

576
00:56:51,003 --> 00:56:55,779
and Antony,enthroned i' the market-place,
did sit alone,whistling to the air;

577
00:56:56,511 --> 00:56:59,220
which, but for vacancy,
Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,

578
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:00,616
And made a gap in nature.

579
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,206
Rare Egyptian!

580
00:57:02,596 --> 00:57:07,481
She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed
Now Antony must leave her utterly

581
00:57:08,615 --> 00:57:13,560
Never; he will not

582
00:57:16,878 --> 00:57:19,136
Age cannot wither her,

583
00:57:19,336 --> 00:57:23,203
nor custom stale
Her infinite variety:

584
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:29,173
other women cloy
The appetites they feed:

585
00:57:29,597 --> 00:57:32,071
but she makes hungry
Where most she satisfies;

586
00:57:32,171 --> 00:57:38,335
for vilest things become themselves in her:
that the holy priests bless her when she is riggish

587
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:39,875
Lord of lords!

588
00:58:44,679 --> 00:58:47,087
....

589
00:58:49,518 --> 00:58:50,894
...

590
00:59:11,876 --> 00:59:12,955
Octavia!

591
00:59:26,642 --> 00:59:28,516
Octavia!

592
00:59:29,145 --> 00:59:31,517
That ever I should call thee castaway!

593
00:59:31,773 --> 00:59:34,810
You have not call'd me so, nor have you cause.

594
00:59:35,861 --> 00:59:41,688
Caesar's sister: the wife of Antony has become
A market-maid to Rome.

595
00:59:42,827 --> 00:59:44,701
Good my lord!

596
00:59:44,912 --> 00:59:48,777
My dear sister, the adulterous
Antony has turned you off

597
00:59:49,167 --> 00:59:50,412
Do not say so, my lord

598
00:59:50,835 --> 00:59:55,664
I have eyes upon him,
And his affairs come to me on the wind

599
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:58,375
Where is he now?
In Athens?

600
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:03,596
No, my most wronged sister

601
01:00:04,738 --> 01:00:05,977
Cleopatra
Hath nodded him to her

602
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:09,846
In contempt of Rome he has done
all this and more

603
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:14,882
In Alexandria, in a market place
Cleopatra and himself

604
01:00:15,165 --> 01:00:17,585
in chairs of gold were  publicly enthroned...

605
01:00:17,907 --> 01:00:22,909
unto her he gave the establisment of Egypt,
made her absolute queen

606
01:00:23,371 --> 01:00:24,403
This in the public eye?

607
01:00:24,664 --> 01:00:26,123
I' the common show-place, where they exercise

608
01:00:28,252 --> 01:00:30,117
Let Rome be thus Inform'd.The people know it;

609
01:00:30,649 --> 01:00:31,976
and have now received
His accusations

610
01:00:32,293 --> 01:00:33,501
Who does he accuse?

611
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:39,133
Cezar: for having Pompei spoiled of Sicily

612
01:00:40,475 --> 01:00:42,175
we have not give him his share

613
01:00:42,517 --> 01:00:44,661
then he say, he lent me
Some shipping unrestored

614
01:00:45,938 --> 01:00:49,224
lastly, he frets
That Lepidus shoul be deposed

615
01:00:49,734 --> 01:00:52,854
and, being, that we detain
All his revenue.

616
01:00:53,237 --> 01:00:54,483
Sir, this should be answer'd..

617
01:00:54,781 --> 01:00:58,238
'Tis done already, and the messenger gone
I have told him I grant him part

618
01:00:59,161 --> 01:01:01,568
but then, in his conquer'd kingdoms,
I demand the like.

619
01:01:02,122 --> 01:01:03,949
He'll never yield to that

620
01:01:10,006 --> 01:01:12,082
Nor must not then be yielded to in this

621
01:01:16,972 --> 01:01:19,048
Hi is giving up the empire to a whore

622
01:01:22,686 --> 01:01:28,019
our world...You have a pair of wolves
...no more

623
01:01:29,935 --> 01:01:32,152
and throw between the food you have..

624
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:35,299
The one wil tear the other

625
01:02:23,265 --> 01:02:26,265
I will be even with thee, doubt it not.

626
01:02:26,465 --> 01:02:27,746
Dar pentru ce?

627
01:02:28,276 --> 01:02:29,790
But why?
why?

628
01:02:30,011 --> 01:02:32,258
You're against my being in these wars,
And say'st it is not fit

629
01:02:34,533 --> 01:02:36,425
Well, is it,
Is it?

630
01:02:37,185 --> 01:02:39,855
If not denounced against us, why should not we
Be there in person?

631
01:02:40,439 --> 01:02:42,977
Your presence needs must puzzle Antony

632
01:02:43,233 --> 01:02:46,012
Take from his heart, take from his brain,
from's time,What should not then be spared

633
01:02:50,783 --> 01:02:55,660
'tis said in Rome that your eunuch
and your maids manage this war.

634
01:02:56,248 --> 01:02:58,205
Sink Rome, and their tongues
rot that speak against us!

635
01:02:58,542 --> 01:03:00,250
A charge we bear i' the war

636
01:03:00,502 --> 01:03:04,547
And, as the ruler of my kingdom, will
Appear there for a man.

637
01:03:05,007 --> 01:03:06,917
Speak not against it:
I will not stay behind

638
01:03:07,218 --> 01:03:09,092
Nay, I have done

639
01:03:10,555 --> 01:03:12,097
Here comes the emperor

640
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:15,807
Is it not strange, Canidius,
That from Tarentum and Brundusium

641
01:03:16,061 --> 01:03:18,434
He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea,
And take in Turin?

642
01:03:18,689 --> 01:03:20,018
You have heard on't, sweet??

643
01:03:20,358 --> 01:03:22,516
Celerity is never more admired
Than by the negligent

644
01:03:23,736 --> 01:03:26,212
A good rebuke,
Which might have well becomed the best of men,

645
01:03:26,602 --> 01:03:28,115
To taunt at slackness.

646
01:03:30,410 --> 01:03:32,305
Canidius, we
Will fight with him by sea

647
01:03:32,871 --> 01:03:34,449
By sea! what else?

648
01:03:34,707 --> 01:03:35,905
Why will my lord do so?

649
01:03:37,418 --> 01:03:39,292
For that he dares us to't.

650
01:03:40,004 --> 01:03:41,582
So hath my lord dared him to single fight.

651
01:03:43,341 --> 01:03:47,177
Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia Where Caesar fought with Pompey:

652
01:03:47,777 --> 01:03:52,194
but these offers which serve not for his vantage,
be shakes off;And so should you.

653
01:03:53,686 --> 01:03:56,853
Your ships are not well mann'd;
Your mariners are  swifters

654
01:03:57,190 --> 01:04:00,274
in Caesar's fleet
Are those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought:

655
01:04:00,592 --> 01:04:02,194
Their ships are yare; yours, heavy:

656
01:04:02,487 --> 01:04:05,405
no disgrace Shall fall you for refusing him at sea,
Being prepared for land.

657
01:04:05,624 --> 01:04:06,988
By sea, by sea

658
01:04:09,370 --> 01:04:12,659
Most worthy sir, you therein throw away
The absolute soldiership you have by land;

659
01:04:13,708 --> 01:04:15,129
Distract your army,  war-mark'd footmen;

660
01:04:16,268 --> 01:04:18,665
Quite forgot your own renowned knowledge;
and give up yourself  to chance

661
01:04:18,790 --> 01:04:19,974
I'll fight at sea

662
01:04:20,090 --> 01:04:21,943
I have sixty sails, Caesar none better

663
01:04:23,011 --> 01:04:24,563
if we should fail,
We then can do't at land.

664
01:04:26,510 --> 01:04:28,915
Canidius,Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land,
And our twelve thousand horse

665
01:04:30,375 --> 01:04:32,174
to our ship

666
01:04:34,663 --> 01:04:35,902
How now, worthy soldier?

667
01:04:39,736 --> 01:04:43,463
O noble emperor, do not fight by sea;Trust not to rotten planks

668
01:04:44,325 --> 01:04:46,238
do you misdoubt
This sword and these my wounds?

669
01:04:46,331 --> 01:04:48,908
Let the Egyptians
And the Phoenicians go a-ducking;

670
01:04:50,787 --> 01:04:53,811
Have used to conquer, standing on the earth,
And fighting foot to foot.

671
01:04:57,131 --> 01:04:58,708
Well, well: away

672
01:05:06,057 --> 01:05:08,383
By Hercules, I think I am in the right.

673
01:05:09,728 --> 01:05:11,668
Soldier, thou art:

674
01:05:13,052 --> 01:05:14,224
but  our leader's led,

675
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:17,690
We are women's men.

676
01:05:39,803 --> 01:05:40,882
Agrippa?

677
01:05:41,137 --> 01:05:42,300
My lord?

678
01:05:42,514 --> 01:05:44,301
Strike not by land; keep whole:

679
01:05:44,601 --> 01:05:46,689
provoke not battle,
Till we have done at sea.

680
01:05:49,605 --> 01:05:53,859
Do not exceed The prescript of this scroll:

681
01:05:57,652 --> 01:05:59,505
our fortune lies Upon this jump.

682
01:11:08,841 --> 01:11:09,841
Retire!

683
01:11:10,041 --> 01:11:11,701
The egyptian queen flies!

684
01:11:12,335 --> 01:11:13,710
Sail!

685
01:11:50,001 --> 01:11:51,246
Retire!

686
01:11:55,007 --> 01:11:56,667
Retire!

687
01:13:12,842 --> 01:13:19,427
Naught, naught all, naught!

688
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:56,674
Do not fight by sea!!

689
01:13:59,477 --> 01:14:01,719
Our fortune on the sea is out of breath!

690
01:14:10,698 --> 01:14:12,156
Gods and goddesses!

691
01:14:12,867 --> 01:14:15,488
The greater cantle of the world is lost

692
01:14:16,829 --> 01:14:19,665
; we have kiss'd away
Kingdoms and provinces.

693
01:14:20,125 --> 01:14:21,583
How appears the fight??

694
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:25,127
On our side like the token'd pestilence,
Where death is sure.

695
01:14:26,465 --> 01:14:30,391
ribaudred nag of Egypt,--
Whom leprosy o'ertake!-

696
01:14:31,365 --> 01:14:37,859
-i' the midst o' the fight,
The breese upon her, like a cow in June,

697
01:14:38,661 --> 01:14:40,527
Hoists sails and flies

698
01:14:41,423 --> 01:14:44,606
That I beheld:
Mine eyes did sicken at the sight,

699
01:14:44,706 --> 01:14:46,896
The noble ruin of her magic, AntonyClaps on his sea-wing

700
01:14:47,719 --> 01:14:53,263
and, like a doting mallard,
Leaving the fight in height, flies after her:

701
01:14:54,675 --> 01:14:56,865
I never saw an action of such shame;

702
01:15:01,462 --> 01:15:04,297
Our fortune on the sea is out of breath,
And sinks most lamentably

703
01:15:05,466 --> 01:15:08,171
Had our general
Been what he knew himself, it had gone well:

704
01:15:08,469 --> 01:15:11,742
O, he has given example for our flight,
Most grossly, by his own!

705
01:15:12,098 --> 01:15:15,265
Ay, are you thereabouts?
Why, then, good night indeed

706
01:15:15,686 --> 01:15:20,091
To Caesar will I render My legions and my horse:
six kings already Show me the way of yielding

707
01:15:24,737 --> 01:15:26,979
I'll yet follow
The wounded chance of Antony,

708
01:15:29,034 --> 01:15:31,739
though my reason
Sits in the wind against me.

709
01:16:07,034 --> 01:16:13,090
! the land bids me tread no more upon't;
It is ashamed to bear me!

710
01:16:15,209 --> 01:16:18,124
I Have lost my way for ever:

711
01:16:19,933 --> 01:16:24,904
Leave me, fly,
Make your peace with Caesar.

712
01:16:25,596 --> 01:16:27,090
Fly?Not I.

713
01:16:27,348 --> 01:16:28,593
Be gone!

714
01:16:45,409 --> 01:16:48,743
No, no, no.

715
01:16:56,713 --> 01:16:58,587
See you here, sir?.

716
01:16:59,592 --> 01:17:00,790
Out!

717
01:17:03,304 --> 01:17:04,383
Madam!

718
01:17:04,597 --> 01:17:06,056
O good empress!

719
01:17:12,689 --> 01:17:20,271
Sir!The queen!

720
01:17:41,930 --> 01:17:45,595
I have offended reputation,.

721
01:17:54,485 --> 01:17:55,730
O my lord,

722
01:18:00,784 --> 01:18:03,619
O, whither hast thou led me, Egypt?

723
01:18:05,581 --> 01:18:06,696
O my lord, my lord,

724
01:18:06,957 --> 01:18:09,104
Forgive my fearful sails!

725
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,112
I little thought
You would have follow'd

726
01:18:14,174 --> 01:18:20,589
Egypt, thou knew'st too well My heart was
to thy rudder tied by the strings,

727
01:18:20,932 --> 01:18:22,681
And thou shouldst tow me after:

728
01:18:24,477 --> 01:18:31,227
Thy beck might from the bidding
of the gods command me

729
01:18:31,484 --> 01:18:33,561
O, my pardon!

730
01:18:33,987 --> 01:18:38,032
Now I must
To the young man send humble treaties, dodge

731
01:18:38,409 --> 01:18:43,071
And palter in the shifts of lowness;

732
01:18:43,456 --> 01:18:46,826
With half the bulk o' the world play'd as I pleased,
Making and marring fortunes

733
01:18:48,336 --> 01:18:51,871
You did know how much you
were my conqueror and that

734
01:18:52,132 --> 01:18:56,304
my sword, made weak by my affection,
would obey it on all cause.

735
01:18:56,595 --> 01:18:59,321
Pardon, pardon!

736
01:19:11,111 --> 01:19:17,607
Fall not a tear, I say; one of them rates
All that is won and lost:

737
01:19:21,456 --> 01:19:22,998
give me a kiss;

738
01:19:28,464 --> 01:19:31,963
Even this repays me

739
01:19:41,103 --> 01:19:44,388
Love, I am full of lead.

740
01:19:47,109 --> 01:19:49,351
Some wine here!

741
01:19:51,155 --> 01:19:57,618
Fortune knows
We scorn her most when most she offers blows.

742
01:20:34,578 --> 01:20:36,785
Let him appear that's come from Antony.

743
01:20:46,007 --> 01:20:47,170
Know you him?

744
01:20:47,717 --> 01:20:49,426
Caesar, 'tis his schoolmaster

745
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:55,220
An argument that he is pluck'd, when hither
He sends so poor a pinion off his wing

746
01:20:56,143 --> 01:21:00,722
Which had superfluous kings for messengers
Not many moons gone by?

747
01:21:01,149 --> 01:21:02,691
Approach, and speak.

748
01:21:09,825 --> 01:21:14,369
Such as I am, I come from Antony:

749
01:21:17,542 --> 01:21:23,132
I was of late as petty to his ends As is the morn-dew
on the myrtle-leaf To his grand sea.

750
01:21:25,968 --> 01:21:32,766
Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and
Requires to live in Egypt

751
01:21:34,143 --> 01:21:38,107
which not granted,He lessens his requests;

752
01:21:39,412 --> 01:21:43,412
and to thee sues
To let him breathe between the heavens and earth,

753
01:21:43,612 --> 01:21:48,575
A private man in Athens:

754
01:21:55,041 --> 01:21:57,580
For Antony,
I have no ears to his request

755
01:22:00,589 --> 01:22:03,341
The queen
Of audience nor desire shall fail

756
01:22:03,843 --> 01:22:08,710
so she From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend,
Or take his life there:

757
01:22:09,391 --> 01:22:11,218
So to them both.
Thyreus!

758
01:22:38,548 --> 01:22:40,849
From Antony win Cleopatra

759
01:22:41,801 --> 01:22:47,671
promise, And in our name, what she requires;
add more From thine invention, offers:

760
01:22:48,405 --> 01:22:50,801
women are not
In their best fortunes strong;

761
01:22:51,437 --> 01:22:53,845
but want will perjure
The ne'er touch'd vestal:

762
01:22:54,106 --> 01:22:57,523
try thy cunning, Thyreus.

763
01:23:12,084 --> 01:23:13,413
What shall we do, Enobarbus?

764
01:23:15,964 --> 01:23:17,873
Think, and die

765
01:23:19,050 --> 01:23:21,209
Is Antony or we in fault for this?

766
01:23:22,221 --> 01:23:26,883
Antony only, that would make his will
Lord of his reason

767
01:23:28,186 --> 01:23:31,349
. What though you fled
From that great face of war,why should he follow?

768
01:23:31,941 --> 01:23:34,562
The itch of his affection should not then
Have nick'd his captainship;

769
01:23:35,439 --> 01:23:39,230
at such a point,When half to half the world opposed,
he being The sole question:

770
01:23:39,430 --> 01:23:41,835
'twas a shame no less Than was his loss

771
01:23:42,099 --> 01:23:44,617
, to course your flying flags,
And leave his navy gazing.

772
01:23:44,655 --> 01:23:46,655
Is that his answer?
Ay, my lord

773
01:23:48,469 --> 01:23:50,948
The queen shall then have courtesy, so she
Will yield us up

774
01:23:52,420 --> 01:23:53,796
He says so

775
01:23:54,006 --> 01:23:55,500
Let her know't

776
01:23:56,967 --> 01:24:02,919
To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,
And he will fill thy wishes to the brim With principalities

777
01:24:05,477 --> 01:24:06,935
That head, my lord?

778
01:24:08,522 --> 01:24:12,140
To him again: tell him he wears the rose
Of youth upon him;

779
01:24:12,568 --> 01:24:17,426
from which the world should note
Something particular: his coin, ships, legions

780
01:24:17,626 --> 01:24:19,378
May be a coward's; whose
ministers would prevail

781
01:24:19,864 --> 01:24:22,595
Under the service of a child as soon
As i' the command of Caesar:

782
01:24:24,064 --> 01:24:26,868
I dare him therefore
To lay his gay comparisons apart,

783
01:24:27,626 --> 01:24:30,946
And answer me declined, sword against sword,
Ourselves alone.

784
01:24:32,006 --> 01:24:33,473
I'll write it: follow me

785
01:24:38,721 --> 01:24:44,367
Yes, like enough, high-battled Caesar will
Unstate his happiness,

786
01:24:44,567 --> 01:24:47,766
and be staged to the show Against a sworder!

787
01:24:48,649 --> 01:24:53,726
Caesar, thou hast subdued
His judgment too.

788
01:24:53,988 --> 01:24:56,942
Madam,A messenger from Caesar.

789
01:24:59,035 --> 01:25:01,823
What, no more ceremony?

790
01:25:04,541 --> 01:25:06,663
See, my women!

791
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:11,383
Against the blown rose may they stop their nose
That kneel'd unto the buds.

792
01:25:14,469 --> 01:25:16,011
Admit him, then.

793
01:25:27,900 --> 01:25:29,818
Mine honesty and I begin to square.

794
01:25:31,474 --> 01:25:34,234
The loyalty well held to fools does make
Our faith mere folly:

795
01:25:35,993 --> 01:25:39,528
yet he that can endure
To follow with allegiance a fall'n lord

796
01:25:40,498 --> 01:25:44,709
Does conquer him that did his master conquer

797
01:25:53,470 --> 01:25:55,013
Caesar's will?

798
01:25:55,931 --> 01:25:57,426
Hear it apart.

799
01:25:57,808 --> 01:26:00,264
None but friends: say boldly.

800
01:26:00,979 --> 01:26:02,639
So, haply, are they friends to Antony..

801
01:26:02,981 --> 01:26:04,176
He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has;
Or needs not us.

802
01:26:05,216 --> 01:26:06,216
So...

803
01:26:14,493 --> 01:26:17,411
Thus then, thou most renown'd:

804
01:26:17,789 --> 01:26:20,784
Caesar entreats,
Not to consider in what case thou stand'st,

805
01:26:21,933 --> 01:26:23,406
Further than he is Caesar.

806
01:26:25,966 --> 01:26:27,923
Go on: right royal

807
01:26:29,134 --> 01:26:33,349
He knows that you embrace not Antony
As you did love, but as you fear'd him

808
01:26:34,390 --> 01:26:34,849
Oh!

809
01:26:35,411 --> 01:26:41,348
The scars upon your honour, therefore, he Does pity,
as constrained blemishes,Not as deserved

810
01:26:43,275 --> 01:26:52,125
He is a god, and knowsWhat is most right:
mine honour was not yielded,But conquer'd merely

811
01:26:54,412 --> 01:26:56,986
To be sure of that,
I will ask Antony.

812
01:27:02,254 --> 01:27:05,514
Shall I say to Caesar
What you require of him?

813
01:27:08,219 --> 01:27:11,920
It much would please him,That of his fortunes
you should make a staff To lean upon:

814
01:27:13,683 --> 01:27:17,764
but it would warm his spirits,
To hear from me you had left Antony,

815
01:27:18,022 --> 01:27:22,900
And put yourself under his shrowd,
The universal landlord.

816
01:27:26,531 --> 01:27:27,942
What's your name?

817
01:27:28,325 --> 01:27:31,741
My name is Thyreus

818
01:27:34,832 --> 01:27:37,602
Most kind messenger

819
01:27:38,748 --> 01:27:44,007
Say to great Caesar this:
in deputation I kiss his conquering hand

820
01:27:44,207 --> 01:27:49,917
tell him, I am prompt
To lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel:

821
01:27:50,117 --> 01:27:53,966
Tell him from his all-obeying breath I hear
The doom of Egypt.

822
01:27:56,439 --> 01:27:58,479
'Tis your noblest course

823
01:28:04,072 --> 01:28:05,453
Give me grace to lay
My duty on your hand.

824
01:28:11,205 --> 01:28:13,948
Your Caesar's father oft,

825
01:28:15,948 --> 01:28:19,948
When he hath mused of taking kingdoms in,
Bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place,

826
01:28:31,477 --> 01:28:34,698
What art thou, fellow?

827
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:39,694
One that but performs
The bidding of the fullest man, and worthiest

828
01:28:39,894 --> 01:28:41,321
To have command obey'd

829
01:28:42,156 --> 01:28:43,270
You will be whipp'd!

830
01:28:44,909 --> 01:28:48,278
Ah, you kite! Now, gods and devils!
Authority melts from me!

831
01:28:49,789 --> 01:28:52,306
of late, when I cried 'Ho!'
Like boys unto a muss,

832
01:28:52,576 --> 01:28:54,245
kings would start forth,
And cry 'Your will?'

833
01:28:55,176 --> 01:28:57,092
Have you no ears?
I am Antony yet.

834
01:28:58,040 --> 01:29:00,777
Take hence this Jack, and whip him!

835
01:29:06,441 --> 01:29:08,202
Moon and stars!
Whip him.

836
01:29:09,164 --> 01:29:11,444
Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries
That do acknowledge Caesar,

837
01:29:11,620 --> 01:29:12,935
should I find them
So saucy with the hand of she here,

838
01:29:13,135 --> 01:29:16,091
what's her name,
Since she was Cleopatra?

839
01:29:19,947 --> 01:29:23,162
Whip him, fellows,
Till, like a boy, you see him cringe his face,

840
01:29:23,287 --> 01:29:24,446
And whine aloud for mercy:

841
01:29:24,646 --> 01:29:25,685
Anthony!
Take him away!

842
01:29:26,037 --> 01:29:27,976
being whipp'd, Bring him again:

843
01:29:28,434 --> 01:29:33,220
this Jack of Caesar's shall
Bear us an errand to him

844
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:36,256
You were half blasted ere I knew you?

845
01:29:36,507 --> 01:29:39,923
Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome,
to be abused by one that looks on feeders

846
01:29:41,304 --> 01:29:42,680
Good my lord

847
01:29:42,889 --> 01:29:44,549
You have been a boggler ever

848
01:29:45,767 --> 01:29:48,306
I found you as a morsel cold upon
Dead Caesar's trencher

849
01:29:48,729 --> 01:29:54,081
Nay, you were a fragment
Of Cneius Pompey's; besides what hotter hours,

850
01:29:54,281 --> 01:29:58,360
Unregister'd in vulgar fame, you have
Luxuriously pick'd out:

851
01:29:58,615 --> 01:30:00,074
Wherefore is this?

852
01:30:00,485 --> 01:30:02,565
To let a fellow that will take rewards

853
01:30:02,679 --> 01:30:05,179
And say 'God quit you!' be familiar
with My playfellow, your hand;

854
01:30:10,879 --> 01:30:12,533
Is he whipp'd?

855
01:30:12,948 --> 01:30:13,860
Soundly, my lord

856
01:30:14,524 --> 01:30:15,695
Cried he? and begg'd a' pardon?

857
01:30:15,895 --> 01:30:17,054
He did ask favour.

858
01:30:23,350 --> 01:30:26,517
If that thy father live, let him repent
Thou wast not made his daughter;

859
01:30:27,688 --> 01:30:30,053
and be thou sorry To follow Caesar in his triumph,
since you have been been whipp'd for it:

860
01:30:32,234 --> 01:30:36,746
henceforth the white hand of a lady fever you,
Shake thou to look on 't.

861
01:30:38,023 --> 01:30:40,917
Get thee back to Caesar.
Tell him thy entertainment:

862
01:30:41,208 --> 01:30:43,208
look, thou say
He makes me angry with him

863
01:30:43,408 --> 01:30:47,769
for he seems proud and disdainful,
harping on what I am, Not what he knew I was:

864
01:30:47,969 --> 01:30:50,248
he makes me angry!

865
01:30:52,316 --> 01:30:55,692
And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,
When my good stars, that were my former guides,

866
01:30:55,892 --> 01:31:00,340
Have empty left their orbs, and shot
their fires Into the abysm of hell.

867
01:31:00,847 --> 01:31:02,847
begone!

868
01:31:05,101 --> 01:31:07,203
Have you done yet?

869
01:31:07,403 --> 01:31:10,861
To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes
With  that ?

870
01:31:14,907 --> 01:31:16,734
Cold-hearted toward me?

871
01:31:19,078 --> 01:31:22,198
Ah, dear, if I be so,

872
01:31:22,446 --> 01:31:27,610
From my cold heart let heaven engender hail,
let the first stone Dissolve my life!

873
01:31:28,085 --> 01:31:31,125
Together with my brave Egyptians all, Lie graveless,

874
01:31:31,492 --> 01:31:34,498
till the flies and gnats of Nile Have buried them for prey

875
01:31:38,391 --> 01:31:40,051
I am satisfied

876
01:31:44,857 --> 01:31:50,228
Caesar  comes near in Alexandria; where
I will oppose his fate.

877
01:31:52,991 --> 01:31:55,690
Our force by land is nobly held;

878
01:31:57,775 --> 01:32:03,207
our shattered navy too knit again, and sails,
threatening most sea-like

879
01:32:06,432 --> 01:32:08,674
Where hast thou been, my heart?

880
01:32:08,874 --> 01:32:15,203
Dost thou hear, my heart??

881
01:32:17,177 --> 01:32:20,639
If from the field I shall return once more
To kiss these lips,

882
01:32:20,976 --> 01:32:26,009
I will appear in blood;I and my sword will earn
our chronicle:We'll beat them

883
01:32:34,406 --> 01:32:36,366
There's hope in't yet

884
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:40,412
That's my brave lord!

885
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:43,622
Let's have one other gaudy night:

886
01:32:43,967 --> 01:32:47,167
call to me all my sad captains;
fill our bowls once more;

887
01:32:48,414 --> 01:32:50,472
Let's mock the midnight bell.

888
01:32:53,326 --> 01:32:54,854
We will yet do well.

889
01:32:55,466 --> 01:32:57,608
Come on, my queen;
There's sap in't yet.

890
01:32:58,712 --> 01:33:01,608
The next time I do fight,
I'll make death love me

891
01:33:09,616 --> 01:33:10,717
Now he'll outstare the lightning

892
01:33:13,447 --> 01:33:19,871
To be furious,Is to be frighted out of fear;
and in that mood The dove will peck the estridge;

893
01:33:21,619 --> 01:33:24,580
and I see still, a diminution in our
captain's brain Restores his heart

894
01:33:27,159 --> 01:33:31,181
when valour preys on reason,
It eats the sword it fights with.

895
01:33:36,538 --> 01:33:38,275
I will seek
Some way to leave him.

896
01:33:52,539 --> 01:33:57,166
He calls me boy; and chides, as he had power
To beat me out of Egypt;

897
01:34:00,237 --> 01:34:04,556
dares me to personal combat,
Caesar to Antony:

898
01:34:04,756 --> 01:34:08,642
let the old ruffian know
I have many other ways to die;

899
01:34:09,766 --> 01:34:12,520
When one so great begins to rage, he's hunted
Even to falling.

900
01:34:13,939 --> 01:34:15,054
Give him no breath

901
01:34:16,946 --> 01:34:20,206
Let our best heads know, that tomorrow
the last of many battles We mean to fight

902
01:34:21,206 --> 01:34:25,439
within our files there are, of those that served Mark Antony
but late,enough to fetch him in.

903
01:34:26,076 --> 01:34:29,659
See it done And feast the army; we have store to do't,
And they have earn'd the waste.

904
01:34:37,046 --> 01:34:38,671
Poor Antony!

905
01:35:00,739 --> 01:35:01,853
Enobarbus!

906
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:03,403
Sir?

907
01:35:05,035 --> 01:35:08,950
He will not fight with me,?
Why should he not?

908
01:35:10,666 --> 01:35:12,326
He is twenty men to one.

909
01:35:14,003 --> 01:35:16,541
To-morrow, soldier,
we'll fight by land

910
01:35:17,507 --> 01:35:24,044
or I will live,Or bathe my dying honour in
the blood Shall make it live again

911
01:35:25,975 --> 01:35:28,014
Woo't thou fight well??

912
01:35:28,603 --> 01:35:31,141
I'll strike, and cry 'Take all

913
01:35:31,981 --> 01:35:35,450
Well said; come give me thy hand.

914
01:35:37,650 --> 01:35:45,160
Thou hast been rightly honest;--you have served me well,
And kings have been your fellows

915
01:35:47,165 --> 01:35:48,873
What mean you, sir?

916
01:35:49,584 --> 01:35:50,995
To make your followers weep?

917
01:35:53,004 --> 01:35:56,623
Good friend, good night.Tomorrow is the day.

918
01:36:22,620 --> 01:36:27,746
. You that will fight,
Follow me close; I'll bring you to't

919
01:36:33,507 --> 01:36:34,788
Call  Enobarbus

920
01:36:35,218 --> 01:36:36,676
He shall not hear me

921
01:36:38,638 --> 01:36:39,717
What say'st thou?

922
01:36:40,140 --> 01:36:41,302
He is with Caesar

923
01:36:45,145 --> 01:36:48,728
Sir, his chests and treasure
He has not with him

924
01:36:51,193 --> 01:36:52,439
Is he gone?

925
01:36:53,112 --> 01:36:54,393
Most so

926
01:36:56,991 --> 01:36:59,946
Go, Eros, send his treasure after; do it;

927
01:37:00,469 --> 01:37:01,763
Detain no jot, I charge thee

928
01:37:03,004 --> 01:37:05,923
write to him--
I will subscribe--gentle adieus and greetings

929
01:37:07,125 --> 01:37:09,439
Say that I wish he never find more cause
To change a master

930
01:37:11,592 --> 01:37:12,873
Dispatch!

931
01:37:19,433 --> 01:37:22,138
my fortunes have
Corrupted honest men

932
01:37:27,275 --> 01:37:28,555
Enobarb.

933
01:37:40,748 --> 01:37:42,373
A plecat ca un erou.

934
01:37:43,668 --> 01:37:49,042
Oh, dacă el a decis să Cezar marele război
luptă singur, apoi folosit Anthony...

935
01:37:52,469 --> 01:37:53,750
si acum...

936
01:38:11,532 --> 01:38:13,608
Go forth, Agrippa, and begin the fight

937
01:38:14,326 --> 01:38:17,577
Our will is Antony be took alive;
Make it so known

938
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:20,700
Caesar, I shall

939
01:38:23,879 --> 01:38:27,580
The time of universal peace is near:
Prove this a prosperous day,

940
01:38:27,966 --> 01:38:31,133
the three-nook'd world
Shall bear the olive freely

941
01:38:39,312 --> 01:38:41,804
Mark AntonyI served.
He was my master.

942
01:38:43,108 --> 01:38:46,477
I will serve you honestly  as I served him

943
01:38:46,695 --> 01:38:48,487
so I'll be yours

944
01:39:01,338 --> 01:39:05,965
Enobarbus, Antony
Hath after thee sent all thy treasure,

945
01:39:06,622 --> 01:39:08,368
the messenger came on my guard;
and at thy tent is now Unloading of his mules.

946
01:39:08,387 --> 01:39:09,502
I give it you!

947
01:39:09,944 --> 01:39:12,040
Mock not, Enobarbus.
I tell you true

948
01:39:19,481 --> 01:39:21,688
I am alone the villain of the earth,

949
01:39:24,696 --> 01:39:27,068
Tomorrow we'll fight by land

950
01:39:28,950 --> 01:39:32,485
Oh, Anthony, eu lupt împotriva ta?

951
01:39:33,163 --> 01:39:36,164
You have been honest..
You served me well

952
01:39:39,337 --> 01:39:41,709
I will go seek
Some ditch wherein to die;

953
01:40:44,116 --> 01:40:47,334
Forgive me in thine own particular;

954
01:40:47,634 --> 01:40:54,913
But let the world rank me in register
A master-leaver and a fugitive

955
01:41:05,139 --> 01:41:06,598
Anthony!

956
01:42:11,879 --> 01:42:13,338
this is fought indeed!

957
01:42:14,466 --> 01:42:15,711
They are beaten, sir!

958
01:42:16,217 --> 01:42:19,254
fire in the air, we fight there too.....

959
01:42:20,786 --> 01:42:22,786
Look, emperor they fought up us there!

960
01:42:43,748 --> 01:42:45,028
Prepare, Scar.

961
01:43:59,956 --> 01:44:04,279
See Anthony be took alive!

962
01:45:53,999 --> 01:45:55,991
This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me!

963
01:48:16,820 --> 01:48:20,701
Mark Antony! 

964
01:48:47,564 --> 01:48:50,020
This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me!

965
01:48:59,244 --> 01:49:05,117
Triple-turn'd whore!tis thou
Hast sold me to this novice!

966
01:49:49,507 --> 01:49:53,256
 Cleopatra, you will have my revenge!

967
01:50:08,153 --> 01:50:12,899
The hearts that spaniel'd me at heels, 
to whom I gave their wishes,

968
01:50:13,158 --> 01:50:15,946
melt their sweets on blossoming Caesar; 

969
01:50:16,497 --> 01:50:18,908
Why is my lord enraged against his love?

970
01:50:19,165 --> 01:50:21,047
Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving,

971
01:50:25,433 --> 01:50:27,433
Follow Cezar' chariot and hoist thee up 

972
01:50:27,633 --> 01:50:30,841
Help me, my women! 

973
01:50:43,775 --> 01:50:45,104
O, he is more mad

974
01:50:45,611 --> 01:50:48,897
To the  Roman boy she hath sold me, 
and I fall under this plot; 

975
01:50:50,411 --> 01:50:51,873
she dies for't

976
01:50:53,328 --> 01:50:54,526
Is mad.

977
01:50:55,622 --> 01:50:56,902
To the monument!

978
01:50:57,207 --> 01:50:58,370
To the monument!

979
01:50:58,583 --> 01:51:01,750
There lock yourself, and send him word you are dead.

980
01:51:03,339 --> 01:51:08,131
Mardian, go tell him I have slain myself;

981
01:51:08,761 --> 01:51:12,629
Say, that the last I spoke was 'Antony,'".

982
01:51:27,657 --> 01:51:30,231
O this false soul of Egypt

983
01:51:31,286 --> 01:51:36,957
this grave charm Whose eye beck'd 
forth my wars, and call'd them home

984
01:51:37,501 --> 01:51:42,169
Whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end,

985
01:51:43,385 --> 01:51:52,356
Like a right gipsy,at fast and loose, beguiled me 
to the very heart of loss

986
01:52:00,151 --> 01:52:02,939
Hei, Eros! Eros!

987
01:52:23,844 --> 01:52:30,168
Sometimes we see a cloud that's dragonish;
A vapour sometime like a bear or lion

988
01:52:30,726 --> 01:52:37,180
A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock
A forked mountain, or blue promontory

989
01:52:37,863 --> 01:52:41,147
With trees upon't, that nod unto the world,
And mock our eyes with air:

990
01:52:41,405 --> 01:52:44,276
thou hast seen these signs;

991
01:52:45,034 --> 01:52:46,279
Ay, my lord,

992
01:52:47,036 --> 01:52:49,278
They are black vesper's pageants

993
01:52:50,456 --> 01:52:51,785
My lord?

994
01:52:53,251 --> 01:52:57,084
That which is now a horse, even with a thought

995
01:52:57,339 --> 01:53:01,485
The rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct,
As water is in water.

996
01:53:03,054 --> 01:53:04,548
It does, my lord.

997
01:53:06,057 --> 01:53:08,727
My good knave Eros, now thy captain is
Even such a body

998
01:53:11,980 --> 01:53:17,402
here I am Antony:
Yet cannot hold this visible shape,

999
01:53:19,780 --> 01:53:23,902
I made these wars for Egypt: and the queen,--

1000
01:53:24,830 --> 01:53:27,537
Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine

1001
01:53:43,306 --> 01:53:48,099
O! thy vile lady!
She has robb'd me of my sword

1002
01:53:48,562 --> 01:53:49,937
No, Antony;

1003
01:53:50,189 --> 01:53:51,980
She hath betray'd me and shall die

1004
01:53:52,233 --> 01:53:55,068
Death of one person can be paid but once,

1005
01:53:55,737 --> 01:53:57,528
what thou wouldst do
Is done

1006
01:53:58,198 --> 01:54:03,987
the last she spake
Was 'Antony! Thy name so buried in her.

1007
01:54:07,833 --> 01:54:09,292
Dead, then?

1008
01:54:09,585 --> 01:54:10,700
Dead.

1009
01:54:17,093 --> 01:54:18,967
Unarm, Eros;

1010
01:54:19,388 --> 01:54:22,839
the long day's task is done,
And we must sleep

1011
01:54:29,232 --> 01:54:33,146
That thou depart'st hence safe,
Does pay thy labour richly; go

1012
01:54:40,494 --> 01:54:43,246
Off, pluck off

1013
01:54:44,707 --> 01:54:49,120
The seven-fold shield of Ajax cannot keep
The battery from my heart

1014
01:54:50,338 --> 01:54:52,711
Apace, Eros, apace.

1015
01:54:55,344 --> 01:54:57,467
No more a soldier:

1016
01:55:06,523 --> 01:55:08,231
Stay a while

1017
01:55:21,915 --> 01:55:25,366
I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra.and
Weep for my pardon

1018
01:55:27,754 --> 01:55:32,832
So it must be, for now All length is torture
since the torch is out

1019
01:55:36,180 --> 01:55:44,093
Lie down, and stray no farther ,all is done

1020
01:55:50,321 --> 01:55:51,732
Eros!

1021
01:55:53,449 --> 01:55:55,276
I come, my queen

1022
01:55:56,745 --> 01:55:58,239
Eros!

1023
01:56:00,791 --> 01:56:02,665
Stay for me

1024
01:56:03,502 --> 01:56:09,873
Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand,
And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze:

1025
01:56:10,093 --> 01:56:17,472
Dido and her AEneas shall want troops,
And all the haunt be ours.

1026
01:56:20,479 --> 01:56:21,724
Come,Eros!

1027
01:56:24,859 --> 01:56:25,890
Eros.

1028
01:56:26,402 --> 01:56:27,647
What would my lord?

1029
01:56:32,200 --> 01:56:36,779
Since Cleopatra died,
I have lived in such dishonour,

1030
01:56:36,997 --> 01:56:39,667
that the gods
Detest my baseness.

1031
01:56:40,418 --> 01:56:44,712
I, that with my sword
Quarter'd the world, and o'er green Neptune's back

1032
01:56:44,964 --> 01:56:48,832
With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack
The courage of a woman

1033
01:56:51,430 --> 01:56:54,384
art sworn, Eros,That, when the exigent should come,
which now Is come indeed,

1034
01:56:54,767 --> 01:56:59,762
on my command,
Thou then wouldst kill me:

1035
01:57:00,398 --> 01:57:04,557
do't; the time is come:
Thou strikest not me, 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st.

1036
01:57:06,488 --> 01:57:07,816
Put colour in thy cheek.

1037
01:57:08,073 --> 01:57:09,615
The gods withhold me!

1038
01:57:10,034 --> 01:57:14,102
Eros,wouldst thou be window'd in great Rome
and see Thy master thus with pleach'd arms

1039
01:57:14,202 --> 01:57:18,495
bending down His  neck, before the  seat
Of fortunate Caesar, ?

1040
01:57:18,712 --> 01:57:20,607
I would not see't

1041
01:57:22,464 --> 01:57:23,905
Come, then; for with a wound I must be cured.

1042
01:57:26,035 --> 01:57:27,061
Draw that  sword.

1043
01:57:27,261 --> 01:57:28,921
O, sir, pardon me!

1044
01:57:29,138 --> 01:57:31,180
When I did make thee free, sworest thou not then
To do this when I bade thee?

1045
01:57:32,193 --> 01:57:34,686
Do it at once;

1046
01:57:35,205 --> 01:57:38,205
Or thy precedent services are all
But accidents unpurposed.

1047
01:57:44,405 --> 01:57:45,780
Draw, and come

1048
01:58:01,715 --> 01:58:04,717
Turn from me, then, that noble countenance,

1049
01:58:14,688 --> 01:58:15,968
Eros!

1050
01:58:16,231 --> 01:58:18,805
My captain, and my emperor, let me say

1051
01:58:20,111 --> 01:58:24,820
Before I strike ," farewell"

1052
01:58:26,868 --> 01:58:29,359
'Tis said, man; and farewell

1053
01:58:31,957 --> 01:58:34,080
Adio la un mare lider!

1054
01:58:48,934 --> 01:58:50,393
Shall I strike now?

1055
01:58:50,811 --> 01:58:52,555
Now, Eros

1056
01:58:59,487 --> 01:59:06,202
Why, there then: thus I do escape the sorrow
Of Antony's death

1057
01:59:17,173 --> 01:59:19,131
Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros

1058
01:59:21,678 --> 01:59:27,183
, what
I should, and thou couldst not.

1059
01:59:28,185 --> 01:59:31,311
but I will be a bridegroom in my death,
and run into't as to a lover's bed.

1060
01:59:32,596 --> 01:59:38,853
Come, then; and, Eros,
Thy master dies thy scholar:

1061
01:59:45,371 --> 01:59:47,862
to do thus
I learn'd of thee.

1062
02:00:03,015 --> 02:00:15,900
How! not dead? not dead?

1063
02:00:23,913 --> 02:00:26,618
Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly

1064
02:00:42,893 --> 02:00:44,387
Who's there??

1065
02:00:57,617 --> 02:01:03,241
Take my aword and give me death

1066
02:01:03,457 --> 02:01:06,660
My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee

1067
02:01:09,964 --> 02:01:12,087
When did she send thee?

1068
02:01:12,967 --> 02:01:14,510
Now, my lord

1069
02:01:19,600 --> 02:01:21,177
Where is she?

1070
02:01:21,518 --> 02:01:23,143
Lock'd in her monument

1071
02:01:31,988 --> 02:01:34,906
She had a prophesying fear
Of what hath come to pass

1072
02:01:35,158 --> 02:01:39,821
fearing since how it might work, hath sent
me to proclaim the truth;

1073
02:01:40,043 --> 02:01:43,043
and I am come,too late

1074
02:01:47,496 --> 02:01:51,180
Too late

1075
02:01:54,221 --> 02:02:04,803
Your star is falling, sir.
You may not live.

1076
02:02:22,043 --> 02:02:28,378
Hei, good friend..
Do not please the faith with your sorrow.

1077
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:44,686
We welcome to which will punish us and buried
lately you will have my thanks for all???

1078
02:03:36,292 --> 02:03:41,287
O Charmian, I will never go from hence

1079
02:03:43,299 --> 02:03:45,458
Be comforted, dear madam.

1080
02:03:52,977 --> 02:03:54,257
No, I will not

1081
02:04:15,960 --> 02:04:17,205
Anthony.

1082
02:04:42,239 --> 02:04:43,733
Anthony!

1083
02:04:47,453 --> 02:04:49,991
I am dying, Egypt, dying;

1084
02:04:51,124 --> 02:04:52,867
only
I here importune death awhile,

1085
02:04:53,293 --> 02:05:00,043
until of many thousand kisses the poor last
I lay up thy lips,

1086
02:05:01,177 --> 02:05:07,714
Dear my lord, pardon,--I dare not,
come down:Lest I be taken

1087
02:05:14,191 --> 02:05:15,602
I am safe

1088
02:05:18,821 --> 02:05:22,949
Help me, my women

1089
02:05:37,800 --> 02:05:42,057
And welcome, welcome.! die where thou hast lived
Quicken with kissing

1090
02:05:43,759 --> 02:05:48,075
had my lips that poweri!
Thus would I wear them out

1091
02:05:52,024 --> 02:05:57,730
I am dying, Egypt, dying:
Give me some wine, and let me speak a little

1092
02:05:58,990 --> 02:06:02,691
Of Caesar seek your honour, with your safety

1093
02:06:05,789 --> 02:06:08,707
They do not go together

1094
02:06:12,255 --> 02:06:13,583
Gentle, hear me:

1095
02:06:15,467 --> 02:06:19,595
None about Caesar trust but Proculeius

1096
02:06:20,472 --> 02:06:25,514
My resolution and my hands I'll trust;
None about Caesar

1097
02:06:27,897 --> 02:06:33,105
The miserable change now at my end
Lament nor sorrow at;

1098
02:06:33,862 --> 02:06:39,486
but please your thoughts
In feeding them with those my former fortunes

1099
02:06:40,077 --> 02:06:45,501
Wherein I lived, the greatest
prince o' the world,

1100
02:06:46,137 --> 02:06:48,137
The noblest; and do now not basely die

1101
02:06:49,337 --> 02:06:51,828
Not cowardly put off my helmet to
My countryman,-

1102
02:06:57,054 --> 02:07:00,672
Noone but Anthony could conquer
Anthony

1103
02:07:06,064 --> 02:07:14,440
Noblest of men, woo't die?
Hast thou no care of me?

1104
02:07:17,243 --> 02:07:24,124
shall I abideIn this dull world,
which in thy absence is No better than a sty?

1105
02:07:27,087 --> 02:07:31,630
O, see, my women!The crown o' the earth doth melt.

1106
02:07:34,345 --> 02:07:35,970
My lord!

1107
02:07:41,978 --> 02:07:45,522
O, wither'd is the garland of the war,

1108
02:07:47,169 --> 02:07:54,169
The soldier's pole is fall'n: young boys and girls
Are level now with men;

1109
02:07:56,369 --> 02:08:04,116
the odds is gone, And there is nothing left remarkable
Beneath the visiting moon.

1110
02:08:09,425 --> 02:08:10,457
Lady!

1111
02:08:14,180 --> 02:08:15,343
Madam!

1112
02:08:15,724 --> 02:08:18,725
Peace, peace, Iras!

1113
02:08:21,814 --> 02:08:27,439
No more, but e'en a woman,
and commanded By such poor passion

1114
02:08:27,781 --> 02:08:30,947
as the maid that milks
and does the meanest chares

1115
02:08:34,691 --> 02:08:41,580
It were for me
To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;

1116
02:08:42,003 --> 02:08:49,418
To tell them that this world did equal theirs
Till they had stol'n our jewel

1117
02:08:56,852 --> 02:09:06,475
Ah, women, women, look,
Our lamp is spent, it's out!

1118
02:09:25,259 --> 02:09:26,504
Wherefore is that?

1119
02:09:32,099 --> 02:09:35,099
what are you?
What you say?

1120
02:09:35,937 --> 02:09:39,602
I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead

1121
02:09:41,360 --> 02:09:43,488
The breaking of so great a thing should make
A greater crack:

1122
02:09:43,906 --> 02:09:46,962
the round world should have shook lions
into civil streets, and citizens to their dens

1123
02:09:51,162 --> 02:09:52,870
He is dead, Caesar

1124
02:09:53,099 --> 02:09:55,420
but that self hand,
Which writ his honour in the acts it did,

1125
02:09:59,405 --> 02:10:03,256
This is his sword;behold his blood

1126
02:10:13,937 --> 02:10:15,597
Look you sad, friends?

1127
02:10:17,775 --> 02:10:22,778
The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings
To wash the eyes of kings

1128
02:10:25,283 --> 02:10:26,694
Caesar is touched

1129
02:10:27,994 --> 02:10:31,828
When such a spacious mirror's set before him,
He needs must see himself

1130
02:10:35,586 --> 02:10:43,422
O Antony!
I have follow'd thee to this

1131
02:10:49,017 --> 02:10:51,140
we could not stall together
In the whole world:

1132
02:10:55,566 --> 02:10:56,562
Whence are you?

1133
02:10:56,818 --> 02:10:58,478
A poor Egyptian yet

1134
02:10:59,946 --> 02:11:03,481
The queen my mistress,
Confined in all she has, her monument

1135
02:11:03,784 --> 02:11:07,034
Of thy intents desires instruction,

1136
02:11:09,123 --> 02:11:10,665
She soon shall know

1137
02:11:12,126 --> 02:11:13,241
Proculus.

1138
02:11:29,937 --> 02:11:34,684
My desolation does begin to make
A better life

1139
02:11:35,697 --> 02:11:41,151
'Tis paltry to be Caesar;
Not being Fortune, he's but fortune's knave.

1140
02:11:41,351 --> 02:11:45,446
Cleopatra, Caesar sends
greeting to the Queen of Egypt!

1141
02:11:49,834 --> 02:11:53,001
And bids thee study on what fair demands
Thou mean'st to have him grant thee

1142
02:11:53,380 --> 02:11:58,126
If your master Would have a queen his beggar,
you must tell him I beg a kingdom.

1143
02:11:58,969 --> 02:11:59,907
This I'll report, dear lady.

1144
02:12:01,228 --> 02:12:07,523
Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied
Of him that caused it.

1145
02:12:15,070 --> 02:12:16,315
Hold, worthy lady, hold:

1146
02:12:16,614 --> 02:12:18,606
Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this
Relieved, but not betray'd

1147
02:12:22,453 --> 02:12:24,945
Where art thou, death?

1148
02:12:28,418 --> 02:12:29,794
O, temperance, lady

1149
02:12:30,045 --> 02:12:33,960
Sir, I will eat no meat, I'll not drink, sir;
If idle talk will once be necessary,

1150
02:12:34,383 --> 02:12:37,301
this mortal house I'll ruin,
Do Caesar what he can.

1151
02:12:48,023 --> 02:12:49,648
To Caesar I will speak what you shall please.

1152
02:12:52,862 --> 02:12:54,855
Say, I would die

1153
02:12:57,826 --> 02:13:00,743
Most noble empress, you have heard of me

1154
02:13:02,831 --> 02:13:04,160
I cannot tell..

1155
02:13:04,625 --> 02:13:06,084
Assuredly you know me

1156
02:13:09,213 --> 02:13:10,672
What's your name?

1157
02:13:11,215 --> 02:13:12,758
My name is Proculeus.

1158
02:13:18,807 --> 02:13:22,844
Antony did tell me about you.
I may trust you.

1159
02:13:30,229 --> 02:13:32,545
I have no use for trusting

1160
02:13:33,573 --> 02:13:36,152
Madam...
Don't matter so..

1161
02:13:45,378 --> 02:13:50,373
I dream'd there was an Emperor Antony

1162
02:13:51,176 --> 02:13:56,218
O, such another sleep, that I might see
But such another man

1163
02:13:56,849 --> 02:13:58,047
If it might please you...

1164
02:13:58,217 --> 02:14:03,519
His face was as the heavens; and therein stuck
A sun and moon, which kept their course,

1165
02:14:04,816 --> 02:14:07,657
and lighted
The little o, the earth

1166
02:14:09,404 --> 02:14:10,863
Most sovereign creature

1167
02:14:11,114 --> 02:14:17,652
...His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm
Crested the world:

1168
02:14:18,748 --> 02:14:23,862
his voice was propertied As all the
tuned spheres, and that to friends.

1169
02:14:24,869 --> 02:14:28,562
But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,
He was as rattling thunder

1170
02:14:30,590 --> 02:14:33,148
For his bounty,there was no winter in't;

1171
02:14:34,611 --> 02:14:37,611
an autumn 'twas that grew the
more by reaping

1172
02:14:37,811 --> 02:14:41,891
in his livery walked crowns and crownets;

1173
02:14:42,649 --> 02:14:48,355
realms and islands were
As plates dropp'd from his pocket

1174
02:14:48,781 --> 02:14:50,013
Cleopatra!

1175
02:14:50,658 --> 02:14:56,130
Think you there was, or might be, such a man
As this I dream'd of

1176
02:14:57,666 --> 02:14:59,374
Gentle madam, no

1177
02:14:59,876 --> 02:15:01,953
You lie, up to the hearing of the gods

1178
02:15:04,131 --> 02:15:08,877
Hear me, good madam.
Your loss is as yourself, great

1179
02:15:11,139 --> 02:15:12,419
I thank you, sir

1180
02:15:16,478 --> 02:15:19,728
Know you what Caesar means to do with me?

1181
02:15:21,275 --> 02:15:23,067
I am loath to tell you what I would you knew

1182
02:15:23,653 --> 02:15:25,396
Nay, pray you, sir,--

1183
02:15:26,322 --> 02:15:27,651
Though he be honourable

1184
02:15:31,453 --> 02:15:34,022
He'll lead me, then, in triumph?
Madam, he will; I know't.

1185
02:15:57,982 --> 02:15:59,524
It is the emperor, madam

1186
02:16:29,892 --> 02:16:31,801
Which is the Queen of Egypt?

1187
02:16:36,650 --> 02:16:42,523
Arise, you shall not kneel:
I pray you, rise; rise, Egypt

1188
02:16:44,366 --> 02:16:49,741
Sir, the gods Will have it thus;
my master and my lord I must obey

1189
02:16:50,957 --> 02:16:52,700
Take to you no hard thoughts:

1190
02:16:53,335 --> 02:16:57,167
What injuries you did us,we shall remember
As things but done by chance.

1191
02:16:59,466 --> 02:17:00,924
Sole sir o' the world,

1192
02:17:01,209 --> 02:17:06,756
Cleopatra, know,
If you apply yourself to our intents,

1193
02:17:07,684 --> 02:17:09,890
Which towards you are most gentle, you shall find
A benefit in this change

1194
02:17:11,438 --> 02:17:15,560
but if you take Antony's course,
you shall bereave yourself Of my good purposes

1195
02:17:17,319 --> 02:17:18,399
I'll take my leave

1196
02:17:18,612 --> 02:17:19,811
And may, through all the world: 'tis yours;

1197
02:17:20,072 --> 02:17:24,836
and we, your signs of conquest, shall
Hang in what place you please

1198
02:17:25,245 --> 02:17:28,696
No, dear queen,Our care and pity
is so much upon you,
That we remain your friend;

1199
02:17:30,334 --> 02:17:31,329
and so, adieu

1200
02:17:31,543 --> 02:17:32,741
My master, and my lord

1201
02:17:33,796 --> 02:17:35,255
Not so. Adieu

1202
02:17:47,436 --> 02:17:53,190
He words me, girls, he words me,

1203
02:17:54,527 --> 02:18:00,182
that I should not
Be noble to myself: what think you?

1204
02:18:00,382 --> 02:18:05,532
Thou, an Egyptian puppet, shalt be shown
In Rome, as well as I

1205
02:18:06,193 --> 02:18:09,916
mechanic slaves with greasy aprons, , shall
Uplift us to the view;

1206
02:18:10,129 --> 02:18:11,722
O the good gods!Nay, that's certain

1207
02:18:15,800 --> 02:18:18,506
the quick comedians extemporally
will stage us Our Alexandrian revels

1208
02:18:18,551 --> 02:18:25,309
Antony
Shall be brought drunken forth,

1209
02:18:25,603 --> 02:18:29,263
and I shall see Some squeaking Cleopatra boy
my greatness In the posture of a whore.

1210
02:18:30,400 --> 02:18:34,350
I'll never see 't; for, I am sure, my nails
Are stronger than mine eyes

1211
02:18:35,197 --> 02:18:36,821
Why, that's the way

1212
02:18:38,325 --> 02:18:45,435
It's finished, good lady.The bright day is done.
And we have it all done

1213
02:18:50,047 --> 02:18:51,408
Now, Charmian!

1214
02:18:55,564 --> 02:18:59,758
Show me, my women, like a queen: go fetch
My best attires

1215
02:19:00,474 --> 02:19:04,722
I am again for Cydnus,
To meet Mark Antony

1216
02:19:06,231 --> 02:19:08,118
Good Iras, go.

1217
02:19:09,550 --> 02:19:12,647
And, when thou hast done this chare,
I'll give thee leave to play till doomsday.

1218
02:19:14,043 --> 02:19:16,091
Bring our crown and all.

1219
02:19:43,313 --> 02:19:45,187
You bring me liberty

1220
02:19:52,698 --> 02:19:54,738
My resolution's placed.

1221
02:19:55,535 --> 02:20:01,538
Now the fleeting moon no planet is of mine.

1222
02:20:03,585 --> 02:20:07,286
Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there,
That kills and pains not

1223
02:20:09,050 --> 02:20:11,466
Truly, I have him.

1224
02:20:12,762 --> 02:20:14,422
His biting is immortal

1225
02:20:14,639 --> 02:20:16,798
Rememberest thou any that have died on't

1226
02:20:17,225 --> 02:20:25,435
Very many, men and women too
Indeed, there is no goodness in the worm.

1227
02:20:25,776 --> 02:20:30,396
Take thou no care; it shall be heeded

1228
02:20:31,825 --> 02:20:32,940
get thee gone

1229
02:20:33,744 --> 02:20:35,368
Yes, forsooth.

1230
02:20:37,289 --> 02:20:38,570
farewell

1231
02:20:41,377 --> 02:20:43,584
I wish you joy o' the worm

1232
02:21:07,239 --> 02:21:15,496
Give me my robe, put on my crown; I have
Immortal longings in me:

1233
02:21:16,874 --> 02:21:20,742
now no more the juice of Egypt's 
grape shall moist this lip:

1234
02:21:22,714 --> 02:21:25,501
Methinks I hear
Antony call;

1235
02:21:25,717 --> 02:21:28,837
I see him rouse himself
To praise my noble act;

1236
02:21:29,305 --> 02:21:33,275
I hear him mock the luck of Caesar,
which the gods give men
To excuse their after wrath

1237
02:21:37,011 --> 02:21:41,573
Husband, I come!

1238
02:21:43,737 --> 02:21:51,532
I am fire and air; my other elements
I give to baser life

1239
02:21:54,374 --> 02:21:56,248
So; have you done?

1240
02:22:05,720 --> 02:22:07,878
Farewell, kind Charmian

1241
02:22:13,937 --> 02:22:16,559
Iras, long farewell

1242
02:22:28,996 --> 02:22:30,455
Dost thou lie still?

1243
02:22:33,729 --> 02:22:36,533
thou tell'st the world
It is not worth leave-taking.

1244
02:22:52,771 --> 02:23:02,488
Come, thoumortal wretch,with thy
sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate
Of life at once untie

1245
02:23:11,876 --> 02:23:19,457
O, couldst thou speak,that I might hear thee
call great Caesar ass unpolicied

1246
02:23:20,594 --> 02:23:22,468
O eastern star!

1247
02:23:25,182 --> 02:23:26,427
Peace, peace!

1248
02:23:32,565 --> 02:23:36,480
Dost thou not see my baby at
my breast...

1249
02:23:37,779 --> 02:23:41,424
O, break! O, break!

1250
02:23:46,581 --> 02:23:49,866
that sucks the nurse asleep??

1251
02:23:55,924 --> 02:24:08,394
As sweet as balm, as soft as air,
as gentle,

1252
02:24:12,067 --> 02:24:14,690
O Antony!

1253
02:24:22,787 --> 02:24:25,040
What should I stay?

1254
02:24:27,891 --> 02:24:29,891
In this vile world?

1255
02:24:35,377 --> 02:24:41,211
Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies
A lass unparallel'd.

1256
02:24:44,774 --> 02:24:46,468
Your crown's awry;

1257
02:24:47,879 --> 02:24:56,069
I'll mend it, and then play

1258
02:25:18,306 --> 02:25:19,386
Where is the queen?

1259
02:25:19,641 --> 02:25:21,184
Speak softly, wake her not

1260
02:25:22,936 --> 02:25:24,312
Caesar hath sent...

1261
02:25:24,605 --> 02:25:26,930
Too slow a messenger

1262
02:25:27,900 --> 02:25:29,478
dispatch

1263
02:25:32,781 --> 02:25:34,323
What work is here!

1264
02:25:35,867 --> 02:25:37,362
Charmian, is this well done

1265
02:25:37,703 --> 02:25:43,042
It is well done, and fitting
for a princess

1266
02:25:50,216 --> 02:25:52,008
Ah, soldier

1267
02:26:07,819 --> 02:26:13,062
O sir, you are too sure an augurer;
That you did fear is done

1268
02:26:24,004 --> 02:26:26,080
Bravest at the last,
She levell'd at our purposes,

1269
02:26:26,465 --> 02:26:30,677
and, being royal,took her own way.

1270
02:26:32,138 --> 02:26:37,477
She looks like sleeping

1271
02:26:37,685 --> 02:26:42,893
As she would catch another Antony
In her strong toil of grace.

1272
02:26:43,734 --> 02:26:47,020
Take up her bed;
She shall be buried by her Antony:

1273
02:26:49,198 --> 02:26:53,944
No grave upon the earth shall clip in it
A pair so famous.
