1
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,600
MIKADO

2
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:14,200
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday!

3
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:28,159
The one I saw on TV?

4
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:29,599
Happy?

5
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,000
Yes. Hold this.

6
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:47,040
Get your hair out of the way, I'll help.

7
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:00,719
Do we go out tonight or leave it
for the weekend and stay out longer?

8
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,799
- Up to her.
- I'm going out with the girls tonight.

9
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,879
Let's do it on Saturday.

10
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:10,280
- Where are you going out?
- I don't know yet.

11
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:13,319
Just you girls?

12
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,759
Yes.

13
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,639
What time are you coming back?

14
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:22,919
- 11?
- Alright, but not later than 11:30.

15
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,319
- Will you drive her to school?
- I'm skipping the first classes.

16
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,199
Who needs school anyway, right?

17
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:33,960
Ha-ha.
Go get dressed.

18
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,240
There's an event at the hospital,

19
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,240
I already told the teachers
I'm skipping classes.

20
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,159
We had an agreement.

21
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,319
- Not nice.
- Serves me right for telling you.

22
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,520
Magda.

23
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,759
Cut her some slack today.

24
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:52,960
Bye.

25
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,479
Make sure she's not late.

26
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,639
- Want to do a magic trick?
- Yes!

27
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,080
So faint!
Haven't you eaten?

28
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,599
Don't they feed you here?
No?

29
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:10,520
- Why, Madam, are they naughty?
- They're the best!

30
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,960
- Have you been good and eaten?
- Yes!

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,719
Then answer this:
Why are elephants' eyes red?

32
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,840
So they can hide in cherry trees.

33
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:26,680
Never seen an elephant
up a cherry tree?

34
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:28,719
Well hidden, aren't they?

35
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,520
The next question may be
too tough for you.

36
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,520
- Not for me!
- You think?

37
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,280
No one figured it out
in the adults section.

38
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,120
Another reason why
elephants have red eyes

39
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:46,599
is so they can hide from
the little red lights in the air.

40
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,759
Can you see them? Where?

41
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,879
You show me where.

42
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,719
You see one here?

43
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,479
I think I can see it too, a little.

44
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,479
Another one! They're everywhere!

45
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,400
Here's one!

46
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,840
It got in my tummy!

47
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,279
Pick a card and show it to everyone.

48
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,120
Now put it anywhere in the pack,
even if I've seen it.

49
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:27,319
- It's in there, right?
- Yes.

50
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,319
Now pick one of your friends
to be the magician.

51
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:35,480
- Her!
- What's your name?

52
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,920
- Luiza.
- How old are you?

53
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,560
- Six.
- Why?

54
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:46,879
Now make a magician gesture, like this.

55
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,319
Well done!

56
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,519
Now show everyone the first card.

57
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,759
Excellent!

58
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:03,120
- Ready for the surprise we prepared?
- Yes!

59
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:07,360
Happy birthday to you,

60
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,360
Happy birthday to you!

61
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,399
Happy birthday, dear
Magda and Luiza,

62
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:29,519
Happy birthday to you!

63
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,959
Bravo!

64
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:45,519
You were loud again.

65
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,040
Want a drink?

66
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,240
I swear,
you're addicted to Instagram.

67
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,920
I'll go shoe shopping with her,
want to come along?

68
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,199
If you're going during the weekend
or in the evening.

69
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,399
Her birthday party is this weekend.

70
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,319
We can go around noon.
It's less crowded, too.

71
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,079
How sweet, they went
to Herăstrău Park.

72
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,040
Let me see.

73
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,519
I'm talking to you!

74
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,679
I told you where it is.

75
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,759
You'll be late, you know.

76
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,919
Have it your way.

77
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:41,120
Go get dressed.

78
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,799
I said go get dressed!

79
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,440
- You'll be late, leave her be.
- Stay out of this!

80
00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:01,320
Make yourself a coffee
or just do your stuff.

81
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:04,919
Where is it?

82
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:11,639
Why are you being like that?
Are we back to this?

83
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,399
- We agreed on something.
- You agreed on your own.

84
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,000
After the last parent-teacher meeting,
you promised you'd change.

85
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,519
Are we back to lying?

86
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,039
- I said I gave it away!
- To a pawn shop or what?

87
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,720
- None of your business.
- Really?

88
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:39,679
- Can't you move it forward?
- Where, on top of the bus?

89
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:43,320
- Just two metres!
- There are bollards.

90
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:45,360
You can squeeze past.

91
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,879
Right, sorry.
Are you at the hospital, can I stop by?

92
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,279
Yes, I'm here.

93
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,720
Just try passing.

94
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,639
You'll fit.

95
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:00,559
We're leaving in a moment.

96
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,080
- Please, can I just leave these?
- No, Madam.

97
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:15,039
- Excuse me, Sir -
- Dr. Avram is expecting me.

98
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,600
- I can't let you in, Madam.
- You just let him!

99
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:21,559
He's not visiting a patient.

100
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,320
- But you let him in!
- Please, go home.

101
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:30,320
- I let her come, I thought you knew.
- Does she ever talk to me?

102
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,039
I'm sorry. She and a boy
hold a monthly event for the children.

103
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,639
Since she's going for Medicine,
I thought it would be good for her.

104
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,000
Come in!

105
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,440
Your delivery is downstairs.

106
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:48,519
If you don't want her to,
I'll tell her to stop coming.

107
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,399
- Bring back the receipt.
- Yes.

108
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,919
Sugar?

109
00:11:58,519 --> 00:11:59,840
No, thank you.

110
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,159
I spoke with my friend,
he'll do the fundraiser here again.

111
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,759
- Campaign or event?
- Campaign.

112
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,639
- A Text-to-Give, ads and so on.
- Great.

113
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,799
You could build another ward.

114
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,240
Remember the media scandal
about that other hospital?

115
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:23,240
This is private money,
it's all checked by the Ministry.

116
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:25,399
What's your target?

117
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:28,799
One million for a fully-equipped storey.

118
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:32,399
Or 200.000 for two equipped rooms.

119
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,919
- Can do.
- Great.

120
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,559
What's with Magda?

121
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,399
I bought her a necklace for her birthday.

122
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,240
She claims she gave it to a girl here.

123
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,519
- A nurse?
- No, a patient.

124
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,639
A little girl, Luiza.

125
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,679
- Here?
- That's what she says.

126
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:57,840
It looks like silver, but it's white gold.

127
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:00,639
The value doesn't matter.

128
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,600
- I just want to know.
- I'll find out in a minute.

129
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,360
Don't tell her I checked.

130
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,399
- Luiza, right?
- So she said.

131
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,879
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

132
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:25,279
Can I use someone in the audience?

133
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,320
I'll bring my own
magic tricks equipment.

134
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,919
I can do three, if you want.

135
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,799
Alright then, just two tricks.

136
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,320
Of course.

137
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,639
I'll come sign the contract, then.

138
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,960
Shoot!

139
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,559
- How was the test?
- So-so.

140
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,639
- Did the TV guys call back?
- So-so.

141
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,879
- They did, you're a star!
- As of today!

142
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,279
Way to go!

143
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,240
- How about the one you showed me?
- Which one?

144
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,159
Where you swallow a chocolate
and pretend to pull it back out.

145
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,600
You need special makeup,
and everyone's seen it.

146
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:11,799
Have you?

147
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:14,879
- What do you want?
- My birthday, my treat.

148
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,600
- No way.
- Come on, it's on me.

149
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,559
What will it be?

150
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,600
A fishburger and a salad.

151
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:23,440
A cheeseburger and a cola.

152
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,960
- Large, regular?
- Regular. You could get a job here.

153
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:28,200
No, your mum makes me fishburgers.

154
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:31,639
It's much cooler to have
your own YouTube channel.

155
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,399
I'll make one and tell the audience
to follow me online.

156
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,679
Hello, Dad.

157
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,080
What do you mean, not there?

158
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:48,679
I'm not lying, I gave it to her!

159
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:50,720
Where are you now?

160
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:53,679
Stay there, I'm on my way.

161
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,879
- Can you drive me to the hospital?
- Anything wrong? Let me get Mihai.

162
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:10,960
- Do I drop you off here?
- Yes.

163
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,240
- I'll call you when I'm done.
- Let me know.

164
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,200
- Take care.
- Bye.

165
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:27,840
- You'd think you want to marry her.
- Shut up, idiot.

166
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:31,120
All that lovey-dovey...
Are you right in the head?

167
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,320
Watching her all puppy-eyed.

168
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:39,720
- Can I touch you?
- Go ahead.

169
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,919
You're for real, you fuck!

170
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:51,360
There's no necklace.
I embarrassed myself in front of them.

171
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,159
- I gave it to her!
- Stop lying.

172
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,360
It was mine, do I need
your permission to give it away?

173
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,080
- Is that all you understood?
- And that you're checking on me.

174
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,039
Because you've been playing me
for an idiot, here and at school.

175
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:10,000
That's why.

176
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,440
You control me to show you care?
Like you did with mum?

177
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,080
- Aren't you embarrassed to -
- No!

178
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,080
I never left her side
the three years until she died.

179
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:22,080
Someone give the man a medal.

180
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,799
- Meaning?
- Nothing.

181
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:36,399
Don't change the subject,
that's so like your mother.

182
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,720
Did you sell the necklace?

183
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,559
Do you ever listen to me?

184
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:44,000
Do you need money?
Are you taking drugs?

185
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,480
- Where is it?
- I gave it to Luiza!

186
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:50,360
Take your hands off me
and leave me alone!

187
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,480
Doesn't matter if you lost it or broke it.

188
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:59,919
I broke things when I was little too.

189
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,480
So tell me, did Magda
give you a necklace at the party?

190
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,519
Don't look at her,
she won't mind you telling.

191
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,160
I promise I'll give you one if she didn't.

192
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:16,839
Did Magda give you
a necklace at the party?

193
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,920
And I suppose you haven't seen
a necklace on any of the children

194
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:26,559
They would have said something.

195
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,480
I see.

196
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:31,359
Thank you.

197
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,559
I'm sorry. See you.

198
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:36,440
- Dad, please wait.
- No.

199
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:39,319
- There will be consequences.
- I just asked you to listen to me

200
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,799
If you mock me, two can play this game.

201
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,000
At least wait.

202
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:49,640
Luiza, I know I said
this will be our magic secret,

203
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,640
but let's make that necklace reappear.

204
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,119
I'll cover my eyes and count to three.

205
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:57,440
1, 2, 3!

206
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:59,359
- Magda, that's enough.
- Luiza!

207
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,240
- Where is it, Luiza?
- Magda, stop it!

208
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:05,599
- Where did you put the necklace?
- Magda, just go!

209
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,920
- Dad, wait!
- Geta!

210
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:09,759
Change her catheter.

211
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:13,440
We have the same birthday,
so I gave it to her!

212
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:18,160
- Was it gold or silver?
- White gold.

213
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:23,480
Geta, if you now something,
tell me right now.

214
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:28,160
- This is theft!
- Theft?

215
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,839
- Didn't you say you took it?
- Yes, but -

216
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,519
Don't "but" me!
Typical thief behaviour.

217
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:39,759
If you had come out and said
"I needed the money" -

218
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:41,200
I didn't do it!

219
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,559
Who gave me this, not two minutes ago?

220
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:49,119
- Me, but I didn't steal it!
- "But" again?

221
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,240
- I'm losing patience.
- Wait.

222
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:55,799
Rodica's been with us for 12 years.
Let's hear her side of the story.

223
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:01,279
I did my night round
to check on Andrei, Alesia, and her.

224
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,640
When I checked her IV,
I saw it on the bed, she was asleep.

225
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:09,319
It had slipped off her head,
it was on the pillow!

226
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,799
I thought it might get lost or broken.

227
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,720
- I wanted to ask someone about it.
- Did you?

228
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:18,200
There was no one to ask at 5 a.m.

229
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:20,759
I left it in my locker,
I didn't even take it home!

230
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:23,359
I bet you did. But I say
you wanted to steal it.

231
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,680
I swear not!
Doctor, you know me!

232
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:29,720
- Just admit to it!
- May God strike me if I stole it!

233
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:31,319
I wish He did.

234
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:36,319
- I swear on the Holy Cross!
- Keep God out of this, it won't help.

235
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,240
I want her fired now.

236
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:41,160
I've known Rodica so long,
I don't think -

237
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,119
You will fire her now!

238
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,440
Or I go to the police
and get your hospital in big trouble.

239
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:51,480
It will be all over the news:
"Nurse Steals from Child with Cancer".

240
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:55,640
- Stop staring and get out!
- Wait, Magda and Iulian were there too.

241
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,960
I don't care!
Keep Magda out of this!

242
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,880
She told the truth,
you all tried to hide it!

243
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:07,519
I don't care if you're my friend,
you can forget that new ward!

244
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,440
Fire her!

245
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,599
Or bear the consequences.

246
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:34,880
I'm sorry.

247
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,359
Here.

248
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:44,400
Give it back to her.

249
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,119
I'm sorry.
You give it back to her.

250
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:13,000
Want to touch a celebrity, bro?

251
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,759
I wanted it to be a surprise,
but I couldn't wait.

252
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:18,839
I'll be on their morning show!

253
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,319
Mondays from 9 to 10,
I'll be there every week.

254
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,079
You bet we'll drink to that!

255
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,240
Catch you later, bye.

256
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,240
Your lunch order.

257
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:55,319
Thanks, please send Rodica over.

258
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,000
- Congratulations, dear!
- The doctor wants you.

259
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:06,559
When do you start?

260
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,799
On the morning show?

261
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,839
On a contract?

262
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,759
Well done!

263
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,680
Alright then.

264
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:19,599
No, I -

265
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,160
We'll talk when I get home.

266
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,920
Bye, dear.

267
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:42,039
Come in.

268
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,319
- Give him two miligrams.
- I did, half an hour ago.

269
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,359
Have a seat.

270
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,559
How are you?

271
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:55,480
Alright.

272
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,440
I'm sorry.

273
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,400
It's out of my hands.
At least until the dust settles.

274
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,039
I didn't steal it, Madam.

275
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:10,920
It doesn't even matter now.

276
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:15,960
Think of the children.

277
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,880
A whole new ward, fully equipped.
Isn't it a pity not to be done?

278
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,680
Do you believe me, though?

279
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:26,799
I do.

280
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,400
Listen, take three days of leave.

281
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,119
File the request today.

282
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,880
By next week, I'll have you
transferred to another ward.

283
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:43,599
It will be alright,
I'll take care of it.

284
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:48,400
I can't help it, it is what it is.

285
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,279
When the new ward is built,
you'll be so proud you contributed.

286
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,440
I don't want to leave the children.

287
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,720
We'll see.

288
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:11,319
I'll try talking to him
once he calms down.

289
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,519
We'll sort this out somehow.

290
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:44,440
Your pizza.
That will be 54 lei.

291
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,039
Just a moment.

292
00:24:56,839 --> 00:24:58,039
- Hello.
- Hello.

293
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,160
- Mum, how are you?
- Good.

294
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,079
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

295
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:15,200
Something wrong?

296
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,599
The lift's broken.

297
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,440
- Want pizza?
- Yes.

298
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:39,039
Are you working on Monday morning?

299
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:40,119
No.

300
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,640
If he gets 10.000 online views
from the TV appearance,

301
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,559
he'll have 100.000 in a week.

302
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,440
He'll earn money from
subscriptions to his YouTube channel.

303
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:05,200
Only if the views are monetised
and he has ads.

304
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:06,920
Love, let's eat.

305
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,920
- He'll get ads too.
- From whom?

306
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,720
- Advertisers?
- Yes, he needs something targeted.

307
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:19,000
Companies that sell things
related to his kind of content.

308
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:25,240
Let's say he does a trick with cats,
since pets are hot on YouTube,

309
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:28,920
then he can try with cat food brands.

310
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,680
- Ads for cat food or litter.
- Or cat collars.

311
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,599
I can give you a hand if you want.

312
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:38,559
- Are you downstairs?
- Problems?

313
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,759
The usual stuff at work.

314
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:46,799
What hospital?

315
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:54,119
Her ID is expired,
didn't the ambulance personnel tell you?

316
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:58,880
You can't get
the paperwork done with this.

317
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:02,839
We need something valid,
like her birth certificate.

318
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:07,640
You need that one
for the morgue anyway.

319
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:12,039
You need to pick her up
from the morgue, Entrance F.

320
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,039
Can you have someone
bring it from home?

321
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,039
Not really...

322
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,559
We can't release the body without
the form. Can you ask a neighbour?

323
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,759
Neighbours...

324
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:34,119
I left with the ambulance,
I didn't think...

325
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,920
She won't be released until tomorrow,
with the documents we issue.

326
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,200
With the papers from the morgue,

327
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:44,759
you go file for a death certificate
at the City Hall.

328
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:48,359
But they close at 2 pm and -
Excuse me.

329
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:54,240
How is she doing?

330
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,440
She's gone.

331
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,519
Nothing more will happen here,
just bring the certificate.

332
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,599
- Can I see her?
- Of course.

333
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:32,680
You'll have to identify her
at the morgue in a few minutes.

334
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,599
Ask them to give you some time.

335
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,400
Please get the papers tonight, yes?

336
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:43,640
Doctor.

337
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:49,400
How's the situation?

338
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,240
They need her birth certificate.

339
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:16,920
- Need a lift?
- I can take a taxi.

340
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:19,680
I had a drink, I can't drive.

341
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:21,559
You want to go?

342
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,440
- Or give me the keys.
- No, I -

343
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:25,759
It's alright.

344
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,079
Do you know where she kept it?

345
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:34,200
- A brown box on a side table by the TV.
- In the livingroom.

346
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,839
- You know where he lives?
- I'm his neighbour.

347
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,079
- Dad can go on his own.
- I still need the address.

348
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,039
- Should I come along?
- Just give me the address.

349
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:29,680
Right, 37.

350
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,200
Yes.

351
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:51,839
Yes, I will.

352
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,839
In the livingroom, right?

353
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,039
I see two boxes by the TV.

354
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:32,440
Yes, found it.

355
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:39,160
Need anything else from here?

356
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,440
Alright, I'm coming.

357
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:44,759
Alright.

358
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,000
- Hello.
- How are you?

359
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:22,799
I've been meaning to call you.

360
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,880
- About today -
- She's dead.

361
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,680
Who?

362
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,880
Rodica, the nurse with the necklace.

363
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:35,920
How so?

364
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:39,519
I'm at the hospital with her son.

365
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:43,240
I brought Magda
so she could be with him.

366
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,559
- The Forensic Institute or the hospital?
- The hospital.

367
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,759
- Why didn't you tell me who she was?
- You didn't let me.

368
00:32:57,079 --> 00:33:01,799
I thought you knew and did it
so Magda would break up with him.

369
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,519
Now what?

370
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,279
I don't know.

371
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,319
Let's sleep on it.

372
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,960
She had medical issues,
but she was under treatment.

373
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:21,680
I'll ask in Cardiology,
I remember she was taking some pills.

374
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:26,599
Can you check tomorrow?
It's weird if I ask to see the papers.

375
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,720
Sure, I'll ask around.

376
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:33,839
Can you call the morgue too?

377
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:37,200
Yes.

378
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:41,559
May she rest in peace.

379
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,960
May she rest in peace.

380
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,000
Talk to you in the morning.

381
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,480
Sure, thanks.

382
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:24,119
If they pick her up at 11,
they'll be at your place just after 12.

383
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,599
The funeral home guys.

384
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:30,119
- Sure you don't want me to come now?
- Let him rest.

385
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,039
It's all taken care of here.

386
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:37,719
Don't tip the morgue guys,
I took care of it.

387
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,719
- Want a lift?
- Where to?

388
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,519
- Home, aren't you tired?
- No, I...

389
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:46,440
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

390
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,360
Let's go, bro.

391
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,800
Call me when you wake up.
Get some sleep.

392
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,800
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

393
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,800
Get some rest, we'll talk tomorrow.

394
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,000
Let's go.

395
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,039
Will you set your alarm?

396
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:08,440
Yes.

397
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,599
- Can I have a glass of water?
- Sure.

398
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:52,280
Goodnight.

399
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,960
Goodnight.

400
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,559
- Make me some coffee, please.
- How about tea?

401
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:02,960
No, coffee.

402
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:05,079
I thought you might
catch two hours of sleep.

403
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,920
So?

404
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,480
I didn't know she was his mother.

405
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:15,800
I lost my temper a little.

406
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:19,559
But I really don't remember...

407
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,960
Don't.

408
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,679
Don't go there.

409
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,920
I know what you're thinking, but still...

410
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,719
If we argue now and I die later,
in my sleep or something,

411
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,760
you may feel guilty but,
rationally and medically, you're not.

412
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:42,480
- People don't die from an argument.
- How about the other way around?

413
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:46,119
Say you told me harsh words
and I die in my sleep.

414
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:49,039
- Wouldn't you feel guilty?
- No.

415
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:53,000
- Well, I would.
- Me too, I'm just saying.

416
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:58,599
But there's a long way
from an argument to someone dying.

417
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:06,239
Magda!

418
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:12,119
It's not like we can help.
A crowd won't do him any good.

419
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,239
- Do you want to go?
- If she wants me to.

420
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:16,639
Wait.

421
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,960
- Magda, wait!
- What?

422
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:24,320
If you insist, I'll come along.
But it's better this way.

423
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:27,079
Suit yourself. I'll call you later.

424
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,679
- She could have taken the tram home.
- It's a long way, why did she walk?

425
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:09,320
I don't know.
She was on the phone with Iulian.

426
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:14,719
- Prolonged effort didn't help.
- Think of all her troubles!

427
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,760
Can I have the ashtray?

428
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,639
Sit here, I need to go to the hospital.

429
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:21,960
I'll walk you out, then.

430
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,960
- Any more sandwiches?
- In a bit.

431
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:27,320
- Where's dad?
- He'll be here soon.

432
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,239
May she rest in peace.

433
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,639
- I'll talk to you later.
- Sure.

434
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,880
- I need to go, are you alright?
- Yes, thank you.

435
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:41,360
Give me a call if you need anything.

436
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:43,000
See you tomorrow.

437
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,280
- Did word get out?
- Of course it did.

438
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:55,880
- Did you ask at the morgue?
- Yes. Heart attack.

439
00:40:56,719 --> 00:40:58,639
So it was her heart?

440
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,639
You want to know if it was your fault?

441
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:04,559
Medically, it could have
happened any time.

442
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:07,639
Her work, her eating habits,
her sleeping patterns,

443
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:10,840
her age of 60, her genes.

444
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:13,280
But putting all that into context

445
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,559
You understand, right?

446
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:20,119
If you want, you can help
the boy with some money.

447
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:23,920
Everyone at the hospital pitched in.

448
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,719
- Are you staying?
- I need to get Magda.

449
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:30,000
- See you tomorrow.
- Alright.

450
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,280
- Buy a two-litre Fanta.
- Got it.

451
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,440
Maria!

452
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:02,920
Should we get going?

453
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,559
I'll have a smoke first.

454
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:13,880
I couldn't believe it at first.

455
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:19,199
At first I didn't realise it was her.

456
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,280
Put it there.

457
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,880
No one ever stole anything
in our hospital.

458
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,480
I spoke with a priest too.

459
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:34,920
It doesn't matter now.

460
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,119
This is from all of us.
Don't refuse, there's a lot of expenses.

461
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:50,639
Just to get you over this tough time.
The Doctor contributed too.

462
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,840
We'll manage.

463
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,519
Maria, will you tell her to come?

464
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,639
Yes, let me finish this.

465
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,880
Pass me the papers.

466
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:13,400
This is from the funeral home.

467
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:18,199
- Did they get the paperwork done?
- They spoke with Mihai and Iulian.

468
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:21,719
- Can we get some more coffee?
- In a minute.

469
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:25,400
Hello?
This is Cristi, about the funeral.

470
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,400
Did you file the papers at City Hall?

471
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,119
When will they make the payment?

472
00:43:33,639 --> 00:43:34,800
I see.

473
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,679
You'll be talking to Iulian.

474
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,199
The deceased's son.

475
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:44,880
Alright then.

476
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:49,719
I won't be here tomorrow,
but I'll leave the receipt.

477
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:53,360
You'll need it at the cemetery.

478
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:55,559
He was horrible.

479
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:00,000
He was yelling,
threatening to have her fired.

480
00:44:02,119 --> 00:44:05,519
If I hadn't told them
about the necklace...

481
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,039
I don't want you to think it was my fault.

482
00:44:09,639 --> 00:44:12,239
You can ask the other nurses.

483
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,360
When did that happen?

484
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:19,400
They came to the hospital
and asked the girl first.

485
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,280
Were they both there?

486
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:27,039
Yes, your girlfriend and her father,
but only he went into the office.

487
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,719
Then he went berserk.

488
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:36,920
What are you doing here?

489
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,320
Get out!

490
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:41,000
You threatened to have her fired!

491
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,599
- Fucking piece of shit!
- Calm down!

492
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,480
Get the fuck out, you murderer!

493
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,400
- Iulian, what happened?
- You killed her!

494
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,000
Let go!

495
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:53,719
- I'll kill you, fuckers!
- Iulian, enough!

496
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,920
Where's that necklace now, huh?

497
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,360
- Hands off her!
- Get out!

498
00:45:00,519 --> 00:45:02,119
Let go of him!

499
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:04,719
- I hate you!
- I didn't know!

500
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,639
I don't give a fuck!
I hate you!

501
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,559
You threaten people!
You never trust me!

502
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,119
- Stop yelling!
- I'll yell if I want, you animal!

503
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:14,840
Go straight to hell!

504
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,960
Magda didn't know.

505
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,559
That asshole father of hers
didn't know, either?

506
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,000
Maybe the broad who fired her
didn't know, either.

507
00:45:50,679 --> 00:45:55,159
Actually, no one knew.
Your mother fired herself.

508
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:09,079
Why did they come to the wake?

509
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,880
With that doctor leading the parade?

510
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,760
Why does her father want
to pay for the funeral?

511
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:21,039
And how the fuck did a few nurses
put together 10.000 lei?

512
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,320
They want to play you.

513
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:33,719
Geta told me
he threatened to go to the press.

514
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,360
Let's talk to an attorney,
listen to your bro.

515
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:45,360
The one who got me off the hook
with the car trial, we can talk to her.

516
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:58,760
I did not know.

517
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,719
- Is Iulian with you?
- Hi. No, he isn't.

518
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:46,800
Hi. How is he?

519
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:49,840
- See you in Bikers?
- No.

520
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,440
I'll text you.

521
00:47:52,679 --> 00:47:54,559
He's not good.

522
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:58,480
Please tell him I didn't know,
he's not answering my calls!

523
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:00,039
He's really upset.

524
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:02,199
Is he home?
I'm coming with you.

525
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,679
Better wait until after the funeral.

526
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,360
Give him time to clear his head.

527
00:48:10,519 --> 00:48:13,760
- I just want to see him.
- You will, at the cemetery.

528
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,360
The thing is...

529
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:20,960
You have to reach an agreement,
tell your dad.

530
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:25,840
We need to find a way
that's fair to everyone.

531
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:27,960
Sure, we need to talk.

532
00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:30,880
With all that's happened...

533
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:43,639
Pass me your dad's number
so we can talk.

534
00:48:44,119 --> 00:48:46,880
No point in taking this to court.

535
00:48:47,239 --> 00:48:51,280
The main thing is
we need to be by his side.

536
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:56,519
- What court?
- Just give me his number.

537
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:01,599
- We'll be at the funeral.
- Just in case you can't find us.

538
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:04,239
Even if Dad won't be there, I will.

539
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:09,199
Very good, at the cemetery
Iulian can't lose his grip again.

540
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,800
So, the number?

541
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:16,719
0744 52 00...

542
00:49:24,039 --> 00:49:25,519
300, right?

543
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:28,400
I'll take care of it.

544
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,360
- Will you settle things with her?
- Yes, I'll let you know.

545
00:49:32,119 --> 00:49:34,480
Don't let her sucker you.

546
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,400
Don't be a fool.

547
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,280
Iulian!

548
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,599
- Iulian, wait!
- Get lost.

549
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,960
- Magda!
- Leave him alone.

550
00:49:43,039 --> 00:49:46,480
Murderers!
God will make you pay in kind!

551
00:49:47,079 --> 00:49:50,239
- I didn't know!
- I just can't look at you now.

552
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,679
- Do you believe me?
- Yes, just leave me alone!

553
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,400
- I swear I didn't know!
- Leave me alone!

554
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:00,360
- Do you believe me?
- Yes, just let go of that door.

555
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,920
- Are you angry with me?
- Ask your father.

556
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,119
Please, let go of the door.

557
00:50:06,679 --> 00:50:07,679
Please.

558
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,480
- Why did you try to hide it?
- Let's talk in my office.

559
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,840
- Tell me why!
- In my office.

560
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,280
Were you afraid?

561
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:51,280
- You fired her!
- I didn't.

562
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,800
- You sent her home!
- For a few days.

563
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,960
Tell me the truth!

564
00:50:57,039 --> 00:50:59,360
I know you're upset.

565
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:00,880
Tell me!

566
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,119
Her heart attack was unrelated
to what happened.

567
00:51:04,639 --> 00:51:07,119
- Then why didn't you tell me?
- It was a bad time.

568
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:09,039
No, because you were afraid!

569
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:13,119
I'm afraid of very few things
and you're not one of them.

570
00:51:13,199 --> 00:51:18,119
I'm sorry, but with her health issues,
it was a matter of time.

571
00:51:18,199 --> 00:51:20,480
But it happened
right after you fired her!

572
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:22,880
And after she walked in the sun
for four hours.

573
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:27,679
- She had done it before.
- And she got fired before.

574
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:31,599
And I put in a word for her,
so stop it.

575
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:36,119
I just sent her home
for a few days, until things calm down!

576
00:51:36,199 --> 00:51:40,079
- She was very calm!
- Until "things" calm down.

577
00:51:40,679 --> 00:51:44,760
Don't fight me, I'm on your side.
So is Cristi.

578
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:47,039
How much did you put in that envelope?

579
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:48,400
Everyone contributed.

580
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:52,719
Geta said the nurses each gave 50 lei.
How did it get to 10.000?

581
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:57,039
- It doesn't matter.
- It does! It means you had a reason!

582
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:01,039
- Isn't caring about you reason enough?
- About me?

583
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:05,840
Funerals are very expensive.
It's not all tears and feelings.

584
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:09,079
- We'll see about that.
- Iulian!

585
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,679
She's not at his place.

586
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:33,000
I rang, I knocked, there's no one here!

587
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:36,400
How am I supposed to know?

588
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,079
OK, bye.

589
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:48,719
It's not easy, but you can ask
for financial damages.

590
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,400
- I don't want money.
- Stop it!

591
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:55,079
- But I don't!
- That's not the point.

592
00:53:55,159 --> 00:53:58,159
Burn the money if you want,
but they must pay.

593
00:53:58,239 --> 00:54:02,039
- But not with money.
- You have to hit them where it hurts.

594
00:54:02,119 --> 00:54:03,199
Then you can -

595
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:08,360
be Santa Claus to some poor people.

596
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:13,559
It takes a long time and
you don't get the amount you ask for.

597
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:20,000
It depends on the deceased's income
and the degree of trauma.

598
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:24,400
You can get more for moral damages.

599
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,840
He should fucking pay for it!

600
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:29,840
- How long will it be?
- 2-3 hours.

601
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,440
Leave the old tyres in the back.

602
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:39,719
If we file criminal charges,
it goes to a prosecutor.

603
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:44,519
He asks for a counter-expertise
on the cause of death,

604
00:54:45,239 --> 00:54:48,239
to contradict the official expertise.

605
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,760
- Geta can testify.
- Did he threaten her?

606
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,920
- Who, Geta?
- No, his mother.

607
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:56,079
He said if she wasn't fired,

608
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:59,760
he'd tell the media
nurses steal from children.

609
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:02,400
That gets him 3 to 12 months.

610
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:06,320
If we prove direct causation,
it's 3 to 7 years.

611
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,280
Are you fine with that?

612
00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:17,159
Where were you?
Why don't you answer my calls?

613
00:55:21,559 --> 00:55:23,599
I asked you something.

614
00:55:28,119 --> 00:55:32,000
- How is Iulian?
- Fine, he's just buried his mum.

615
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:41,079
- Don't shut the door in my face.
- Leave my room, please.

616
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:43,920
I will, but don't shut
the door in my face.

617
00:55:44,599 --> 00:55:46,559
- Cristi!
- I don't care what -

618
00:55:46,639 --> 00:55:47,800
Cristi!

619
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:50,800
All I want is to know you're alright.

620
00:55:51,239 --> 00:55:53,280
I am, leave me alone.

621
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:57,559
That's why I called you!

622
00:55:57,639 --> 00:56:00,760
- Hello?
- You can at least pick up!

623
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:04,199
He's unavailable, who is this?

624
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,639
Hi, it's me, Maria.

625
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,360
He'll call you back.
Actually, wait.

626
00:56:13,639 --> 00:56:16,679
It's Mihai, Iulian's friend.
Want to talk to him?

627
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,360
Hello? How is he?

628
00:56:27,239 --> 00:56:28,239
I understand.

629
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:32,480
I'm listening.

630
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,639
What do you mean?

631
00:56:40,519 --> 00:56:42,599
Why do we need to meet?

632
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:49,400
I don't know, let me check my schedule.

633
00:56:51,159 --> 00:56:52,719
I'll call you back.

634
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,079
On this number?

635
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:57,760
Right.

636
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,639
Yes, I got it.

637
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:03,719
What?

638
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:07,599
He wants me to meet Iulian's attorney.

639
00:57:22,719 --> 00:57:25,719
I keep telling you, it wasn't like that!

640
00:57:26,239 --> 00:57:29,320
Still, I don't think you should meet him.

641
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:36,119
- People were talking at the funeral.
- I don't care!

642
00:57:36,199 --> 00:57:37,239
Fine.

643
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:42,079
- What were they saying?
- You weren't even there to hear.

644
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:45,079
You'd be feeding the rumours
by meeting that attorney.

645
00:57:45,159 --> 00:57:47,760
I'll strike the iron while it's hot.

646
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:50,639
Sticking my head in the sand
won't solve things.

647
00:57:50,719 --> 00:57:54,679
They have nothing on us
because there is nothing!

648
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:59,480
- Let them take the first step.
- They did, they called an attorney.

649
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:02,920
It doesn't mean we have to react!

650
00:58:03,239 --> 00:58:07,920
I'm sorry, but it looks like
this is more about yourself than them.

651
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,400
You're reliving your own loss.

652
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,800
What are you doing?

653
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,719
Don't call him now.

654
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,440
Wait until you calm down.

655
00:58:20,519 --> 00:58:21,480
Cristi.

656
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:30,000
Hi, are you busy tonight?

657
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,559
How about meeting?

658
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:44,559
As her son,
he can file for a second autopsy.

659
00:58:46,199 --> 00:58:50,920
Rodica had no other close relatives,
not that it would matter in court.

660
00:58:52,119 --> 00:58:53,079
I see.

661
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:57,679
I doubt you do.
Things have degenerated.

662
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,440
It didn't have to be this way,

663
00:59:00,519 --> 00:59:04,679
but with the threats
and the nurses who can testify,

664
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,639
it's getting complicated.

665
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:10,519
People say many things
when they're angry.

666
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:15,119
But I think we can find
a mutually convenient solution.

667
00:59:15,199 --> 00:59:17,639
No point in going to court.

668
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:22,679
We could get more money that way,
but the boy needs help now.

669
00:59:24,039 --> 00:59:27,760
I advise an amiable agreement
with you and the doctor.

670
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:29,400
I see.

671
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:33,920
In whose name are you speaking?

672
00:59:34,519 --> 00:59:36,199
In their name.

673
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:39,639
- Who are "they"?
- Iulian.

674
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:44,800
Let me see your power of attorney.

675
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:50,400
- I'm here to extend a hand.
- You still need a power of attorney.

676
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:55,360
Trust me, courts are nasty.
Damages, legal expenses...

677
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,519
Plus the criminal record.

678
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:01,360
You would get at least 3-4 years.

679
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:05,599
- Easy with the accusations.
- Just stating the facts.

680
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,800
But have it your way.
Threat is a crime too.

681
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:14,239
The sentence is lighter, though.
One year at most.

682
01:00:14,599 --> 01:00:18,679
But with aggravating circumstances,
it can go up to 7 years.

683
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:34,960
Get out right now.

684
01:00:35,039 --> 01:00:36,239
Cristi...

685
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:40,559
- Stop staring and get out!
- Cristi.

686
01:00:41,079 --> 01:00:44,440
- You too.
- Let's calm down and talk.

687
01:00:44,519 --> 01:00:47,320
I say you just get out
and calmly meet in court.

688
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,119
Suit yourselves.

689
01:00:49,199 --> 01:00:51,079
I said get out!

690
01:00:51,159 --> 01:00:54,119
- Hands off, man, or -
- Or what?

691
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:57,599
I'm warning you,
you'll lose on both counts.

692
01:00:57,679 --> 01:00:59,880
- Got it, now scram.
- Cristi, let's...

693
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,239
Out!

694
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:04,400
Boss, you're playing with fire.

695
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:08,079
Say what, you fucking scum?

696
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:10,480
- You might get burned.
- Get the fuck out!

697
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:13,880
- Get out of here!
- This will turn ugly!

698
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:15,119
Cristi, that's enough!

699
01:01:17,199 --> 01:01:19,760
- What did I tell you?
- If they're like that...

700
01:01:20,519 --> 01:01:21,840
Wait a moment!

701
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:25,519
- He's just hot-headed.
- Prison will cool him off!

702
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:28,719
- Give us a minute.
- But he -

703
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,639
Wait in the car, please.

704
01:01:37,079 --> 01:01:40,599
- That was not OK.
- Neither were you.

705
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:45,039
You don't understand your situation.

706
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:48,440
He risks ending up in a very tight spot.

707
01:01:52,719 --> 01:01:57,440
We're willing to end this for 50.000 euro.
Him and the doctor, half-half.

708
01:01:58,159 --> 01:01:59,840
Wouldn't it be easier?

709
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:06,039
She has some rubbish power
of attorney.

710
01:02:06,719 --> 01:02:07,840
Understood.

711
01:02:08,519 --> 01:02:11,360
- Please text me that.
- What are my options?

712
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:14,159
- And practically?
- Thanks, bye.

713
01:02:15,519 --> 01:02:16,519
Right.

714
01:02:17,679 --> 01:02:20,480
Thanks a lot, I'll call you later.

715
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,079
It's possible,

716
01:02:25,159 --> 01:02:29,039
but it would be very hard for them to
prove connection to the cause of death.

717
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:32,960
- So they can prosecute.
- They can ask for a re-examination,

718
01:02:33,559 --> 01:02:36,400
if the forensic expert
and the prosecutor agree.

719
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:39,760
For now, they can only sue for threat.

720
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:47,760
"Threatening a person with a crime
or an act liable to cause them fear"

721
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:54,119
"is punishable by 3 to 12 months
in prison or by a fine."

722
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:56,039
Who cares about a fine?

723
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:59,840
And you didn't threaten her.
They have nothing!

724
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,679
I said I'd go
to the police and the media.

725
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:06,320
- That's not a crime!
- According to you.

726
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,519
I said I'd do that
unless she was fired.

727
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:13,039
At most, you threatened the doctor.
And she's not complaining.

728
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:26,320
It was just
the three of you in the office.

729
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,519
Then how did Iulian find out?

730
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:32,039
Maybe someone in the hospital told him.

731
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:35,760
At the end of the day
it's your word against theirs.

732
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:39,159
And you want to pay them 25.000 euro?

733
01:03:39,679 --> 01:03:42,800
- Wasn't it 50?
- From both, you and the doctor.

734
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:46,360
All that money,
and it wasn't even a real threat.

735
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:55,280
"Determining or facilitating
suicide or acts causing death"

736
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,480
"is punished by 3 to 7 years in prison."

737
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:03,239
If they prove it! You want to give them
money by default?

738
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:48,239
Iulian...

739
01:05:50,719 --> 01:05:51,639
Iulian!

740
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:55,280
Slow down!

741
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,000
Stop!

742
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:03,280
Iulian, stop!

743
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:07,599
Iulian!

744
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:03,360
I see.

745
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:08,400
No, I don't have a problem.

746
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:12,960
A friend of mine wanted to check
on this lawyer, that's why I'm asking...

747
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,239
Right.

748
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:20,440
Thanks a lot.

749
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:23,400
Maybe we'll find some time for a coffee.

750
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:26,199
Ok, bye.

751
01:07:31,559 --> 01:07:38,480
So what if her dad was a prosecutor?
You'll see, things will calm down in time.

752
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:42,199
In a month, they will see it differently.

753
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:45,559
But let's say they file charges now.

754
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,679
Protracted procedures,
no evidence, judicial vacations...

755
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:53,239
Even well-grounded lawsuits take years.

756
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,599
You think this will be done in two days?

757
01:07:56,119 --> 01:08:00,039
You can choose to
give them money in a few months.

758
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:03,039
They'll take any amount, any time.

759
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:07,760
They'll drop the complaint
even for 10.000.

760
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:11,519
Do what you want, I'm not paying.
Let them sue me.

761
01:08:12,719 --> 01:08:15,480
Want anything else
or do we ask for the bill?

762
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:18,479
- I'm in a hurry.
- I got this.

763
01:08:22,159 --> 01:08:23,159
Excuse me!

764
01:08:27,399 --> 01:08:30,920
A cappuccino to go and the bill, please.

765
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,319
You can pay at the bar.

766
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,079
We can pay at the bar.

767
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:47,079
What if you pay him
and he still files charges?

768
01:08:47,159 --> 01:08:50,880
Or you make the settlement
and let the trial go on?

769
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:55,000
I wouldn't be paying him
for his mother's death.

770
01:08:55,079 --> 01:08:58,439
I don't know to what extent
it was my fault.

771
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:00,560
Is it guilt or fear of prison?

772
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:04,079
- I don't feel completely guilty.
- To what extent, then?

773
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,399
This doesn't let me sleep at night.

774
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:11,359
- So it's about you, not the boy.
- It's about him too.

775
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:13,680
And about my peace of mind.

776
01:09:14,239 --> 01:09:15,680
Suit yourself.

777
01:09:18,159 --> 01:09:21,640
I say you should reconsider.
You didn't kill anyone.

778
01:09:22,119 --> 01:09:24,760
We all die, whose fault is that?

779
01:09:28,439 --> 01:09:32,159
- Do you have the boy's number?
- Yes, I'll pass it to you.

780
01:09:32,239 --> 01:09:36,960
You think you understand?
You have someone to go home to!

781
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:41,239
- I lost my mum too.
- You have your father! That murderer!

782
01:09:41,319 --> 01:09:45,359
- I'll leave home, move in with you.
- Spare me, both of you!

783
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:47,920
But you still want money from us!

784
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:51,159
- Who said that?
- Mihai and that attorney!

785
01:09:51,239 --> 01:09:54,439
They came and asked Dad
for money as compensation!

786
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:57,199
I told the attorney I don't want money!

787
01:09:57,279 --> 01:09:59,079
- So you did see her!
- So what?

788
01:09:59,159 --> 01:10:01,920
They asked Dad for money.

789
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,840
Fuck your money!

790
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:06,159
Will money bring my mother back?

791
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,079
Iulian.

792
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,239
Iulian, where are you going?

793
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:14,720
Are you listening? Iulian!

794
01:10:15,239 --> 01:10:17,680
- Wait, talk to me!
- Let go!

795
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,039
Iulian!

796
01:10:24,479 --> 01:10:25,960
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

797
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:10,840
I couldn't answer your call
with my wife there!

798
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:17,560
- Say you'll call back.
- Can I call you back in five?

799
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,000
I'm not at the beach, things come up!

800
01:11:22,079 --> 01:11:24,880
That's why I don't answer your calls!

801
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:26,760
Shit.

802
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:29,239
I need 15.000 euro.

803
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:33,960
- Are you OK?
- Yes, I just need it.

804
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:36,399
I can't, I swear.

805
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,079
You know my money
gets split two ways.

806
01:11:39,159 --> 01:11:40,920
And the company account?

807
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,560
- Today?
- Yes.

808
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:48,399
- What is it for?
- A personal issue.

809
01:11:52,239 --> 01:11:53,479
I don't want to.

810
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:57,159
I have nothing to talk to you about!

811
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:00,720
I understand, I'm still not interested!

812
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,960
This shit is your fault!

813
01:12:04,039 --> 01:12:07,640
- I did it for you.
- Did you even ask?

814
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:11,680
No, I just did my thing.
Sunny side up?

815
01:12:13,359 --> 01:12:15,520
- Ana? Sunny side up?
- Whatever.

816
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,439
Pour us some soda.

817
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:22,880
It's Magda, want to talk to her?

818
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:05,520
I LOVE YOU

819
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:09,239
- Did she let you do her in the ass?
- Fuck off!

820
01:13:09,319 --> 01:13:14,039
You swearing at your bro?
Her dad sent her to get him off the hook!

821
01:13:14,359 --> 01:13:18,920
- No, he wants to meet me!
- To fool you into not asking for money.

822
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,840
- You asked for it, in my name!
- To help you!

823
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:25,720
- Why, am I handicapped?
- No, just a retarded sucker!

824
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:30,319
I love you like my brother,
she loves her daddy best!

825
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:34,119
- Why do you think she came to you?
- To talk, idiot.

826
01:13:34,199 --> 01:13:36,680
To keep her dad out of prison,
that's why!

827
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:41,600
He sent her because
he knows you're an idiot.

828
01:13:42,079 --> 01:13:46,600
She'll fuck you for a month or two
and go back to her daddy.

829
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:48,800
Who will you go back to?

830
01:13:50,439 --> 01:13:54,159
Who, you piece of shit,
after you fought me for that cunt?

831
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:57,319
Won't you come back to me then?

832
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:23,760
I'm sorry.

833
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Good evening.

834
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:27,880
Good eve -

835
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:31,720
- Hello.
- Sorry I'm late.

836
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:34,039
- Don't worry. Coffee?
- No, thank you.

837
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:36,199
- Water?
- I'm fine.

838
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:40,119
I won't keep you.
How do we do this?

839
01:18:40,439 --> 01:18:43,640
With our cards on the table or in court?

840
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:46,960
Aren't you here to discuss things?

841
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:51,199
- Will you take a seat?
- Thank you, I sat enough in the car.

842
01:18:54,039 --> 01:18:58,760
First, sorry for my outburst.
I don't deal well with threats.

843
01:18:59,319 --> 01:19:01,720
Don't worry, you're not the first.

844
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:05,720
Second,
the lawsuit would drag on and on.

845
01:19:06,279 --> 01:19:08,239
And you might not win.

846
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:12,880
Technically, it's possible,
but still a long shot.

847
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:16,119
An amiable settlement
would be best for you.

848
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:18,079
If you say so.

849
01:19:19,239 --> 01:19:21,319
I'll give him the money.

850
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:26,119
But not all of it, and not out of guilt.
To help him.

851
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:30,640
I'm a father, I empathise.
But it wasn't my fault.

852
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:36,000
If you want the full amount,
try in court.

853
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:38,800
It's 15.000 or nothing.

854
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:42,880
Are you sure you don't want to sit down?

855
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:45,000
No, I'm in a hurry.

856
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:50,279
Bring Iulian to this address tomorrow.
It's my company.

857
01:19:51,199 --> 01:19:52,760
He won't talk to me.

858
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:56,840
Come together and I'll explain why
I'm only offering this amount.

859
01:19:57,159 --> 01:19:59,960
I'll talk to him, we'll find a way.

860
01:20:00,039 --> 01:20:04,199
Please do.
I want to do what's right.

861
01:20:04,279 --> 01:20:06,600
What's best for everyone.

862
01:20:09,399 --> 01:20:11,800
- Have a good evening.
- You too.

863
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:41,960
- We did it, bro!
- I told you not to knock like that.

864
01:20:43,359 --> 01:20:46,279
Answer when I call,
don't throw pussy tantrums.

865
01:20:46,359 --> 01:20:47,800
Fucking mask.

866
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:51,199
God sent her to you, mate!

867
01:20:51,279 --> 01:20:55,159
She told her dad you're a sucker
who faints at the sight of cunt

868
01:20:55,239 --> 01:20:57,640
and then he changed his mind!

869
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:58,840
Want to eat?

870
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:05,720
Mrs. Sweet Tits Attorney called.
He's giving you the money.

871
01:21:06,159 --> 01:21:09,039
- 15.000, 5.000, who cares?
- What money?

872
01:21:09,119 --> 01:21:12,000
- Can't turn down 5.000 euro.
- What?

873
01:21:12,079 --> 01:21:15,319
At least it's something.
Do you have a bank account?

874
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:19,079
Or maybe he brings the money
in a fucking shopping bag.

875
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,079
Hey!

876
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:23,520
What got into you?

877
01:21:27,159 --> 01:21:28,239
What?

878
01:21:48,039 --> 01:21:49,800
Please leave me alone.

879
01:22:00,359 --> 01:22:01,399
There, there.

880
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:05,640
It will be alright, you'll see.

881
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:13,600
This will pass too.

882
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:34,279
And you know
what bothers me the most?

883
01:23:38,439 --> 01:23:41,159
What hurts the most, actually.

884
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:45,479
He can't see it.

885
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:51,399
As a father, he's not thinking about
myself or what he's done.

886
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:55,239
It's always someone else's fault.

887
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:03,279
Even with this whole madness,
I don't think he considers himself guilty.

888
01:24:06,119 --> 01:24:07,880
It's not quite like that.

889
01:24:11,439 --> 01:24:13,520
You could say I started it all.

890
01:24:14,479 --> 01:24:18,119
I showed him those photos
of you in the Herastrau Park.

891
01:24:42,399 --> 01:24:46,000
Agent Corbeanu, traffic police.
Your documents, please.

892
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,319
Your insurance?

893
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:04,359
- Do you know why I stopped you?
- No.

894
01:25:04,439 --> 01:25:07,279
- Oh, my seatbelt.
- Why is it off?

895
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:10,880
I'm sorry.

896
01:25:13,119 --> 01:25:15,239
Please wait in the car.

897
01:26:31,199 --> 01:26:33,640
It's fine, I'll give it to him.

898
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:37,640
Not all of it, 15.000.
And not as settlement, just to help.

899
01:26:39,399 --> 01:26:41,319
I just want to do it.

900
01:26:42,439 --> 01:26:47,159
Yes, they'll come to my office,
our legal counsel will be there.

901
01:26:49,399 --> 01:26:53,000
No, this is for him,
the attorney is another matter.

902
01:26:53,079 --> 01:26:57,000
1.000? She wishes!
2-300 at most.

903
01:26:57,479 --> 01:27:00,680
Didn't I tell you it would work out?
Fuck...

904
01:27:02,319 --> 01:27:04,359
You said it would take months.

905
01:27:05,359 --> 01:27:09,359
It's not about money, the main thing
is this is right for everyone.

906
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:11,119
Fair is fair.

907
01:27:12,079 --> 01:27:15,880
Subject closed,
let's talk about something else.

908
01:27:44,199 --> 01:27:46,640
Call an ambulance!

909
01:28:44,479 --> 01:28:48,279
for my father
