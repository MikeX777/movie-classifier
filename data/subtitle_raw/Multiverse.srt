1
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:38,890
(Dramatic music)

2
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:57,909
(Slow-paced music)

3
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:08,253
(Soft compelling music)

4
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:19,491
(Slow suspenseful music)

5
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:54,359
(Electric static crackling)

6
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,032
Loretta: You know about
multiverse theory, right?

7
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,658
Like in science fiction?

8
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:03,868
Comic books?

9
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:06,537
(Ticking)

10
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:10,876
Loretta: Accepting that an infinite
number of universes exist.

11
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:14,629
At least one of them will
be exactly like ours.

12
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:15,713
(Ticking)

13
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:16,941
(Ticking)
Loretta: More than one.

14
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,593
(Ticking)
An endless number of identical worlds!

15
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,596
(Ticking)
Well, almost identical.

16
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,723
(Ticking) There has to be!

17
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,893
(Ticking)
(Echoing) Because infinite is infinite.

18
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,269
(Dramatic beat)

19
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,062
Loretta: Sideways 8.

20
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:33,648
(Echoing) Coolest number of all!

21
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:40,362
(Beeping) Now, contacting
an identical mirror universe,

22
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,365
impossible, right?

23
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:44,658
But if you're stupid
enough to try,

24
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,911
one thing's for sure,

25
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,788
there's another you somewhere

26
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,664
trying the exact
same stupid thing

27
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,751
at the exact same time.

28
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,377
That's teamwork!

29
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:59,132
(Electric static)

30
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,804
(Electricity crackling)

31
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,781
Okay, I installed the
8k chip last night.

32
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:24,991
Oh.

33
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,662
8k installed.

34
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,625
(Machine whirring)

35
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,504
Did you feel that?

36
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:38,839
Well I dunno,

37
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,131
something came through.

38
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,804
We checked the ups
like 100 times.

39
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:48,222
The current's clean.

40
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:49,390
According to science digest,

41
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:50,724
if fish don't eat,

42
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:51,810
they die.

43
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:05,073
(Slow paced music)

44
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,784
What are you doing?

45
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,498
(Whizzing and rumbling)

46
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:20,880
Something's coming through!

47
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,299
Yeah, a goldfish.

48
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,010
Particles, a recurring pattern!

49
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,303
Bullshit!

50
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:27,929
(Amy screams)

51
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,141
The water.

52
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,059
Particles in flux!

53
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,686
Gerry: Now you lost me.

54
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:36,855
Danny: Okay, what's going on?

55
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:42,694
We're trying to reach an
identical universe, right?

56
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,071
So the more particles
that we have to match,

57
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,824
the more perfect the duplicate!

58
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,411
More water.

59
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,038
Bigger fishbowl?

60
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,832
No bigger, way bigger!

61
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:59,586
(Atmospheric music)

62
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,256
Gerry:
Guess I'm designated driver again, huh?

63
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,384
Danny:
Just get in the car and lets go.

64
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:09,512
(Atmospheric music)

65
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,573
I need to see the entire lake.

66
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,659
There's a lookout up ahead.

67
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,701
What a thrilling Saturday night.

68
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,787
Goddamn it's good to be young.

69
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,539
Hurry! We've got a perfect wind.

70
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,416
(Engine accelerating)

71
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,169
(Slow paced music)

72
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,213
Danny: Dude, slow down!

73
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,005
Come on, you gotta burn some gas

74
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,924
to break through time and space.

75
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,636
(Machine softly beeping)

76
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,471
Loretta: I'm getting flares!

77
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,932
Ah, must be love.

78
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:02,564
Gerry: You guys do realize

79
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:05,110
that the whole multiverse
thing is just an idea, right?

80
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,402
It's a probability.

81
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:07,987
It's a mathematical certainty.

82
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,239
Gerry: It's a mind game.

83
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,993
(Machine softly beeping)

84
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,537
Holy crap!
Did you guys see that?

85
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:18,206
- Yeah!
- Wow!

86
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,335
(Car accelerating)

87
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:23,378
Too fast!

88
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:24,295
Sorry Amy!

89
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:26,214
You can't slow down
the wheels of progress!

90
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:32,512
(Engine accelerating)

91
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,473
(Tires screeching)

92
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,976
Jesus! (Tires screeching)

93
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,687
(Smashing)

94
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:47,652
Holy shit!

95
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:49,571
You almost got us
fucking killed!

96
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,616
Hope they're okay.

97
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,124
(Car revving)

98
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,252
(Car revving) (Ominous music)

99
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,671
Loretta stay back,
we're calling the police!

100
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:11,759
(Car revving) (Ominous music)

101
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,094
(Muffled screaming)

102
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,309
(People screaming)

103
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:23,812
Don't get too close!

104
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,440
Hey, don't! It's not safe!

105
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,234
(Car revving)
(Muffled panicked talking)

106
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:30,820
Loretta stay back!

107
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:34,949
No, it's-

108
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,995
(car revving) (Metal groaning)

109
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,498
(Muffled panicked talking)

110
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:50,006
(Car revving)

111
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,842
(Metal creaking) (Ominous music)

112
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,552
(Loretta screams)

113
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:55,970
Danny: Loretta!

114
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:56,763
(Glass shattering)
(Trees cracking)

115
00:09:56,764 --> 00:09:59,598
(Horn honking) (Car exploding)

116
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,560
Loretta!

117
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:05,772
(Danny screaming) (Sombre music)

118
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:10,151
(Danny sobbing)
(Explosions booming)

119
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:15,782
(Sombre music)

120
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:18,243
(Clocks ticking) (Rushing winds)

121
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,208
Gerry: All right, you ready?

122
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,792
You tell me?

123
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,086
Let's do this.

124
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:31,673
(Machine softly beeping)

125
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,052
Gerry: This is awesome.

126
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,012
Danny: Give me a break.

127
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:40,097
Gerry: I've got a complete
emotional response set here.

128
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,348
We got excitement, sadness,

129
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,016
boredom, libido, the whole deal.

130
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:46,354
I mean, it's like a little
window into your brain.

131
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,314
I didn't know you found
grilled cheese so erotic.

132
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,024
(Danny scoffs)

133
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:50,817
Hey man, who doesn't?

134
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:52,193
Hey, stay focused.

135
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,281
Danny: What the fuck dude?

136
00:10:56,282 --> 00:10:58,449
I'm sorry, sorry.
I needed that for calibration.

137
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,702
- Hey, don't touch him.
- No, no, no.

138
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,121
(Machine softly beeping)

139
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,417
(Machine beats rapidly)

140
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,252
Danny:
Fuck you dude! I'm done with this shit!

141
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:11,253
Hey, we agreed to this!

142
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:12,797
Full emotional spectrum!

143
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,507
We talked about this!

144
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,552
Listen, I know we agreed,

145
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:19,636
I just can't.

146
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:24,684
I'm late.
(Door creaks open and shut)

147
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,146
Amy's phone: That was not cool.

148
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,355
You don't think he
thinks about it?

149
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,649
Like every day?

150
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,403
Amy's phone: He's trying not to.

151
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,406
He says he's fine.

152
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,287
Interesting. (Machine pulsating)

153
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,207
That exact moment
when you touched him?

154
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:48,958
Look.

155
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:52,003
(Machine pulsating)

156
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,842
Are you two like-

157
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,385
a thing?

158
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,471
Seriously?

159
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:03,723
For how long?

160
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,228
Amy's phone:
I don't know what we are.

161
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:10,271
Just so you know,

162
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:11,898
it's okay.

163
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,276
I mean, he's a really nice
guy and you're awesome.

164
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,570
And there's nothing that
says losing a girlfriend

165
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,530
or a best friend means
you have to spend

166
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,283
the rest of your life miserable.

167
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,244
And you're total geeks.

168
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,871
Who's gonna want ya anyway?

169
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:37,707
(Thunder rumbling)
(People chattering)

170
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:51,228
(Ominous music)

171
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:52,563
Loretta?

172
00:12:54,607 --> 00:13:01,781
(Ominous music)

173
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:17,672
Loretta?

174
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:21,758
Sorry.

175
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:27,223
(Ominous music)

176
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:38,901
(Tense music)

177
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,320
Loretta!

178
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:50,830
(Melancholy music)

179
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:09,640
(Scooter whirring)

180
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:18,316
(Soft ethereal music)

181
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,233
(Pool balls clanking)

182
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,401
Gerry: I'm so bored.

183
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,945
We used to go way out there.

184
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,490
I mean, quantum entanglement
for Christ's sake.

185
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:14,909
Yeah, I think we all
remember those days.

186
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,243
We were pushing the envelope.

187
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:17,828
Why the fuck did we stop?

188
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:19,746
I think it has something to do

189
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,541
with the fact that
my girlfriend died.

190
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,506
Look,

191
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,425
that was her thing, okay?

192
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,511
Massive particle observation.

193
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:37,515
It was her idea and
her experiment.

194
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,476
Now she's gone.

195
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,520
We're doing something else.

196
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:43,854
It's that simple.

197
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,442
What?

198
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:01,580
How about we just go back and
we look at Loretta's notes

199
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:02,789
and we just run with her ideas.

200
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,374
It's what she would've wanted.

201
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,917
I'm not going there again.

202
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,752
Gerry: But we just take it slow!

203
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:08,878
I mean, there's so
much work being done

204
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,965
on the math side of things
that would completely-

205
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:16,136
um, sorry, it's just-

206
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:18,764
this girl, she just looked
exactly like Loretta.

207
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,518
- Over there?
- Well she just left.

208
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,729
Danny!

209
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,572
I just said that she
looked like her, I didn't-

210
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:08,554
Danny: You didn't have to stay
'til the end of my shift.

211
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,401
Thanks.

212
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,070
I would have been okay.

213
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,704
What about your mom?

214
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:26,916
But what if we wake her?

215
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:34,464
Right.

216
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:43,766
Danny!

217
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,578
I know.

218
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,130
Or maybe it was.

219
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,717
Or maybe it wasn't.

220
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,344
It doesn't matter now anyway.

221
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:26,559
I don't know.

222
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,310
(Soft ambient music)

223
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,812
Danny: I saw this girl today.

224
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:33,399
Looked exactly like her.

225
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:36,360
And then Gerry saw her.

226
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:46,996
I know.

227
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:48,538
I know.

228
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,459
It's just a weird day.

229
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,252
I'm sorry.

230
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,722
No, of course not.

231
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,016
Where did that come from?

232
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,395
No, I like you the
way that you are.

233
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,857
I mean, you wouldn't be you.

234
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:18,986
Danny: I don't know.

235
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:21,530
But you'd be different.

236
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,992
And I like the you that you are.

237
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:29,246
(Soft ambient music)

238
00:21:56,273 --> 00:22:00,026
(Water bubbling) (Tense music)

239
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:03,988
(Muffled screaming)

240
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,199
(Amy gasps)

241
00:22:53,622 --> 00:23:00,671
(Phone ringing and buzzing)

242
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:07,719
Hello?

243
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,555
Loretta: Hey Gerry, it's lor.

244
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:10,472
Is Danny with you?

245
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:11,640
I can't find him.

246
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:14,101
Who is this?

247
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,101
Loretta: Loretta.

248
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,145
Listen, I'm worried,

249
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:17,563
he didn't come home last night.

250
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,398
Is Amy with you?

251
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:21,649
No, she's not.

252
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,152
And this isn't funny,
by the way.

253
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:23,944
Loretta: Okay, I'm late.

254
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:25,445
I'll try to catch
him after class.

255
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:26,697
See ya later.

256
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,076
(School bell rings)
(People chattering)

257
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:35,205
P.A. announcement: Attention students
enrolled in astrophysics 202,

258
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,750
today's 2:30 pm.
Lecture's been relocated.

259
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,627
(Student chatter)

260
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,962
P.A. announcement:
Once again, astrophysics 202

261
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,964
has been relocated to
the de! Mar auditorium

262
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:48,594
at it's regular time,
2:30 pm, thank you.

263
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:52,973
Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

264
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,937
No, honestly, I feel
really good about it.

265
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,897
I don't know why I
was being so stupid.

266
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:16,955
(Suspenseful music)

267
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:17,748
(Amy gasps)

268
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:18,540
Holy fuck!

269
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:19,541
(Amy gasps)

270
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:24,921
(Suspenseful music)

271
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:28,300
I never, ever thought that
I'd have to worry about you!

272
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,135
What, you don't have
anything to say?

273
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,389
Not a goddamn fucking word?

274
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:36,642
(Suspenseful music)

275
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,560
What about you?

276
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,522
Say something!

277
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,483
What do you mean, dead?

278
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,318
Like dead dead.

279
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:48,821
Like gone from this world dead.

280
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:53,492
What's funny about this?

281
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:56,745
So you don't
remember that night?

282
00:24:57,538 --> 00:24:58,538
At the lookout?

283
00:24:58,539 --> 00:24:59,872
Stop it! Yes, I
remember that night.

284
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,792
It was the scariest
night of my life.

285
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:04,044
But I sure as shit didn't die!

286
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:05,128
Slow down.

287
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:08,881
So then where the hell have
you been the last five months?

288
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:13,470
Why are you all
fucking with my head!

289
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:18,642
I see you guys, like, every day!

290
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:28,317
So you're not saying that
you wandered off somewhere

291
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:31,113
or had amnesia or started
a new life, no, no.

292
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:33,781
What you're saying

293
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,492
is that nothing has changed?

294
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:39,454
Everything is normal and
you've been coming to school

295
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:42,416
and hanging out with us,
just like before?

296
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:46,587
Why are you doing this?

297
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,301
And why won't you talk to me?

298
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,513
Why are you signing?

299
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,852
You're supposed to
be my best friend.

300
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,062
Danny: Loretta, you know she
can't understand you

301
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,355
unless you face her.

302
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:07,274
What?

303
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:08,941
That's just stupid!

304
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,235
Stop it!

305
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,615
(Tense music)

306
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,289
(Suspenseful music)

307
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,541
Oh fuck.

308
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,628
It worked!

309
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,255
(Echoing) Accepting

310
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:33,342
that an infinite number
of universes exist,

311
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,093
at least one of them

312
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,970
will be exactly like ours.

313
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,640
Because infinite is infinite.

314
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:41,934
Side ways eight.

315
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:43,852
Coolest number of all.

316
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:45,686
So let me get this straight.

317
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,856
You think you got sucked
out of a parallel universe,

318
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:49,733
into ours?

319
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:50,609
Oh, is that so impossible?

320
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,402
Gerry:
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it is!

321
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,530
Look, the machine was programmed

322
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:56,907
to look for the closest match.

323
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:58,699
That's why we brought
the gear to the lake,

324
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,994
to observe as much
water in a single view.

325
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,538
The maximum identical
particles observable.

326
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:05,748
Observe a particle,
affect its twin!

327
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:06,917
Entanglement.

328
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,544
Spooky action at a distance.

329
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:10,087
Loretta: Right!

330
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:11,963
And the whole point was to find

331
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:14,174
asidenficala match as possible.

332
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,718
So yeah, I'm part of that match.

333
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,969
And so are all of you.

334
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,597
Or versions of you, on my side.

335
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:21,807
Twins.

336
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:22,516
Affected!

337
00:27:22,517 --> 00:27:24,725
We were just screwing around!

338
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,018
It was never supposed to work!

339
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,270
I was barely paying
attention half the time!

340
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:28,563
We were bored and fearless!

341
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,565
It was still ridiculous!

342
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:32,776
But what if we stayed
bored and fearless.

343
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,318
What if we kept trying?

344
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,571
Danny: But we didn't.

345
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:36,946
We quit.

346
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:39,323
You didn't, but we did!

347
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:42,702
On my side, in my universe,
where I didn't die!

348
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:44,287
We kept trying!

349
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:45,581
All of us!

350
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,040
We got better chips,
higher resolution,

351
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,458
more observed
particle collisions,

352
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:50,752
higher match rate.

353
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:55,924
Assuming that there's a transfer
of energy in spooky action,

354
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,720
what if the observer can get
sucked along for the ride?

355
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,473
Arthur, poor little guy,

356
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:05,850
was just swimming
in the crosshairs,

357
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:08,060
and then suddenly,
poof, he's gone!

358
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,980
And you guys got a new fish!

359
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:11,814
Thank you for that!

360
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,149
Loretta:
I didn't know what had happened,

361
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,401
so I just kept repeating
the same steps all night

362
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:16,737
and nothing worked.

363
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,488
But I crossed over!

364
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,489
And I didn't even know it.

365
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,992
I didn't even feel it.

366
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,451
I just walked away
from the machine,

367
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:24,785
I thought maybe I'd broken it.

368
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,622
But I was already here!

369
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:29,332
This is fucking crazy!

370
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,541
Loretta:
If I'm supposed to be dead,

371
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,710
than what's crazier
than me being here?

372
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,046
Alive!

373
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,430
What's she saying?

374
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,849
She's saying that multiple
universes are science fiction

375
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,852
and that you're a lunatic.

376
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,813
(Whispers) Sorry.

377
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:57,778
Loretta: There's also this.

378
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,197
What's that about?

379
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,323
Loretta:
Six weeks ago, Saturday night,

380
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:03,492
got this inked.

381
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:04,951
Danny: Why?

382
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:06,535
I was drunk, we all were.

383
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,330
We all got the same tattoo.

384
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,168
Amy's phone: No we didn't.

385
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:17,339
Okay, you didn't, but we did.

386
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:22,927
Or I'm just crazy and
I've been walking around

387
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,846
in a dream for the
last five months.

388
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:34,564
(Suspenseful music)

389
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:38,610
(Ominous music)

390
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,002
Look Amy,

391
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:57,629
I'm gonna drive her home.

392
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,965
And I'm gonna go
back to my room.

393
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,217
I'm sorry.

394
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,927
I'm just kind of
messed up right now.

395
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,473
Maybe.

396
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:11,601
But she's here.

397
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,229
And that's real.

398
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,398
(Amy gasps)

399
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:22,863
(Solemn music)

400
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,239
Danny: So where do you live?

401
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:26,081
I guess you don't really
have a place anymore.

402
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:28,993
Yeah.

403
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:31,246
That kinda crossed my mind.

404
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,750
Well where did you
stay last night?

405
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,209
Your place.

406
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:42,674
I waited for you all
night in your room.

407
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:44,760
You never came home.

408
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,595
Your number didn't work.

409
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:48,847
It was a pretty shitty night.

410
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:53,894
Yeah, I changed my
number three months ago.

411
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:02,693
Look”.

412
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,907
I'm sorry, but us being
in your car together,

413
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,866
maybe it's weird for you,

414
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,160
you know, probably fucking
with your head big time.

415
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:15,415
But for me, it's totally normal.

416
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,294
It's what we've been
doing since high school.

417
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:24,883
I kept going with this
for the last five months.

418
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:27,302
With you.

419
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,849
So you need a place to stay?

420
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:39,397
Fine.

421
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,317
But I'm sleeping on
the floor, okay?

422
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,029
Okay.

423
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:48,489
Deal.

424
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:52,828
(Balls clanging)

425
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:57,958
You think she's right?

426
00:31:58,917 --> 00:31:59,917
Danny: Who?

427
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,173
I mean, it's possible, right?

428
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:08,301
That I got hit on the head.

429
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,763
Wandered around in
some crazy dream.

430
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:15,350
Got a tattoo and then
somehow drifted back home.

431
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,771
Am I crazy?

432
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,066
Did I just go crazy?

433
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,237
You're one of the
sanest people I know.

434
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:37,288
Well, I'm either insane or
something insane has happened.

435
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:39,583
Some nice set of choices.

436
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,418
Well, whatever it is
that's happening,

437
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:43,836
it's exhausting.

438
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:45,463
I can barely stand up.

439
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,381
We can share the bed.

440
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,925
It doesn't have to be-

441
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,428
I guess that's not a great idea.

442
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:54,346
Danny: Yeah, I think it
falls pretty squarely

443
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,016
in the bad-idea column.

444
00:32:57,184 --> 00:32:59,978
Sorry, yesterday it
fell in the normal column.

445
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,520
Here.

446
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:02,939
Thanks.

447
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,072
You and Amy-

448
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:13,492
can I ask?

449
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:15,827
Danny: Can you ask tomorrow?

450
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,080
Okay.

451
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:31,343
(Low ominous music)

452
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,855
(Gerry screams)

453
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:50,402
(Low ominous music)

454
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,446
(Amy gasps)

455
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:53,822
(Low ominous music)

456
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:56,033
(Danny grunts)

457
00:33:56,034 --> 00:34:04,034
(Deafening people shouting,
static noise and buzzing)

458
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:11,675
(Amy screams)

459
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:15,302
(Loud humming)

460
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:18,305
(Deafening people shouting,
static noise and buzzing)

461
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,307
(Loud humming)

462
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:21,226
(Amy screaming)

463
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:26,147
(Loud humming)

464
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,404
(Gasping)

465
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:35,031
(Gasping)

466
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:41,997
(Gasping)

467
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,930
What the fuck?

468
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:02,976
(Tense music)

469
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:11,483
(Dramatic beat)

470
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:16,990
(Scooter chugging)

471
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:31,171
Danny: Hi Amy.

472
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:35,591
She's getting coffee.

473
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:36,843
She's coming down now.

474
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,182
No, I just drove her in,
that's it.

475
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,099
(Amy gasps)

476
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,768
Danny: Amy come on.

477
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,985
Either of you two
here last night?

478
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,156
Gerry: Well somebody was.

479
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,282
I mean, look around.

480
00:35:59,283 --> 00:36:01,910
Things have been moved,
drawers opened.

481
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:04,537
I don't understand, who-

482
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:05,872
who else has keys?

483
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,247
Gerry: Nobody.

484
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:08,874
We changed the locks, remember?

485
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,293
That was ages ago.

486
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,420
Loretta?

487
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,006
No, it wasn't Loretta.

488
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:17,801
Amy's phone: How do you know?

489
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:20,720
Gerry: It's weird man.

490
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,846
I mean, nobody cares
what's in our notebooks

491
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,515
and logs and shit.

492
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,643
I mean, I don't even think
anybody took anything.

493
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:31,481
They murdered one
of our fish though.

494
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:41,824
Well is it Arthur or the, um-

495
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:43,243
the other Arthur?

496
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,494
Danny: I don't know.

497
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,330
(Loretta gasps)

498
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,331
Oh shit!

499
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:50,875
Danny: What's wrong?

500
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:52,335
Arthur's dead!

501
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,422
So, it's just a fish.

502
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:58,258
The fish that crossed over.

503
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:00,135
Like me!

504
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,762
So what does that tell you?

505
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:09,060
(Emotive music)

506
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,702
(Horn honking)

507
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,348
(Door creaking)

508
00:37:58,818 --> 00:37:59,818
Hello?

509
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:04,240
Is anybody here?

510
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:19,839
(Thudding)

511
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:30,433
(Ominous music)

512
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,858
Shit!

513
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,737
(Eerie music)

514
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:44,739
Fuck!

515
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:53,331
(Metal clanging)
(Footsteps running)

516
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:56,876
(Engine revving)

517
00:38:57,293 --> 00:39:03,007
(Tires screeching)
(Engine accelerating)

518
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:34,914
(Suspenseful music)

519
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,795
(Tense music)

520
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:45,717
(Train whistle blowing)

521
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:50,471
(Eerie music)

522
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:06,779
(Phone ringing)

523
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,239
Voicemail:
You've reached the Vance house,

524
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,574
I can't take your call right now

525
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:12,075
so please leave a message.

526
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,202
(Phone beeps)

527
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:19,459
(Gasping breaths)

528
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:21,961
Mother: Hello?

529
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:23,421
Hello?

530
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:25,213
Who is this?

531
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,467
How do you have my
daughter's phone?

532
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,176
Father: What is it?

533
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:31,553
Mother:
It's somebody with Loretta's number.

534
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:32,639
Father: Who?

535
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:35,308
Mother:
They won't talk but I hear breathing.

536
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:37,435
I can hear you there!

537
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:39,144
How did you get this number?

538
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,229
What do you want?

539
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:42,065
Father: Give me the phone.

540
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,398
Hey, whoever this is,

541
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,566
if you call this number again,

542
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:45,526
we 'il call the police!

543
00:40:45,527 --> 00:40:46,653
You understand?

544
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:48,779
You can hear me, right?

545
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,781
You get it?

546
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:50,989
Hello-

547
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:12,587
(Loud heart beating)
(High pitched ringing)

548
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:21,270
I'd like to talk.

549
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:30,028
In case you're wondering,

550
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,614
I got a motel room.

551
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:37,829
Danny lent me some money
so I can, you know,

552
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:40,790
figure out how to
be a person again.

553
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:45,419
Look,

554
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:51,342
this kind of thing
isn't exactly normal.

555
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:56,472
You know, it's-it's hard to
tell what's right or wrong.

556
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:02,061
But I really care about Danny

557
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:07,650
and I really care about you.

558
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:10,278
And Danny,

559
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:15,575
he's completely
fucked up right now.

560
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:22,414
So I think that we should
give him some space

561
00:42:22,415 --> 00:42:24,291
and be friends.

562
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:25,543
Three ways.

563
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,258
I know.

564
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,802
Big speech.

565
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:36,471
Pretty dramatic.

566
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:39,806
Sorry about that.

567
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:46,689
Amy's phone:
You are very Loretta.

568
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:50,902
I've always thought so.

569
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:57,533
(Slow gentle music)

570
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:07,335
(Ominous music)

571
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:13,256
Danny: You gonna tell me
what we're doing?

572
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,425
Gerry: Where's the
mystery in that?

573
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,261
Danny: I've had enough
mystery, dude.

574
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:22,600
(Door creaking) (Water dripping)

575
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,050
Danny: When did you get the keys
to this pleasure suite?

576
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,104
Gerry: Well my dad thought
it would build character

577
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:29,023
if I got an on-campus job.

578
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,025
Apprentice janitor.

579
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,193
How long did that last,

580
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:34,486
like 10 minutes?

581
00:43:34,487 --> 00:43:35,613
About seven.

582
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:39,367
But it did give me access
to these on-campus perks.

583
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:43,371
This is where I come to think.

584
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:46,791
Danny: Since when.

585
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:49,043
Gerry: Since I copied the key.

586
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:52,505
So what am I doing here?

587
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:56,008
Gerry:
What, don't you like to think?

588
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:08,228
Ugh.

589
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:10,814
Dude, what is this?

590
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:12,108
Gerry: Thinking juice.

591
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,193
The expensive kind.

592
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:19,115
Do you believe in the contagion
of mass hallucination?

593
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:22,784
Meaning?

594
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:25,120
A group of people who think
they saw something impossible,

595
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:27,497
but they actually saw
the exact same thing?

596
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:28,498
You're talking about Loretta?

597
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,543
Gerry: Danny, what else would
we be talking about?

598
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:33,462
I mean, she's kinda the hot
topic of the month, right?

599
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:36,591
Well, I don't think
Loretta's a mass hallucination.

600
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:39,385
Good, because she isn't.

601
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:42,429
Now, do you believe
that she got sucked

602
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:44,765
out of an alternate
universe into this one?

603
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,976
Or do you believe that she
disappeared for five months

604
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:49,562
and went fucking insane?

605
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:52,690
No, Loretta is not
the gone-insane type.

606
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,734
So then you trust her?

607
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:58,404
Yeah, I guess do.

608
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,156
And you trust me too, right?

609
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,700
Danny: Most of the time.

610
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:07,580
You're gonna want another hit.

611
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:11,209
(Flask clanging)

612
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:15,128
You've been dropping a
lot of things lately?

613
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:16,254
Danny: Maybe a little.

614
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:17,632
Muscular weakness?

615
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,635
I don't know, why?

616
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:24,180
Well you saw what happened
to the other fish, right?

617
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:27,892
Yeah, but that's a
delicate creature, dude.

618
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:31,770
Just because crossing
over killed a fish,

619
00:45:31,771 --> 00:45:34,065
doesn't necessarily
mean Loretta's at risk.

620
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:38,069
But what makes you so sure that
it was the new fish that died?

621
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:45,326
I guess I'm not.

622
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:50,873
Let me show you something.

623
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:00,591
Danny: Wait, are you-

624
00:46:00,592 --> 00:46:02,009
Gerry: You were with me.

625
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:04,971
We read through Loretta's logs,

626
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:06,514
pressed all the buttons

627
00:46:06,515 --> 00:46:08,015
and then all of a sudden-

628
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:09,766
poof.

629
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:11,435
Here we are!

630
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,980
We didn't even feel it happen.

631
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:17,357
I blinked and we were
here in this world,

632
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:19,735
in this identical world

633
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:22,989
where there are two
versions of each of us.

634
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,489
There's another one of me

635
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:26,242
and there is another one of you.

636
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:30,329
Well not exactly like you.

637
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:32,415
(Ominous music)

638
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,249
Dude, I think I'm drunk.

639
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:35,292
Gerry: Whatever Loretta did,

640
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:38,129
she opened up some
kind of tunnel.

641
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:40,172
Except it's only one-way.

642
00:46:40,673 --> 00:46:42,924
See, there's no working
machine on this side

643
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:44,176
to bring us back.

644
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,844
So you're stuck here?

645
00:46:45,845 --> 00:46:47,096
Gerry: It gets worse.

646
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,723
See, this is what
I've figured out,

647
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:52,434
a universe can't sustain
two identical versions

648
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:53,810
of the same mass.

649
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:58,566
It defies like a million
different physical laws.

650
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,694
That's why you've been
feeling like shit.

651
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:05,072
That's why the other fish died.

652
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,035
It doesn't matter
which version fails,

653
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,955
but one version of each
version has to go.

654
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:16,625
Call it a correction.

655
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:20,504
But it's how space,
time heals itself.

656
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,715
Except Loretta, she
doesn't have that problem

657
00:47:23,716 --> 00:47:25,426
because her version
already died.

658
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:28,304
(Heavy breathing)
(Ominous music)

659
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:29,722
Gerry: Now,

660
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:33,351
I want you to know,

661
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:36,437
that despite how you're
feeling right now,

662
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,190
and despite how
you're about to feel,

663
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:41,817
everything's gonna be fine.

664
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:45,946
Whatever happens,

665
00:47:45,947 --> 00:47:48,157
there's still gonna be
a Danny in this world.

666
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:50,826
And he's my friend.

667
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,330
And he's gonna be all right.

668
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,541
(Ominous music)

669
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:11,806
(Danny gagging)

670
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:14,683
(Ominous music)

671
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:31,784
A correction.

672
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:35,079
For my friend Danny.

673
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:41,961
(Electricity buzzing)

674
00:48:43,546 --> 00:48:47,133
(Ominous music)

675
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,247
(Egg cracking)

676
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:29,175
(Ominous music)

677
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,405
Gerry:
You've got fingerprints, DNA.

678
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,324
I mean, they have to give
you your identity back.

679
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:55,617
What other choice do they have?

680
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:58,036
How am I supposed to
explain the last five months?

681
00:49:58,037 --> 00:49:59,746
It doesn't matter
how you explain it.

682
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:01,499
You're here, you're alive.

683
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,333
How do I know that my
DNA is even the same?

684
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:04,584
Loretta, look at you!

685
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:06,128
Exactly the same.

686
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:07,838
I mean, we don't know.

687
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:11,342
(Electricity buzzing)
Gerry: Alright, we test it.

688
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:12,717
I mean we've got
your old notebooks.

689
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:13,968
They have to have a hair,

690
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,428
a fleck of skin
in there somewhere.

691
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,806
I mean, you can't be
homeless forever.

692
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:19,350
What's wrong with homeless?

693
00:50:19,517 --> 00:50:20,351
You hate your home.

694
00:50:20,352 --> 00:50:22,228
Yeah, but I do like
creature comforts.

695
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,110
Danny:
You look like shit by the way.

696
00:50:30,653 --> 00:50:31,653
Gerry: Thanks.

697
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,863
And you look great,
what's that all about?

698
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:34,864
Gerry: I don't know.

699
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:38,369
You know, I was kinda feeling
shitty there for a while.

700
00:50:38,911 --> 00:50:40,829
But now I feel fantastic!

701
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:42,998
So yeah.

702
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:45,834
Hey Danny, we need to talk?

703
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:48,337
- Sure.
- Alone.

704
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:50,463
What are you,
my guidance counsellor?

705
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:51,840
Loretta: That's okay, i-

706
00:50:51,966 --> 00:50:54,218
need to go find some
cheap new clothes.

707
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:06,272
What?

708
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:09,482
You need to speak to Amy,

709
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,902
and you need to speak
very nicely to Amy.

710
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:13,861
Why do I need to speak to Amy?

711
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:15,030
Gerry: Why do you think?

712
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:16,782
Well I don't know,

713
00:51:16,783 --> 00:51:18,284
why don't you tell
me what you think.

714
00:51:18,534 --> 00:51:20,202
Well come on, man, you and her-

715
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:24,831
you have every right to get
back together with Loretta,

716
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:26,709
but can you at least
be cool about it?

717
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,086
Amy?

718
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,046
Gerry:
Dude, what is wrong with you?

719
00:51:31,047 --> 00:51:32,505
For the last five months
you've been a wreck.

720
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:34,382
What are you now,
playing the field?

721
00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:35,301
What are you talking about?

722
00:51:35,302 --> 00:51:37,761
Like, dude, you're being
a real asshole right now.

723
00:51:39,722 --> 00:51:42,224
I certainly won't question
an expert in the field then.

724
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:55,029
Gerry: So!

725
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:56,113
Holy fuck!

726
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:57,740
Feel pretty good?

727
00:51:57,990 --> 00:51:59,033
Pretty strong?

728
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:01,076
How the fuck did
you just do that?

729
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:05,455
Oh, you don't know yet, do you?

730
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:07,576
No dude, I don't know why
you're being so weird today.

731
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:21,639
Remember, all we have in
this world is each other.

732
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,684
You better tell me exactly
what the fuck is going on

733
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,437
before I kick your
ass out of my car.

734
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:31,398
I think you'd better
fasten your seat belt, pal.

735
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:21,382
Are you insane?

736
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:22,843
Gerry: Regarding which part?

737
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:24,845
All of it!

738
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:27,472
You just left the
other me in there!

739
00:54:27,473 --> 00:54:29,599
What, do you think that's
a fucking magic trick?

740
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,518
Danny:
So you expect me to believe

741
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:35,189
that somehow Amy is not our Amy?

742
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:38,567
And, and that Loretta died!

743
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:40,610
Except not our Loretta?

744
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:42,738
Danny, look at this.

745
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:47,408
Okay, I know you felt that too.

746
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:48,618
The weakness, the shakiness.

747
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:50,329
Like something was very wrong.

748
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,121
Dude, I feel fine.

749
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,416
That's because I did that!

750
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:57,460
I made you unique in this world.

751
00:54:57,461 --> 00:55:00,214
That's one major solid I
did for you, my friend!

752
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:02,883
What is this about?

753
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:06,178
Now it's your turn.

754
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:08,222
I've done my part!

755
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:12,768
I need you to take
the other me out.

756
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:17,940
Okay, firstly, you have
lost your fucking mind!

757
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:22,152
And secondly, I am
not killing anyone!

758
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:23,986
Especially not you.

759
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:24,987
He's not me, I'm me.

760
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:26,405
Danny: He's exactly you, dude!

761
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:28,367
I just fucking spoke with him!

762
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:33,789
It's the same Gerry I've
known my whole life!

763
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:36,917
You know what?

764
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:39,460
He was more real than
you are right now.

765
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:40,837
None of this is real!

766
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:42,506
Don't you fucking get it?

767
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,298
We are the real us!

768
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:46,259
This is not the fork in
the road we didn't take!

769
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:47,594
This is our fork now!

770
00:55:48,262 --> 00:55:50,514
So why don't you just
go and kill you?

771
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:54,892
I tried.

772
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:57,896
Believe me, I really did.

773
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,230
(Tense music)

774
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:00,566
(Thudding)

775
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:04,360
(Eerie music)

776
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:18,959
Fuck!

777
00:56:19,668 --> 00:56:21,461
Killing you was way easier

778
00:56:26,842 --> 00:56:28,510
Are you off your meds, dude?

779
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:35,017
Danny, guess what?

780
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,769
That Gerry in there,

781
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:42,357
apparently he doesn't
take any meds.

782
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:46,695
So now, I need you to help me.

783
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:49,823
Come on man, you owe me.

784
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:53,534
I'm not gonna hurt anyone.

785
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:54,328
(Gerry chuckles)

786
00:56:54,329 --> 00:56:56,370
There can't be two of any of us!

787
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:58,497
Conservation of mass
or energy, who knows?

788
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:01,335
But the side effect is
rapid neurological atrophy.

789
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:05,714
That story only ends one way.

790
00:57:08,884 --> 00:57:10,718
I'm not gonna kill you Gerry,
I'm sorry.

791
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:11,595
No I'm not-

792
00:57:11,596 --> 00:57:13,679
I'm not asking you to kill me.

793
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,766
I'm asking you to
fucking save me!

794
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,280
There's still gonna be
a Gerry in this world.

795
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:25,192
It doesn't matter
which one it is.

796
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:27,903
But frankly, I'd
rather it be me.

797
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:32,239
Fine!

798
00:57:39,623 --> 00:57:41,500
Well, I guess you got a freebie.

799
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:44,169
(Door slams)

800
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:48,422
(Thunder rumbling)

801
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:50,968
(Ominous music)

802
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:14,615
Reporter: Friends and family

803
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:17,660
attended the funeral of
19-year-old Loretta Vance

804
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:18,703
on Saturday,

805
00:58:18,704 --> 00:58:21,289
following her tragic
demise last week.

806
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:23,457
The scene was highly emotional

807
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:26,585
as her untimely death
shocked the community

808
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:29,839
and robbed the world of a
remarkable science prodigy

809
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,341
beloved by so many.

810
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:33,926
Police have yet to
reveal the identities

811
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:35,678
of the passengers in the vehicle

812
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:39,390
whose cliff fall dragged
miss Vance to her death.

813
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:41,017
While the fuel tank explosion

814
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:44,270
is known to have consumed the
victims beyond recognition,

815
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:47,606
police remain puzzled
that no missing persons reports

816
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:49,735
were filed then nor since.

817
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:51,736
On the night of the fatality,

818
00:58:51,737 --> 00:58:54,321
Loretta's friends
reported a near collision

819
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:55,823
with the exploded automobile

820
00:58:55,824 --> 00:58:58,994
just prior to it's rolling
off the edge of the lookout.

821
00:58:59,578 --> 00:59:01,662
Loretta's boyfriend,
Daniel Lewis,

822
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:04,790
expressed his personal
devastation in a brief

823
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:06,710
but heart-wrenching eulogy.

824
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:09,046
Danny:
Nobody was as scared as Loretta.

825
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:10,964
Nobody as smart.

826
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:12,882
There will never
be another Loretta

827
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:14,092
because there can't be.

828
00:59:14,593 --> 00:59:16,344
This isn't something
I'll get over

829
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:18,972
'cause nothing can make
this life right again.

830
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:20,849
Not for me.

831
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:25,145
(Ominous music)

832
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:32,611
(Door knocking)

833
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:37,157
Amy, hi.

834
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:38,491
Come in.

835
00:59:49,503 --> 00:59:50,503
I know.

836
00:59:50,879 --> 00:59:52,631
I just have something
I wanna say first.

837
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:59,346
So, I know that before
Loretta came back,

838
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:02,099
you and I were-were
getting close.

839
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,267
Let me finish.

840
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,395
I just think

841
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,357
that now that Loretta's back,

842
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:14,276
I think it's only
fair to everyone,

843
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:17,489
you know, if we
just take it slow.

844
01:00:22,828 --> 01:00:24,287
Stop, stop.

845
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,965
Amy, I'm really sorry okay.

846
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:37,259
Look, I wanted to tell you.

847
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:40,345
I really care about you!

848
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:46,810
(Door slams)

849
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:51,898
(Solemn music)

850
01:01:13,879 --> 01:01:15,964
(Deirdre gasps)

851
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:11,561
(Amy gasps)

852
01:02:19,027 --> 01:02:20,027
(Door slams)

853
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:34,084
What the fuck?

854
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:42,759
(Slow suspenseful music)

855
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:55,605
Amy: No, no, it's not possible.

856
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:00,442
What?

857
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,821
(Ominous music)

858
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,598
Oh my god, no.

859
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:37,105
(Phone buzzing and ringing)

860
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:38,273
Hello?

861
01:03:38,274 --> 01:03:39,774
Amy: Gerry, is that you?

862
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,525
Yeah, who's this?

863
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:43,361
Amy:
Oh my god, your number works.

864
01:03:43,737 --> 01:03:44,820
I said who is this?

865
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:45,947
Amy: It' 3 Amy.

866
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:48,115
Who is this? Are you with Amy?

867
01:03:48,116 --> 01:03:49,658
Amy:
You have no idea what's happening!

868
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:50,618
I'm deaf.

869
01:03:50,619 --> 01:03:52,454
I'm supposed to be deaf!

870
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:54,539
What the fuck?

871
01:04:01,004 --> 01:04:02,255
Amy, what is this?

872
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:04,174
Wha-what's going on?

873
01:04:04,175 --> 01:04:05,216
Who are you with?

874
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:06,426
I'm alone.

875
01:04:06,427 --> 01:04:08,385
Listen, I think I
figured something out.

876
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:09,595
I think we passed it over!

877
01:04:09,596 --> 01:04:10,680
Both of us!

878
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:12,223
Amy stop!

879
01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:13,016
You're freaking me out!

880
01:04:13,017 --> 01:04:15,226
How are you talking like that?

881
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:18,146
How the hell can you hear me?

882
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:20,523
Amy, what is happening!

883
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:23,526
I'm sorry, there's
been a mistake.

884
01:04:24,027 --> 01:04:25,612
(Phone beeps)

885
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,826
Voicemail:
You've reached Amy's voicemail.

886
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:35,913
Since leaving Amy a voicemail
is a dumb-ass thing to do,

887
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:38,249
please hang up and
text her instead.

888
01:04:39,459 --> 01:04:40,627
(Phone buzzing)

889
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:50,512
You're telling me.

890
01:04:51,763 --> 01:04:52,763
Great.

891
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:55,934
So there's versions of all
of us running around town.

892
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,186
Fantastic.

893
01:05:01,481 --> 01:05:03,358
What's this muscular shit about?

894
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:08,530
Amy's phone: The fish died.

895
01:05:09,197 --> 01:05:10,657
Gerry: Yeah, I know.

896
01:05:13,785 --> 01:05:15,912
Amy's phone:
Both fish were slowing down.

897
01:05:16,121 --> 01:05:17,497
Sinking to the bottom.

898
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:20,582
One died.

899
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:22,544
Now the other one is fine.

900
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:26,880
So you're saying that
the versions of all of us,

901
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:28,049
that they'll die?

902
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:31,386
Amy's phone: Or we die.

903
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:36,433
Holy shit!

904
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:41,855
Amy's phone:
I want to know where Danny is.

905
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:43,356
My Danny.

906
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:45,681
You know what I'd love to know?

907
01:05:49,237 --> 01:05:50,447
Where the hell am I?

908
01:05:52,115 --> 01:05:53,074
Loretta: Please slow down.

909
01:05:53,075 --> 01:05:54,783
This is no time to slow down.

910
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:55,702
You're scaring me.

911
01:05:55,703 --> 01:05:57,453
God, everyone is so
goddamned sensitive!

912
01:05:57,454 --> 01:05:59,456
Stop the car, this is not funny!

913
01:05:59,664 --> 01:06:01,207
(Tires screeching)

914
01:06:02,834 --> 01:06:03,835
Gerry: Done!

915
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:10,508
What is wrong with you?!

916
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:12,469
Just a little sleep deprived.

917
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:14,220
A lot of action in my head.

918
01:06:15,763 --> 01:06:16,763
Did you know,

919
01:06:17,056 --> 01:06:18,849
the greatest figures
of mass enterprise:

920
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:19,975
Carnegie, rockefeller, getty,

921
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:22,604
they all amassed their
fortunes in the exact same way.

922
01:06:23,855 --> 01:06:24,647
Bill Gates?

923
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:25,523
No, fuck Bill Gates!

924
01:06:25,524 --> 01:06:27,608
I'm talking about the original
monster billionaires.

925
01:06:27,609 --> 01:06:31,571
They built their fortunes
using natural resources!

926
01:06:32,614 --> 01:06:33,614
Water.

927
01:06:33,865 --> 01:06:35,282
The most abundant
resource on the planet,

928
01:06:35,283 --> 01:06:36,950
but nobody's figured out
how to actually use it

929
01:06:36,951 --> 01:06:38,828
to do something
truly extraordinary!

930
01:06:40,288 --> 01:06:41,288
We did.

931
01:06:41,623 --> 01:06:44,166
Every lake, every river,
every ocean.

932
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:46,336
Enough particle flux
to jump universes!

933
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:49,463
We didn't even know
it had happened.

934
01:06:49,464 --> 01:06:50,298
Forget about how.

935
01:06:50,299 --> 01:06:51,299
Gerry: No, we'll figure out how

936
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:52,674
because we were asking
the right questions.

937
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:54,968
And you were a contributing
factor in that!

938
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:56,221
Contributing factor?

939
01:06:56,804 --> 01:06:58,014
It was my idea.

940
01:06:58,389 --> 01:06:59,557
You guys quit.

941
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:01,851
On my side I kept going.

942
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:04,354
We kept going!

943
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:06,814
Holy shit!

944
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:11,026
You passed through.

945
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:12,027
Gerry: Fuck yeah!

946
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:15,197
Now, maybe we didn't know
exactly what we were doing,

947
01:07:15,198 --> 01:07:16,407
but we hit it.

948
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:19,869
The mother lode of
all game changers!

949
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:22,747
We're gonna figure this out.

950
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:25,416
We're gonna build a new machine.

951
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:28,378
But I want us to be partners.

952
01:07:30,964 --> 01:07:32,590
Let's change science.

953
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:36,177
Alright, fine.

954
01:07:38,263 --> 01:07:40,515
But I'm cold and tired.

955
01:07:40,932 --> 01:07:42,141
I wanna go home.

956
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:46,396
Partners?

957
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:51,316
Loretta: Geez.

958
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:53,695
You should really see
somebody about that.

959
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:56,739
I know exactly who to see.

960
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:03,913
You're still here.

961
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:05,957
Where else would I be?

962
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:12,337
Danny: Want a beer?

963
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:14,132
Sure, yeah.

964
01:08:17,176 --> 01:08:18,553
So, uh, Amy knows,

965
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:20,388
by the way, about you.

966
01:08:21,389 --> 01:08:23,933
Yeah, I kinda gathered that
when she tore my head off.

967
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,107
The other you's
still around, huh?

968
01:08:31,899 --> 01:08:32,900
Yeah.

969
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:35,820
You mind helping
me out with that?

970
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:38,031
I said no and I meant it.

971
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:40,782
Where is he?

972
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:42,452
- Who?
- Danny, the real Danny!

973
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:49,916
You know, life would
be a lot simpler

974
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:51,668
if we all just wore
short sleeves.

975
01:08:51,669 --> 01:08:52,545
Fuck you!

976
01:08:52,546 --> 01:08:53,921
No, stop it, dude!

977
01:08:54,422 --> 01:08:55,715
You don't have it in you!

978
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:58,217
Look at you, you can
barely fucking walk!

979
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:00,720
If you've got something
to say, say it!

980
01:09:01,304 --> 01:09:02,722
We 're all in this!

981
01:09:05,183 --> 01:09:07,560
Where is Danny?

982
01:09:07,935 --> 01:09:08,478
I'm Danny.

983
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:09,853
No! Our Danny!

984
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:10,854
He's gone!

985
01:09:11,314 --> 01:09:12,523
It's just me!

986
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:16,694
What?

987
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:21,324
How did that happen?

988
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:24,077
You really wanna know?

989
01:09:26,329 --> 01:09:27,455
You killed him.

990
01:09:28,915 --> 01:09:30,667
And you didn't even
shed a tear about it.

991
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,753
You saw him as a problem
and you took care of it.

992
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:38,006
No, no, I don't-i
don't believe you.

993
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:39,447
I would never do
something like that.

994
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:41,468
Danny: Well, you said you did!

995
01:09:41,469 --> 01:09:43,136
And who are you to
call you a liar?

996
01:09:43,137 --> 01:09:45,515
Gerry:
No, no, you mean the other me!

997
01:09:49,727 --> 01:09:50,727
Danny: Dude,

998
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:57,026
you were always kind
of a ticking time-bomb.

999
01:09:58,778 --> 01:10:00,071
But I'm not a killer.

1000
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:04,282
Our Amy isn't deaf?

1001
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:05,368
Did you know that?

1002
01:10:06,786 --> 01:10:08,621
Yeah, I kind of met
her on the phone.

1003
01:10:09,497 --> 01:10:11,164
So there are differences, right?

1004
01:10:11,165 --> 01:10:12,542
So it seems.

1005
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:16,546
Well, our Gerry is a
little different too.

1006
01:10:17,296 --> 01:10:18,339
Different how?

1007
01:10:22,093 --> 01:10:23,261
Imagine you,

1008
01:10:24,554 --> 01:10:26,681
but with a lot
more loose screws.

1009
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:30,475
And imagine what a
guy like you would do

1010
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:32,686
if he thought all of
this wasn't real?

1011
01:10:32,687 --> 01:10:34,689
If he thought
everything was a dream?

1012
01:10:34,772 --> 01:10:39,193
(Ominous music)

1013
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:42,821
Are you aware that you're
acting like an insane person?

1014
01:10:42,822 --> 01:10:44,699
Sanity is a construct.

1015
01:10:45,324 --> 01:10:47,159
You're off your meds aren't you?

1016
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:51,122
Gerry: Medication made me
believe the rules of the dull

1017
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:52,790
and the stupid!

1018
01:10:53,708 --> 01:10:56,085
It's chains around
true thinking and I,

1019
01:10:56,461 --> 01:10:57,794
I've broken those chains.
(Engine revving)

1020
01:10:57,795 --> 01:10:59,045
Okay, you need to calm down.

1021
01:10:59,046 --> 01:11:00,213
What don't you get?

1022
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:01,423
This is where we dream!

1023
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:04,260
This is our playground
and it's in fucking 3D!

1024
01:11:06,053 --> 01:11:07,972
(Tense music)

1025
01:11:08,639 --> 01:11:09,640
(Amy grunts)

1026
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:55,520
(Phone buzzing)

1027
01:12:00,525 --> 01:12:02,944
(Heavy breathing)

1028
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:15,039
This where you're staying?

1029
01:12:15,373 --> 01:12:16,374
Loretta: It's near here.

1030
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:18,291
(Engine revving)

1031
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:19,293
"Near here?"

1032
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:21,879
Well that's a little rude,
I thought we were partners.

1033
01:12:22,255 --> 01:12:23,713
I'm tired, can you just leave?

1034
01:12:23,714 --> 01:12:25,466
Are you fucking with me, lor?

1035
01:12:26,509 --> 01:12:28,719
'Cause I do not like
being fucked with!

1036
01:12:30,471 --> 01:12:32,640
It's our 3D playground, Gerry.

1037
01:12:32,682 --> 01:12:34,684
I can fuck with whoever I want!

1038
01:12:45,111 --> 01:12:46,529
(Amy groans)

1039
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:16,017
(Ominous music)

1040
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:26,319
Amy's phone:
I was wondering when you'd show up.

1041
01:13:28,112 --> 01:13:29,905
How did you get in here?

1042
01:13:29,906 --> 01:13:31,032
The normal way.

1043
01:13:32,366 --> 01:13:33,617
That's convenient.

1044
01:13:33,618 --> 01:13:35,536
Must make it easy
to make friends.

1045
01:13:37,455 --> 01:13:38,664
Amy's phone: What do you want?

1046
01:13:40,207 --> 01:13:41,709
I've no one to talk to.

1047
01:13:45,004 --> 01:13:46,923
Amy's phone:
I don't want to talk to you.

1048
01:13:47,131 --> 01:13:48,257
You scare me.

1049
01:13:48,883 --> 01:13:49,967
I understand.

1050
01:13:50,509 --> 01:13:51,928
I think I scared mom too.

1051
01:13:54,639 --> 01:13:55,764
Amy's phone: Does she know?

1052
01:13:55,765 --> 01:13:57,182
Amy 2: She knew something.

1053
01:13:57,183 --> 01:13:59,143
That I wasn't quite you.

1054
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:03,063
Amy's phone: You can hear.

1055
01:14:03,064 --> 01:14:04,941
That's scary enough.

1056
01:14:05,733 --> 01:14:07,150
They told me I was lucky.

1057
01:14:07,151 --> 01:14:09,528
There was 90% odds of
it being passed down.

1058
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:13,074
I guess I won the coin toss.

1059
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:15,952
Amy's phone: Good for you.

1060
01:14:17,578 --> 01:14:19,497
I'm sorry it was
different for you.

1061
01:14:23,751 --> 01:14:24,751
I get that.

1062
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:27,088
You seem like a nice person.

1063
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:29,715
Nicer than me, probably.

1064
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:30,841
I'm a bit messed up.

1065
01:14:30,842 --> 01:14:32,122
And I'm not a very
good daughter.

1066
01:14:32,593 --> 01:14:33,886
Not in my world.

1067
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:37,223
Amy's phone: What do you mean?

1068
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:45,438
Growing up, she wasn't normal.

1069
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:46,649
Not like I was.

1070
01:14:47,274 --> 01:14:48,317
Or dad was.

1071
01:14:48,526 --> 01:14:51,195
She made our family different
and I hated her for it.

1072
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:54,073
I was too stupid to see

1073
01:14:54,074 --> 01:14:55,992
there was nothing
wrong with different.

1074
01:14:56,867 --> 01:14:58,368
Amy's phone: Congratulations,

1075
01:14:58,369 --> 01:14:59,620
you are so woke.

1076
01:15:00,705 --> 01:15:03,164
I'm just not like you.

1077
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:05,418
Your mother has the
daughter she deserves.

1078
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:06,961
I can't fuck with that.

1079
01:15:07,837 --> 01:15:09,505
She's used to being loved.

1080
01:15:10,548 --> 01:15:13,008
I can't hurt two versions
of my own mother.

1081
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:14,677
I am not a monster.

1082
01:15:17,388 --> 01:15:19,140
Amy's phone:
What are you going to do?

1083
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:27,440
You just take care of her.

1084
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:29,859
Make every day matter.

1085
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:34,196
And I'll take care of us.

1086
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:36,907
(Ominous music)

1087
01:15:44,999 --> 01:15:48,461
(Slow gentle music)

1088
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:31,462
(Door opens)

1089
01:16:50,397 --> 01:16:52,441
Loretta:
Danny! He's totally lost it!

1090
01:16:52,733 --> 01:16:53,567
Who?

1091
01:16:53,568 --> 01:16:54,610
Who do you think?

1092
01:16:55,111 --> 01:16:56,112
Oh, right.

1093
01:16:56,403 --> 01:16:57,571
I was afraid of that.

1094
01:16:57,822 --> 01:16:59,156
We need to find Amy.

1095
01:17:04,787 --> 01:17:05,830
Did you kill him?

1096
01:17:06,122 --> 01:17:07,705
The other Danny?

1097
01:17:07,706 --> 01:17:08,499
How can you even ask me that?

1098
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:09,750
Well then where is he?

1099
01:17:11,085 --> 01:17:12,002
He's gone.

1100
01:17:12,003 --> 01:17:13,504
Who made him gone?

1101
01:17:14,046 --> 01:17:15,421
Who do you think?

1102
01:17:15,422 --> 01:17:19,593
(Thunder cracking)
(Water rushing)

1103
01:17:54,587 --> 01:17:55,587
What?

1104
01:18:45,512 --> 01:18:46,512
What?

1105
01:18:53,854 --> 01:18:55,147
(Amy gasps)

1106
01:19:08,452 --> 01:19:09,828
No, no!

1107
01:19:12,289 --> 01:19:14,708
(Amy gasping) (Water rustling)

1108
01:19:19,546 --> 01:19:25,678
(Sombre music)

1109
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:34,603
(Sombre music)

1110
01:19:44,863 --> 01:19:46,031
(Phone buzzing)

1111
01:19:47,116 --> 01:19:50,118
(Sombre music)

1112
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:03,007
(Engine engages)

1113
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:29,366
Perfect.

1114
01:20:38,792 --> 01:20:42,755
(Eerie music)

1115
01:20:46,925 --> 01:20:49,386
Out all night!

1116
01:20:50,137 --> 01:20:52,389
Do you have any idea how
worried I've been young man?

1117
01:20:53,807 --> 01:20:55,434
You killed my best friend.

1118
01:20:55,893 --> 01:20:58,062
So guess what?
I'm not laughing at your jokes.

1119
01:20:59,438 --> 01:21:00,772
Where are the 'rents?

1120
01:21:00,773 --> 01:21:01,940
California.

1121
01:21:02,441 --> 01:21:03,650
Gerry 2: Well that's handy.

1122
01:21:04,026 --> 01:21:05,026
Why is that?

1123
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:07,738
For figuring out
little differences.

1124
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:10,491
Until they they get home.

1125
01:21:11,408 --> 01:21:13,951
You really think they're not
gonna notice that you're not me?

1126
01:21:13,952 --> 01:21:15,788
But I am you.

1127
01:21:16,205 --> 01:21:18,498
C'mon, Gerry, this is
pretty fucking fun!

1128
01:21:18,499 --> 01:21:20,667
A chance to really
get to know yourself.

1129
01:21:23,337 --> 01:21:24,337
What do you want?

1130
01:21:25,255 --> 01:21:30,134
Well, it seems like there's only
room in this gosh-darned town

1131
01:21:30,135 --> 01:21:31,595
for the one of us.

1132
01:21:33,097 --> 01:21:37,309
But there is one big
difference between you and me.

1133
01:21:39,186 --> 01:21:40,521
Just one, huh?

1134
01:21:42,356 --> 01:21:46,151
The difference is I
know what I want.

1135
01:21:46,693 --> 01:21:47,735
(Tense music)

1136
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:49,904
(Gun cocking)
And that, my friend,

1137
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:51,531
is the key to survival.

1138
01:21:51,532 --> 01:21:52,866
(Gun firing) (Glass shattering)

1139
01:21:53,242 --> 01:21:54,159
(Thudding)

1140
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:56,745
(Gerry grunts) (Tense music)

1141
01:21:59,957 --> 01:22:04,168
(Tense music)

1142
01:22:09,383 --> 01:22:11,093
(Gun firing) (Glass shattering)

1143
01:22:11,635 --> 01:22:15,847
(Tense music)

1144
01:22:15,848 --> 01:22:16,848
(Amy gasps)

1145
01:22:19,435 --> 01:22:20,936
Stop it! Let him go!

1146
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:22,646
He came here to kill me!

1147
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:24,689
Loretta: I said let go!

1148
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:25,690
I can't!

1149
01:22:25,983 --> 01:22:27,067
Look at him!

1150
01:22:27,234 --> 01:22:28,110
He'll kill us all!

1151
01:22:28,111 --> 01:22:29,778
He's gone fucking crazy!

1152
01:22:30,737 --> 01:22:32,781
(Gerry gasps)

1153
01:22:34,533 --> 01:22:35,533
Fuck.

1154
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:40,205
(Tense music)

1155
01:22:41,415 --> 01:22:42,415
Him!

1156
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:46,461
(Loretta screams)
(Head thudding)

1157
01:22:46,462 --> 01:22:48,505
(Gerry gasps)

1158
01:22:49,631 --> 01:22:52,593
(Coughing and sputtering)

1159
01:22:57,389 --> 01:22:58,765
I thought it was over.

1160
01:22:59,433 --> 01:23:00,684
It's not over yet.

1161
01:23:01,226 --> 01:23:04,813
(Tense music)

1162
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:07,232
It has to be.

1163
01:23:18,577 --> 01:23:23,123
(Trophy thudding)
(Flesh squishing)

1164
01:23:27,586 --> 01:23:29,046
(Trophy clanging)

1165
01:23:40,724 --> 01:23:42,351
Can we get a head count, please?

1166
01:23:47,064 --> 01:23:55,064
(Echoing heart beating)

1167
01:24:04,414 --> 01:24:06,625
One, two-

1168
01:24:08,126 --> 01:24:09,211
(water splashing)

1169
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:15,717
(Crickets chirping)

1170
01:24:22,182 --> 01:24:24,560
I get a bad feeling
on this road.

1171
01:24:25,852 --> 01:24:29,231
Gerry: It wasn't even you who
got killed last time.

1172
01:24:33,777 --> 01:24:35,571
So many ways to die.

1173
01:24:36,405 --> 01:24:38,073
So little time.

1174
01:24:38,699 --> 01:24:40,325
That's dark.

1175
01:24:41,243 --> 01:24:42,619
It's been a dark week.

1176
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:45,789
Jesus.

1177
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:49,334
I can't even imagine
how I dealt with that.

1178
01:24:51,545 --> 01:24:52,796
You don't have to.

1179
01:25:04,808 --> 01:25:05,975
Jesus! (Lorena gasps)

1180
01:25:05,976 --> 01:25:07,351
(Tires screeching)

1181
01:25:07,352 --> 01:25:08,854
(Car crashing)

1182
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:15,694
Oh my god.

1183
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:17,988
(Metal groaning)

1184
01:25:18,739 --> 01:25:19,780
(Whimpering)

1185
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:20,948
Oh fuck!

1186
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:22,241
Dude, get us off of here!

1187
01:25:22,242 --> 01:25:23,659
Nobody fucking move!
(Car creaking)

1188
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:25,078
Back up the car!

1189
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,830
Back up the fucking car!

1190
01:25:26,913 --> 01:25:28,373
(Car revving)

1191
01:25:29,458 --> 01:25:30,499
Danny:
What the fuck is wrong with you?!

1192
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:32,418
I'm trying!
What do you think I'm doing!

1193
01:25:32,419 --> 01:25:33,420
What the fuck?

1194
01:25:33,503 --> 01:25:35,881
(Car revving)

1195
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:37,716
(Girls screaming)

1196
01:25:37,883 --> 01:25:40,052
Hold on, everybody
fucking hold on!

1197
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:41,720
(Car revving)

1198
01:25:42,137 --> 01:25:46,308
(Ominous music)

1199
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:52,689
(Soft ambient music)

1200
01:25:57,402 --> 01:25:58,987
Danny: Loretta, stay back!

1201
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:00,781
No it's-

1202
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:03,533
it's us!

1203
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:07,496
(Soft ambient music)

1204
01:26:21,551 --> 01:26:23,844
(Car creaking)
(Loretta screaming)

1205
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:27,099
(Screaming)

1206
01:26:27,432 --> 01:26:28,808
(Crashing)

1207
01:26:28,809 --> 01:26:30,519
(Exploding boom)

1208
01:26:30,686 --> 01:26:31,853
Danny: Loretta!

1209
01:26:32,354 --> 01:26:33,772
(Sobbing) Loretta!

1210
01:26:35,774 --> 01:26:36,983
(Sobbing) Oh god!

1211
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:43,156
Loretta!

1212
01:26:43,365 --> 01:26:45,324
(Clocks ticking)

1213
01:26:45,325 --> 01:26:47,619
Loretta:
You know about multiverse theory, right?

1214
01:26:48,453 --> 01:26:52,791
(Clocks ticking) Accepting that
an infinite number of universes exist.

1215
01:26:52,916 --> 01:26:56,712
(Clocks ticking) At least one
of them will be exactly like ours.

1216
01:26:56,837 --> 01:26:58,087
(Clocks ticking) More than one.

1217
01:26:58,088 --> 01:27:00,924
(Clocks ticking)
An endless number of identical worlds.

1218
01:27:01,049 --> 01:27:03,343
(Clocks ticking)
Well, almost identical.

1219
01:27:03,635 --> 01:27:05,136
(Clocks ticking)
There has to be.

1220
01:27:05,137 --> 01:27:06,721
(Echoing) Because infinite,

1221
01:27:06,722 --> 01:27:08,931
is infinite.

1222
01:27:08,932 --> 01:27:10,433
Side ways eight.

1223
01:27:10,434 --> 01:27:13,019
Coolest number of all.

1224
01:27:13,103 --> 01:27:16,440
(Clocks ticking loudly)
(Tense music)

1225
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:27,450
Did you feel that?

1226
01:27:27,451 --> 01:27:28,160
What?

1227
01:27:28,161 --> 01:27:30,036
Well I don't know,
something came through.

1228
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:31,912
According to "science digest"

1229
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:34,332
if fish don't eat, they die.

1230
01:27:35,333 --> 01:27:40,464
(Slow paced music)

1231
01:27:42,632 --> 01:27:44,426
What are you doing?

1232
01:27:46,011 --> 01:27:47,094
Something's coming through!

1233
01:27:47,095 --> 01:27:49,014
(Amy screams) (Machine buzzing)

1234
01:27:50,599 --> 01:27:52,224
The water.

1235
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:54,019
Particles in flux!

1236
01:27:54,186 --> 01:27:55,520
Hey, lemme see.

1237
01:27:57,856 --> 01:27:59,441
More water.

1238
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:01,650
Bigger fishbowl?

1239
01:28:01,651 --> 01:28:04,029
No bigger, way bigger!
(Tense music)

1240
01:28:04,154 --> 01:28:08,700
(Tense music)

1241
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:11,328
Gerry:
I guess I'm designated driver again, huh?

1242
01:28:12,496 --> 01:28:14,414
Danny:
Just get in the car and let's go.

1243
01:28:14,664 --> 01:28:18,209
(Tense music)
