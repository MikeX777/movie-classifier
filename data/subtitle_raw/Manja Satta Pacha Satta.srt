"The clown who made them
laugh has come here."

17
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,958
Story teller Ucchu Kudumba...

18
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:24,125
I am present my lord.

19
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:27,417
Before the guests go to sleep
begin your story Ucchu Kudumba.

20
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,792
What I bring to you is...

21
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,667
Under the 3 thousand crore deities
and the hole in the ozone layer.

22
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,792
Having chopped all trees inside this
concrete jungle, atop this earth.

23
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:37,917
Where the never drying sewage rivers
that flow next to the Chennai City!

24
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,125
and in the retro city
that nobody has heard of.

25
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,250
There was once that be BOB ATM.

26
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:46,833
Wow, in trying to sing your story you
have given many messages to many people!

27
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:49,958
Once man gets a machine that gives money,
his life is sure to be disastrous!

28
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,875
And it is in this idiom
that our story begins.

29
00:03:51,917 --> 00:03:53,125
Amazing, tell me more!

30
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:58,292
6 km away from this ATM is the factory
behind the old marriage hall bus stop.

31
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,167
And here takes place our first act

32
00:04:30,292 --> 00:04:31,833
Hey, who are you?!

33
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,417
Hey old man, I too I am from around here

34
00:04:34,792 --> 00:04:35,875
What work do you have here?

35
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,250
Will anyone come here for a marriage?
We came here to drink!

36
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,042
No no, you should not come here!

37
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:42,542
Oh my God!

38
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:43,958
I don’t know who I am!

39
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,417
I don’t care who you are.

40
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:47,708
I will break your head open!

41
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,833
Go...

42
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,417
Go!

43
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,958
Hey runaway, quickly now.

44
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:56,500
Hey quickly get your bike and let’s go!

45
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,833
Hey take this, wait here!

46
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:11,667
Hey, this old man has beaten
and killed more than 100 people.

47
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:13,083
How do you know that?

48
00:05:13,417 --> 00:05:15,042
It came as a WhatsApp message

49
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,458
I myself forwarded it to many groups.

50
00:05:17,542 --> 00:05:19,333
Oh no, he seems to be a very violent man!

51
00:05:19,417 --> 00:05:21,583
What my Lord, she said it came in WhatsApp!

52
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:22,625
Do you still believe him?

53
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:24,375
Forget about that let’s
get back to the story.

54
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,958
Ucchu Kudumba, who is he?

55
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,458
She is somebody that nobody knows
if you use it good or bad person.

56
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:31,000
He is the central minister Paagambariya!

57
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,917
and somebody is here to see him!

58
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,667
Is he a good person or bad person?

59
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,750
He’s the one who rejoices, if
the country is split apart.

60
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,000
Is he a performer?

61
00:05:38,042 --> 00:05:40,833
He is not a simple performer
he is in an institutional performer

62
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:43,125
Corporate-Broker Dilip Judhani

63
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:49,750
Take this

64
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:50,833
Please have it!

65
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,125
Tender coconut in the night time?!

66
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:55,333
When we can cheat in the night,

67
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,417
shouldn’t we be able to give
tender coconuts in the night?!

68
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:58,958
Come on!

69
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:03,667
Once you are here as our guest!

70
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,417
Please have our customary drink.

71
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,542
And if you manage to learn
or customs and language...

72
00:06:08,917 --> 00:06:10,292
It will be easier for us.

73
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,500
Minister sir,

74
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:16,292
20 crores per year

75
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,958
I have negotiated for you!

76
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,167
You will be recognised as one
of the pioneers of Project Welfare,

77
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:23,417
Your name will go down in history.

78
00:06:29,917 --> 00:06:32,583
It’s okay if my name is there
only on my tombstone Judhani.

79
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:36,542
Why should I write my name on
somebody else’s tombstone?

80
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:39,208
Whatever you heard is true.

81
00:06:39,292 --> 00:06:42,333
For money Paagambariya will open wide!

82
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:48,125
It’s only four MLAs and one MP
I have earned in minister’s seat,

83
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,542
You can make the judgment.

84
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:53,333
For a profit, I will do
what is politically wrong.

85
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:57,708
I will do what is politically immoral

86
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:01,792
I will even do what is politically illegal!

87
00:07:02,292 --> 00:07:06,375
But I will never do what
people say is wrong...

88
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:11,083
and it’s not because I will not
get the vote next time Mr. Judhani.

89
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:14,375
By poisoning drinking water

90
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:17,042
air that we breathe

91
00:07:17,292 --> 00:07:18,583
and the very ground that I stand on,

92
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:21,167
Where can I go with all
the money in the world?

93
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:24,958
To the moon? I know
what this project is?

94
00:07:25,542 --> 00:07:28,833
I also know what is the
commission you will get from it.

95
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,958
I will never give my
approval for this project!

96
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,917
This city is the soil are you stand on,

97
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:48,083
If I cannot live on this earth anymore,

98
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,542
I will oppose anything!

99
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:55,958
Amazing, Fantastic, Brilliant!
Though the job is to perform Tandavakone!

100
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,583
When it is about money,
you are very diligent Tandavakone

101
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:00,750
Go ahead!

102
00:08:00,792 --> 00:08:03,667
One who chops up fish food,
can chop up a corpse too!

103
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:06,417
He is our Jailkodi Prabhakar a.k.a Prabha.

104
00:08:09,917 --> 00:08:10,667
What?

105
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,333
ACP has called for you.

106
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,208
Come, how are you?

107
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,042
Make sure nobody finds out, Prabha.

108
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,417
You are talking to Jailkodi Prabhakaran.

109
00:08:27,542 --> 00:08:29,500
Okay, a dead body has come in.

110
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,458
Your job is to chop it
up and feed the fish.

111
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,625
Only give me the order
not the instructions.

112
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:36,292
Prabha, do this carefully!

113
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,292
It should not leak to any one!

114
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,875
Even God will not be able to find it!

115
00:08:40,917 --> 00:08:42,417
Just give us the body.

116
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:43,875
- I will send it.
- Hey come.

117
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:45,917
Sir!

118
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,042
Who is he that has a scorpion like
moustache and looks like Duryodhana?

119
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,875
My lord, due to circumstances
and certain choices,

120
00:08:51,917 --> 00:08:53,750
he is the Ravanan who lost everything!

121
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:55,875
Karimel Thunjiya Pandian.

122
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,583
Good morning, sir.

123
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,958
Sir that Arabian girl Chaya who is missing.

124
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,708
I have found a new lead in the case sir.

125
00:09:07,792 --> 00:09:09,625
The girl has not vacated her hotel room.

126
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:11,792
Moreover, she has gone by running taxi.

127
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,417
We will find her very soon!

128
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,500
For the marriage function
of minister’s relative

129
00:09:16,542 --> 00:09:17,958
they had asked for police protection.

130
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,208
It seems you have refused!

131
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,875
All other stations help out with manpower.

132
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,167
What is your problem?

133
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,958
I came here to discuss another case sir.

134
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:28,542
Hey, is this an important case?

135
00:09:28,792 --> 00:09:31,250
She must be high in some
or the other ashram!

136
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,083
When she comes to see will return home.

137
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,167
Go and do as I told you.

138
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,042
Come Mujeeb

139
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,250
Get lost you bugger!

140
00:09:42,792 --> 00:09:43,667
Yes, sir.

141
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:44,958
Okay sir.

142
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:47,375
Sir, sir has gone out regarding a case.

143
00:09:48,542 --> 00:09:49,917
Okay sir!

144
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:55,417
What is this?!

145
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,208
That inspector behaves as though
he is the one who discovered law!

146
00:09:58,417 --> 00:10:01,917
Like this moron cops all
are died in road side

147
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:02,792
Do you know?

148
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:05,667
When we come here with
the anticipatory bail,

149
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:07,625
You will take that and make us wait.

150
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:09,375
It is inspector’s orders what can I do?!

151
00:10:09,417 --> 00:10:11,667
Do I look like a fool?!

152
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,667
Don’t try no how to get our boy out!

153
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,833
Sitting minister is my brother-in-law!

154
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:18,000
Come let’s go.

155
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:22,250
Sir can I take a boy now?!

156
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,750
I can see how hurt you are.

157
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:30,583
The son of someone who is always
doing welfare for people...

158
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:33,583
has ripped apart the shirt of a
girl in the middle of the street!

159
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,167
Sir!
You horny little dog!

160
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,125
If you ever come here and
say my dad will come.

161
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,750
I will make sure you don’t
have a dad to bail you out.

162
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,417
Okay?!
You can take him.

163
00:10:52,542 --> 00:10:53,500
Head constable get me a tea.

164
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:54,458
Okay sir.

165
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,792
Brother he hit our boy in front of us!

166
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,292
Karimel Thunjiya Pandian,
it’s a great thing

167
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,000
that he let us go at all! Come.

168
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,083
What have you done about what I asked?!

169
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,542
We can talk when I get back home,

170
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,667
cut the call!

171
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,167
Next, the crows that fell the palm tree!

172
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,875
Have you gone mad?!

173
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:34,875
Is the humiliation in an
interview, something new for us?!

174
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,417
It’s been five years!

175
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,958
Nobody give me an engineering job!

176
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:42,333
Including jammers and security protocols
I have seven different projects!

177
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:44,000
But wherever I go,

178
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,708
they offer me system admin and HR jobs.

179
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,208
I didn’t do engineering
because others told me to!

180
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,625
This is my dream!

181
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,792
I will show this world who I am!

182
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:57,625
I will show how an ATM can be robbed!

183
00:11:57,792 --> 00:12:00,667
In this world full of CCTV cameras,

184
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,083
I will show it is possible to be invisible.

185
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:07,792
It is all about frequencies, anything
can be opened any data can be taken!

186
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:10,208
Any bank can be opened!

187
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:11,792
For that you want us to steal!

188
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,542
We are going to search for her identity!

189
00:12:15,917 --> 00:12:18,458
We don’t have chance to prove
ourselves in the righteous path!

190
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,792
All of them are going to
play kabaddi in a guy’s life!

191
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,542
You mean, the great Kabbadi league!?

192
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,292
He is our king to be Thannoli

193
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:28,000
I am next to him is, Ms. Bhanumathi.

194
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:32,542
Banu, is money everything?!

195
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,250
More or less it is everything.

196
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:37,500
Then, are you saying that
I am good for nothing?

197
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,125
You are a good guy.

198
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:40,500
But a failure!

199
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,875
Even if you are a con, you must earn money!

200
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:46,917
Either you must change
or I will replace you.

201
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:48,333
Banu,

202
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,375
Banu look at me for a second!

203
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,167
Please don’t mistake the
question I am about to ask you!

204
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,000
In case we had an arranged marriage,

205
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,500
after marriage you had learnt
I was a good guy who is a failure...

206
00:12:58,542 --> 00:13:00,792
who is good for nothing!

207
00:13:01,292 --> 00:13:02,833
Would you replace me even then?!

208
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,958
You must be ruthless in life.

209
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,250
Hence, I would replace you.

210
00:13:09,792 --> 00:13:12,208
So, for money you will do anything?

211
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,500
Come again!

212
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,375
I mean, for money...

213
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:17,958
you will do anything?!

214
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:23,250
Even if I was your wife, you have
no right to call me a prostitute!

215
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,958
Goodbye!

216
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,250
Banu, I’m sorry Banu. Banu!

217
00:13:26,292 --> 00:13:29,375
After this love failure,
our hero fails in life...

218
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:32,042
and for three days he
mourned his six-year love!

219
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:35,167
What’s new, life is always like this!

220
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,958
The thing years six months before this,

221
00:13:37,042 --> 00:13:38,875
on an auspicious day,

222
00:13:38,917 --> 00:13:41,958
as per somebody’s advice
thinking there is a lot of money

223
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:45,958
in starting a YouTube channel,
our hero lost the only job he had.

224
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,792
Enough Ucchu Kudumba, I will
see the rest in the visuals.

225
00:13:52,542 --> 00:13:53,250
Hey,

226
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:56,375
for giving you 10 days leave
now my job is in danger!

227
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:58,083
This is a stress buster mam.

228
00:13:58,167 --> 00:14:01,625
Those who have lot of stress will go
and do primitive living in the forest.

229
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:04,000
Just like a system restore.

230
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:06,542
That is for people who actually
do their job why did you two go?!

231
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:07,583
Hey bro,

232
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,500
we should have taken madam along with us.

233
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,583
We should have!

234
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:11,917
You are fired!

235
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,750
Peanuts, this is all your salary!

236
00:14:19,542 --> 00:14:21,292
She is only the side dish,

237
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,208
Who is going buy us liquor Kanniamma?!

238
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:26,583
That is your name right?!

239
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:27,875
Get lost!

240
00:14:32,417 --> 00:14:34,167
There you go, the 80,000 I had borrowed.

241
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,042
Do you know one thing,

242
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,125
your guy has just been fired!

243
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:39,458
What are you saying?!

244
00:14:39,542 --> 00:14:41,250
They built a fire in the
forest but it burnt them here.

245
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:50,417
Where to?!

246
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:51,167
Outside!

247
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,167
So it is a treat in the evening?!

248
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,417
She is like an old dog;
you can never change.

249
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,667
Even if he got a job in Giga
he will leave it halfway!

250
00:15:01,417 --> 00:15:02,917
What do I care about him?!

251
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,500
There is 80,000 in here

252
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,208
I cannot go outside right now.

253
00:15:08,292 --> 00:15:10,208
Will you deposit this
in my mother’s account?

254
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,500
This is the account details.

255
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,250
Don’t give this to him,
he will somehow screw it up!

256
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:17,292
Hey...

257
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,083
come!

258
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,083
Don’t stare at me!

259
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:25,958
When the world is headed one way,
you are headed in a different way.

260
00:15:26,042 --> 00:15:26,958
Get lost.

261
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,292
Sis, the T-shirts we had ordered
for our party affiliates.

262
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:37,917
Yes sis, they have arrived.

263
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:38,958
How much?

264
00:15:39,042 --> 00:15:39,958
One lakh sis.

265
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:41,500
But sis, I have a doubt.

266
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:45,000
All our affiliates,

267
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,708
Including the PA system
guys, tea vendor

268
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,833
and cotton candy seller
don’t make 4 thousand

269
00:15:49,917 --> 00:15:51,917
Then why did we order one lakh T-shirts?!

270
00:15:54,042 --> 00:15:56,583
If we make coalition negotiations
as per party attendance,

271
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,375
We won’t even account for the

272
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,583
amount spent on our letter pad

273
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:04,958
We have to show a mass following!
Get everyone to wear our party’s T-shirt!

274
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,667
Sis, nobody can beat your brilliance!

275
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,333
Get me a sample of the T-shirts!

276
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:13,750
Sis, the samples you asked for.

277
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,167
What, you are so quick today?!

278
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,292
What Ekambaram?

279
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:27,125
I asked for T-shirts in the colour of our
party flag, but you have got it separate?!

280
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,708
Sis, it is Rs.40 per piece
for a single colour.

281
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,125
But Rs.60 for double colour.

282
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,833
That is why I said print single colours.

283
00:16:36,917 --> 00:16:38,292
Both the colours are here sis.

284
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:45,542
What is it?
Even your stupidity has helped us out!

285
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,333
These fans who come to
watch a cricket match,

286
00:16:48,792 --> 00:16:50,667
Dress in the colours of the national flag.

287
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,583
Will they all wear the same colour?

288
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:53,208
No sis.

289
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:56,167
One will wear white, one green
and the other saffron, right?!

290
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,833
But when you look at it from a
distance it’s the national flag.

291
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,917
Delhi is a bit distant.

292
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:04,167
And if you say it is our party
T-shirt nobody will wear it.

293
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:09,208
Give the to shirts these marathon runners
cricket players and football players.

294
00:17:10,542 --> 00:17:14,250
If it is free, they will
eat curry with a sweet.

295
00:17:14,292 --> 00:17:15,875
That is our people.

296
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:18,000
When we look from afar our
party flag will be visible!

297
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,167
- Okay?
- Okay sis!

298
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,708
40 lakhs would have been a loss.

299
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:25,708
Somehow I escaped!

300
00:17:40,542 --> 00:17:43,208
My sister is ready with the money in hand.

301
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:46,875
Looks like I will have
to lick my wounds again.

302
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:49,792
You will get eight lakhs
right, take it and be happy.

303
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:52,083
She gives eight lakhs
she will get the house,

304
00:17:52,417 --> 00:17:54,417
I had give the eight lakhs
I will get the house.

305
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:58,875
House that is worth 40 lakhs will
be worth 4 crores in four years!

306
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:02,375
They married me off to this
sincere police officer

307
00:18:02,417 --> 00:18:04,792
and ruined my life!

308
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,958
If you ask for eight lakhs all of a
Sudden, where will I get the money?

309
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,833
Those who joined duty along with you

310
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:12,000
have houses all over the
suburbs of Chennai.

311
00:18:12,042 --> 00:18:14,000
They also have a wife
each one of those houses,

312
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:16,458
should I also follow suit?

313
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:19,125
Person who doesn’t know how to
cut has thousands of lives!

314
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,208
You haven’t yet done anything
with the house you have!

315
00:18:21,292 --> 00:18:22,125
Hey!

316
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,042
Yeah, sit silently.

317
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,500
I’ve had enough of your mastery in bed!

318
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,833
Now show your mastery in
getting me this house!

319
00:18:28,917 --> 00:18:30,000
I don’t care!

320
00:18:31,417 --> 00:18:33,917
You can do whatever you want,

321
00:18:34,292 --> 00:18:37,417
I need eight lakh rupees in the next week.

322
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,792
Look here...

323
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,958
The food that we eat the clothes that
you wear and the house that we live in,

324
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:45,750
and the respect you get
when you go outside.

325
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,000
All of this is because of this uniform.

326
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,792
I cannot betray it!

327
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,458
You may not betray it!

328
00:18:51,542 --> 00:18:52,917
But I am not like you!

329
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:55,333
You are my patience has a limit.

330
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:58,083
There are many who salivate
at aunties like me,

331
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:02,333
If I only raise my eyebrows and
look at them, that is enough.

332
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,583
Don’t think I am joking here.

333
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,708
I will divorce and leave you!

334
00:19:06,792 --> 00:19:10,792
Don’t talk about justice
and righteousness with me!

335
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,875
Learn to live as the world is!

336
00:19:13,292 --> 00:19:15,542
All in all, be a man!

337
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:49,042
You don’t know any other way
to prove your manhood, right?

338
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:53,792
Why can’t you give me the 8 lakhs
and prove your manhood?!

339
00:19:54,417 --> 00:19:56,917
You want the money right?
Go!

340
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,208
Hello,

341
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:06,708
Sis, Judhani has made his move.

342
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,542
Tonight your house will be raided!

343
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,625
All our accounts are squared up, right?

344
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:17,875
Everything is perfect!

345
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:20,542
We have done everything legally sis.

346
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:22,708
Sis,

347
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:26,000
Builder Nidhirajan’s 22 has
not yet been laundered.

348
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:27,625
It is still in the godown,

349
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,208
But it won’t be a problem.

350
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:30,792
Ekambaram,

351
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,167
It’s not just our house,

352
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,250
They will raid the house
of the illicit wife

353
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,375
of the nephew of our servant!

354
00:20:38,042 --> 00:20:40,375
They should not find the money.

355
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,875
When they are in the godown
we will bring it to the house,

356
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,958
When they check the house we
will put it back in the godown!

357
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:49,917
There is something in what you just said.

358
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:50,917
Okay sis.

359
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,250
If we put the money in a vehicle and
let it roam it won’t be caught right?!

360
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,250
What is the police catch
it in night checking?

361
00:20:56,667 --> 00:20:58,917
It must be a vehicle that
the police won’t search.

362
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,292
Super idea sis!

363
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:02,125
We will put it in your car and let it roam.

364
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,250
It is the central minister’s car,

365
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:05,500
Who will dare to check it?!

366
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:09,042
Get a vehicle that puts cash in ATMs.

367
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,958
Put two party workers and
tell them to roam all night!

368
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:13,875
Ask them to return in the morning

369
00:21:13,917 --> 00:21:16,375
Sis, what if they run away with the money!

370
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:19,042
Don’t tell them it is money!
Tell them his documents.

371
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,333
Okay sis

372
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:24,917
They must be my diehard fans at the
same time they must be complete fools.

373
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:27,333
Sis there are many fools in our party.

374
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,750
Where will I find diehard fans?

375
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:33,792
Okay sis.

376
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,083
This is your evening show RJ Shiva,

377
00:21:38,167 --> 00:21:40,833
Just like in international football match

378
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:44,458
Your local private league
match score is 2 each

379
00:21:44,542 --> 00:21:46,958
Let us go for a small
commercial break, stay tuned!

380
00:21:48,292 --> 00:21:49,000
Hey!

381
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:52,833
As this team always loses to us,

382
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,083
I want all my wife’s jewellery
and everything on this game.

383
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:56,500
You don’t worry bro; I
will get you the victory!

384
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,583
Please don’t try to do anything!

385
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,958
There is only two minutes left.

386
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,958
Just run here and there while that happens.

387
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,958
Already the score is 2-2

388
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,458
Why the hell did you call me 100 times?!

389
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:08,333
I only put you in this game
because I don’t have other players.

390
00:22:08,417 --> 00:22:09,958
I don’t have any substitutes!

391
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,875
Is this any way to run a club?!

392
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,792
You don’t even have a proper Jersey!

393
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,958
That way jersey wearers are your opponents
colour dress are your teammates

394
00:22:18,542 --> 00:22:19,667
Please just go and play.

395
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:21,083
Are you some international coach?!

396
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:22,667
To always keep your coolers on, remove it!

397
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:24,417
I have Madras eye, is that okay?!

398
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:25,708
Thank you.

399
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:36,833
Hey don’t do it!

400
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:45,167
What is this?

401
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:52,958
Why?!

402
00:22:53,292 --> 00:22:54,500
Sorry bro...

403
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,125
Forget it bro,

404
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,542
Winning and losing is a part of the game.

405
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:14,917
Morning manager fired from the job.

406
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:16,167
The evening we lost the game.

407
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:18,083
That’s okay,

408
00:23:18,167 --> 00:23:19,208
Let’s celebrate.

409
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,708
Like this?

410
00:23:21,417 --> 00:23:22,292
Change over.

411
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:40,792
"Yellow shirt, green shirt
Yellow shirt, green shirt."

412
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:50,042
"Yellow shirt, green shirt
Yellow shirt, green shirt."

413
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:56,667
"Yellow shirt,"

414
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,167
"Green... green, green shirt"

415
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:01,375
"Yellow shirt. Green...
green, green shirt."

416
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:22,167
Brother,

417
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:22,833
Yes sir,

418
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:24,750
‘For sister, I will give my life!’

419
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:27,333
Do a performance to
emote this feeling

420
00:24:27,417 --> 00:24:29,875
Start,
Do you know who sister is?!

421
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,958
Do you know the meaning of sister?!

422
00:24:32,042 --> 00:24:34,708
Do you know love of a sister?!

423
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:37,792
Which serial do you work in brother?

424
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:42,250
‘Love Roots’ sir, I come and
drink tea in one scene!

425
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:46,625
Hello sir.

426
00:24:46,958 --> 00:24:50,000
‘For sister I will give my life’
do a performance for this feeling.

427
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:52,208
Sir, can I get a stick?

428
00:24:55,875 --> 00:24:59,500
Hey, Madurai is famous for Jasmine
sister is famous for being the best.

429
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:02,417
He will fight 10 people all by himself!

430
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,833
Will you come?
Come, let us see...

431
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,125
They are calling the next in line.

432
00:25:15,708 --> 00:25:18,542
"Yellow shirt, green shirt
Yellow shirt, green shirt."

433
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:20,958
‘For sister I will give my life’
come with this feeling.

434
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,333
What? Sis, is in trouble"

435
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:28,250
Nobody has done this till now,
Do you like sister so much?!

436
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:29,292
Okay, leave it!

437
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:31,375
I am going to trouble
you just a little bit!

438
00:25:31,458 --> 00:25:33,042
Do you think you can trouble us?!

439
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:36,833
I have finally found the correct fools!

440
00:25:38,292 --> 00:25:40,042
What happened to the Ward
president’s house robbery case?

441
00:25:40,125 --> 00:25:41,792
They are suspecting the vice president sir.

442
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:44,250
Get the role call book and the
duty list and come to my cabin.

443
00:25:47,792 --> 00:25:48,667
Sir.

444
00:25:49,417 --> 00:25:50,833
How many men are there on duty right now?

445
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:52,958
Sir it is in the duty register,

446
00:25:54,792 --> 00:25:56,333
Where are Dass and head constable?

447
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:58,708
As per usual they said
they would go on beat

448
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,625
But are playing cards
behind the building, sir.

449
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:02,000
Ask them to come and meet me.

450
00:26:02,042 --> 00:26:02,833
Okay sir.

451
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:09,000
Sir?

452
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,583
I have brought them here.

453
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:13,000
Sir, greetings sir.

454
00:26:14,667 --> 00:26:16,042
What were you doing behind the building?!

455
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:17,958
Sir, we were getting ready to go on a beat.

456
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:20,375
It’s been 27 years since you joined duty.

457
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:22,667
Have you ever caught a single case.

458
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,917
You sign on as joint investigator
in somebody else’s case.

459
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:28,417
Sir, I am not doing it on purpose!

460
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,792
I even said that police is your friend.

461
00:26:30,875 --> 00:26:32,500
Still they ran as soon as they see me.

462
00:26:32,583 --> 00:26:33,708
I will do one thing,

463
00:26:33,958 --> 00:26:36,625
I will tell all criminals to
commit crimes in the station itself!

464
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,333
You, crime is prevalent everywhere!

465
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:41,750
Couldn’t you solve even
one case of among those,

466
00:26:42,417 --> 00:26:44,417
Can’t you you will learn
from the media people,

467
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,917
In Konampettai, a goat gave
birth for the first time.

468
00:26:46,958 --> 00:26:48,917
He filled a slot with this news.

469
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:53,167
Even if you had 25% of his dedication,
you would have caught a case by now.

470
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:54,917
To solve a case...

471
00:26:54,958 --> 00:26:56,292
there should be a complaint first.

472
00:26:56,458 --> 00:26:57,625
Can I go to every home and ask

473
00:26:57,708 --> 00:26:59,625
Are your children safe?

474
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:00,833
Are your cattle and pets safe?

475
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:02,750
Has your husband returned safely from work?

476
00:27:02,833 --> 00:27:04,542
Is anybody threatening you.

477
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:05,708
Has there been any theft?

478
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:07,417
Can you go and ask them all of this?

479
00:27:08,042 --> 00:27:09,958
All you can do is talk like this!

480
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:11,750
Don’t you dare solve a case.

481
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,292
I will give you one weeks time,

482
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,792
If you don’t solve a strong case?

483
00:27:17,458 --> 00:27:18,667
Disobedience

484
00:27:19,083 --> 00:27:20,625
and unfit for service

485
00:27:20,792 --> 00:27:22,375
I will write you up to higher officials.

486
00:27:22,958 --> 00:27:25,667
You have only four years
of service left, so beware!

487
00:27:25,958 --> 00:27:26,875
You Dass!

488
00:27:26,958 --> 00:27:27,792
Sir...

489
00:27:27,917 --> 00:27:29,458
Stop spending time with this man.

490
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:30,333
Okay sir.

491
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,208
I am doing this for your good, go now!

492
00:27:35,958 --> 00:27:36,708
Hey,

493
00:27:36,917 --> 00:27:39,625
Did you rat me out, because
I earn more bribes than you.

494
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:41,458
Come outside, I will take care of you!

495
00:27:41,542 --> 00:27:43,292
Sir, sir... head constable sir!

496
00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:46,708
I am in service for this many years
without knowing how to solve a case?!

497
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,250
If I start to solve cases.

498
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:49,583
This station wouldn’t be able to stand it!

499
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:04,000
Boss, is this the bag
that has dead bodies in it.

500
00:28:04,042 --> 00:28:05,875
Has sister done any murders lately?!

501
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:07,958
Sush!

502
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:09,333
Stupid bugger, it is full of documents.

503
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:11,125
It is the immovable assets of the party!

504
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:13,625
If these documents are found in the raid...

505
00:28:13,708 --> 00:28:16,667
Sister will lose all respect and honour!

506
00:28:17,958 --> 00:28:19,208
Your mission is to,

507
00:28:19,292 --> 00:28:21,208
Drive around in the vehicle all night!

508
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:24,042
Till I call you in the morning,

509
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,250
you have to keep this safe.

510
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:27,750
Not only that!

511
00:28:27,792 --> 00:28:31,208
You should never open the
bag while you are traveling!

512
00:28:31,792 --> 00:28:33,500
Swear on the lighter’s flame.

513
00:28:33,542 --> 00:28:36,083
What, don’t they usually
swear on camphor flame?

514
00:28:36,167 --> 00:28:38,042
Why, won’t you swear
on the lighter’s flame?

515
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:46,250
Close it

516
00:29:16,292 --> 00:29:17,292
Have you had anything to drink?

517
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:18,083
No sir!

518
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,083
Blow...

519
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:20,042
Shit!

520
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:21,500
What, is he drunk?

521
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,125
Sir, his breath stinks!

522
00:29:23,167 --> 00:29:24,417
- Hey, go on!
- Go!

523
00:29:29,042 --> 00:29:30,208
Head it’s the police!

524
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:32,917
Don’t open your mouth,
else we will be caught.

525
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:38,542
Blow,

526
00:29:40,292 --> 00:29:41,833
Hey, I am telling you to blow!

527
00:29:41,917 --> 00:29:43,792
Sir, he cannot speak.

528
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:45,042
Sorry bro.

529
00:29:45,292 --> 00:29:46,458
Where are you going?

530
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:48,500
Oh, is this a bank vehicle!

531
00:29:48,625 --> 00:29:49,833
Go on go!

532
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,833
They look like proper thieves!

533
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:54,333
Many cash department guys look like that.

534
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:56,833
What can we do?

535
00:29:56,875 --> 00:29:59,333
Head, just miss. If only we
had drunk like we regularly do!

536
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,417
If I had blonde he would have fainted!

537
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,458
- Head...
- Tell me hand!

538
00:30:03,542 --> 00:30:05,917
We haven’t eaten anything
because we didn’t drink today!

539
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:08,625
Since we have a night duty,
we will get hungry later!

540
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:11,792
We need money, look
for an ATM up-ahead!

541
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:13,125
Okay..!

542
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,500
Hey...

543
00:30:17,417 --> 00:30:18,917
I want to drink a lot,

544
00:30:18,958 --> 00:30:20,000
then I want to gag

545
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:22,292
and throw it all up!

546
00:30:22,875 --> 00:30:24,208
What do you want now?!

547
00:30:24,292 --> 00:30:25,750
You want to hate her

548
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,208
that’s it right?

549
00:30:27,667 --> 00:30:29,250
Then get married to her,

550
00:30:29,958 --> 00:30:31,917
automatically you will hate her!

551
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:35,333
Really, will I become better?

552
00:30:38,708 --> 00:30:40,958
Only when we are half mad,

553
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,417
We will have doubts
if we are mad or normal.

554
00:30:44,708 --> 00:30:47,333
If you go completely mad,

555
00:30:47,458 --> 00:30:50,375
we will never realise that we are mad!

556
00:30:54,917 --> 00:30:59,208
She didn’t even look at me for six
years while I worked in that office!

557
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:01,792
When I was leaving she
came and spoke to me!

558
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:04,125
That means she is in
love with me, right?

559
00:31:04,542 --> 00:31:05,375
Hey...

560
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:07,417
where did she speak to you?

561
00:31:07,958 --> 00:31:09,792
She gave the money to me!

562
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,625
Okay...

563
00:31:15,292 --> 00:31:17,333
Did you put the money in
the cash deposit machine?!

564
00:31:21,292 --> 00:31:22,375
No bro!

565
00:31:22,667 --> 00:31:23,708
Come quickly!

566
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:28,167
Come, come!

567
00:31:40,958 --> 00:31:42,167
Don’t allow anyone inside or out,

568
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:43,333
Sir, we are from CBI.

569
00:31:44,042 --> 00:31:46,167
Please go to the side
and cooperate with us.

570
00:31:56,292 --> 00:31:57,125
Sir we are from CBI,

571
00:31:57,167 --> 00:31:59,125
this is an investigation of income tax!

572
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,542
I know!

573
00:32:06,708 --> 00:32:08,208
Hey, they are here!

574
00:32:08,583 --> 00:32:10,292
Start the agitation in the market!

575
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,792
It should be thunderous.

576
00:32:17,708 --> 00:32:18,542
Hey...

577
00:32:18,833 --> 00:32:19,833
are you sure!

578
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:20,833
Fully!

579
00:32:21,333 --> 00:32:22,875
This ATM doesn’t
have a security guard!

580
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:24,667
The EMP is on.

581
00:32:24,917 --> 00:32:27,833
No cameras in a 35m radius will work

582
00:32:50,708 --> 00:32:51,750
Sir, greetings sir.

583
00:32:51,792 --> 00:32:53,458
How many times have I told you?

584
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,792
You should not have
your shop after 9 PM!

585
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:57,708
Mutton Biryani with piece is there sir!

586
00:32:57,875 --> 00:33:01,208
Last time you gave me a lot of bones,
My teeth were aching so much!

587
00:33:02,958 --> 00:33:05,292
Put some big juicy pieces and pack it!

588
00:33:28,208 --> 00:33:29,208
It’s the inspector.

589
00:33:29,292 --> 00:33:30,375
Talk and ask what he wants.

590
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:32,167
Sir, tell me sir.

591
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,625
Head constable, where are you?

592
00:33:33,917 --> 00:33:36,167
We are on beat in the market!

593
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:39,417
Near the market roundabout some
political party agitation is going on.

594
00:33:39,458 --> 00:33:40,625
Immediately go and see to it?

595
00:33:40,792 --> 00:33:41,708
Okay sir!

596
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,375
What did he say?

597
00:33:44,375 --> 00:33:47,125
Okay, you get the biryani parcel.

598
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:49,625
I will go and see what is
happening in the roundabout!

599
00:33:49,667 --> 00:33:50,917
You carry on, I will take care.

600
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:52,292
Hey,

601
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:53,125
make an half boiled egg!

602
00:33:53,167 --> 00:33:54,125
Okay sir, surely!

603
00:34:05,625 --> 00:34:07,542
Hey somebody is coming here!

604
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:13,958
Hey, it is the bank’s staff!

605
00:34:17,458 --> 00:34:18,667
Do you have the ATM card?

606
00:34:20,083 --> 00:34:21,042
Is the AC working?

607
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,417
Hey, just a minute!

608
00:34:41,708 --> 00:34:43,750
Head, look down the door is open!

609
00:34:46,708 --> 00:34:48,083
Cover your face quickly!

610
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:16,125
You sinners!

611
00:35:16,542 --> 00:35:17,792
They are robbing the ATM!

612
00:35:17,875 --> 00:35:19,458
If I am caught, that’s it for me!

613
00:35:19,625 --> 00:35:20,917
I should go and get Dass!

614
00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:25,083
Head, hurry hurry, quickly!

615
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:26,458
It’s the police, act normal!

616
00:35:42,167 --> 00:35:42,833
Hey,

617
00:35:42,917 --> 00:35:44,500
two men are robbing an ATM over there

618
00:35:44,583 --> 00:35:46,042
It is the big case we need, come quickly!

619
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:47,583
What are you saying head constable sir!

620
00:35:47,875 --> 00:35:49,167
Head constable sir,
don’t you want to the biryani?!

621
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,000
Hey!

622
00:35:50,042 --> 00:35:51,625
If I see your shop here tomorrow!

623
00:35:55,167 --> 00:35:58,208
When I saw inside one guy was wearing a
yellow T-shirt and one in a green T-shirt

624
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:00,417
They had open the ATM and
were taking the money out!

625
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,167
Immediately I got afraid!

626
00:36:02,542 --> 00:36:04,750
Finally we got this big case!

627
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,750
I am sure to become
a sub-inspector Dass!

628
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:09,958
For having trusted you...
I lost a good Biryani!

629
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,042
Turn the vehicle around!

630
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:13,292
I am telling you
such a serious matter,

631
00:36:13,375 --> 00:36:14,833
The ATM machine is open,

632
00:36:14,917 --> 00:36:16,500
there is a bank van outside,

633
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:19,292
That means the bank staff is
there to fill cash into the machine!

634
00:36:19,375 --> 00:36:22,667
and you are a mumbling that they were
robbing the ATM, turnaround I say!

635
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:24,375
What Dass...

636
00:36:24,458 --> 00:36:27,875
does this mean God has made
another April fool of me?

637
00:36:27,958 --> 00:36:29,083
First turn the vehicle around!

638
00:36:30,125 --> 00:36:31,792
Shit, how did our plan fail?!

639
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,625
Are you sure you didn’t
leave any evidence behind?

640
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:34,542
Pendrive?!

641
00:36:34,833 --> 00:36:36,125
Pendrive is in the laptop right?

642
00:36:42,625 --> 00:36:44,542
Hey, it has my complete info!

643
00:36:45,792 --> 00:36:48,000
Bro going back for it is a very big risk!

644
00:36:48,083 --> 00:36:49,583
100% we will be caught!

645
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:52,167
If you leave the pen drive there
200% we will be caught!

646
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:53,458
Come.

647
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:57,875
These bank staffers are so dedicated!

648
00:36:57,917 --> 00:36:59,667
They are working in
the middle of the night!

649
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,458
I guess they too are like us.

650
00:37:04,583 --> 00:37:06,875
What? Is a bone stuck in your throat?

651
00:37:08,792 --> 00:37:10,958
The cash delivery service people...

652
00:37:11,042 --> 00:37:12,542
Who put money into the ATM machines...

653
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:15,167
are you supposed to only work before 6 PM?

654
00:37:15,958 --> 00:37:18,083
There must be some emergency today.

655
00:37:18,708 --> 00:37:21,958
Even I doubted those two were in the ATM.

656
00:37:23,167 --> 00:37:25,167
Also the only security
force person wasn’t there!

657
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:27,667
Won’t I feel doubt?!

658
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:31,292
Oh my God!

659
00:37:34,167 --> 00:37:36,125
Hey, God. I am sorry I am drunk...

660
00:37:52,083 --> 00:37:54,833
Do you know if there is
a cash deposit machine here?

661
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:56,875
You’ll only know if you go and see.

662
00:38:06,042 --> 00:38:07,375
Hey, the ATM is open.

663
00:38:07,542 --> 00:38:08,958
That is a good thing right?!

664
00:38:09,167 --> 00:38:11,333
You fool, look the ATM
machine is open like this!

665
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,292
Definitely somebody has
tried to rob the ATM,

666
00:38:16,375 --> 00:38:17,292
Come let us go.

667
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:19,708
Didn’t I tell you?!

668
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:20,625
Yellow shirt and green shirt!

669
00:38:20,708 --> 00:38:22,083
- It’s the police!
- They are caught!

670
00:38:24,625 --> 00:38:26,417
Then, have you taken all the money?!

671
00:38:26,458 --> 00:38:28,333
Sir, we came to deposit money sir.

672
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:29,125
How much?

673
00:38:29,208 --> 00:38:31,833
Rs.80,000 sir. 40,000 each!

674
00:38:31,917 --> 00:38:35,083
See they have followed government
regulations even while stealing!

675
00:38:35,167 --> 00:38:36,750
Take the money out,

676
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,333
Sir it belongs to a friend!

677
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,208
Oh!

678
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,250
So you divide the shares here itself?

679
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:42,500
Take the money out!

680
00:38:43,042 --> 00:38:44,458
I need that to patch
up with my lover sir.

681
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,375
Oh to patch up with your lover...

682
00:38:46,583 --> 00:38:48,708
You have to rob an ATM
and give the money to her?!

683
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:49,792
Sure, no sir...

684
00:38:49,875 --> 00:38:51,333
Dass, put the bike up here.

685
00:38:51,542 --> 00:38:53,375
They deserve...
Sir, I came to deposit the cash.

686
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,167
Hey, we never went inside.

687
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,083
Sir, sir!

688
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,125
- Sir, we didn’t do anything!
- I can see it in your face clearly!

689
00:38:59,083 --> 00:38:59,958
Sit here.

690
00:39:00,583 --> 00:39:01,500
Hey, start the auto.

691
00:39:01,542 --> 00:39:02,167
Move

692
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:02,958
Wait Dass.

693
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:15,917
Hello...

694
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:18,417
Sir, a big incident has happened!

695
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:21,000
And we caught the accused red-handed.

696
00:39:21,083 --> 00:39:22,458
Sure, I am not an accused...

697
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,792
Don’t talk while I am talking!

698
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:25,083
What is happening over there?

699
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:26,875
It is an ATM robbery sir.

700
00:39:27,375 --> 00:39:28,375
There’s two of them.

701
00:39:28,792 --> 00:39:30,667
They have clearly broken in
and taken the cash sir.

702
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:31,667
Which ATM?

703
00:39:31,708 --> 00:39:33,958
The B.O.B ATM near the market!

704
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:35,375
Have you apprehended the criminal.

705
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:36,417
Yes we have sir!

706
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:37,583
We have recovered the money

707
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:40,333
Now we are securely transporting
the accused to the station!

708
00:39:40,417 --> 00:39:41,000
Please tell him sir!

709
00:39:41,042 --> 00:39:41,875
Shut up!

710
00:39:41,917 --> 00:39:42,750
How much cash did you get?

711
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:45,042
More or less, around 80 sir

712
00:39:45,125 --> 00:39:46,250
80 lakhs?

713
00:39:46,292 --> 00:39:48,167
Sir 80 thousand, sir.

714
00:39:48,333 --> 00:39:50,042
To hell with you and your...

715
00:39:50,917 --> 00:39:52,208
What kind of a robbery cases is this?!

716
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:55,333
Set aside 40 from that 80!

717
00:39:55,667 --> 00:39:57,958
Sir, is this really you?!

718
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,167
Head Constable, we should
live as per the world.

719
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,667
Rightly said sir!

720
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:03,833
Sir, also the other thing is...

721
00:40:03,917 --> 00:40:05,958
I couldn’t go to the riot!

722
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,042
Sorry sir

723
00:40:07,167 --> 00:40:08,833
Leave it, don’t go there!

724
00:40:08,917 --> 00:40:11,458
There is an IT raid on the
central minister’s home,

725
00:40:12,792 --> 00:40:14,583
You have got a big case
for the very first time,

726
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:16,125
Come to the station,
we will talk about it.

727
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:17,333
- Okay?
- Okay sir!

728
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:23,250
Hey, take a 407 with you...

729
00:40:23,292 --> 00:40:26,125
Whoever is there where
the riot is happening,

730
00:40:26,167 --> 00:40:28,583
Round them all up and bring
them to the station.

731
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:30,792
Dass...

732
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:31,958
Head Constable sir!

733
00:40:31,958 --> 00:40:33,792
They said we can never solve a case.

734
00:40:35,458 --> 00:40:36,875
What a great case we have got!

735
00:40:36,958 --> 00:40:38,625
Let us go and show
everyone in the station!

736
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:39,875
Yes, let us!

737
00:40:40,167 --> 00:40:41,042
Dass,

738
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:42,625
I forgot my cap at the biryani stall.

739
00:40:42,667 --> 00:40:43,750
You keep forgetting everything.

740
00:40:43,792 --> 00:40:45,042
Hey don’t tease me!

741
00:40:52,042 --> 00:40:52,917
Did you get it?

742
00:40:54,333 --> 00:40:55,375
Yes I got it, you go!

743
00:40:56,125 --> 00:40:58,292
Sir, sir. I haven’t done anything sir.

744
00:40:58,333 --> 00:41:00,208
Why don’t you listen to me sir!

745
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,458
Sir, sir.

746
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,958
Sir, please no!

747
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,417
Sir, I will burn myself right here.

748
00:41:05,458 --> 00:41:07,625
Sir!
Hey...

749
00:41:07,667 --> 00:41:09,833
You look a baby elephant!

750
00:41:10,792 --> 00:41:12,667
Is this much for today enough for you?!

751
00:41:12,708 --> 00:41:17,208
Head writer sir, please take down the
statement from both those ATM robbers.

752
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:19,917
Sir! We haven’t done
any robberies!

753
00:41:19,958 --> 00:41:22,500
There is a murder case,
would you prefer that?

754
00:41:22,958 --> 00:41:23,750
Sir?!

755
00:41:23,792 --> 00:41:25,500
What are you saying sir?!

756
00:41:25,542 --> 00:41:26,708
What is your problem?!

757
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:29,667
Sure, the Ashram people
took my wife away...

758
00:41:29,708 --> 00:41:32,833
After she’s gone there she’s
making nonsensical videos!

759
00:41:32,875 --> 00:41:35,208
Please somehow rescue and
return my wife to me!

760
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:36,417
So it’s gone, it’s gone right?!

761
00:41:36,458 --> 00:41:38,917
After all of this what
will you do with her?!

762
00:41:38,958 --> 00:41:42,250
Dass, check their pockets
and remove anything in it.

763
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:44,792
Why sir...?
Come on empty your pockets!

764
00:41:44,833 --> 00:41:46,083
What is he saying?

765
00:41:46,125 --> 00:41:47,958
Hey, tomorrow we will have to
take the accused to the court.

766
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,708
We will need petrol for that,
so take this and use it!

767
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,500
But petrol is mine sir.

768
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:53,750
Hey, when your life is not yours anymore.

769
00:41:53,833 --> 00:41:55,958
What will you do with this?

770
00:41:56,292 --> 00:41:57,625
Go on, get out of here!

771
00:41:57,667 --> 00:41:58,250
Sir!

772
00:41:58,292 --> 00:41:59,125
Keep this aside!

773
00:41:59,375 --> 00:42:00,167
What are you thinking?

774
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:01,833
Person and other things.

775
00:42:01,875 --> 00:42:03,042
Hey, send that guy out of the station!

776
00:42:03,458 --> 00:42:06,083
Don’t shout come quietly!

777
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:07,958
Long-live sister!
Long-live sister!

778
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,250
Both of your remove your dress.

779
00:42:09,292 --> 00:42:10,583
Remove it.
Sir...

780
00:42:10,625 --> 00:42:12,083
Quickly, remove it!
Why sir!

781
00:42:12,125 --> 00:42:13,792
Down with IT raid,
Long-live Sister!

782
00:42:13,833 --> 00:42:16,458

786
00:42:25,625 --> 00:42:27,083
Hey what is your problem?!

787
00:42:27,125 --> 00:42:29,583
Is IT companies come from somewhere else,
and are turning our people into slaves.

788
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:32,917
Yes sir,

789
00:42:32,958 --> 00:42:33,958
They have brought us
to the police station.

790
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,750
Completely wreak the station!

791
00:42:35,792 --> 00:42:37,250
Okay sir!

792
00:42:37,292 --> 00:42:39,333
- Hey, you are an activist right?!
- Yes!

793
00:42:39,375 --> 00:42:40,917
You think information technology
people are conducting the raid?!

794
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:43,292
Police brutality towards common people,
must be stooped immediately!

795
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:46,625
Down with Police!
Corrupt Police be damned!

796
00:42:46,667 --> 00:42:50,500
Silence, silence! Go and protest in
front of the house that is raided!

797
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,000
Bring the inspector here!
Police have to answer to us!

798
00:42:53,042 --> 00:42:56,042
Send the inspector to stop the raid!

799
00:42:56,083 --> 00:42:58,208
If you keep making a ruckus

800
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:59,542
I will put you all in the cell!

801
00:42:59,583 --> 00:43:00,542
Be quiet everyone.

802
00:43:00,583 --> 00:43:01,583
Move!

803
00:43:01,625 --> 00:43:05,667
To protest the police brutality
I am going to set myself on fire!

804
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:07,500
Hey stop!

805
00:43:07,542 --> 00:43:10,083
Let go of me!
Down with police brutality!

806
00:43:10,125 --> 00:43:10,875
Listen to me!

807
00:43:10,917 --> 00:43:13,500
Corrupt and unjust police
department must be damned!

808
00:43:13,542 --> 00:43:15,833
Let go of me!

809
00:43:15,875 --> 00:43:19,250
Let me go!

810
00:43:19,292 --> 00:43:21,917
Give that fuel can hear!

811
00:43:21,917 --> 00:43:23,375
Move... Hello!

812
00:43:23,417 --> 00:43:24,833
What is that ruckus?

813
00:43:24,875 --> 00:43:28,500
Sir the protesters we arrested, are
making a huge riot in the station!

814
00:43:28,542 --> 00:43:30,875
Hey I told you not to do anything!

815
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:32,333
Police brutality!

816
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:33,583
Beat and send everyone outside!

817
00:43:33,625 --> 00:43:35,333
Police brutality be damned!

818
00:43:35,333 --> 00:43:36,583
Lathi Charge!

819
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,042
Good thing they all are now gone!
What, the entire station is empty?!

820
00:44:08,958 --> 00:44:11,333
Sir, I have kept the 40
thousand in your drawer!

821
00:44:11,375 --> 00:44:13,208
The rest I have kept in the safe.

822
00:44:13,208 --> 00:44:14,375
Where are the accused?!

823
00:44:14,375 --> 00:44:15,833
They’re sitting here outside sir!

824
00:44:15,875 --> 00:44:17,125
Why haven’t you put them in the cell?

825
00:44:17,125 --> 00:44:18,500
The cell is full!

826
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:31,458
Where are they?

827
00:44:32,208 --> 00:44:33,458
Where did they go?

828
00:44:34,833 --> 00:44:36,167
Where, I don’t know!

829
00:44:38,292 --> 00:44:38,917
Sir,

830
00:44:38,958 --> 00:44:40,333
Where are the accused?

831
00:44:41,958 --> 00:44:44,500
Sure, the bank manager is here.

832
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,083
Please come sir!

833
00:44:45,125 --> 00:44:49,708
Constable, check all the
CCTV cameras near the ATM!

834
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:52,458
The robbers must have been
caught on at least one of them.

835
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,292
One person cannot do this alone.

836
00:44:54,333 --> 00:44:57,625
You told me on the phone you have
arrested the robbers already!

837
00:44:57,667 --> 00:44:59,750
I only told you that the
robbery had happened!

838
00:44:59,792 --> 00:45:01,375
You sure it was two people!

839
00:45:01,417 --> 00:45:04,083
Yes, head constable and
constable had been there.

840
00:45:04,125 --> 00:45:05,292
Those are the two I mentioned.

841
00:45:05,333 --> 00:45:06,750
Then who robbed...

842
00:45:06,792 --> 00:45:08,708
Do you know who robbed the ATM?!

843
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:11,250
No sir, you proceed with the case sir.

844
00:45:13,958 --> 00:45:15,625
How much cash did you recover sir!

845
00:45:15,667 --> 00:45:16,792
40 thousand sir!

846
00:45:21,542 --> 00:45:23,292
We only found 40,000 in the ATM machine,

847
00:45:23,292 --> 00:45:24,667
How much balance does your account show!

848
00:45:26,042 --> 00:45:28,042
13 lakhs and 80 thousand sir,

849
00:45:29,042 --> 00:45:30,583
13.8 lakhs!

850
00:45:36,042 --> 00:45:39,042
What sir, they say there is no
money in the ATM machines?

851
00:45:39,083 --> 00:45:41,042
Are you trying to do a side hustle?!

852
00:45:41,083 --> 00:45:42,958
Sir I am an honest man!

853
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:46,875
Come sir, let us talk in private!

854
00:45:47,542 --> 00:45:49,750
I too am an honest inspector.

855
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,875
I will file the FIR for 13 lakhs!

856
00:45:55,958 --> 00:45:58,667
Six lakhs for you and six lakhs for me!

857
00:45:58,708 --> 00:45:59,833
Deal okay?

858
00:45:59,875 --> 00:46:01,583
The deal would be nice but,

859
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:04,542
We can only do that if we had 13 lakhs.

860
00:46:04,583 --> 00:46:06,167
We only have 40 thousand!

861
00:46:06,208 --> 00:46:07,958
I said mean you are really lost 13 lakhs.

862
00:46:08,042 --> 00:46:11,333
Yes sir, 13 lakhs 80 thousand sir!

863
00:46:14,333 --> 00:46:16,542
Okay, you please wait inside.
Head constable...

864
00:46:21,667 --> 00:46:24,958
What head constable, how can you
want to pocket all the 13 lakhs?!

865
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,625
I am still your senior officer right?!

866
00:46:28,667 --> 00:46:29,792
8 and 5.

867
00:46:29,833 --> 00:46:31,667
8 for me 5 for you.

868
00:46:31,708 --> 00:46:33,958
Sir, I swear I did not take it!

869
00:46:37,417 --> 00:46:39,208
Sir the CCTV footage is here.

870
00:46:40,417 --> 00:46:41,750
Okay, these are the thieves!

871
00:46:50,583 --> 00:46:52,125
Please wait there for a minute.

872
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:56,083
What, there are two accused in the video!

873
00:46:56,125 --> 00:46:57,958
There too were wearing yellow
shirt and green shirt sir!

874
00:46:58,042 --> 00:46:59,750
So you have given the 13 lakhs
to them and sent them away!

875
00:46:59,792 --> 00:47:01,542
Sir,

876
00:47:01,583 --> 00:47:03,625
I am completely innocent sir.

877
00:47:03,667 --> 00:47:05,750
Now you have two options head constable

878
00:47:05,792 --> 00:47:07,375
Option 1,

879
00:47:07,375 --> 00:47:09,000
Aiding a robbery,

880
00:47:09,042 --> 00:47:10,792
Miss using the uniform and

881
00:47:10,792 --> 00:47:14,708
Letting the accused escape.
and a total of 13 cases will be filed

882
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:16,500
and I will safely send you to jail!

883
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:17,958
Option 2,

884
00:47:17,958 --> 00:47:20,292
Get me the 13 lakhs that you have stolen!

885
00:47:20,292 --> 00:47:22,875
I will give you five lakhs from that!

886
00:47:22,917 --> 00:47:25,458
Who did the work and who is profiting?

887
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,333
I will even recommend you for a promotion!

888
00:47:27,375 --> 00:47:29,333
Sir...
Choice is yours.

889
00:47:29,333 --> 00:47:31,167
I am innocent sir.

890
00:47:31,208 --> 00:47:33,125
I have four more years of service.

891
00:47:33,167 --> 00:47:34,958
Don’t cost me, my pension sir.

892
00:47:35,042 --> 00:47:36,458
When did I cost you anything?!

893
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,292
You are the one who is costing himself.

894
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:41,583
The state government has already
cost us all do you know this?!

895
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:43,042
Go on.

896
00:47:43,875 --> 00:47:45,250
This way!

897
00:47:47,333 --> 00:47:48,250
Dass...

898
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,417
Dass!
Sir...

899
00:47:51,042 --> 00:47:51,958
Out!

900
00:47:52,292 --> 00:47:53,417
Station is empty.

901
00:47:53,458 --> 00:47:54,750
Manager!

902
00:47:54,792 --> 00:47:55,750
Yes sir!

903
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,417
We will arrest the accused within 48 hours

904
00:47:59,458 --> 00:48:01,625
You can leave for now.

905
00:48:05,542 --> 00:48:08,417
I too should somehow
get a seat on the bus.

906
00:48:15,833 --> 00:48:17,542
Tea stall lady, put two glasses of tea.

907
00:48:18,833 --> 00:48:22,083
Head, what you are reading newspapers!

908
00:48:22,125 --> 00:48:24,083
Do you know how to read?

909
00:48:24,125 --> 00:48:26,917
Do I need a medical degree to
look at Nayantara’s photos?!

910
00:48:26,958 --> 00:48:28,875
A B.O.B ATM has been burglarized!

911
00:48:28,917 --> 00:48:34,833
A man in a yellow shirt and another in a
green shirt are clearly seen during the robbery!

912
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:02,875
Brother, brother...

913
00:49:03,208 --> 00:49:04,167
your tea?!

914
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:13,833
Where did they go?

915
00:49:32,333 --> 00:49:32,917
Hey,

916
00:49:33,875 --> 00:49:36,583
I never thought that our
lives would end this early!

917
00:49:36,833 --> 00:49:39,000
I haven’t even begun to live.

918
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:40,708
Hey what did we do wrong?

919
00:49:48,958 --> 00:49:50,500
What did you guys say?

920
00:49:50,875 --> 00:49:53,458
We won’t be able to get
liquor from Pondicherry!

921
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,917
Now see how I have brought it here.

922
00:49:56,375 --> 00:49:57,750
You are amazing bro!

923
00:49:58,042 --> 00:49:59,792
We can drink inside the
police vehicle itself

924
00:49:59,833 --> 00:50:01,500
We can even have a party in it!

925
00:50:01,542 --> 00:50:02,542
You are superb bro!

926
00:50:02,542 --> 00:50:04,583
Thank you for everything!

927
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:06,125
We’re meaning to hiring
a shooting vehicle.

928
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,500
Hey, who are you?

929
00:50:31,375 --> 00:50:32,375
What work do you have here?

930
00:50:32,417 --> 00:50:33,542
Sorry grandpa...

931
00:50:33,583 --> 00:50:34,625
we came to take a piss.

932
00:50:34,667 --> 00:50:37,125
No no, you should not come here.

933
00:50:37,542 --> 00:50:39,083
we are very good boys grandpa.

934
00:50:39,958 --> 00:50:41,625
We are not ATM robbers!

935
00:50:41,917 --> 00:50:45,125
I don’t care who you are!
I will break your head open.

936
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:46,500
Go,

937
00:50:46,542 --> 00:50:47,333
go!

938
00:50:58,958 --> 00:50:59,958
Hey...

939
00:51:00,042 --> 00:51:02,250
We cannot go back into the city.

940
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:04,125
Our news is out on TV.

941
00:51:05,042 --> 00:51:05,792
Hey,

942
00:51:05,792 --> 00:51:10,500
We need to get through tonight,
we should hide somewhere somehow!

943
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:11,125
Okay come.

944
00:51:11,917 --> 00:51:13,958
Hey wait! There is another vehicle...

945
00:51:15,875 --> 00:51:17,208
Hey, who are you?

946
00:51:17,625 --> 00:51:18,333
Sir.

947
00:51:18,333 --> 00:51:20,625
What work do you have here?

948
00:51:21,458 --> 00:51:22,583
No no!

949
00:51:22,625 --> 00:51:23,958
You should not come here

950
00:51:25,167 --> 00:51:26,958
I don’t care who you go

951
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:28,542
I will break your head open.

952
00:51:28,917 --> 00:51:29,750
Go...

953
00:51:29,792 --> 00:51:30,833
go!!!!

954
00:51:31,417 --> 00:51:32,833
Sir,
Sir!

955
00:51:32,833 --> 00:51:33,542
Its me.

956
00:51:33,917 --> 00:51:35,125
Yes, it’s me

957
00:51:35,167 --> 00:51:36,083
Is it you?

958
00:51:36,625 --> 00:51:37,917
I have brought you food.

959
00:51:38,417 --> 00:51:39,417
- Is it food sir?
- Yes

960
00:51:39,958 --> 00:51:40,958
You go sir,

961
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,292
You please leave

962
00:51:42,625 --> 00:51:43,917
I will take care of
everything, you please go.

963
00:51:44,458 --> 00:51:45,208
Please go sir.

964
00:51:45,917 --> 00:51:46,792
Please go.

965
00:51:50,667 --> 00:51:54,958
What sir, you have put a blind and deaf man as
security for this property under litigation.

966
00:51:54,958 --> 00:51:56,833
He’s like a snake,

967
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,542
he is blind and deaf

968
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:02,167
But you will not let
anybody know about it.

969
00:52:02,208 --> 00:52:05,083
The dialogue his speaks
will match everybody.

970
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:07,292
and since he looks terrifying

971
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:08,875
Nobody will dare enter.

972
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:11,083
He is the best option for this property.

973
00:52:11,417 --> 00:52:12,833
Okay come, let’s go.

974
00:52:18,625 --> 00:52:20,458
Bro, the bike is gone.

975
00:52:23,583 --> 00:52:24,875
Hey, who are you?

976
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:28,792
What work do you have here?

977
00:52:28,833 --> 00:52:31,958
No no, you shouldn’t come here!

978
00:52:32,042 --> 00:52:33,917
I don’t care who you are,

979
00:52:33,958 --> 00:52:36,500
I will break your head open, go!

980
00:52:36,542 --> 00:52:37,750
Go...!

981
00:52:53,458 --> 00:52:56,417
"Yellow shirt, green shirt
Yellow shirt, green shirt"

982
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,083
Bro, is all of this liquor bro?

983
00:53:06,125 --> 00:53:07,708
Hey be careful with that!

984
00:53:08,875 --> 00:53:09,750
Close it.

985
00:53:12,167 --> 00:53:13,625
Bro come here for a second,

986
00:53:13,625 --> 00:53:15,833
If I leave it with the boys
they will finish it at once.

987
00:53:15,833 --> 00:53:18,208
You bring it to the Marriage
Hall tomorrow evening.

988
00:53:29,083 --> 00:53:30,375
Hey why are you crying?

989
00:53:30,917 --> 00:53:34,167
Get lost.
You are always peeing through the eyes.

990
00:53:34,167 --> 00:53:36,583
and still there is water shortage everywhere.

991
00:53:36,625 --> 00:53:37,833
Head constable...

992
00:53:37,875 --> 00:53:39,333
My father got me this job,

993
00:53:39,375 --> 00:53:41,542
by borrowing four lakhs for the bribe.

994
00:53:41,542 --> 00:53:43,333
Do you know what he told
me when I joined duty?

995
00:53:43,417 --> 00:53:44,417
Hey Dass,

996
00:53:44,417 --> 00:53:46,250
Two months after you get this job,

997
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:47,750
Please pay of this debt.

998
00:53:47,792 --> 00:53:50,000
Because I am joined with
you I have become useless!

999
00:53:50,042 --> 00:53:52,458
What, six lakhs in two months?!

1000
00:53:52,458 --> 00:53:55,333
Dass, I have completed 27 years of service.

1001
00:53:55,375 --> 00:53:57,667
I have never seen this
amount in my entire life!

1002
00:53:57,708 --> 00:53:58,958
You are cheap bugger!

1003
00:53:59,042 --> 00:54:00,833
Why are you comparing me to you?

1004
00:54:00,875 --> 00:54:03,458
Okay come let us drink some
tea and think about it!

1005
00:54:05,042 --> 00:54:06,542
Give us two glasses of tea.

1006
00:54:06,542 --> 00:54:07,792
Sir, we are out of milk.

1007
00:54:08,583 --> 00:54:10,750
I will pay you for it just
give us two glasses of tea.

1008
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,750
Dass

1009
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,083
If we catch those too hardened crooks...

1010
00:54:17,083 --> 00:54:18,958
Then all of our problems will be solved.

1011
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,375
How are you going to catch them?

1012
00:54:20,417 --> 00:54:21,625
And that too within 48 hours.

1013
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:23,458
Don’t worry about it!

1014
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:26,708
Before leaving the station I cut a coin
as an offering to Ara Kaasu Amman!

1015
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:27,958
We will find them very soon.

1016
00:54:27,958 --> 00:54:28,792
You and your...!

1017
00:54:29,125 --> 00:54:30,542
Believe me Dass!

1018
00:54:30,583 --> 00:54:32,708
Just like this, I lost
my mobile one day.

1019
00:54:33,292 --> 00:54:34,750
Then my wife gave me this idea.

1020
00:54:34,792 --> 00:54:37,708
She said pray to Ara Kaasu Amman
and you will find your mobile,

1021
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:38,667
I found it that very day!

1022
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:39,750
Where was it!

1023
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:42,625
When I finished my duty, I
forgot it in the station itself.

1024
00:54:42,958 --> 00:54:45,958
Play that you lost the yellow
shirt and green shirt guys

1025
00:54:45,958 --> 00:54:47,792
in the station itself!
Do you remember that?

1026
00:54:48,125 --> 00:54:51,833
What sir, are you trying to
solve the ATM robbery?

1027
00:54:51,833 --> 00:54:54,917
You should only do
tea stall related work.

1028
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:55,625
Do you understand?

1029
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:58,167
You are looking for the red yellow
shirt and green shirt guys no sir?!

1030
00:54:58,208 --> 00:55:01,250
They showed the CCTV
footage on the news no sir!

1031
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:04,375
We are looking for some other
yellow shirt and green shirt guys!

1032
00:55:04,917 --> 00:55:07,500
Curly hair, fair skin

1033
00:55:07,542 --> 00:55:08,917
Just a little fat,

1034
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:11,500
They came and drank tea here sir.

1035
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:13,792
Dass, I told you right!

1036
00:55:13,833 --> 00:55:15,792
It is all the doing of Ara Kaasu Amman!

1037
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:17,375
What else do you know?

1038
00:55:18,917 --> 00:55:20,375
Look at this sir!

1039
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:24,833
Was this photo posted by your friend?

1040
00:55:25,708 --> 00:55:26,667
Ask for his phone number.

1041
00:55:26,708 --> 00:55:28,375
Why do you need the phone number?

1042
00:55:28,417 --> 00:55:29,583
To trace their location.

1043
00:55:29,583 --> 00:55:30,458
Oh God!

1044
00:55:32,833 --> 00:55:33,833
Look at this!

1045
00:55:33,875 --> 00:55:36,333
‘Old Marriage Hall Bus Stop’

1046
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:38,333
Dass, come quickly!

1047
00:55:38,708 --> 00:55:40,375
What kind of police are they?!

1048
00:55:44,208 --> 00:55:47,250
Dass, Ara Kaasu Amman didn’t
abandon us, we got the location!

1049
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,875
He has nothing on the outside
of his head, nor on the inside.

1050
00:55:49,917 --> 00:55:51,958
The correct location,
look at that board.

1051
00:55:58,917 --> 00:56:00,542
Hey, who are you?

1052
00:56:00,583 --> 00:56:02,083
Hey, we are the police!

1053
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:04,167
What work do you have here?

1054
00:56:04,208 --> 00:56:05,542
We have come for rounds.

1055
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:09,167
No no, you should
not come here.

1056
00:56:09,208 --> 00:56:10,750
Hey, you’re talking too much!

1057
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:11,458
We are police!

1058
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,458
I don’t care who you are
I will break open your head!

1059
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:15,208
Go away!

1060
00:56:15,458 --> 00:56:17,292
Oh my god, save me!
Run away Dass.

1061
00:56:21,792 --> 00:56:22,458
Dass,

1062
00:56:23,292 --> 00:56:26,833
Head constable sir,
he doesn’t fear police!

1063
00:56:26,875 --> 00:56:28,167
He must be a big time rowdy!

1064
00:56:28,542 --> 00:56:29,625
He could even be mad!

1065
00:56:29,667 --> 00:56:31,125
That is even more dangerous!

1066
00:56:31,167 --> 00:56:33,458
Dass, please go and get the bike.

1067
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:34,417
Me?!

1068
00:56:34,458 --> 00:56:35,958
Please go and get it.

1069
00:56:36,333 --> 00:56:37,375
I will go.

1070
00:56:37,417 --> 00:56:39,042
I am not even married.

1071
00:56:47,625 --> 00:56:50,083
Head constable sir, for
sure they are not here!

1072
00:56:50,875 --> 00:56:52,375
How can you be so sure?

1073
00:56:53,875 --> 00:56:55,458
They have looted 13 lakhs.

1074
00:56:55,542 --> 00:56:57,125
Will they be here in this
mosquito infested place?

1075
00:56:57,708 --> 00:56:59,125
By now they would have
booked a room somewhere

1076
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:00,708
I would have made some setup

1077
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,833
They would be jolly in an AC room.

1078
00:57:02,833 --> 00:57:03,833
Hey,

1079
00:57:04,375 --> 00:57:06,750
tomorrow they will put us in the jail.

1080
00:57:06,792 --> 00:57:08,958
Hey wash your mouth with soap.

1081
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,375
By the time we went there the
ATM machine was already open.

1082
00:57:12,042 --> 00:57:13,583
We haven’t stolen anything!

1083
00:57:14,958 --> 00:57:16,875
Why do things like this
keep happening to us?

1084
00:57:18,208 --> 00:57:22,042
Sir, what have you recovered in your raid?

1085
00:57:22,333 --> 00:57:23,042
No comments.

1086
00:57:23,083 --> 00:57:25,250
Sir rumour is that, there are
ulterior motives for this raid

1087
00:57:25,292 --> 00:57:26,625
Look here!

1088
00:57:26,667 --> 00:57:30,625
We came to my house in the middle of
the night and have trashed the place,

1089
00:57:30,667 --> 00:57:32,458
Ask them what they found?

1090
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:33,625
Yes sir, please tell us what you found

1091
00:57:33,667 --> 00:57:36,625
You run a train like scroll reading
‘IT raid at Paagambariya’s House’

1092
00:57:36,667 --> 00:57:39,125
Now ask them.

1093
00:57:39,167 --> 00:57:40,833
Sir tell us what you found.

1094
00:57:40,875 --> 00:57:42,125
No comments.

1095
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:44,083
Yeah ‘no comments’ I will tell you!

1096
00:57:44,125 --> 00:57:46,542
All they will ever find in
my house is some spices.

1097
00:57:46,583 --> 00:57:49,333
I will boldly claim that they didn’t find
anything, let them contradicted it.

1098
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:52,500
Nowadays IT department,
and vigilance are acting like hired guns.

1099
00:57:52,542 --> 00:57:57,000
People say that do not want project welfare
I am only echoing their voices,

1100
00:57:57,042 --> 00:57:59,042
In four months there will be an election.

1101
00:57:59,083 --> 00:58:02,125
Nobody who has opposed me has even
recovered their deposit. Why is that?

1102
00:58:02,167 --> 00:58:05,833
Because I am in the hearts of the people.

1103
00:58:05,875 --> 00:58:07,125
To defeat Paagambariya

1104
00:58:07,167 --> 00:58:09,250
that too in his own fort.

1105
00:58:09,292 --> 00:58:13,411
They must first take him out
of the hearts of the people.

1106
00:58:13,436 --> 00:58:15,274
Hence they are making many plans.

1107
00:58:16,348 --> 00:58:19,292
I will never support project welfare!

1108
00:58:20,958 --> 00:58:22,750
More than this political seats,

1109
00:58:23,349 --> 00:58:25,495
I will cherish the seat I
hold in people’s hearts.

1110
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:26,600
That is more than enough for me.

1111
00:58:26,625 --> 00:58:31,182
Opposing the IT raids on central
minister Paagambariya’s home,

1112
00:58:31,207 --> 00:58:36,248
His supporters outcry and people’s
support has risen strongly!

1113
00:58:50,127 --> 00:58:53,892
35 years’ political experience Mr Judhani!

1114
00:58:53,917 --> 00:58:56,875
Just holding 12 percentage vote bank,

1115
00:58:56,917 --> 00:59:01,375
You need exceptional strength to hold
onto a seat in five elections.

1116
00:59:01,766 --> 00:59:04,808
Go, go and watch all the TV networks.

1117
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:07,808
I am converting the IT raid that
you planned into my strength!

1118
00:59:07,833 --> 00:59:09,933
Though the entire country,

1119
00:59:09,958 --> 00:59:12,167
Is ready to oppose this project.

1120
00:59:12,208 --> 00:59:15,767
When the concerned department’s
minister opposes it.

1121
00:59:15,808 --> 00:59:19,433
There is no bigger
sensation for the media.

1122
00:59:19,458 --> 00:59:22,208
There is no bigger
revolution for the people.

1123
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:23,292
Trending,

1124
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,417
Trending in all forms of media!

1125
00:59:25,417 --> 00:59:28,292
Paagambariya is today’s victory mantra.

1126
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:32,333
A true politician is who makes
his weakness is his strength!

1127
00:59:32,833 --> 00:59:35,375
The IT raid was not meant to catch you,

1128
00:59:35,417 --> 00:59:36,958
I know that isn’t possible.

1129
00:59:37,333 --> 00:59:38,875
It was just to show you that

1130
00:59:38,917 --> 00:59:44,042
Judhani’s reach can shake
up the IT department.

1131
00:59:45,458 --> 00:59:47,875
Though the elephant is very big.

1132
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:50,875
The smallest ant can trouble it!

1133
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:54,750
Beware maybe there is an ant
that is out there looking for you?

1134
00:59:55,333 --> 00:59:59,875
Tonight a private bank’s ATM
was burglarised in Retro Nagar.

1135
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:04,958
Two men wearing a yellow shirt and a green shirt are
clearly seen stealing money from the ATM machine.

1136
01:00:04,958 --> 01:00:07,458
Every elephant will have an ant Judhani.

1137
01:00:10,583 --> 01:00:12,625
Hey, what is this?

1138
01:00:13,083 --> 01:00:15,500
It’s like asking the
fox to guard the sheep!

1139
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:20,292
Instead of two fools you have selected two
criminals and handed over 22 crores to them.

1140
01:00:20,333 --> 01:00:22,750
There is no chance of that sis,
both of them are complete fools!

1141
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:25,333
I might find it hard to
recognise intelligence,

1142
01:00:25,833 --> 01:00:27,458
I will easily identify fools!

1143
01:00:27,458 --> 01:00:28,833
It’s like birds of a feather.

1144
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,250
Something wrong has happened sis!

1145
01:00:32,208 --> 01:00:33,958
You are right Ekambaram,

1146
01:00:33,958 --> 01:00:37,375
When they have 22 crores if
they have gone to rob an ATM...

1147
01:00:38,042 --> 01:00:39,208
They are truly fools!

1148
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:43,708
It is believed that this was orchestrated
by corporate broker Dilip Judhani,

1149
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:47,042
#Paagambariya4CM is trending worldwide.

1150
01:00:47,708 --> 01:00:50,542
After these many years in politics,

1151
01:00:50,542 --> 01:00:53,167
I have earned a lot of money Ekambaram,

1152
01:00:53,208 --> 01:00:57,667
but a place in people’s hearts
every politician dreams of that throne.

1153
01:00:59,208 --> 01:01:01,292
That is why we all fight!

1154
01:01:01,333 --> 01:01:04,667
Please sacrificing this money is
the only way I will get power

1155
01:01:04,708 --> 01:01:06,625
I will do that.

1156
01:01:06,667 --> 01:01:12,625
Today people see me as an idol of
honesty, we should not damage that!

1157
01:01:12,625 --> 01:01:19,125
The money, those two boys and
no evidence should survive!

1158
01:01:19,125 --> 01:01:24,042
Finish them!
I have just hit the Jackpot!

1159
01:02:19,167 --> 01:02:20,208
What sir...?

1160
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,167
She is actually a foreigner sir.

1161
01:02:22,583 --> 01:02:24,458
I know what the problem is

1162
01:02:24,958 --> 01:02:26,750
and I know how serious it is.

1163
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:28,542
That is why I called you.

1164
01:02:30,667 --> 01:02:33,167
Sir is not joke, it’s an embassy issue!

1165
01:02:33,208 --> 01:02:34,417
But you are the DCP.

1166
01:02:34,458 --> 01:02:36,208
Everything is under your control.

1167
01:02:36,208 --> 01:02:37,958
It’s not that I can’t do it...

1168
01:02:38,667 --> 01:02:41,083
The more zeroes you put after one,

1169
01:02:41,083 --> 01:02:42,542
that will determine the entirety.

1170
01:02:43,083 --> 01:02:44,250
How much do you need?

1171
01:02:44,583 --> 01:02:46,208
It is only a murder if they find the body.

1172
01:02:46,208 --> 01:02:47,583
Otherwise she is just missing,

1173
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:49,792
Who did she come with?

1174
01:02:50,125 --> 01:02:50,958
Personal call.

1175
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:52,500
Whose number?

1176
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:53,500
Fake number.

1177
01:02:54,125 --> 01:02:55,125
Did you get the phone?

1178
01:02:55,125 --> 01:02:56,292
Yes, I did.

1179
01:02:56,333 --> 01:02:57,208
CCTV?

1180
01:02:58,458 --> 01:03:01,875
Then do one thing, delete that feed
and lock it up for maintenance.

1181
01:03:01,875 --> 01:03:02,917
I will take care of the rest.

1182
01:03:06,833 --> 01:03:08,292
Come, how are you?

1183
01:03:09,583 --> 01:03:10,458
I have got a body,

1184
01:03:10,792 --> 01:03:12,667
Your job is to chop it up
and feed it to the fishes.

1185
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,750
You are talking to Jailkodi Prabhakaran.

1186
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:16,708
Even God will not be able to find her.

1187
01:03:17,167 --> 01:03:18,417
Just send the body over.

1188
01:03:18,458 --> 01:03:19,292
I will.

1189
01:03:23,667 --> 01:03:25,542
Paagambhariya is like a tiger,

1190
01:03:26,583 --> 01:03:27,792
he is very dangerous.

1191
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:30,250
One of my ants is out there,

1192
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:32,542
You better take care of it.

1193
01:03:40,458 --> 01:03:41,458
Hey Ashok!

1194
01:03:42,542 --> 01:03:43,375
Head constable,

1195
01:03:43,417 --> 01:03:47,167
We sometimes look for a white goat in
the ditch while it is on our shoulder

1196
01:03:47,167 --> 01:03:51,083
With everything that you have told me,
I have realised who the black sheep is!

1197
01:03:51,833 --> 01:03:53,208
You said we were looking for a white goat?!

1198
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:56,250
Many times a white goat is a black sheep!

1199
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:59,833
You are only thinking with
the scenes that you saw.

1200
01:03:59,833 --> 01:04:02,333
I am going to tell you a
scene that you haven’t seen.

1201
01:04:14,208 --> 01:04:15,167
It’s the Inspector,

1202
01:04:15,167 --> 01:04:16,500
Talk to him and ask what he wants.

1203
01:04:17,083 --> 01:04:18,250
Sir, tell me sir...

1204
01:04:18,792 --> 01:04:20,083
Where are you?

1205
01:04:22,792 --> 01:04:26,917
Sir we are on beat in the
market both me and Dass.

1206
01:04:26,958 --> 01:04:31,333
Ma.Na.Ka party people are protesting
in the market go and have a look.

1207
01:04:31,375 --> 01:04:32,208
Okay sir.

1208
01:04:33,375 --> 01:04:35,958
Those buggers will come this way.

1209
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,333
Go and stand there
so that they see you.

1210
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:42,000
But why should he make
them be seen by me?

1211
01:04:42,042 --> 01:04:45,417
Then how will you get a sacrificial
lamb for the ATM robbery!

1212
01:04:45,458 --> 01:04:47,167
Why did he select us for that?

1213
01:04:47,208 --> 01:04:50,792
Because you both are the
nly f 'n' fs he knows

1214
01:04:51,917 --> 01:04:54,875
Don’t get angry, it
means fumbling fools

1215
01:04:55,625 --> 01:04:57,750
Sorry, I misunderstood you. Continue,

1216
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:07,292
What sir, he went away?

1217
01:05:09,083 --> 01:05:11,292
All he does is screw up.

1218
01:05:11,667 --> 01:05:14,708
They will come back,
you wait for them.

1219
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:21,500
Now tell me where the money is.

1220
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:22,708
In Inspector’s house.

1221
01:05:23,042 --> 01:05:26,458
Wow, you think like a CBI officer.

1222
01:05:26,875 --> 01:05:28,667
It’s because of the many serials I see.

1223
01:05:29,542 --> 01:05:30,750
Let that be,

1224
01:05:31,125 --> 01:05:32,667
You know what you have
to do next right?!

1225
01:05:35,917 --> 01:05:37,792
You have only seen
Annamalai as your friend,

1226
01:05:38,542 --> 01:05:41,000
Now you will see Annamalai is your enemy!

1227
01:05:41,833 --> 01:05:42,500
Hello sir.

1228
01:05:43,333 --> 01:05:44,042
Come, come.

1229
01:05:44,792 --> 01:05:46,292
Kareem Bhai,
sit down.

1230
01:05:47,333 --> 01:05:49,208
Sir, my name is not Kareem Bhai.

1231
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:50,500
Karimel Thunjiya Pandian.

1232
01:05:52,417 --> 01:05:53,875
What is your problem?

1233
01:05:53,917 --> 01:05:55,458
Rajinikanth, Kamala Hassan,

1234
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:56,583
what does it matter what I call you?

1235
01:05:56,625 --> 01:05:58,375
Other than you, is there anybody else here?

1236
01:05:58,667 --> 01:05:59,958
But that is not my name sir,

1237
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:02,542
My name is Karimel Thunjiya Pandian,

1238
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:03,875
What does that mean?

1239
01:06:04,625 --> 01:06:07,917
A Pandian who died fighting
a war on elephant back.

1240
01:06:09,917 --> 01:06:11,708
Someone died of an
elephant that’s it right?!

1241
01:06:14,583 --> 01:06:16,250
Sir please call me Kareem Bhai,

1242
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:17,500
This is the matter...

1243
01:06:17,542 --> 01:06:20,875
Yesterday we gave all of sister’s
documents to 2 crackpots

1244
01:06:20,875 --> 01:06:21,667
and sent them out.

1245
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:24,500
Those documents should safely return to me.

1246
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:26,250
and those two crackpot should not live.

1247
01:06:26,292 --> 01:06:28,208
Also they have robbed an ATM

1248
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:30,750
That is a plus for you.

1249
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:32,917
Kill them in an encounter
and get a promotion.

1250
01:06:32,917 --> 01:06:34,875
Whatever I need to do I will.

1251
01:06:36,208 --> 01:06:37,625
Whatever you need just ask for it.

1252
01:06:40,625 --> 01:06:42,208
If it is an encounter, I can surely do it.

1253
01:06:42,667 --> 01:06:44,417
The robbery case is also with me.

1254
01:06:47,958 --> 01:06:49,083
Just give me 8.

1255
01:06:50,208 --> 01:06:53,333
If I take 8 out of 22, 18 is left.

1256
01:06:53,792 --> 01:06:55,292
It is a high price,

1257
01:06:56,125 --> 01:06:57,167
I will give you 8 crores.

1258
01:06:57,875 --> 01:06:58,792
What happened?

1259
01:06:59,167 --> 01:06:59,792
It slipped.

1260
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:02,958
This is the first time
you are slipping in life.

1261
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,875
Make sure to get this done secretively.
and the documents must come to my hand.

1262
01:07:09,042 --> 01:07:10,042
I will get it done sir.

1263
01:07:10,583 --> 01:07:11,458
All the best!

1264
01:07:43,458 --> 01:07:46,583
"Where else can I search for this money?"

1265
01:07:46,625 --> 01:07:50,417
"I mean, where else can I
search for this money?"

1266
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:53,708
"Where else can I search for this money?"

1267
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:54,875
"I mean,"

1268
01:07:54,917 --> 01:07:58,292
"where else can I search for this money?"

1269
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:02,542
"Another form of God is,"

1270
01:08:02,542 --> 01:08:06,083
"the money we carry around with us."

1271
01:08:06,458 --> 01:08:08,167
"Another form of"

1272
01:08:08,208 --> 01:08:09,917
"the God up there is,"

1273
01:08:09,958 --> 01:08:13,375
"the money we carry around with us."

1274
01:08:29,208 --> 01:08:32,625
"A fool can become a king with money."

1275
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:36,583
"Every sin is washed away with money."

1276
01:08:36,833 --> 01:08:40,292
"Even a sage wants this money,"

1277
01:08:40,667 --> 01:08:43,958
"The government can be
shook by this money... I mean,"

1278
01:08:44,458 --> 01:08:47,000
"where else can I search"

1279
01:08:47,042 --> 01:08:47,958
"for this money? I mean,"

1280
01:08:48,042 --> 01:08:51,958
"where else can I search for this money?"

1281
01:08:51,958 --> 01:08:53,625
"Cash only is God here,"

1282
01:08:53,667 --> 01:08:55,542
"Even God needs that cash dear."

1283
01:08:55,583 --> 01:08:57,292
"You need to put cash in the hundi."

1284
01:08:57,333 --> 01:08:59,250
"Also a special ticket scam you know."

1285
01:08:59,292 --> 01:09:01,167
"Every charity donation and gift comes to"

1286
01:09:01,208 --> 01:09:02,958
"currency circulation deal!"

1287
01:09:03,208 --> 01:09:04,875
I am not opposing temples,

1288
01:09:04,917 --> 01:09:07,833
I am opposing temples
being home to evil men

1289
01:09:07,875 --> 01:09:09,875
"If you want any position, just give cash"

1290
01:09:09,917 --> 01:09:11,792
"I want power, show currency notes."

1291
01:09:11,833 --> 01:09:13,708
"Even if you want to love, so some money."

1292
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:15,625
"To get the votes, spread the notes."

1293
01:09:15,667 --> 01:09:17,625
"What is heaven and what is hell?"

1294
01:09:17,667 --> 01:09:19,542
"If you have a lot of money
then you are God everywhere."

1295
01:09:45,167 --> 01:09:46,542
He will ready that money dad.

1296
01:09:46,542 --> 01:09:47,208
Okay dear,

1297
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:49,167
Whatever it is he is a man.

1298
01:09:49,625 --> 01:09:51,792
I have touched every nerve
that I shouldn’t have touched.

1299
01:09:51,833 --> 01:09:52,667
Please tell him to do it quickly.

1300
01:09:52,667 --> 01:09:54,667
For me wait just for a month dad.

1301
01:09:54,708 --> 01:09:55,250
I am hearing an echo in your voice,

1302
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:56,667
where are you?

1303
01:09:57,208 --> 01:09:59,042
I am talking from inside
the bathroom dad.

1304
01:09:59,042 --> 01:10:01,042
Why, are you not feeling well?

1305
01:10:01,042 --> 01:10:02,083
It’s not that dad.

1306
01:10:02,083 --> 01:10:03,875
This is the only place I
get signal in this house.

1307
01:10:03,875 --> 01:10:05,375
Please ask him to do it quickly.

1308
01:10:05,417 --> 01:10:07,667
That I think he’s here, cut the call
I’ll call you back later

1309
01:10:16,583 --> 01:10:18,208
What brother, you are here at this time?!

1310
01:10:18,208 --> 01:10:18,958
What dear...

1311
01:10:18,958 --> 01:10:22,583
just because I am a head constable, you’re not
even going to invite me inside the house right?!

1312
01:10:22,625 --> 01:10:23,708
That’s okay.

1313
01:10:23,708 --> 01:10:26,292
Oh no, what are you saying?
Please come inside.

1314
01:10:28,708 --> 01:10:30,792
Hey, what are you doing?

1315
01:10:30,833 --> 01:10:32,708
Get that chair.

1316
01:10:32,708 --> 01:10:34,625
Don’t struggle just sit here silently.

1317
01:10:34,667 --> 01:10:36,542
Hey what are you doing?
Get the rope Dass.

1318
01:10:39,333 --> 01:10:39,917
Hello...

1319
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:43,667
hello, head constable.

1320
01:10:47,625 --> 01:10:48,417
What is it?

1321
01:10:48,792 --> 01:10:52,875
We know everything about who
stole the money and where it is.

1322
01:10:53,375 --> 01:10:54,125
Where have you been?

1323
01:10:54,708 --> 01:10:56,208
I am at your house!

1324
01:10:57,208 --> 01:11:00,708
Now your wife is in our custody.

1325
01:11:00,708 --> 01:11:03,708
We immediately want the money
and those two criminals!

1326
01:11:08,875 --> 01:11:09,958
He has nothing sir.

1327
01:11:11,167 --> 01:11:13,083
Now you can’t hear anything is it?!

1328
01:11:13,542 --> 01:11:15,000
Cut the call.

1329
01:11:15,042 --> 01:11:16,625
I will call you back!

1330
01:11:16,625 --> 01:11:17,958
Sir, your phone is on.

1331
01:11:18,542 --> 01:11:19,083
Hello...

1332
01:11:23,042 --> 01:11:26,417
I don’t understand why he
calls me why I cut the call...

1333
01:11:27,125 --> 01:11:29,125
Kariya has to come to this house.

1334
01:11:29,792 --> 01:11:32,250
The money must be somewhere here.

1335
01:11:32,958 --> 01:11:34,333
We will wait for him.

1336
01:11:36,333 --> 01:11:37,167
Bro,

1337
01:11:37,667 --> 01:11:39,917
in the morning our faces
will be seen everywhere.

1338
01:11:46,833 --> 01:11:47,625
Hello Banu,

1339
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:50,458
Whom did I ever hurt Banu.

1340
01:11:51,417 --> 01:11:52,875
I fell in love.

1341
01:11:52,917 --> 01:11:54,583
The girl I love hates me.

1342
01:11:55,083 --> 01:11:58,792
I want to deposit money for her,
and got caught up in an ATM robbery

1343
01:11:59,333 --> 01:12:02,000
Tomorrow I am going to jail for her Banu,

1344
01:12:03,083 --> 01:12:05,958
But I don’t know if she will
ever understand all of this

1345
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:08,083
Where the hell are you, you buffalo?!

1346
01:12:09,875 --> 01:12:11,583
I will share the location Banu,

1347
01:12:11,958 --> 01:12:14,500
Please come and rescue me Banu, please!

1348
01:12:14,542 --> 01:12:16,583
Who told him, he robbed the ATM?

1349
01:12:18,958 --> 01:12:22,000
I am hand, I am head,
Is that your real name?

1350
01:12:22,042 --> 01:12:24,542
Oh no, no!

1351
01:12:24,583 --> 01:12:25,583
I am Elvis Presley and I am Bob Marley.

1352
01:12:25,583 --> 01:12:27,125
Oh!

1353
01:12:27,167 --> 01:12:28,750
So this is actually their problem.

1354
01:12:28,792 --> 01:12:33,375
They are thinking of themselves
as Elvis Presley and Bob Marley.

1355
01:12:42,542 --> 01:12:43,792
Sir, tea.

1356
01:12:44,333 --> 01:12:44,958
Come here.

1357
01:12:45,625 --> 01:12:46,417
Sir,

1358
01:12:46,417 --> 01:12:48,417
Head constable brought
two accused here right?

1359
01:12:48,458 --> 01:12:49,042
Yes sir.

1360
01:12:49,083 --> 01:12:50,333
Did you see them?

1361
01:12:50,333 --> 01:12:51,250
Yes sir, I saw them.

1362
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:53,250
Are they the same to you guys here?

1363
01:12:54,917 --> 01:12:56,875
It’s not them sir, they are different.

1364
01:12:57,667 --> 01:12:58,750
Can you identify them?

1365
01:12:58,792 --> 01:13:00,083
I surely can.

1366
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:03,292
Go and check all the CCTV
cameras near our station,

1367
01:13:04,125 --> 01:13:06,000
If you find any footage
of them bring it here.

1368
01:13:06,333 --> 01:13:06,958
Okay sir.

1369
01:13:07,208 --> 01:13:07,708
Go.

1370
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:17,417
So the 2 men on camera
are actually insane.

1371
01:13:19,167 --> 01:13:21,292
Head constable and Dass
do not have any courage.

1372
01:13:21,583 --> 01:13:23,042
Also they are fools.

1373
01:13:23,708 --> 01:13:26,125
Then who are those two that
the head constable brought here.

1374
01:13:27,875 --> 01:13:30,583
The two of them are
the master minds here.

1375
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:41,292
Sir, I got it.

1376
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:44,792
This footage is from KRC Jewellers
and it is the both of them.

1377
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:06,042
Now I have to hunt them down.

1378
01:14:21,292 --> 01:14:28,083
'Intermission'

1379
01:14:30,583 --> 01:14:34,042
Ekambaram bag and the ATM robbery
are definitely related.

1380
01:14:35,875 --> 01:14:38,333
Why did the crazies with
the bag rob the ATM?

1381
01:14:40,250 --> 01:14:42,208
How did the mastermind come into this?

1382
01:14:43,417 --> 01:14:46,958
How did they never get registered
on the CCTV camera?

1383
01:14:47,958 --> 01:14:50,708
Why is Ekambaram so desperate
to make a deal?

1384
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,083
Is that a diversion?
The bag is everybody’s cool.

1385
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:57,583
What is in the bag?

1386
01:15:01,667 --> 01:15:03,333
Hey, who are you?

1387
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:05,917
Thannoli... Thannoli...?!

1388
01:15:06,583 --> 01:15:07,667
No, no...

1389
01:15:08,208 --> 01:15:09,625
you should not come here.

1390
01:15:09,917 --> 01:15:11,167
I have to see him.

1391
01:15:11,208 --> 01:15:12,167
I am Bhanumathi.

1392
01:15:12,208 --> 01:15:13,917
I don’t care who you are.

1393
01:15:13,958 --> 01:15:15,542
I will break your head open.

1394
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:17,583
Go away, go!

1395
01:15:29,208 --> 01:15:30,417
Banu... Banu!

1396
01:15:31,833 --> 01:15:33,833
Banu, I have not robbed the ATM Banu!

1397
01:15:34,292 --> 01:15:36,125
They mistakenly arrested me.

1398
01:15:36,167 --> 01:15:37,500
Where is my 80 thousand?

1399
01:15:41,458 --> 01:15:42,833
Who is that?

1400
01:15:42,875 --> 01:15:44,292
I will tell you that later, come.

1401
01:16:00,333 --> 01:16:01,875
Hey, who are you?

1402
01:16:03,542 --> 01:16:05,042
What work do you have here?

1403
01:16:07,083 --> 01:16:09,875
No no, you should not come here.

1404
01:16:12,917 --> 01:16:14,750
I don’t care who you are.

1405
01:16:14,792 --> 01:16:16,667
I will break your head open.

1406
01:16:17,208 --> 01:16:18,333
Go away,

1407
01:16:18,917 --> 01:16:19,833
Go!

1408
01:16:23,875 --> 01:16:25,542
Do you know we got caught stealing?

1409
01:16:26,417 --> 01:16:28,208
Who told you that you robbed the ATM?

1410
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:29,708
They said it in the news.

1411
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:33,125
Look, they are the robbers.

1412
01:16:33,167 --> 01:16:34,833
The news is only showing their face.

1413
01:16:39,792 --> 01:16:41,917
Hey fool! I told you it wasn’t us.

1414
01:16:42,375 --> 01:16:44,250
You are the first to run
away from the tea stall.

1415
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:47,250
Okay bro, come let’s go
and fight with the police.

1416
01:16:47,292 --> 01:16:49,042
Hey you brainless buffoon!

1417
01:16:49,083 --> 01:16:52,083
Can a young woman go to the police
station in the middle of the night?

1418
01:16:55,625 --> 01:16:57,167
Okay I’ll go and sleep.

1419
01:16:59,875 --> 01:17:03,500
Thanks for coming as soon
as I asked you to rescue me.

1420
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Oh no, I didn’t come for that.

1421
01:17:06,042 --> 01:17:07,750
I came for my 80 thousand.

1422
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:09,792
Get lost.

1423
01:17:10,583 --> 01:17:11,250
Hey,

1424
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:13,958
How many times can I come
looking for your love?

1425
01:17:14,042 --> 01:17:15,875
I’m getting bored of doing
it again and again.

1426
01:17:15,917 --> 01:17:18,250
What, you came looking for my love?

1427
01:17:18,292 --> 01:17:20,167
Every time I came looking for you!

1428
01:17:20,917 --> 01:17:23,292
I came and gave you 80,000
when you lost the job.

1429
01:17:24,208 --> 01:17:26,083
I thought you would use
that to get me back.

1430
01:17:26,125 --> 01:17:27,125
You blundered that as well!

1431
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:29,958
Okay, go to sleep.

1432
01:17:30,917 --> 01:17:32,042
I have to think of something.

1433
01:17:33,042 --> 01:17:33,750
Good night.

1434
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:52,083
"A bird that forgot to fly
has spread its wings"

1435
01:17:52,125 --> 01:17:56,250
"It painted it wings in the
colour of dreams and flew away"

1436
01:17:57,125 --> 01:17:59,167
"In the scorching desert"

1437
01:17:59,208 --> 01:18:01,417
"a beautiful new garden blooms"

1438
01:18:01,958 --> 01:18:03,958
"The thirst of the ocean"

1439
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,375
"is satisfied by a few dew drops"

1440
01:18:06,417 --> 01:18:10,292
"The forest burns in a raging fire"

1441
01:18:11,167 --> 01:18:14,583
"A bunch of clouds now fall on the earth"

1442
01:18:45,542 --> 01:18:47,875
"the roots of love are drenched"

1443
01:18:47,917 --> 01:18:50,292
"in the season’s first rain"

1444
01:18:50,333 --> 01:18:52,750
"As thunder mimics the child’s first words."

1445
01:18:52,792 --> 01:18:55,167
"The inner eyes have lost sight"

1446
01:18:55,208 --> 01:18:57,542
"of the ever-changing heart,"

1447
01:18:57,583 --> 01:18:59,875
"Just for a few seconds"

1448
01:18:59,917 --> 01:19:02,333
"I feel like denying it all"

1449
01:19:02,375 --> 01:19:04,333
"You are killing me"

1450
01:19:04,375 --> 01:19:08,750
"by giving dreams to both my eyes"

1451
01:19:08,792 --> 01:19:13,875
"and add a little bit of
honey and little fire to it."

1452
01:19:13,917 --> 01:19:18,125
"The running time pauses for a little while"

1453
01:19:18,167 --> 01:19:23,375
"my heart now runs to the beat of love"

1454
01:20:02,333 --> 01:20:04,750
"The lips conjure"

1455
01:20:04,792 --> 01:20:07,333
"these beautiful lines"

1456
01:20:07,375 --> 01:20:09,625
"and completely change"

1457
01:20:09,667 --> 01:20:11,792
"where my life resides"

1458
01:20:11,833 --> 01:20:14,250
"To trap your fingers"

1459
01:20:14,292 --> 01:20:16,792
"in-between my fingers"

1460
01:20:16,833 --> 01:20:19,125
"Even this distance"

1461
01:20:19,167 --> 01:20:21,125
"feels so sweet now"

1462
01:20:21,167 --> 01:20:25,917
"All over my body your eyes travel"

1463
01:20:25,958 --> 01:20:30,667
"as though you consume me with your sight"

1464
01:20:30,708 --> 01:20:34,917
"In the hot fire my body shrivels down"

1465
01:20:34,958 --> 01:20:40,167
"Now light as a feather it rolls over"

1466
01:20:59,583 --> 01:21:03,542
"A bird that forgot to fly
has spread its wings"

1467
01:21:04,167 --> 01:21:08,292
"It painted it wings in the
colour of dreams and flew away"

1468
01:21:09,167 --> 01:21:13,333
"In the scorching desert
a beautiful new garden blooms"

1469
01:21:13,958 --> 01:21:18,125
"The thirst of the ocean
is satisfied by a few dew drops"

1470
01:21:18,375 --> 01:21:22,917
"The forest burns in a raging fire"

1471
01:21:22,958 --> 01:21:26,583
"A bunch of clouds now fall on the earth"

1472
01:21:51,375 --> 01:21:54,917
Look here, your crying
is of no use here.

1473
01:21:55,292 --> 01:21:57,208
I still want to save you.

1474
01:21:59,375 --> 01:22:00,458
You know very well,

1475
01:22:00,875 --> 01:22:03,083
this investigation was
ordered by the minister.

1476
01:22:22,792 --> 01:22:24,750
National party are discussing coalitions,

1477
01:22:24,792 --> 01:22:26,792
When I sit for the meeting,
those two ants should be no more.

1478
01:22:26,833 --> 01:22:27,417
Okay sis.

1479
01:22:27,958 --> 01:22:30,375
I too am looking for them.

1480
01:22:30,833 --> 01:22:32,500
I said don’t be seen by anyone,

1481
01:22:32,542 --> 01:22:34,417
now I am not able to see them.

1482
01:22:41,583 --> 01:22:42,708
What, water is not coming here!

1483
01:22:47,208 --> 01:22:49,458
There is no water where it should be,
but all over the ground there is water

1484
01:22:49,458 --> 01:22:51,458
Oh no,

1485
01:22:51,958 --> 01:22:54,208
just as I need to go there is no water.

1486
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:55,833
What can I do now?

1487
01:22:55,875 --> 01:22:57,083
Okay let me go here.

1488
01:22:57,083 --> 01:22:58,542
But it is so dark here.

1489
01:22:58,583 --> 01:23:01,208
Many times I don’t have light to eat!
Why do I need it for this?

1490
01:23:01,208 --> 01:23:03,000
I am coming.

1491
01:23:18,125 --> 01:23:19,958
Come quickly, Kareem Bhai

1492
01:23:20,083 --> 01:23:22,458
Why did you call me here,
did you not find any other place?

1493
01:23:23,083 --> 01:23:24,292
Nobody will ever come here.

1494
01:23:24,292 --> 01:23:25,875
If it stinks so bad who will come here?!

1495
01:23:26,333 --> 01:23:27,667
You said it was something urgent.

1496
01:23:27,667 --> 01:23:29,000
What, can’t you do it by yourself?!

1497
01:23:29,208 --> 01:23:31,875
Sir, as we agreed if I kill those two guys...

1498
01:23:31,875 --> 01:23:32,875
your problem won’t be solved.

1499
01:23:32,917 --> 01:23:35,250
Two of you are men are
roaming with the documents,

1500
01:23:35,292 --> 01:23:36,667
then there is two of our men

1501
01:23:36,667 --> 01:23:38,417
and the two who are
controlling these four men!

1502
01:23:38,917 --> 01:23:40,917
Only if I kill all the six your
minister will be safe.

1503
01:23:40,917 --> 01:23:42,083
So kill them all!

1504
01:23:42,125 --> 01:23:43,625
Sir but we only talked about those two.

1505
01:23:44,208 --> 01:23:47,208
Think of me as your brother and
please kill all those six guys.

1506
01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:48,875
As per the deal I will give you 8 crores,
Sir...!

1507
01:23:48,917 --> 01:23:50,750
You won’t get a penny more!

1508
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:52,875
That’s it, as per the deal
you will only get 8 crores.

1509
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,458
Oh my God!

1510
01:24:06,167 --> 01:24:09,333
This Karimel Thunj and this black face
are making such a big plan.

1511
01:24:09,958 --> 01:24:11,875
If I remain a coward,
I will always be poor.

1512
01:24:12,208 --> 01:24:13,125
I will come right away!

1513
01:24:23,292 --> 01:24:26,542
Hello, why are you calling me at this hour?

1514
01:24:26,542 --> 01:24:29,458
Head constable, I can judge by your silence

1515
01:24:29,458 --> 01:24:31,917
how much mental torture
you are experiencing!

1516
01:24:31,958 --> 01:24:33,833
Can you hear what I am saying?!

1517
01:24:33,875 --> 01:24:35,292
You keep silent!

1518
01:24:35,833 --> 01:24:38,208
But pay attention to
what I am going to say.

1519
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:41,083
Hey, can you hear me or not?!

1520
01:24:41,417 --> 01:24:46,750
The inspector has planned to
encounter both you and Dass.

1521
01:24:48,667 --> 01:24:50,250
What, encounter?

1522
01:24:51,125 --> 01:24:54,042
Will that Kariya, encounter
and kill on-duty police?

1523
01:24:56,250 --> 01:24:58,833
That is why as long as
I am a part of our team,

1524
01:24:58,833 --> 01:25:01,208
that inspector cannot do anything to you!

1525
01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:04,333
Hey, first cut the call and redial.

1526
01:25:04,417 --> 01:25:06,042
How are you able to hear me?!

1527
01:25:06,083 --> 01:25:09,125
Are you wondering why
I am calling this our team?

1528
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:14,417
13 lakhs divided by six is 2.3 lakhs

1529
01:25:14,458 --> 01:25:16,708
What is divided by seven it is 1.8 lakhs?

1530
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:20,250
Don’t die for the difference amount!

1531
01:25:20,667 --> 01:25:23,583
Informer is also very
important, remember that!

1532
01:25:23,625 --> 01:25:25,958
Hey, when did we steal that amount?!

1533
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,333
We will live by our unity,
but never die by the bullet!

1534
01:25:31,167 --> 01:25:33,375
Wait for my next call.

1535
01:25:42,167 --> 01:25:45,667
Dass, Karimel knows that
we kidnapped his wife.

1536
01:25:46,167 --> 01:25:47,750
How is that possible head constable sir?

1537
01:25:47,792 --> 01:25:48,833
He is going to kill us in an encounter.

1538
01:25:49,333 --> 01:25:50,333
Head constable Sir!

1539
01:25:50,833 --> 01:25:52,792
But his life is in our hands.

1540
01:25:53,542 --> 01:25:55,583
Let us see how he manages to kill us.

1541
01:25:55,625 --> 01:25:57,458
First we have to pack and move her.
Okay...

1542
01:25:58,333 --> 01:25:59,333
Hey Dass! First wrap her up.

1543
01:25:59,375 --> 01:26:01,375
You can deal with emotions later.

1544
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:03,458
It’s about to be sunrise.
Go quickly!

1545
01:26:04,667 --> 01:26:08,792
Head, there is police everywhere.
We are sure to get caught sooner or later!

1546
01:26:09,333 --> 01:26:11,500
We must make sure we are not seen.

1547
01:26:11,542 --> 01:26:13,250
Let us stick our heads inside somewhere!

1548
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:14,458
But Hand,

1549
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:17,042
We have promised that we will
drive around the entire night.

1550
01:26:17,042 --> 01:26:19,000
That too I have promised on my mummy.

1551
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:21,333
Head, but your mummy is already dead.

1552
01:26:21,375 --> 01:26:23,250
Does that mean, I can kill
mummy again and again?!

1553
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:24,917
My God, a face like a snake!

1554
01:26:25,083 --> 01:26:26,375
A promise is a promise.

1555
01:26:26,708 --> 01:26:27,292
Head,

1556
01:26:27,833 --> 01:26:30,250
We made a mistake by stealing, right?

1557
01:26:31,083 --> 01:26:31,875
Oh no!

1558
01:26:32,125 --> 01:26:35,292
All these big-time crooks have created
a status for thieves everywhere!

1559
01:26:35,375 --> 01:26:36,458
Oh my God!

1560
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:38,208
Now we too are men of status, Hand!

1561
01:26:42,875 --> 01:26:45,292
Head, why did you stop here?!

1562
01:26:45,292 --> 01:26:47,208
The curry is empty!

1563
01:27:05,042 --> 01:27:06,500
Hey, who are you?!

1564
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:09,917
We too are poor men like you boss!

1565
01:27:10,083 --> 01:27:11,208
What work do you have here?

1566
01:27:11,250 --> 01:27:13,792
Boss, the fuel in our vehicle is empty.

1567
01:27:13,792 --> 01:27:17,583
That is why, we thought we
can stay here for a day.

1568
01:27:17,625 --> 01:27:20,333
No no, you shouldn’t come here!

1569
01:27:20,333 --> 01:27:22,583
Please reconsider for us boss.

1570
01:27:22,667 --> 01:27:24,667
I don’t care who you are!

1571
01:27:24,667 --> 01:27:26,500
I will break open your head. Go...

1572
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:27,542
No...!

1573
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:29,125
Jesus Christ!

1574
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:35,542
Boss, sorry we disturbed you.

1575
01:27:35,667 --> 01:27:37,458
This is very important documents boss!

1576
01:27:57,792 --> 01:27:58,833
Hello...

1577
01:28:00,208 --> 01:28:03,042
Bro everything is safe,
all of the liquor is safe!

1578
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:05,292
You don’t worry I will bring it!

1579
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:07,083
Yes cut the call!

1580
01:28:10,375 --> 01:28:11,042
Hi!

1581
01:28:11,083 --> 01:28:12,583
What sir, up are you well?!

1582
01:28:12,625 --> 01:28:13,750
How can I be well?

1583
01:28:13,792 --> 01:28:15,042
What sir, what happened?

1584
01:28:15,042 --> 01:28:16,375
It is all about that girl!

1585
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,292
But we have already disposed of that body!

1586
01:28:18,958 --> 01:28:20,917
Sir there is no trace left!

1587
01:28:21,417 --> 01:28:22,375
There is no evidence left!

1588
01:28:22,375 --> 01:28:25,000
There are skilled men everywhere,
that is the problem.

1589
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:27,458
Tell me how many zeroes you need after one.

1590
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:35,750
Greetings, today on Truth Seen
we are going to meet...

1591
01:28:35,792 --> 01:28:39,125
The party president of Ma.Na.Ka
and central minister Mr. Paagambariya.

1592
01:28:39,167 --> 01:28:40,125
Greeting sir.

1593
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:41,083
Greetings.

1594
01:28:42,125 --> 01:28:45,458
First question is about
your controversial name.

1595
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:47,958
You are male who has a female name,

1596
01:28:47,958 --> 01:28:50,917
Also your party members call
you sister why is this so?

1597
01:28:51,333 --> 01:28:52,792
What is controversial about this?

1598
01:28:53,667 --> 01:28:57,625
My parents had thought to name
their child after our family deity.

1599
01:28:57,875 --> 01:28:59,042
When I was born, they did so.

1600
01:28:59,458 --> 01:29:00,917
Because I had a female name...

1601
01:29:02,292 --> 01:29:06,958
they initially called me sister to tease me,
but now it is the party’s calling card.

1602
01:29:06,958 --> 01:29:10,125
Because you have the name of
a deity from the main caste,

1603
01:29:10,125 --> 01:29:12,708
can we consider you as a
religious or caste leader.

1604
01:29:13,958 --> 01:29:15,625
Once a child is born

1605
01:29:15,625 --> 01:29:19,292
to issue a berth certificate, the government
asks for it’s caste and religion.

1606
01:29:19,333 --> 01:29:21,167
So is the government
a religious institution?

1607
01:29:21,167 --> 01:29:22,708
A child that is just born,

1608
01:29:23,292 --> 01:29:26,792
doesn’t even know the
concept of God or caste!

1609
01:29:26,833 --> 01:29:30,208
What sir, they are just going to
apply the father’s religion to it.

1610
01:29:31,458 --> 01:29:33,458
Is religion an ancestral property?

1611
01:29:33,458 --> 01:29:39,083
You take away the freedom to pray
to any God, and force feed religion.

1612
01:29:39,083 --> 01:29:42,958
Once the child grows up it has
the option to change it’s religion.

1613
01:29:44,708 --> 01:29:45,583
What about caste?

1614
01:29:46,250 --> 01:29:48,375
If we had the option to change
castes it would be so great!

1615
01:29:48,917 --> 01:29:52,083
Does this mean you strongly
oppose religion and castes?

1616
01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:57,458
I can see, when you ask
questions to a politician,

1617
01:29:58,542 --> 01:30:01,875
those questions are framed
in a way to boost TRP!

1618
01:30:02,250 --> 01:30:04,792
It’s a competitive field, what can you do?

1619
01:30:05,125 --> 01:30:09,583
Politicians talk about politics,
how is it going to be interesting?!

1620
01:30:10,542 --> 01:30:13,125
When even other states are praising you,

1621
01:30:13,167 --> 01:30:16,750
In the next election, which national party
are you going to have a coalition with?

1622
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:21,042
Ma.Na.Ka will contest as
independent in every constituency

1623
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:24,375
Does this mean you prefer
local self governance?

1624
01:30:25,417 --> 01:30:28,708
Now, if we didn’t need
local self governance,

1625
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:33,042
why was this country divided as per
language into so many states?

1626
01:30:33,792 --> 01:30:37,292
Not everybody can understand
our culture and customs.

1627
01:30:37,333 --> 01:30:38,708
Take a simple issue for example,

1628
01:30:38,708 --> 01:30:41,333
in our custom it is usual to
marry maternal cousins.

1629
01:30:41,625 --> 01:30:45,042
But in their custom up north, a cousin
is the same as their sister.

1630
01:30:45,292 --> 01:30:47,667
They will not be able to understand
all of our customers!

1631
01:30:47,708 --> 01:30:49,042
They are not able to.

1632
01:30:49,042 --> 01:30:52,917
If they pass a law that cousins
should not marry,

1633
01:30:54,292 --> 01:30:56,958
can we go and sit in the
beach to protest that?

1634
01:30:57,292 --> 01:30:59,125
Now even that is not possible!

1635
01:31:00,167 --> 01:31:03,583
The entire world we are the
only ones to lock up a beach.

1636
01:31:03,792 --> 01:31:06,000
Don’t you feel that this
is national separatism.

1637
01:31:06,042 --> 01:31:11,083
Which is separatism, to ask for
respect towards customs or to deny it?

1638
01:31:11,125 --> 01:31:18,208
In 234 constituencies in the assembly,
and 40 seats in the Parliament.

1639
01:31:18,250 --> 01:31:21,458
Makal Nalaachi Kachchi, will contest independently.
(People’s Good Governance Party)

1640
01:31:22,333 --> 01:31:23,667
Greetings!
Greetings sir.

1641
01:31:24,125 --> 01:31:29,208
As per opinion polls Ma Na Ka,
is leading in 183 constituencies.

1642
01:31:29,208 --> 01:31:32,542
Nobody knows what is project welfare,
and those who oppose it get IT raids.

1643
01:31:32,583 --> 01:31:34,875
That is the reaction that you will get,
go and look at social media.

1644
01:31:34,917 --> 01:31:36,167
You will realise how much support he has.

1645
01:31:36,208 --> 01:31:38,792
How long will we trust you,
don’t we need a change for ourselves?

1646
01:31:38,833 --> 01:31:42,250
Every party will give us Rs.2000,
we will take and keep it.

1647
01:31:42,292 --> 01:31:43,250
But our vote is for Paagambariya.

1648
01:31:43,250 --> 01:31:45,583
Looking at the cost of goods, it
would be best if Paagambariya wins.

1649
01:31:45,583 --> 01:31:48,458
If the election took place today,
Paagambariya would be the next CM.

1650
01:31:48,458 --> 01:31:49,042
Next he is going to win.

1651
01:31:49,083 --> 01:31:49,917
Paagambariya.

1652
01:31:49,917 --> 01:31:50,833
Only Paagambariya!

1653
01:31:50,833 --> 01:31:52,208
My vote is for Paagambariya

1654
01:32:01,250 --> 01:32:01,917
Sir,

1655
01:32:04,833 --> 01:32:06,500
Sir it is best if he is there.

1656
01:32:10,792 --> 01:32:11,792
Okay sir.

1657
01:32:13,917 --> 01:32:14,542
What is it?

1658
01:32:14,542 --> 01:32:16,875
As usual they are going to
bring some girl and have a party!

1659
01:32:17,708 --> 01:32:18,958
So you want to remove the old man.

1660
01:32:20,333 --> 01:32:21,125
He is blind and deaf.

1661
01:32:22,250 --> 01:32:24,125
He won’t even hear if firecracker next to him.

1662
01:32:24,542 --> 01:32:25,958
What is it going to see?

1663
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,167
Only we know that they don’t.

1664
01:32:28,417 --> 01:32:29,417
I will go and get him.

1665
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Hey!

1666
01:32:38,417 --> 01:32:39,292
Hey!

1667
01:32:45,958 --> 01:32:47,083
What work did you have here?

1668
01:32:47,458 --> 01:32:48,917
You should not come here.

1669
01:32:49,625 --> 01:32:51,542
I don’t care who you are.

1670
01:32:51,583 --> 01:32:53,292
I will break your head open!

1671
01:32:53,292 --> 01:32:54,417
Go!
Sir, sir!

1672
01:32:54,458 --> 01:32:55,292
Sir!

1673
01:32:56,250 --> 01:32:57,417
Yes it is me it is me.

1674
01:32:57,458 --> 01:32:58,250
We will leave for now.

1675
01:32:58,250 --> 01:32:58,708
Sir!

1676
01:32:58,750 --> 01:32:59,208
Let us go for now.

1677
01:32:59,250 --> 01:32:59,917
Sir!

1678
01:33:18,292 --> 01:33:18,917
Get up.

1679
01:33:18,917 --> 01:33:20,375
Vasuga...

1680
01:33:20,958 --> 01:33:22,292
Get up!

1681
01:33:41,542 --> 01:33:42,833
Oh my god!

1682
01:33:43,417 --> 01:33:44,917
They shot me they are going to kill me!

1683
01:33:44,958 --> 01:33:46,542
Mummy they have shot me!

1684
01:33:46,542 --> 01:33:47,833
Sir, sir!

1685
01:33:47,875 --> 01:33:49,250
It was all this Thannoli sir!

1686
01:33:49,292 --> 01:33:53,125
His Aadhar number is 4321-2223-7173

1687
01:33:59,833 --> 01:34:01,583
Sorry bro, bad dreams.

1688
01:34:03,375 --> 01:34:04,542
Bad friend!

1689
01:34:08,292 --> 01:34:09,417
Where the f is she?!

1690
01:34:09,458 --> 01:34:11,458
Your pass time is to play with my life.

1691
01:34:15,042 --> 01:34:16,417
Why did you burst the firecracker?

1692
01:34:16,417 --> 01:34:17,667
Won’t they have heard the sound outside?

1693
01:34:18,167 --> 01:34:20,125
That old man left just right now!

1694
01:34:20,167 --> 01:34:23,333
Just because I pitied you and told
the truth you go to sleep like that?

1695
01:34:23,958 --> 01:34:26,125
You said you have to go to the
police station in the morning,

1696
01:34:26,125 --> 01:34:27,125
what is the time now?

1697
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:28,333
Oh my God!

1698
01:34:30,333 --> 01:34:32,208
Is make up very important now?
It is already late come.

1699
01:34:32,208 --> 01:34:34,875
Can a young girl go outside
without make up?

1700
01:34:35,333 --> 01:34:36,625
Don’t make me use filthy words!

1701
01:34:36,625 --> 01:34:37,292
Come let’s go!

1702
01:34:41,167 --> 01:34:42,500
Hey take your hand away!

1703
01:34:42,833 --> 01:34:43,833
Go.

1704
01:34:44,125 --> 01:34:44,750
You go.
Go!

1705
01:34:47,125 --> 01:34:47,583
Hey...

1706
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,750
we have robbed an ATM!

1707
01:34:49,792 --> 01:34:51,125
You are walking so carelessly!

1708
01:34:51,583 --> 01:34:52,333
Hey!

1709
01:34:52,333 --> 01:34:54,167
Yesterday night she told us to right?

1710
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:55,458
We have not stolen anything!

1711
01:34:57,042 --> 01:34:57,750
Hey!

1712
01:34:58,458 --> 01:34:59,875
Won’t you ever change?!

1713
01:35:28,208 --> 01:35:31,417
"Yellow shirt green shirt.
Yellow shirt green shirt."

1714
01:35:37,208 --> 01:35:40,375
"Yellow shirt green shirt.
Yellow shirt green shirt."

1715
01:35:48,042 --> 01:35:49,750
He is going to die without
wearing a helmet!

1716
01:35:50,125 --> 01:35:51,208
If only he had stopped I could
have fined him Rs.50.

1717
01:35:51,208 --> 01:35:51,833
Thanks brother.

1718
01:35:52,167 --> 01:35:53,042
Thank you very much.

1719
01:35:53,917 --> 01:35:55,292
Sir...

1720
01:35:55,333 --> 01:35:56,875
Hello sir.
Hey, why have you come here?

1721
01:35:57,125 --> 01:36:00,042
We came to tell the inspector
what the head constable did.

1722
01:36:00,083 --> 01:36:02,958
Having done so much already,
why... why... why have you changed?!

1723
01:36:03,625 --> 01:36:07,125
Have you forgotten that five others
are dependent on the both of you?!

1724
01:36:08,292 --> 01:36:09,958
You must have a plan for that 1.8 lakhs,

1725
01:36:09,958 --> 01:36:12,333
Have you forgotten that?!

1726
01:36:12,375 --> 01:36:14,542
Did you get scared when you
heard about the encounter?!

1727
01:36:15,083 --> 01:36:16,958
What, Encounter?!

1728
01:36:17,417 --> 01:36:18,333
Yes,

1729
01:36:18,375 --> 01:36:20,958
as soon as he said the six of you
will be killed in an encounter...

1730
01:36:21,292 --> 01:36:24,417
Thinking I have taken my
share and left you to die!

1731
01:36:24,625 --> 01:36:27,125
My heart slapped me tight twice!

1732
01:36:27,167 --> 01:36:28,833
Hey, who are those six people?!

1733
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:31,042
Are you asking who are those six people?!

1734
01:36:31,083 --> 01:36:33,333
Once you are asking
only for those six people,

1735
01:36:33,375 --> 01:36:35,625
I realise you do not suspect
the seventh one who is me!

1736
01:36:36,125 --> 01:36:37,708
The both of you,

1737
01:36:37,708 --> 01:36:38,750
Head Constable and Constable,

1738
01:36:38,792 --> 01:36:40,667
Come let’s go, come on!
Hey!

1739
01:36:40,708 --> 01:36:42,375
Don’t listen to that girl!
Get back in the vehicle, get in fast!

1740
01:36:42,417 --> 01:36:44,375
Brother let’s go quickly!
Don’t you dare move this auto!

1741
01:36:44,375 --> 01:36:45,667
Brother go!
Hey stop!

1742
01:36:45,708 --> 01:36:48,375
- Go quickly.
- Listen to what I am saying, stop!

1743
01:36:48,542 --> 01:36:52,042
That Karimel Thunjiya Pandian
plans to kill you by tonight!

1744
01:36:55,125 --> 01:36:55,917
Get in!

1745
01:37:26,750 --> 01:37:28,583
What did you do with the body?

1746
01:37:28,625 --> 01:37:32,333
Am I a government employee
to give you proper documents?!

1747
01:37:33,958 --> 01:37:37,125
My word is everything, I will never say!

1748
01:37:38,083 --> 01:37:39,750
He won’t talk, let him down!

1749
01:37:51,167 --> 01:37:52,458
Get up.

1750
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:53,458
Go inside.

1751
01:37:53,458 --> 01:37:54,958
Get inside now.

1752
01:37:55,542 --> 01:37:56,167
Let me go.

1753
01:37:56,167 --> 01:37:58,625
Safeguard me or lord Kanagavel,
look after me and look out for all evil.

1754
01:38:00,583 --> 01:38:02,208
Safeguard me or lord Kanagavel

1755
01:38:02,250 --> 01:38:03,167
Hey wait...

1756
01:38:03,208 --> 01:38:04,125
Let go of me!

1757
01:38:05,375 --> 01:38:06,708
Then let go of the people who stole.

1758
01:38:06,750 --> 01:38:08,375
Those ATM robbers should die,

1759
01:38:08,417 --> 01:38:10,083
the police who
organised this should die...

1760
01:38:11,750 --> 01:38:13,000
Why should I die?

1761
01:38:13,042 --> 01:38:16,167
They are going to encounter us along
with that yellow shirt and green shirt!

1762
01:38:19,417 --> 01:38:20,708
We are all going to die!

1763
01:38:24,583 --> 01:38:26,542
Hey, let me think for sometime.

1764
01:38:26,958 --> 01:38:28,583
First go and sit somewhere.

1765
01:38:30,208 --> 01:38:31,500
Go, go!

1766
01:38:37,083 --> 01:38:40,625
Hand, they have betrayed us.

1767
01:38:41,250 --> 01:38:42,833
Now they are going to kill us.

1768
01:38:43,125 --> 01:38:47,583
Before that I want to ask him four
questions that will knock him out.

1769
01:38:47,958 --> 01:38:49,000
Give me your phone...

1770
01:38:49,250 --> 01:38:52,042
My phone is switched off, Head!

1771
01:38:52,083 --> 01:38:53,792
So is mine Hand!

1772
01:39:00,917 --> 01:39:03,083
Ms. Crood oil.

1773
01:39:03,333 --> 01:39:05,042
M S company

1774
01:39:05,042 --> 01:39:05,833
Moratta Single.

1775
01:39:06,583 --> 01:39:08,125
I too am single.

1776
01:39:25,458 --> 01:39:26,708
Talk to me girl.

1777
01:39:44,208 --> 01:39:45,792
Head, give me that phone number.

1778
01:39:59,542 --> 01:40:00,458
Who is this?

1779
01:40:00,875 --> 01:40:01,458
Hello,

1780
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:03,750
we are the super heroes who are
protecting the party’s reputation.

1781
01:40:03,750 --> 01:40:05,375
Why are you whispering?

1782
01:40:05,375 --> 01:40:06,917
So that nobody else can you hear us.

1783
01:40:06,958 --> 01:40:09,333
Boss, why have you sent

1784
01:40:09,333 --> 01:40:10,958
the police to encounter and kill us?

1785
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,583
So this is completely spoilt!

1786
01:40:13,875 --> 01:40:15,417
Hey, how will I do such a thing?

1787
01:40:15,833 --> 01:40:18,583
The minister is angry with you
for what you have done.

1788
01:40:18,625 --> 01:40:20,917
This plan is to save you from that.

1789
01:40:21,375 --> 01:40:23,542
Do you usually have the police
kill someone to save them?!

1790
01:40:23,583 --> 01:40:24,667
Hey you fools!

1791
01:40:24,667 --> 01:40:27,333
The encounter prime is real,
but that is not for you.

1792
01:40:27,375 --> 01:40:28,708
Do one thing,

1793
01:40:28,708 --> 01:40:30,500
Return the documents,

1794
01:40:30,542 --> 01:40:32,125
and surrender to the police

1795
01:40:32,125 --> 01:40:33,667
with the money that you stole.

1796
01:40:33,708 --> 01:40:35,292
They will let you escape,

1797
01:40:35,292 --> 01:40:37,417
and kill two other men in your place

1798
01:40:37,458 --> 01:40:38,875
Yeah we know that much!

1799
01:40:39,292 --> 01:40:40,083
How?!

1800
01:40:40,125 --> 01:40:41,917
Those two are roaming around here.

1801
01:40:42,625 --> 01:40:44,625
Hey, tell me correctly...

1802
01:40:45,042 --> 01:40:45,917
tell me where...

1803
01:40:47,917 --> 01:40:48,917
Keep quiet.

1804
01:40:50,083 --> 01:40:52,042
Dass, it’s a good thing...

1805
01:40:52,042 --> 01:40:53,333
The old man isn’t here,

1806
01:40:53,333 --> 01:40:55,458
Where else can we take her?!

1807
01:40:59,625 --> 01:41:00,625
Success!

1808
01:41:04,875 --> 01:41:05,667
Dass, look after her carefully.

1809
01:41:05,708 --> 01:41:06,958
Make sure to tie her legs.

1810
01:41:06,958 --> 01:41:08,958
I will go and call Karimel,

1811
01:41:20,542 --> 01:41:23,375
How hard it is for me to
maintain this phone!

1812
01:41:44,708 --> 01:41:46,042
they are hiding here.

1813
01:41:46,083 --> 01:41:47,375
Let me go and beat them up!

1814
01:41:47,917 --> 01:41:50,417
Hey, they are skilled thieves

1815
01:41:50,833 --> 01:41:52,667
It’s very dangerous, don’t do it.

1816
01:41:52,917 --> 01:41:53,917
What should we do?

1817
01:41:54,750 --> 01:41:56,625
We have to somehow get those 13 lakhs.

1818
01:41:57,250 --> 01:41:58,792
Also we must catch them.

1819
01:42:00,583 --> 01:42:02,958
If you please sit down,

1820
01:42:02,958 --> 01:42:04,167
I will tie your legs.

1821
01:42:09,292 --> 01:42:10,958
Please cooperate with me.

1822
01:42:13,625 --> 01:42:15,250
You will cooperate, right?

1823
01:42:29,208 --> 01:42:30,167
Hey, tell me.

1824
01:42:34,083 --> 01:42:34,958
Head constable...?

1825
01:42:37,292 --> 01:42:38,083
Hey, head constable!

1826
01:42:39,333 --> 01:42:41,875
Either mobile’s signal is weak

1827
01:42:42,292 --> 01:42:44,083
Or the mic in your phone is gone.

1828
01:42:44,583 --> 01:42:47,000
Since yesterday, whenever
you call it is silent.

1829
01:42:48,208 --> 01:42:49,417
Call me from another phone.

1830
01:42:52,417 --> 01:42:55,458
All this while I was
calling from this phone!

1831
01:42:55,458 --> 01:42:57,083
Oh my God!

1832
01:42:58,625 --> 01:43:03,167
The service center boy told me,
not to let sweat seep in.

1833
01:43:04,292 --> 01:43:05,708
Insulting!

1834
01:43:15,708 --> 01:43:16,375
Sir,

1835
01:43:17,583 --> 01:43:18,375
Tell me sir.

1836
01:43:19,083 --> 01:43:21,792
What Kareem bhai,
are you playing a double game?!

1837
01:43:22,625 --> 01:43:23,667
What are you saying sir?!

1838
01:43:24,125 --> 01:43:25,750
They called me up,

1839
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:27,333
Just a minute sir.

1840
01:43:27,375 --> 01:43:28,250
Hey, come here.

1841
01:43:28,333 --> 01:43:28,750
Sir,

1842
01:43:28,750 --> 01:43:29,583
What is the stain on your uniform?

1843
01:43:29,625 --> 01:43:30,917
Sir some ink spilt.

1844
01:43:31,583 --> 01:43:32,125
Go on.

1845
01:43:32,917 --> 01:43:34,500
They called me up,

1846
01:43:34,542 --> 01:43:36,333
and asked have you fixed
an encounter for us?

1847
01:43:36,708 --> 01:43:37,583
How did they come to know?

1848
01:43:38,583 --> 01:43:40,917
How did they know my plans?!

1849
01:43:41,875 --> 01:43:44,250
Sir, this is a police game sir.

1850
01:43:45,042 --> 01:43:46,333
Let us do our job,

1851
01:43:46,917 --> 01:43:48,708
All this while they were absconded,

1852
01:43:48,750 --> 01:43:51,333
I soon as I leave this matter
they have come out, see?!

1853
01:43:51,875 --> 01:43:53,375
One cannot catch a fish in the dark lake.

1854
01:43:53,958 --> 01:43:55,125
You’re a superb policeman!

1855
01:43:55,875 --> 01:43:57,375
I have their number,
shall I give it to you?

1856
01:44:00,292 --> 01:44:01,208
You can trace it, right?

1857
01:44:01,542 --> 01:44:02,625
Yes, tell me sir.

1858
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:06,917
Triple 2, double 7, triple 2

1859
01:44:09,125 --> 01:44:10,125
Have you noted it down?

1860
01:44:11,167 --> 01:44:12,542
Sir, it looks like a landline number

1861
01:44:13,292 --> 01:44:15,208
They seem to have called
you from a phone booth.

1862
01:44:15,667 --> 01:44:18,042
Do you will surely call back,
we will catch them!

1863
01:44:18,208 --> 01:44:19,083
Catch them and call me.

1864
01:44:19,833 --> 01:44:20,500
Dass...

1865
01:44:20,542 --> 01:44:22,042
Where will I go for a phone?

1866
01:44:22,292 --> 01:44:24,333
Kariya doesn’t know we
have kidnapped his wife.

1867
01:44:24,333 --> 01:44:25,375
First you have to let him know.

1868
01:44:26,042 --> 01:44:27,208
I need a phone right now!

1869
01:44:49,542 --> 01:44:50,917
Ms. Crood...

1870
01:45:13,125 --> 01:45:14,042
Kari...!

1871
01:45:14,792 --> 01:45:16,708
What Dandapani, there is a
difference in your voice?

1872
01:45:16,708 --> 01:45:18,583
What Kari, is it shocking?

1873
01:45:20,208 --> 01:45:24,125
You hire someone to steal,
and then pocket the money.

1874
01:45:24,167 --> 01:45:26,208
Then you try to blame it on us

1875
01:45:26,208 --> 01:45:27,708
And then try to encounter us

1876
01:45:31,083 --> 01:45:32,667
Do you think I am
your sacrificial lamb?

1877
01:45:32,667 --> 01:45:34,292
I am a lion, a lion!

1878
01:45:34,792 --> 01:45:36,958
That is why I have taken away your life!

1879
01:45:39,083 --> 01:45:41,500
Bring the 13 lakhs that you stole!

1880
01:45:41,542 --> 01:45:42,500
Come and see me!

1881
01:45:42,750 --> 01:45:44,917
Let us see if you can kill me
or if I will kill you!

1882
01:45:44,917 --> 01:45:46,958
Find out where I am,

1883
01:45:47,042 --> 01:45:49,458
Let us play some hide and seek!

1884
01:45:58,583 --> 01:46:01,083
He just spoke from the
number that Ekambaram gave.

1885
01:46:01,417 --> 01:46:03,750
So, everybody is in the same place.

1886
01:46:11,458 --> 01:46:14,708
Dass, I called from the landline,
won't we get caught with a trace?

1887
01:46:14,917 --> 01:46:17,667
Why will we be caught? Whose name
the connection is in will be caught!

1888
01:46:17,833 --> 01:46:19,833
Yes, you are right!

1889
01:46:20,708 --> 01:46:22,542
Dass, she’s trying to say something.

1890
01:46:22,583 --> 01:46:24,042
She won’t anything head constable sir.

1891
01:46:24,708 --> 01:46:26,250
Head constable sir,
don’t do that!

1892
01:46:26,292 --> 01:46:27,167
Wait Dass, let us hear her out.

1893
01:46:27,208 --> 01:46:28,833
Oh, just take your hands away.

1894
01:46:28,875 --> 01:46:30,625
Head constable sir,
she is going to bathe me.

1895
01:46:32,250 --> 01:46:34,583
Oh no, what did you do?!

1896
01:46:34,583 --> 01:46:35,750
Have you any sense?!

1897
01:46:35,792 --> 01:46:37,125
What did you do, hey?!

1898
01:47:15,542 --> 01:47:16,417
Hello...

1899
01:47:16,458 --> 01:47:17,542
Who is this?!

1900
01:47:19,125 --> 01:47:20,292
I am Hand!

1901
01:47:20,292 --> 01:47:21,250
Where are you?!

1902
01:47:21,292 --> 01:47:24,458
In the factory behind
the old marriage Hall stop!

1903
01:47:24,583 --> 01:47:26,875
Hand, stay there I will send a vehicle.

1904
01:47:27,417 --> 01:47:29,958
Registration number TN 42 TN 22

1905
01:47:29,958 --> 01:47:30,792
Note it down.

1906
01:47:30,792 --> 01:47:31,542
Hand,

1907
01:47:31,750 --> 01:47:33,167
I can you read a little bit.

1908
01:47:33,167 --> 01:47:34,333
I don’t know to write.

1909
01:47:34,375 --> 01:47:35,792
I will remember it by heart.

1910
01:47:36,208 --> 01:47:38,042
TN 42 TN 22

1911
01:47:38,458 --> 01:47:39,500
Okay boss.

1912
01:47:39,500 --> 01:47:40,417
The second one is

1913
01:47:40,458 --> 01:47:41,667
TN 22

1914
01:47:41,792 --> 01:47:42,708
The hell,

1915
01:47:42,708 --> 01:47:45,708
first is TN 42 then is TN 22.

1916
01:47:45,750 --> 01:47:48,125
TN 22, TN 42

1917
01:47:48,542 --> 01:47:50,208
Hey, forget that.

1918
01:47:50,625 --> 01:47:52,375
My wife’s name is on
the back of the vehicle.

1919
01:47:52,708 --> 01:47:55,583
Boss, what is your wife’s name?!

1920
01:47:56,333 --> 01:47:58,708
My name is in front of the vehicle.

1921
01:47:58,750 --> 01:48:01,958
Boss, I don’t know your name!

1922
01:48:04,125 --> 01:48:06,042
Ek... Ekam... Ekam brass... get lost!

1923
01:48:06,458 --> 01:48:07,792
Okay boss!

1924
01:48:09,792 --> 01:48:13,083
I am not able to say my name
clearly as Ekambaram Arasar.

1925
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:15,917
Hair composer vehicle...

1926
01:48:15,958 --> 01:48:17,292
it must be air compressor.

1927
01:48:17,292 --> 01:48:18,292
Dass...

1928
01:48:18,583 --> 01:48:19,833
the Sentry was right.

1929
01:48:20,583 --> 01:48:22,375
Those two goons are here.

1930
01:48:24,292 --> 01:48:26,500
Inspector, I was told them follow us.

1931
01:48:27,083 --> 01:48:28,917
They are his spies.

1932
01:48:35,042 --> 01:48:36,667
The hell gave you a police job?

1933
01:48:37,208 --> 01:48:38,792
I too thought I wouldn’t get one sir.

1934
01:48:38,833 --> 01:48:42,833
They said if you stand upon Rs. 3 lakhs
we will adjust the height requirement.

1935
01:48:42,875 --> 01:48:45,542
I thought a bit criminally
and stacked Rs.50 notes sir.

1936
01:48:45,542 --> 01:48:47,500
Why, you should have stacked Rs.10 notes.

1937
01:48:47,542 --> 01:48:48,833
I couldn’t find any sir.

1938
01:48:50,958 --> 01:48:52,208
Where are you off to?

1939
01:48:52,250 --> 01:48:53,292
I’m going to the court sir.

1940
01:48:53,667 --> 01:48:54,875
Who is here in the station?

1941
01:48:54,917 --> 01:48:55,625
Nobody is here sir,

1942
01:48:55,625 --> 01:48:57,667
There is some disturbance in
the colony everybody is there.

1943
01:48:58,375 --> 01:48:59,625
Okay, I will take care.
Okay sir.

1944
01:49:07,375 --> 01:49:08,542
Will you eat biryani?

1945
01:49:10,417 --> 01:49:12,833
A Muslim friend has recently
opened a new biryani shop.

1946
01:49:13,750 --> 01:49:14,542
Shall I order?

1947
01:49:14,583 --> 01:49:15,833
It is just as in the station, right?

1948
01:49:15,833 --> 01:49:16,958
Yes sir.

1949
01:49:16,958 --> 01:49:17,917
Okay.

1950
01:49:20,125 --> 01:49:22,292
Is he here to do a job or just eat?!

1951
01:49:23,167 --> 01:49:24,417
He offered me a biryani...

1952
01:49:25,792 --> 01:49:27,542
biryani is here.
It is from friend’s shop.

1953
01:49:27,542 --> 01:49:29,292
Is there two?
Yes sir.

1954
01:49:31,083 --> 01:49:32,667
I should take the one on the top
and give the one on the bottom to him.

1955
01:49:32,708 --> 01:49:34,125
- Come sir
- Food received?

1956
01:49:34,125 --> 01:49:36,917
I was just about to come
inside but you are here now.

1957
01:49:36,917 --> 01:49:37,958
Where is your rifle?

1958
01:49:37,958 --> 01:49:39,375
I have kept it inside sir.

1959
01:49:39,375 --> 01:49:40,375
Have you eaten?

1960
01:49:40,417 --> 01:49:41,375
Not yet sir.

1961
01:49:41,417 --> 01:49:42,250
Come let’s go and eat.

1962
01:49:42,292 --> 01:49:43,958
Sir you are a senior officer please
go inside, I will eat here itself.

1963
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,875
It was the British

1964
01:49:46,667 --> 01:49:51,250
who discriminated based on physical attributes.
Without a shirt we are all Indians.

1965
01:49:52,458 --> 01:49:53,625
Sir you are a right person,

1966
01:49:53,625 --> 01:49:55,083
There is something left in you.

1967
01:49:55,125 --> 01:49:57,542
You are not just all
you have a big heart.

1968
01:49:57,542 --> 01:49:59,250
Sir, who will guard this place?

1969
01:49:59,292 --> 01:50:00,250
Don’t worry about that, come.

1970
01:50:00,250 --> 01:50:01,208
Okay sir.

1971
01:50:01,250 --> 01:50:03,083
Sir, are you really taking me inside?

1972
01:50:03,083 --> 01:50:04,375
I feel so happy.

1973
01:50:05,333 --> 01:50:06,458
Sir light....

1974
01:50:06,917 --> 01:50:07,667
Thank you sir.

1975
01:50:07,667 --> 01:50:09,417
Sir, what is this?

1976
01:50:09,458 --> 01:50:11,333
There are no chairs in this room

1977
01:50:11,375 --> 01:50:12,708
How will we sit and eat here?

1978
01:50:12,750 --> 01:50:15,083
That's okay, you sit there
and I will sit here and eat.

1979
01:50:15,333 --> 01:50:17,625
How did they learn
about my encounter plan?

1980
01:50:20,667 --> 01:50:21,917
Is he also in on this?

1981
01:50:25,667 --> 01:50:27,167
I knew it!

1982
01:50:27,167 --> 01:50:29,792
How will a senior officer
not know about this plan?

1983
01:50:30,208 --> 01:50:31,542
You are the eighth person, right?

1984
01:50:32,042 --> 01:50:33,708
If I am the eighth, who
are the remaining seven?

1985
01:50:33,750 --> 01:50:35,208
What sir, as if you don’t know!

1986
01:50:35,250 --> 01:50:36,875
Four are the robbers

1987
01:50:36,917 --> 01:50:38,458
Head Constable and
constable are the other two,

1988
01:50:38,500 --> 01:50:39,917
I am the seventh.

1989
01:50:39,958 --> 01:50:42,292
Thanks you are the eight, right?

1990
01:50:43,958 --> 01:50:45,167
Is that it?

1991
01:50:45,208 --> 01:50:46,792
Sir I have a doubt.

1992
01:50:47,333 --> 01:50:49,750
Is it just the eight or are there more?

1993
01:50:49,750 --> 01:50:52,583
If the number increases the share
decreases, I want to plan accordingly.

1994
01:50:53,708 --> 01:50:54,750
Why are you looking at the stick sir?

1995
01:50:55,375 --> 01:50:56,167
Let us do it.

1996
01:50:57,333 --> 01:50:58,250
So it’s just the eight.

1997
01:50:59,125 --> 01:51:00,250
Oh my, oh god!

1998
01:51:00,292 --> 01:51:01,625
Sir please don’t hit me sir. Sir!

1999
01:51:01,625 --> 01:51:03,167
Sir please don’t do this, please stop!

2000
01:51:04,667 --> 01:51:06,292
In the next half hour...

2001
01:51:06,792 --> 01:51:10,625
If I don’t know where they are
keeping my kidnapped wife.

2002
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:13,167
You will tell me!

2003
01:51:21,458 --> 01:51:22,792
Why did he just beat me?

2004
01:51:23,875 --> 01:51:25,958
He said we equal without our shirts.

2005
01:51:26,333 --> 01:51:28,000
What is that because he was
going to remove my shirt.

2006
01:51:29,125 --> 01:51:31,333
How will I know who is keeping his wife?!

2007
01:51:31,375 --> 01:51:32,167
Hey you!

2008
01:51:37,625 --> 01:51:38,333
Tell me sir.

2009
01:51:38,667 --> 01:51:39,292
Kareem bhai...

2010
01:51:39,875 --> 01:51:41,667
I have got the details
of where those guys are.

2011
01:51:42,375 --> 01:51:43,458
I will tell it to you note it down

2012
01:51:43,875 --> 01:51:45,667
They are in the bakery

2013
01:51:45,667 --> 01:51:46,583
next to the policy marriage hall.

2014
01:51:46,833 --> 01:51:50,250
Sir, that is the factory behind
the old marriage hall bus stop.

2015
01:51:50,250 --> 01:51:51,250
How do you know that?

2016
01:51:51,583 --> 01:51:52,708
I traced them there.

2017
01:51:52,958 --> 01:51:54,667
There is a difference
between what you are saying

2018
01:51:54,667 --> 01:51:57,042
and what they themselves told me.

2019
01:51:57,083 --> 01:51:58,500
Just do what I tell you to.

2020
01:52:08,458 --> 01:52:09,167
Hey!

2021
01:52:11,708 --> 01:52:12,917
Don’t play with me Prabha.

2022
01:52:39,667 --> 01:52:42,542
If you kill us, you will only silence us.

2023
01:52:43,917 --> 01:52:46,875
People only give voice to her sister.

2024
01:52:47,625 --> 01:52:49,042
Give me my phone sir.

2025
01:52:50,833 --> 01:52:51,958
Only then the girl will come.

2026
01:52:58,500 --> 01:52:59,708
Switch on the speaker.

2027
01:53:01,083 --> 01:53:01,792
Hello...

2028
01:53:02,125 --> 01:53:03,083
Where are you?

2029
01:53:03,083 --> 01:53:04,500
I am in Chennai.

2030
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:06,500
What is your program?

2031
01:53:06,500 --> 01:53:07,375
It is a private party.

2032
01:53:09,958 --> 01:53:11,542
Location?
I am sending it.

2033
01:53:14,917 --> 01:53:15,750
Prabha...

2034
01:53:16,125 --> 01:53:18,417
Will they identify Kajali without us?

2035
01:53:19,958 --> 01:53:21,042
They are playing games sir.

2036
01:53:22,042 --> 01:53:23,917
But an important play has been revealed.

2037
01:53:24,583 --> 01:53:26,042
There is a girl involved in this.

2038
01:53:26,042 --> 01:53:26,833
Who is she?

2039
01:53:27,917 --> 01:53:28,833
She is the elder sister of the dead girl.

2040
01:53:35,458 --> 01:53:36,375
Do one thing,

2041
01:53:36,667 --> 01:53:37,792
It’s not take this vehicle.

2042
01:53:37,833 --> 01:53:39,292
Call for a police car.

2043
01:53:47,625 --> 01:53:49,125
Head, stop head.

2044
01:53:50,292 --> 01:53:51,458
Air compressor vehicle.

2045
01:53:53,917 --> 01:53:56,042
Hand, where is the driver?

2046
01:53:56,083 --> 01:53:57,000
See there.

2047
01:53:57,875 --> 01:53:58,458
Boss,

2048
01:53:58,500 --> 01:53:59,792
Who are you guys?

2049
01:54:00,208 --> 01:54:01,750
Is this the air compressor vehicle?

2050
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:03,458
Yes it is, get lost.

2051
01:54:03,792 --> 01:54:04,875
Thank you boss.

2052
01:54:22,750 --> 01:54:24,708
Hand, it’s been three days
since I took a piss.

2053
01:54:24,750 --> 01:54:26,583
My tank will overflow, come let’s go.

2054
01:54:57,292 --> 01:54:58,583
Where is my vehicle?

2055
01:54:58,625 --> 01:54:59,917
I have to go to the marriage.

2056
01:55:14,958 --> 01:55:16,583
Head Constable you catch him
I will get the other guy.

2057
01:55:16,583 --> 01:55:17,625
Hey, come here you.

2058
01:55:18,167 --> 01:55:20,542
Hey, why are you catching us.

2059
01:55:20,542 --> 01:55:22,000
Hey, take your hand off me.

2060
01:55:22,042 --> 01:55:24,375
We know that Karimel Thunjiya Pandian
has give the stolen money to you.

2061
01:55:24,417 --> 01:55:26,583
Hey, who is Karimel Thunjiya Pandian?

2062
01:55:26,583 --> 01:55:28,417
Hey, how did you get this money?

2063
01:55:29,208 --> 01:55:31,292
They stole this money,
why are you after us?

2064
01:55:31,333 --> 01:55:33,583
Hey, I have been in service for 27 years.

2065
01:55:33,958 --> 01:55:36,250
I can identify the accused
by just looking at them.

2066
01:55:36,625 --> 01:55:37,292
Yeah, I can’t see that!

2067
01:55:38,250 --> 01:55:40,042
Sarcasm? Do you think you are funny?

2068
01:55:40,042 --> 01:55:41,583
Wait just a second I
will take care of you.

2069
01:55:41,625 --> 01:55:42,958
Dass, come and get me a rod.

2070
01:55:42,958 --> 01:55:44,417
Come quickly, come on!

2071
01:55:44,458 --> 01:55:45,167
Get it!

2072
01:55:45,167 --> 01:55:47,042
Here you go.

2073
01:55:47,083 --> 01:55:49,167
Go on... take care of them,
take care of them!

2074
01:55:51,875 --> 01:55:52,583
Take care!

2075
01:55:58,917 --> 01:55:59,333
Hey!

2076
01:56:00,625 --> 01:56:02,208
Hey...!

2077
01:56:02,250 --> 01:56:02,958
Stop it!

2078
01:56:02,958 --> 01:56:03,917
Brothers...

2079
01:56:04,750 --> 01:56:06,000
Let us talk and resolve this.

2080
01:56:06,500 --> 01:56:07,958
Let us talk, put the rod down.

2081
01:56:08,292 --> 01:56:09,583
Put it down, come on now.

2082
01:56:09,625 --> 01:56:10,958
Yes trust us put it down.

2083
01:56:10,958 --> 01:56:12,250
Let us come to a compromise.

2084
01:56:12,792 --> 01:56:13,958
I promise I will not hit you.

2085
01:56:15,292 --> 01:56:17,000
Let us make a compromise.
Glad to meet you!

2086
01:56:22,958 --> 01:56:24,625
We sent you to kill them in an encounter.

2087
01:56:24,667 --> 01:56:26,417
Do what you should and go!

2088
01:56:28,083 --> 01:56:29,042
I will kill you!

2089
01:56:29,083 --> 01:56:30,042
Hey head constable...

2090
01:56:30,083 --> 01:56:31,167
They are the ones who stole.

2091
01:56:31,208 --> 01:56:33,833
We didn’t steal, it was open so we took.

2092
01:56:33,875 --> 01:56:34,750
You buggers!

2093
01:56:35,292 --> 01:56:36,542
That is called stealing.

2094
01:56:36,792 --> 01:56:37,458
So sad!

2095
01:56:37,458 --> 01:56:39,333
What happen when you entered the ATM?

2096
01:56:39,333 --> 01:56:40,583
Two guys walked out.

2097
01:56:41,333 --> 01:56:42,375
Who are those two guys?

2098
01:56:42,417 --> 01:56:44,375
They were wearing black
shirt and black pants.

2099
01:56:44,375 --> 01:56:45,917
In which vehicle did you come?

2100
01:56:46,250 --> 01:56:47,625
Bank cash vehicle.

2101
01:56:48,292 --> 01:56:48,875
Head constable sir,

2102
01:56:49,583 --> 01:56:50,833
they didn’t mean to steal the money.

2103
01:56:51,125 --> 01:56:52,708
It was those two guys who
broke into the ATM.

2104
01:56:52,708 --> 01:56:54,458
Black shirt and black pants.

2105
01:56:54,750 --> 01:56:56,417
Because they came in a bank vehicle.

2106
01:56:56,458 --> 01:56:59,125
They must have thought they
were bank officers and fled.

2107
01:56:59,500 --> 01:57:00,750
When did you come into this?

2108
01:57:00,792 --> 01:57:03,958
I came when the yellow shirt and
green shirt guys were removing the money.

2109
01:57:03,958 --> 01:57:05,125
What is the bank vehicle there?

2110
01:57:05,542 --> 01:57:06,375
Yes it was.

2111
01:57:06,417 --> 01:57:07,333
Then it was them.
Yeah.

2112
01:57:08,167 --> 01:57:09,208
Then what did you do?

2113
01:57:09,458 --> 01:57:11,292
I came back within 10 to 15 minutes.

2114
01:57:11,667 --> 01:57:12,667
Then was the vehicle there?

2115
01:57:12,708 --> 01:57:13,292
No!

2116
01:57:13,333 --> 01:57:14,125
Then it was I us.

2117
01:57:14,500 --> 01:57:16,042
Then how did you have money with you?

2118
01:57:16,625 --> 01:57:18,917
I came to deposit her
money Head constable sir!

2119
01:57:18,958 --> 01:57:20,583
Everywhere it was this
yellow and green shirts,

2120
01:57:20,583 --> 01:57:21,792
I got confused!

2121
01:57:23,292 --> 01:57:25,000
None of us have done anything wrong.

2122
01:57:25,250 --> 01:57:27,208
Just answer my questions,

2123
01:57:27,417 --> 01:57:28,500
I will rescue you.

2124
01:57:28,833 --> 01:57:30,167
Who are you and where
are you coming from?

2125
01:57:30,667 --> 01:57:33,833
"Yellow shirt, Green Shirt..."

2126
01:57:39,708 --> 01:57:41,625
"Yellow shirt, Green Shirt..."

2127
01:57:44,875 --> 01:57:45,958
Head constable sir,

2128
01:57:45,958 --> 01:57:49,000
This is completely set
up by the ministers PA.

2129
01:57:49,625 --> 01:57:52,125
If they are coming to kill all of us,

2130
01:57:52,125 --> 01:57:54,000
it means they are all afraid of us.

2131
01:57:54,167 --> 01:57:56,292
If we take that fear away,

2132
01:57:56,292 --> 01:57:57,417
We can all be safe.

2133
01:57:59,250 --> 01:58:02,000
We have unknowingly
kidnapped an innocent girl.

2134
01:58:03,125 --> 01:58:03,958
Go and bring her here.

2135
01:58:04,167 --> 01:58:04,667
I will be back.

2136
01:58:05,708 --> 01:58:07,042
Carefully, slowly come here.

2137
01:58:07,042 --> 01:58:08,125
Please come and stand here.

2138
01:58:08,792 --> 01:58:09,583
She is here head constable sir.

2139
01:58:11,333 --> 01:58:13,292
I heard everything you were saying.

2140
01:58:13,458 --> 01:58:15,083
My husband is not like what you think.

2141
01:58:15,375 --> 01:58:16,458
He’s an honest man.

2142
01:58:16,792 --> 01:58:19,583
I am the one who keeps
nagging and torturing him.

2143
01:58:20,125 --> 01:58:21,833
I will speak to him on behalf of you.

2144
01:58:21,833 --> 01:58:22,917
That was till yesterday.

2145
01:58:23,042 --> 01:58:24,958
Once she should keep Rs.40,000 aside,

2146
01:58:24,958 --> 01:58:26,333
Your husband has changed.

2147
01:58:27,125 --> 01:58:29,958
As long as none of us are
in danger by your husband,

2148
01:58:29,958 --> 01:58:32,042
No harm will come to your husband by us.

2149
01:58:32,250 --> 01:58:33,333
Shall we do one thing?!

2150
01:58:34,042 --> 01:58:35,917
Shall all of us go and meet
Karimel Thunjiya Pandian.

2151
01:58:35,958 --> 01:58:37,750
Let him come here,

2152
01:58:38,125 --> 01:58:38,708
we will take care.

2153
01:59:07,875 --> 01:59:10,042
Sir,
Where is the bag?

2154
01:59:10,417 --> 01:59:10,958
Sir...

2155
01:59:11,667 --> 01:59:12,667
Where is the bag?!

2156
01:59:13,292 --> 01:59:13,958
Sir...

2157
01:59:14,792 --> 01:59:16,208
They were the ones who stole it sir.

2158
01:59:16,250 --> 01:59:21,125
Go and tell your long tails to
those scared fools who ran away.

2159
01:59:22,333 --> 01:59:25,542
Did I come here to solve the ATM case
and get a medal from the government?

2160
01:59:26,875 --> 01:59:28,333
Where is Paagambariya’s bag?

2161
01:59:30,667 --> 01:59:31,708
Where is the bag?

2162
01:59:32,542 --> 01:59:34,625
We have put it in the
air compressor vehicle.

2163
01:59:34,667 --> 01:59:35,625
It is parked outside,

2164
01:59:35,667 --> 01:59:37,042
and now I am surrendered!

2165
01:59:40,375 --> 01:59:40,958
Thannoli...

2166
01:59:41,167 --> 01:59:41,625
Th...!

2167
01:59:46,333 --> 01:59:47,458
Is she your darling?

2168
01:59:48,208 --> 01:59:49,250
Sweet spot...?

2169
01:59:50,625 --> 01:59:53,292
A villain shouldn’t have a
sweet spot Mr. mastermind!

2170
01:59:54,750 --> 01:59:55,917
Sir,
Where is the bag?!

2171
01:59:55,958 --> 01:59:59,542
Sir we went to deposit cash and got
caught up in all of this please believe us.

2172
02:00:00,583 --> 02:00:01,583
Sir,

2173
02:00:03,292 --> 02:00:04,500
Thannoli...

2174
02:00:05,542 --> 02:00:06,625
Sir...

2175
02:00:15,917 --> 02:00:18,417
I have completed my enquiry about
this case before coming here.

2176
02:00:20,375 --> 02:00:21,875
They both are mentally handicapped.

2177
02:00:22,500 --> 02:00:24,875
They were getting treated
in the psychiatric ward.

2178
02:00:27,500 --> 02:00:29,333
The two who ran away are fools.

2179
02:00:30,542 --> 02:00:34,750
You are looking to get them caught in
the ATM cash and escape with the bag.

2180
02:00:35,500 --> 02:00:38,792
I figured it out when the ATM camera
switched off only when you were near it.

2181
02:00:38,792 --> 02:00:41,958
I know who you are I know
who I should talk to.

2182
02:00:43,583 --> 02:00:45,292
Sir, this is Ekambaram’s planning.

2183
02:00:46,375 --> 02:00:47,500
Shit!

2184
02:00:48,625 --> 02:00:49,917
First go and arrest him sir.

2185
02:00:53,958 --> 02:00:58,125
I doubted him once he offered to
give me more than I asked him for.

2186
02:00:59,542 --> 02:01:01,625
I know he wants the bag for
himself and not Paagambariya.

2187
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:03,750
I enquired what is in the bag,

2188
02:01:04,667 --> 02:01:05,667
now I even know that.

2189
02:01:06,125 --> 02:01:11,042
I know that Paagambariya doesn’t
want that bag and Ekambaram does.

2190
02:01:11,042 --> 02:01:12,583
That is when I decided.

2191
02:01:13,917 --> 02:01:15,292
I am going to take the bag.

2192
02:01:17,125 --> 02:01:18,375
Shouldn’t I settle down in life.

2193
02:01:21,333 --> 02:01:25,292
As soon as Ekambaram gets the bag,
if I put the gun to his head.

2194
02:01:25,292 --> 02:01:26,708
he will hand it over himself.

2195
02:01:26,750 --> 02:01:29,042
Sir, then go and arrest him.

2196
02:01:31,042 --> 02:01:32,167
You are right.

2197
02:01:32,542 --> 02:01:34,125
I was waiting for the
bag to come into play.

2198
02:01:37,833 --> 02:01:41,333
When he called the old marriage hall
‘the policy marriage hall’ I realised,

2199
02:01:41,708 --> 02:01:42,833
That the bag won’t come into play.

2200
02:01:44,833 --> 02:01:46,583
That is why I came here myself.

2201
02:01:47,250 --> 02:01:50,250
If as a mastermind you want to play games?

2202
02:01:50,625 --> 02:01:53,958
I have made a Plan-B to
kill you all and take the bag.

2203
02:01:54,042 --> 02:01:57,042
He has also given me permission for it.

2204
02:01:59,750 --> 02:02:03,292
I am a dullard to let
you take away 22 crores!

2205
02:02:12,167 --> 02:02:12,917
Shit!

2206
02:02:21,458 --> 02:02:22,167
Kneel you...

2207
02:02:24,917 --> 02:02:25,792
Get over there.

2208
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:35,542
Sir, shall we go inside?

2209
02:02:35,583 --> 02:02:38,500
Sir, there definitely inside.
Shall we go in?

2210
02:02:40,083 --> 02:02:41,708
Mujeeb, it must be a clean sheet.

2211
02:02:42,625 --> 02:02:44,708
There must be 10 to 15 people inside.

2212
02:02:46,917 --> 02:02:48,617
We will take care of it
when they come out.

2213
02:03:12,558 --> 02:03:14,683
Your time seems to be auspicious

2214
02:03:14,708 --> 02:03:16,792
my brothers are here for a hunt.

2215
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:18,583
Let them finish and go,

2216
02:03:19,326 --> 02:03:20,659
we will talk after that.

2217
02:04:13,308 --> 02:04:17,225
"A growing lust is within me, please come."

2218
02:04:17,592 --> 02:04:21,833
"When you hug my mature
body it shivers with joy."

2219
02:04:21,875 --> 02:04:25,875
"Don’t touch me, I am highly poisonous."

2220
02:04:25,900 --> 02:04:30,734
"Don’t get caught I am
the lips that will bite you."

2221
02:04:30,759 --> 02:04:33,009
"In this very late hour,"

2222
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,333
"let us play hide and seek."

2223
02:04:39,250 --> 02:04:43,875
"Let water flow in a dry riverbed."

2224
02:04:43,917 --> 02:04:48,417
"Let water flow in a dry riverbed."

2225
02:05:14,500 --> 02:05:18,667
"Which is part that the
wind never touches?"

2226
02:05:18,708 --> 02:05:23,042
"Men really loved it
and it is women’s heart."

2227
02:05:23,083 --> 02:05:27,167
"Which pitch is never sung in a song?"

2228
02:05:27,250 --> 02:05:31,792
"As soon as you open a
bottle you will learn it."

2229
02:05:31,875 --> 02:05:33,417
"Scarcity..."

2230
02:05:33,958 --> 02:05:36,250
"I have none of it."

2231
02:05:36,292 --> 02:05:38,375
"Regret..."

2232
02:05:38,417 --> 02:05:40,625
"is all you will have."

2233
02:05:40,667 --> 02:05:44,583
"You keep looking at me,
shall I return every day?"

2234
02:05:44,625 --> 02:05:49,042
"You take aim and strike me,
shall I give you a kiss?"

2235
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:02,292
"A growing lust is within me, please come."

2236
02:06:02,333 --> 02:06:06,999
"When you hug my mature
body it shivers with joy."

2237
02:06:32,917 --> 02:06:36,750
"There in auto that doesn’t use a meter?"

2238
02:06:36,833 --> 02:06:41,208
"If you just show your hand
it will stop by itself?"

2239
02:06:41,667 --> 02:06:45,875
"Is there a house without a door?"

2240
02:06:45,917 --> 02:06:50,000
"Turn that into a fort of love."

2241
02:06:50,583 --> 02:06:52,167
"Butterflies..."

2242
02:06:52,667 --> 02:06:54,708
"flutter in my heart."

2243
02:06:54,750 --> 02:06:57,042
"Take a coconut shell..."

2244
02:06:57,208 --> 02:06:59,042
"Tap a nice rhythm on it."

2245
02:06:59,042 --> 02:07:03,375
"You have to walk this hand cart,
come and practice how to do so."

2246
02:07:03,458 --> 02:07:07,833
"This crop filled truck is out of control,
come and steal all that you can."

2247
02:07:07,833 --> 02:07:09,792
Hey, time is running out!

2248
02:07:10,458 --> 02:07:12,000
Now you have only two options.

2249
02:07:12,042 --> 02:07:13,125
One,

2250
02:07:13,167 --> 02:07:15,542
Handover the bag to me and
I will let everybody live.

2251
02:07:15,542 --> 02:07:18,875
Or else I will kill everybody,
take the bag and go

2252
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,375
There is also a third option
Karimel Thunjiya Pandian.

2253
02:07:22,417 --> 02:07:24,542
I can kill you and get out of here.

2254
02:07:34,708 --> 02:07:36,750
What Prabha, have you set us up?

2255
02:07:41,542 --> 02:07:43,333
What Mujeeb sir,

2256
02:07:43,375 --> 02:07:46,458
you said get me the video
recorded in the watch

2257
02:07:46,500 --> 02:07:48,833
I will negotiate with Judhani,

2258
02:07:49,333 --> 02:07:50,792
Now you have jumped ship?!

2259
02:07:50,833 --> 02:07:52,333
What Mujeeb, are you playing a double game.

2260
02:07:52,375 --> 02:07:53,958
Sir, he is playing sir.

2261
02:07:54,167 --> 02:07:55,417
Hey, it is that girl Kajali!

2262
02:08:22,792 --> 02:08:24,292
Come

2263
02:08:32,999 --> 02:08:35,125
Karimel Thunjiya Pandian is on to us sir!

2264
02:09:02,750 --> 02:09:04,333
When will all of this end?

2265
02:09:07,708 --> 02:09:11,708
As long as Judhani is alive we cannot be.

2266
02:09:12,417 --> 02:09:14,000
Go out!

2267
02:09:15,375 --> 02:09:17,125
Dear!

2268
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:23,500
My dear...!

2269
02:09:35,208 --> 02:09:38,125
I don’t have time to fight with you.

2270
02:09:38,167 --> 02:09:40,292
I will save myself.

2271
02:09:40,792 --> 02:09:43,083
If you can, save yourself.

2272
02:09:44,208 --> 02:09:45,583
Come let’s go.

2273
02:09:47,542 --> 02:09:48,417
Look here.

2274
02:09:48,792 --> 02:09:52,208
You know I can kill the both
of you and escape from here.

2275
02:09:52,375 --> 02:09:55,000
Because we both are
not registered anywhere.

2276
02:09:55,083 --> 02:09:57,625
But there is a way
where we can all escape.

2277
02:09:57,667 --> 02:09:59,708
If that’s okay with
you just raise your hand.

2278
02:10:03,500 --> 02:10:05,458
Don’t do anything to him.

2279
02:10:06,458 --> 02:10:08,000
Karimel Thunjiya Pandian,

2280
02:10:08,042 --> 02:10:09,875
Tell the media exactly what I say now.

2281
02:10:10,250 --> 02:10:13,125
Those three police officers used these
two crazies to rob the ATM,

2282
02:10:13,167 --> 02:10:17,125
After you discovered this you came here,
they shot at you and so you shot back.

2283
02:10:17,167 --> 02:10:18,750
Nobody can arrest them,

2284
02:10:18,792 --> 02:10:21,042
because they are mentally handicapped.

2285
02:10:21,125 --> 02:10:22,917
You too will be safe.

2286
02:10:22,958 --> 02:10:24,708
I will immediately called for an ambulance.

2287
02:10:36,958 --> 02:10:40,625
Hey, get out of here as soon as
you can and call for an ambulance. Go.

2288
02:10:40,667 --> 02:10:42,458
How can I leave without you?

2289
02:10:42,500 --> 02:10:43,250
Banu,

2290
02:10:43,250 --> 02:10:45,833
three police officers are dead
and one is fighting for his life.

2291
02:10:45,875 --> 02:10:47,292
It is best that you are not here, so leave.

2292
02:10:47,333 --> 02:10:49,292
I said just leave!

2293
02:10:50,583 --> 02:10:52,583
Bro, let us also runaway.

2294
02:10:52,583 --> 02:10:55,125
Hey, what are you saying
the bank you still here.

2295
02:10:55,208 --> 02:10:57,167
Hey, what will you do with those documents?

2296
02:10:57,208 --> 02:11:00,125
Hey, those are not just documents.

2297
02:11:00,792 --> 02:11:02,208
Come I will show you.

2298
02:11:35,042 --> 02:11:37,125
Hey, Jackpot!

2299
02:11:42,125 --> 02:11:46,999
Just a little while police, ambulance
and everybody else will be here.

2300
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:48,833
It’s not safe for us here.

2301
02:11:50,417 --> 02:11:53,292
Let us hide the bag somewhere
in the factory and leave.

2302
02:11:53,333 --> 02:11:57,583
Once everything settles down, we will come
back tomorrow morning, get the money and live

2303
02:11:57,999 --> 02:11:59,208
Come

2304
02:12:01,167 --> 02:12:02,875
Move it a bit more.

2305
02:12:04,167 --> 02:12:06,083
Come let's go.

2306
02:12:25,667 --> 02:12:28,833
What, you seem to have escaped from
a huge case I saw it in the news.

2307
02:12:28,875 --> 02:12:32,292
Okay, two strong teas
and a pack of cigarettes.

2308
02:12:32,958 --> 02:12:34,875
No way, I don’t have change here!

2309
02:12:34,958 --> 02:12:36,917
I don’t want the change, you can keep it.

2310
02:12:36,917 --> 02:12:40,542
Karimel Thunjiya Pandian,
was severely injured...

2311
02:12:40,583 --> 02:12:45,083
...in a shootout where he
killed 3 police men!

2312
02:12:45,917 --> 02:12:47,500
There is no big problem sir.

2313
02:12:47,542 --> 02:12:49,375
It’s a ricocheted bullet injury.

2314
02:12:49,375 --> 02:12:51,083
Mandible was fractured.

2315
02:12:51,125 --> 02:12:52,583
We have done a minor surgery.

2316
02:12:52,667 --> 02:12:54,125
He will recover soon.

2317
02:12:54,292 --> 02:12:55,083
Can I talk to him?

2318
02:12:55,125 --> 02:12:57,292
You won’t be able to speak
but you can talk to him.

2319
02:12:57,375 --> 02:13:00,083
Karimel Thunjiya Pandian is okay now.

2320
02:13:00,125 --> 02:13:01,875
He will soon return to duty.

2321
02:13:02,083 --> 02:13:04,042
The three men he shot,

2322
02:13:04,250 --> 02:13:05,792
Have been identified as

2323
02:13:05,833 --> 02:13:07,708
Criminals pretending to be police.

2324
02:13:07,750 --> 02:13:10,542
Karimel Thunjiya Pandian who
was an inspector till now,

2325
02:13:10,667 --> 02:13:13,625
has now been promoted to DSP.

2326
02:13:13,999 --> 02:13:18,500
To compensate for his injury,
4 lakhs from the internal ministry and

2327
02:13:18,542 --> 02:13:21,167
4 lakhs from the chief
minister’s relief fund,

2328
02:13:21,208 --> 02:13:23,750
...a total of 8 lakhs be
presented to his family.

2329
02:13:33,542 --> 02:13:38,625
The video of the murder of Arabian dancer
Chaya, who was missing has come to light.

2330
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:42,125
A special team is about to arrest
the suspect Dilip Judhani.

2331
02:13:42,167 --> 02:13:45,667
Rowdy Prabha and his accomplice
have surrendered the evidence.

2332
02:13:51,125 --> 02:13:54,875
Ekabaram, arrange to bail them both out.

2333
02:13:55,125 --> 02:13:57,250
Both of them are violent criminals,

2334
02:13:57,375 --> 02:13:59,875
an they are stuck in a complicated case.

2335
02:13:59,999 --> 02:14:03,208
They went in for us right, bail them out.

2336
02:14:03,999 --> 02:14:05,417
Okay sis.

2337
02:14:09,417 --> 02:14:11,958
Sir, the police is here
with an arrest warrant.

2338
02:14:21,125 --> 02:14:24,417
Now, you should learn to eat by yourself.

2339
02:14:31,250 --> 02:14:32,583
Go

2340
02:14:41,958 --> 02:14:42,999
Hey!

2341
02:14:45,583 --> 02:14:46,958
Where is the bag?

2342
02:14:54,625 --> 02:14:56,583
Hey don’t burn it.

2343
02:15:07,208 --> 02:15:08,167
Hey!

2344
02:15:09,500 --> 02:15:10,333
Hey,

2345
02:15:10,375 --> 02:15:11,125
Sir!

2346
02:15:11,125 --> 02:15:12,500
Why did you do this?

2347
02:15:12,542 --> 02:15:14,167
He is deaf.

2348
02:15:20,792 --> 02:15:21,917
Why!

2349
02:15:22,333 --> 02:15:23,500
I burnt it.

2350
02:15:23,958 --> 02:15:25,125
I burnt it all

2351
02:15:25,833 --> 02:15:28,625
So much money can only be wrong.

2352
02:15:29,208 --> 02:15:32,000
Only wrong money can come here like this.

2353
02:15:32,625 --> 02:15:36,125
That is why I burnt it, money wrong.

2354
02:15:47,708 --> 02:15:48,750
In Lanka,

2355
02:15:50,958 --> 02:15:53,833
When we fought for our rights.

2356
02:15:55,833 --> 02:15:57,292
One bullet...

2357
02:15:57,708 --> 02:15:59,500
just one bullet!

2358
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,542
Took away my eyes and ears.

2359
02:16:02,917 --> 02:16:05,250
Having lost two of my senses...

2360
02:16:05,833 --> 02:16:08,999
I was living in a prison of my own body.

2361
02:16:09,542 --> 02:16:11,333
You middle of the ocean

2362
02:16:11,375 --> 02:16:13,750
in the island...

2363
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:16,042
all alone.

2364
02:16:16,875 --> 02:16:19,125
in lap of this blind and deaf man.

2365
02:16:20,292 --> 02:16:22,958
She lay there on my lap.

2366
02:16:24,083 --> 02:16:26,250
She had a disease.

2367
02:16:26,333 --> 02:16:29,375
The great disease of hunger and thirst.

2368
02:16:29,792 --> 02:16:33,125
The medicine for that,
was food and water

2369
02:16:34,667 --> 02:16:37,500
Money should surely by that, right?!

2370
02:16:38,500 --> 02:16:39,792
I too thought

2371
02:16:39,833 --> 02:16:41,458
it surely would.

2372
02:16:42,708 --> 02:16:44,542
But there was no food to buy,

2373
02:16:44,917 --> 02:16:46,333
No water to drink.

2374
02:16:47,125 --> 02:16:48,333
In the middle of the ocean.

2375
02:16:49,083 --> 02:16:51,125
In the middle of the island.

2376
02:16:51,292 --> 02:16:53,833
I screamed to let others know,

2377
02:16:55,083 --> 02:16:58,417
and I bought both of them to be shore

2378
02:16:59,542 --> 02:17:02,000
The courts of my wife...

2379
02:17:02,542 --> 02:17:04,375
and a lot of money.

2380
02:17:05,917 --> 02:17:08,250
I burnt them both!

2381
02:17:10,917 --> 02:17:11,750
Money...

2382
02:17:12,333 --> 02:17:15,042
It is the cruelest weapon that man invented.

2383
02:17:15,125 --> 02:17:17,417
Cave man had very little needs.

2384
02:17:17,458 --> 02:17:21,792
Food to eat, water and a place to shelter.

2385
02:17:24,083 --> 02:17:26,750
Once people start to occupy these shelters,

2386
02:17:27,042 --> 02:17:28,667
his greed surfaces!

2387
02:17:28,708 --> 02:17:29,667
Money...

2388
02:17:30,292 --> 02:17:31,333
Money...What is it?

2389
02:17:31,625 --> 02:17:33,458
It is nothing.

2390
02:17:33,958 --> 02:17:37,792
I promise to pay the
bearer the sum of Rs.500.

2391
02:17:37,833 --> 02:17:39,375
Money is an abstract.

2392
02:17:39,750 --> 02:17:40,999
It is an inclusion.

2393
02:17:41,500 --> 02:17:43,000
It is just a promise.

2394
02:17:44,125 --> 02:17:46,292
If one day that promises is broken,

2395
02:17:47,125 --> 02:17:48,958
They will say it is worthless.

2396
02:17:48,999 --> 02:17:50,792
Because that money remains

2397
02:17:51,042 --> 02:17:52,958
as a belief.

2398
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:54,250
As his riches

2399
02:17:54,458 --> 02:17:56,917
and as all his needs

2400
02:17:57,250 --> 02:17:58,458
Money...

2401
02:17:58,667 --> 02:18:01,625
The cruelest weapon man invented

2402
02:18:01,625 --> 02:18:03,542
Money can you break a man.

2403
02:18:03,958 --> 02:18:05,500
Money is everything.

2404
02:18:06,083 --> 02:18:07,625
Money is a dictator.

2405
02:18:08,375 --> 02:18:09,792
Money is Almighty!

2406
02:18:10,750 --> 02:18:12,250
It becomes the creator of all misery

2407
02:18:13,250 --> 02:18:15,042
As long is they were goods

2408
02:18:15,708 --> 02:18:18,042
riches were equally distributed among all.

2409
02:18:18,625 --> 02:18:19,833
Once it became money...

2410
02:18:20,125 --> 02:18:21,750
it accumulates with one person,

2411
02:18:22,458 --> 02:18:24,667
and the rest become slaves.

2412
02:18:25,583 --> 02:18:26,542
Riches,

2413
02:18:26,708 --> 02:18:28,417
must be shared!

2414
02:18:29,375 --> 02:18:31,583
Only a society without money.

2415
02:18:32,250 --> 02:18:34,999
The starting of the
next level of civilization.

2416
02:18:35,875 --> 02:18:38,792
If mankind needs to be respected

2417
02:18:39,999 --> 02:18:42,833
A society without money should be created.

2418
02:18:48,542 --> 02:18:51,000
We need a society without money

2419
02:18:51,583 --> 02:18:53,999
and to create that,

2420
02:18:54,125 --> 02:18:57,000
an understanding of the truth

2421
02:18:57,042 --> 02:18:58,792
is what man needs.

2422
02:19:11,083 --> 02:19:14,375
Our king Thannoli, made it his job

2423
02:19:14,458 --> 02:19:18,292
to teach everyone ancient way of life
where he ghost of money never existed.

2424
02:19:18,333 --> 02:19:20,750
and so this story comes to an end.
