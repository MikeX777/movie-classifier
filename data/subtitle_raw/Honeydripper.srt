1
00:00:33,795 --> 00:00:36,834
Come on, lay off with that scratch!

2
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:39,318
Ain't bothering you.

3
00:00:39,353 --> 00:00:42,412
Yes it is,
that ain't no kind of music.

4
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,630
At least I make a sound.

5
00:00:44,687 --> 00:00:47,374
Yeah, and it's a nasty one.

6
00:00:58,464 --> 00:01:01,463
Wanna try again tonight?
Might as well.

7
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:27,558
MUSIC PLAYS FROM CLUB

8
00:03:53,536 --> 00:03:58,354
# I know a gal
by the name of Maid Lou

9
00:03:58,454 --> 00:04:03,751
# She shook it so much
she had the German flu

10
00:04:03,851 --> 00:04:05,771
# No matter how she done it

11
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:11,248
# Oh, no matter how she done it

12
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:18,169
# Well, no matter how she done it

13
00:04:18,272 --> 00:04:22,230
# She done it just the same

14
00:04:25,662 --> 00:04:27,681
# The women didn't like her

15
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,972
# And they called her out
of her name

16
00:04:31,059 --> 00:04:33,768
# But the men, they loved her

17
00:04:33,803 --> 00:04:36,279
# Mmm, it was a crying shame

18
00:04:36,314 --> 00:04:38,756
# No matter how she done it

19
00:04:41,235 --> 00:04:43,434
# No matter how she done it

20
00:04:46,802 --> 00:04:51,120
# Well, no matter how she done it

21
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:55,549
# She done it just the same

22
00:04:56,653 --> 00:05:00,370
# No matter how she done it

23
00:05:00,448 --> 00:05:04,187
# She done it just the same

24
00:05:06,499 --> 00:05:08,098
# Yes, she did. #

25
00:05:15,935 --> 00:05:17,979
You take it for a while.

26
00:05:18,014 --> 00:05:21,452
They making all that racket again
at Toussaint's.

27
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,488
Yeah, all them people
over there buying drinks,

28
00:05:24,523 --> 00:05:27,490
throwin' that money after them
dice and what not.

29
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,449
Lucky we got none of that here.

30
00:05:31,968 --> 00:05:34,487
# You can drink your liquor

31
00:05:34,987 --> 00:05:38,645
# You can drink your cold can beer

32
00:05:41,943 --> 00:05:44,862
# You can drink your good whisky

33
00:05:44,962 --> 00:05:48,321
# You can drink your cool can beer

34
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,779
# You can stay out
all with your sweet gal

35
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:57,997
# But, Papa,
don't you leave me here

36
00:05:58,762 --> 00:06:01,941
# I hear that wild ox moaning

37
00:06:01,964 --> 00:06:04,823
# Looking for that Texas... #

38
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,789
Sounding good, huh?

39
00:06:08,712 --> 00:06:11,490
Sounds fine. Always has.

40
00:06:13,285 --> 00:06:16,764
Not much of a crowd. Not a crowd at all,

41
00:06:16,766 --> 00:06:21,743
just some stiffs who wanna drink themselves
to sleep without the music waking them up.

42
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:24,185
You oughta advertise.

43
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,305
Got an attraction like Bertha Mae.

44
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,738
Singing is one thing, Slick, but
whether people wanna look at you

45
00:06:29,773 --> 00:06:32,502
when you do it is another.
Got quite a number

46
00:06:32,537 --> 00:06:35,261
over the Toussaint's place tonight.
Sounds like it.

47
00:06:35,296 --> 00:06:38,499
Lots of young folks coming in
to listen to that box of his.

48
00:06:38,534 --> 00:06:43,333
I don't see why we don't just turn our
box on, let folks feed it nickels like they do.

49
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:46,319
The lady is singing.

50
00:06:46,354 --> 00:06:51,391
# You hear me pleading, baby
Baby, don't you leave me here... #

51
00:06:51,426 --> 00:06:54,870
But didn't nobody come
to listen to her, Slick.

52
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,074
# Come here, sweet Daddy

53
00:06:58,109 --> 00:07:01,792
# Let me whisper in your ear... #

54
00:07:01,827 --> 00:07:05,306
Like the man say,
you can't argue with failure.

55
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:08,502
You know why Slick
here's like a preacher?

56
00:07:08,537 --> 00:07:11,663
Cos he do all his best work
on his knees!

57
00:07:12,422 --> 00:07:14,421
Never mind him, he's just drunk.

58
00:07:14,462 --> 00:07:18,780
I heard she put a ring through it,
use it to drag him round the house.

59
00:07:19,712 --> 00:07:22,330
Come on, you know Tyrone
don't like no scuffle in here.

60
00:07:22,351 --> 00:07:25,829
I ought to get me old lady,
help out with the groceries...

61
00:07:25,976 --> 00:07:29,735
You just gotta sweet talk her some,
give her a little poke every now and then.

62
00:07:29,788 --> 00:07:35,226
You gonna drink,
or you gonna lay Gentlemen!

63
00:07:35,465 --> 00:07:37,069
Miss Delilah.

64
00:07:37,104 --> 00:07:39,423
Let's behave ourselves.

65
00:07:40,786 --> 00:07:42,245
What are you boys doing in here?

66
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:46,020
Out, out! And what are you
doing behind that bar?

67
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:49,868
It's just for a minute.
That's 60 seconds too long.

68
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:51,298
Maceo, take that child's place.

69
00:07:51,898 --> 00:07:55,057
You bring people their food,
Nobody's eating!

70
00:07:55,797 --> 00:07:58,654
That's cos nobody's here
but these couple of lost souls.

71
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:02,987
Haven't had an appetite since
they gave over to the devil.

72
00:08:09,764 --> 00:08:14,162
Evening, Maceo,
you looking good tonight!

73
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,649
Likewise, Miss Nadine.

74
00:08:16,853 --> 00:08:18,233
What can I do for you?

75
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:21,223
Oh, you know what you can do for me,
sweet man.

76
00:08:23,383 --> 00:08:25,822
What would you like... to drink?

77
00:08:31,991 --> 00:08:33,750
How many is that tonight?

78
00:08:34,173 --> 00:08:35,898
Don't talk to me about that, baby.

79
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:39,011
Not tonight. I don't want
China Doll behind that bar.

80
00:08:39,046 --> 00:08:40,536
She's got to help out.

81
00:08:40,571 --> 00:08:44,049
Not behind there she doesn't. You
know she's not supposed to get excited.

82
00:08:44,084 --> 00:08:46,093
Not much chance of that in here.

83
00:08:46,128 --> 00:08:50,367
Harvest hands all crowded in
to Toussaint's place.

84
00:08:50,402 --> 00:08:52,131
Young ones.

85
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,170
You'll get some of them.

86
00:08:54,205 --> 00:08:58,763
They'll stick their noses in here, get
one little sniff of the music and go home.

87
00:08:59,143 --> 00:09:01,287
Maybe that's the wages of sin.

88
00:09:01,303 --> 00:09:03,702
Ain't no sin happening
here tonight, baby.

89
00:09:03,737 --> 00:09:06,066
And there sure as hell
ain't no wages.

90
00:09:06,101 --> 00:09:10,258
Your God wants to chastise some sinners,
he'd best go over to Toussaint's.

91
00:09:10,293 --> 00:09:12,657
Got a whole bar room
crowded with them.

92
00:09:12,692 --> 00:09:14,301
He's not my God.

93
00:09:14,636 --> 00:09:16,856
He's everybody's God.

94
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,214
How did the meeting go tonight?

95
00:09:24,851 --> 00:09:27,735
Viola Underwood found the Lord.

96
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,694
If she'd found Him last,
she wouldn't have come through.

97
00:09:31,787 --> 00:09:37,905
She must have lost Him again between 
then and now cos she come down that aisle 
tonight hollering in tongues.

98
00:09:40,815 --> 00:09:42,733
The spirit didn't move you, though?

99
00:09:44,197 --> 00:09:45,396
Not yet.

100
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:50,124
Maybe it's too late for me.

101
00:09:56,317 --> 00:09:59,415
I can't believe he's serving
Alton Stokely. That poor man.

102
00:09:59,813 --> 00:10:02,002
Toussaint cut his credit off.

103
00:10:02,037 --> 00:10:07,535
Either he gets it here, or he drinks 
that paint peeler Willie Pettigrew 
cuts up back in his swamp.

104
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:10,134
I'm gonna go home,
say a prayer for that man.

105
00:10:11,573 --> 00:10:13,172
Say one for me too, baby.

106
00:10:24,646 --> 00:10:27,130
Outstanding, baby. 

107
00:10:27,165 --> 00:10:29,464
Outstanding. You've still got the voice.

108
00:10:29,499 --> 00:10:32,763
You think so? - Chills down my spine
just to hear you.

109
00:10:34,814 --> 00:10:37,752
Ty, I'm gonna be
a little late Saturday.

110
00:10:38,332 --> 00:10:41,536
No need to come in
if you don't want to.

111
00:10:43,303 --> 00:10:45,702
I've made other arrangements.

112
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:48,679
Other arrangements?

113
00:10:46,737 --> 00:10:51,014
Try something new in here.
You can't do that. Yes, he can, darling.

114
00:10:51,049 --> 00:10:56,052
This is his place,
and he can do whatever he wants.

115
00:10:56,087 --> 00:10:57,931
You'll know where to find me
when you need me.

116
00:11:08,127 --> 00:11:10,546
Put the box on now, Ty?

117
00:11:10,581 --> 00:11:12,930
Yeah, put the box on.

118
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:16,844
I'm gonna crank it up some,
see if we can draw some life in here.

119
00:11:19,802 --> 00:11:21,961
LOUD JAZZ MUSIC

120
00:11:29,997 --> 00:11:31,761
There it goes again.

121
00:11:31,796 --> 00:11:35,355
Electricity don't like that jukebox.

122
00:11:41,712 --> 00:11:44,036
Must be a short circuit
in the juke here.

123
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:47,869
Got to get the power company No,
they turned my juice off last month.

124
00:11:47,904 --> 00:11:51,548
I don't want you sniffing
around that splice out Maceo did.

125
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:54,024
It's nice in here.

126
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:56,431
Kind of romantic.

127
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,904
I'm gonna have to go out back,
wiggle some things around.

128
00:11:59,939 --> 00:12:03,342
Don't you wiggle nothing round
unless I'm there to see it.

129
00:12:03,377 --> 00:12:06,381
You don't worry, folks,
bar's still open.

130
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,537
Evening, folks.

131
00:12:19,895 --> 00:12:22,754
Evening, Sherriff.

132
00:12:22,789 --> 00:12:25,613
Your light's gone out.

133
00:12:25,648 --> 00:12:27,537
Looks like it.

134
00:12:27,572 --> 00:12:30,651
You'll know that'll be a violation
of something or other.

135
00:12:30,686 --> 00:12:32,770
We're just about to close up here.

136
00:12:34,289 --> 00:12:36,647
Oh. Ooh, your wife been cooking?

137
00:12:36,682 --> 00:12:38,651
Not tonight.

138
00:12:38,686 --> 00:12:40,450
Went to a revival chat.

139
00:12:40,485 --> 00:12:43,809
Ah, I stood by there myself.

140
00:12:43,844 --> 00:12:47,367
Them niggers were singing up a storm.

141
00:12:47,402 --> 00:12:50,281
I just came out here
to look in on Toussaint.

142
00:12:50,316 --> 00:12:54,040
Had that shooting two nights ago.

143
00:12:54,075 --> 00:12:56,079
Lots of fighting in there.

144
00:12:56,114 --> 00:12:58,643
There is that.

145
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:01,996
Course, me and old Toussaint,

146
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,515
we got us an agreement.

147
00:13:07,594 --> 00:13:11,038
Them field hands
start sucking down that whisky,

148
00:13:11,073 --> 00:13:15,310
hopping them all up with music,
there's gonna be some razors drawn.

149
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:19,713
Course, he only call me
if it's a fatality.

150
00:13:19,748 --> 00:13:24,506
Never been a killing here. Them
youngbloods know better than to mess...

151
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:27,630
Than to mess with Tyrone Purvis.

152
00:13:27,665 --> 00:13:31,163
You've got quite a reputation
round here, Tyrone.

153
00:13:31,198 --> 00:13:34,662
People say you put some poor
black boy in the grave.

154
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,698
Just people talking.

155
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:45,222
Uh-huh.

156
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:46,820
You just remember,

157
00:13:46,855 --> 00:13:48,940
this is my county, Tyrone.

158
00:13:48,975 --> 00:13:52,018
What goes on goes on cos I let it.

159
00:13:52,053 --> 00:13:55,412
Don't want nobody getting too big
for their breeches round here.

160
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,129
You folks have a pleasant evening.

161
00:14:13,964 --> 00:14:15,643
Nigger ain't shit in this world.

162
00:14:17,043 --> 00:14:19,447
Speaking for yourself.

163
00:14:19,482 --> 00:14:24,559
You ain't had his club, Tyrone,
what do you think you'd be?

164
00:14:24,594 --> 00:14:27,158
You wouldn't be nothing.

165
00:14:28,677 --> 00:14:31,995
If that ain't truth,
then grits ain't grocery.

166
00:14:47,229 --> 00:14:50,473
TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS

167
00:14:50,508 --> 00:14:53,751
That's a terrible noise.

168
00:14:53,786 --> 00:14:57,424
Just the northbound Talladega.
Sounds like it always does.

169
00:14:57,459 --> 00:15:01,342
Like a soul being carried away
from this life.

170
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,704
Come on in, darling,

171
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:09,739
before you catch
your death out here.

172
00:15:41,844 --> 00:15:46,362
You're lucky the high sheriff ain't
seen you crawling out that boxcar.

173
00:15:46,397 --> 00:15:49,641
Does he come around here much?
Only when he bored.

174
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,759
You working on a train?Yeah, 
Kansas City to New Orleans.

175
00:15:53,794 --> 00:15:56,375
What did you get off here for?

176
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:58,823
I got people here. How about you?

177
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:01,236
Got tired of sleeping in a boxcar.

178
00:16:03,035 --> 00:16:05,634
Is there a place to stay
around here?

179
00:16:05,669 --> 00:16:07,118
Shed right over there got a cot.

180
00:16:07,153 --> 00:16:10,631
And don't mind the rats.
Not unless you've got food on you.

181
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:14,075
I see you and a good meal have
been strangers for some time.

182
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:19,027
Get into town tomorrow, find you need
something, tell them Shack Thomas sent you.

183
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:23,706
They'll know who you're
talking about. Thanks.

184
00:16:27,944 --> 00:16:31,222
Name like that sounds like
a good place for a musician.

185
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:36,740
Only night I ever been in jail
was a town called Liberty.

186
00:16:36,775 --> 00:16:39,099
The sun come up,
you'll see where you landed.

187
00:16:44,936 --> 00:16:47,534
You'd best be out that shed
by first light.

188
00:17:05,007 --> 00:17:09,365
Just a weekday night.
The chicken man or the ice man

189
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,724
At least you don't owe
the electric company.

190
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:13,484
Yeah, that's a big relief.

191
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,479
You thinking about closing down?

192
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:33,199
What do you think?The biggest 
act in New Orleans.

193
00:17:33,234 --> 00:17:36,433
Got him a hit on the radio.
He's playing here Saturday night.

194
00:17:36,468 --> 00:17:39,632
I'm thinking I wait till Bertha Mae
was gone and I put him up.

195
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:41,276
Here?

196
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:43,515
You mean like in this room here?

197
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,354
You know the Tomcat Club
in Texicana?

198
00:17:45,389 --> 00:17:48,588
Big Jim Jameson's place?
It just went out of business.

199
00:17:48,623 --> 00:17:56,149
Damn. Since Sam is getting sway over

200
00:17:56,184 --> 00:18:00,182
But you ain't never had no guitar...
I'm having one now.

201
00:18:03,221 --> 00:18:06,864
You just worry about getting these
hung everywhere in the county tomorrow.

202
00:18:06,899 --> 00:18:12,377
Payday Saturday, he's gonna draw all them
cotton pickers and soldier boys in here.

203
00:18:12,412 --> 00:18:14,373
Get us back in the black.

204
00:18:14,408 --> 00:18:16,511
They're gonna take me down,

205
00:18:16,546 --> 00:18:18,639
it won't be without a fight.

206
00:18:18,674 --> 00:18:20,733
Guitar Sam at the Honeydripper!

207
00:18:20,768 --> 00:18:22,418
Mm-hm!

208
00:18:22,453 --> 00:18:25,451
Man, this joint is gonna jump!

209
00:19:16,028 --> 00:19:17,387
BELL TINKLES

210
00:19:59,649 --> 00:20:02,288
GUITAR STRUMMING

211
00:20:08,245 --> 00:20:10,604
Somebody slipped
in the railroad yard.

212
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,124
You all can play that thing.

213
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,318
Yeah, been doing it nearby for ever.

214
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:26,676
What side of the tracks am I on?

215
00:20:26,711 --> 00:20:28,476
The wrong side.

216
00:20:28,511 --> 00:20:30,440
For you.

217
00:20:30,475 --> 00:20:33,518
What you doing here, then?

218
00:20:33,553 --> 00:20:36,357
Oh, white folks
look right through me.

219
00:20:36,392 --> 00:20:41,470
Besides, how much mischief is an old,
blind spook like me gonna get up to anyhow?

220
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:45,473
Lot of people go for music
around here?

221
00:20:45,508 --> 00:20:49,986
There's a couple of places just
outside of town, at the crossroads.

222
00:20:50,021 --> 00:20:52,704
A long walk? Are you in a hurry?

223
00:20:56,303 --> 00:21:00,941
How old is that box you're playing,
Second one ever made.

224
00:21:00,976 --> 00:21:04,779
The devil got the first one.
How about yours?

225
00:21:04,814 --> 00:21:07,703
Brand new. Made it myself.

226
00:21:07,738 --> 00:21:10,577
Ooh, brand new! Made it hisself!

227
00:21:10,612 --> 00:21:13,593
Hot dog! It's right.

228
00:21:13,628 --> 00:21:16,539
So, these clubs?

229
00:21:16,574 --> 00:21:19,313
Old Toussaint,
he runs the Ace of Spades.

230
00:21:19,348 --> 00:21:22,017
They don't have no live music
in there.

231
00:21:22,052 --> 00:21:25,210
Pine Top Purvis, he runs
the Honeydripper Lounge.

232
00:21:25,245 --> 00:21:27,694
He don't care nothing
about no guitar.

233
00:21:27,729 --> 00:21:31,127
He won't allow one under his roof.
That don't make sense.

234
00:21:31,162 --> 00:21:34,886
Well, when a musician
put his hand to murder,

235
00:21:34,921 --> 00:21:38,884
nine times out of ten
a drummer done it.

236
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:41,488
But Pine Top, he a piano man.

237
00:21:41,523 --> 00:21:44,841
He killed somebody?That's the story.

238
00:21:45,761 --> 00:21:49,759
But if you meet the man, you damn
well don't be asking him about it.

239
00:21:58,516 --> 00:22:00,594
HONKING

240
00:22:13,948 --> 00:22:15,987
Ain't seen no mule in a long time!

241
00:22:17,507 --> 00:22:21,425
I knew this was Alabama,
but that's the Stone Ages, man!

242
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,024
Where you from, boy?

243
00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:24,589
Memphis.

244
00:22:24,624 --> 00:22:26,948
Down on your vacation?

245
00:22:26,983 --> 00:22:29,422
Got in a piece of trouble up there
with the white folks.

246
00:22:29,457 --> 00:22:31,226
Need to bide my time for a spell.

247
00:22:31,261 --> 00:22:33,859
Biding your time
with them pills, man,

248
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,463
boss man gonna fire your ass.

249
00:22:35,498 --> 00:22:38,537
Don't worry about that.
I'm a cotton-picking fool!

250
00:22:40,256 --> 00:22:41,776
You a fool all right.

251
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:55,110
Where you from, brother bear?
Mississippi.

252
00:22:55,145 --> 00:22:58,214
Hoo! This here
is a real step-up for you!

253
00:22:58,249 --> 00:23:01,247
Folks around here have discovered
fire and whatnot!

254
00:23:04,526 --> 00:23:08,329
That trouble you in,

255
00:23:08,364 --> 00:23:10,887
have anything to do
with running your mouth?

256
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:15,240
It had to do with somebody getting on
my nerves and I had to deal with him.

257
00:23:15,275 --> 00:23:17,497
Must have been somebody kinda puny.

258
00:23:17,532 --> 00:23:19,719
As I recall, he was about your size.

259
00:23:41,589 --> 00:23:45,147
What's this place we at?
Nearest town's Harmony.

260
00:23:45,182 --> 00:23:47,306
This is Mr Silas Tugwell's place.

261
00:23:48,905 --> 00:23:51,444
You better get to picking. 
Cotton ain't going nowhere.

262
00:23:51,479 --> 00:23:53,983
The more you get first thing
when the dew's still on it,

263
00:23:54,018 --> 00:23:55,662
the more it weighs
when it tip that scale.

264
00:23:58,981 --> 00:24:00,460
You live here too?

265
00:24:03,259 --> 00:24:04,899
You got my sympathies.

266
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:17,098
Hot damn!

267
00:24:17,133 --> 00:24:19,536
What's the matter? I got a shock.

268
00:24:19,571 --> 00:24:21,331
I thought you used to work
for the power company.

269
00:24:21,366 --> 00:24:24,854
I drove the supply truck.

270
00:24:24,889 --> 00:24:28,808
Guitar Sam ain't gonna be playing
by no candlelight.

271
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:32,211
I smell bacon.

272
00:24:32,246 --> 00:24:36,564
You must have burned your porky ass
with that electricity!

273
00:24:38,324 --> 00:24:40,043
Breakfast's ready!

274
00:24:41,642 --> 00:24:44,206
Where your mama?She already 
over to the mayor's.

275
00:24:44,241 --> 00:24:48,319
She told me to make sure you eat
something before you start running 'round.

276
00:24:48,354 --> 00:24:50,963
That is a sweet woman you got.

277
00:24:50,998 --> 00:24:54,476
You got one waiting for you
if you want her. Who, Nadine?

278
00:24:54,511 --> 00:24:57,954
She come in here every night
making them cow eyes at you.

279
00:24:57,989 --> 00:25:00,233
She seem like a kind
who could smother a man.

280
00:25:00,268 --> 00:25:01,758
She makes all her own clothes.

281
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:03,792
Darlin', that's not
the kind of thing

282
00:25:03,827 --> 00:25:05,871
a man cares about from a woman.

283
00:25:05,906 --> 00:25:07,355
MUSIC BLARES

284
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:10,429
Hey, I fixed it!You ain't done 
no such thing.

285
00:25:10,464 --> 00:25:13,185
It just decided to come back on.
Decided? Yeah.

286
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,907
Just like it decided
to switch off last night.

287
00:25:15,942 --> 00:25:18,031
You ain't even in the conversation!

288
00:25:18,066 --> 00:25:21,784
This Nadine makes some good money,
too, sewing for people.

289
00:25:21,819 --> 00:25:23,429
That woman scares me.

290
00:25:23,464 --> 00:25:26,482
Last ol' boy to give her a tumble,

291
00:25:26,517 --> 00:25:29,465
Napier Carpenter,
she cooked for him.

292
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:33,258
Fixed him up all kinds
of nice, new clothes...

293
00:25:33,293 --> 00:25:34,943
I don't see no problem with that!

294
00:25:34,978 --> 00:25:37,217
Come four, five months,
a man starts to...

295
00:25:38,736 --> 00:25:41,615
Sorry, China Doll,
but this is just the way it is.

296
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:44,259
A man gots needs.

297
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:47,817
Looks like Nadine could
take care of those, too.

298
00:25:47,852 --> 00:25:51,131
You eat chicken every morning,
noon and night for five months,

299
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:54,250
you get a taste
for a different kind of meat.

300
00:25:55,449 --> 00:25:59,687
Maybe I shouldn't be talking
about this in front of China Doll.

301
00:25:59,722 --> 00:26:03,251
You ain't gonna say something
I haven't heard worse.

302
00:26:03,286 --> 00:26:09,522
Well, Napier goes out and has him
a pork chop or two, let's say.

303
00:26:12,081 --> 00:26:15,680
Comes back one night
from Toussaint's place,

304
00:26:15,715 --> 00:26:18,438
feeling no pain and smelling...

305
00:26:19,598 --> 00:26:22,802
.. Like pork chops,
the way a man will.

306
00:26:22,837 --> 00:26:27,040
He falls out on Nadine's couch
and commenced to snore.

307
00:26:27,075 --> 00:26:32,593
Wake up next morning, find she had taken
all his clothes off without him knowing.

308
00:26:32,628 --> 00:26:34,757
The man was dog drunk!

309
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:37,390
Miss Nadine come back
with a skillet in her hand,

310
00:26:37,425 --> 00:26:38,755
hot grits bubbling in it.

311
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:43,952
Says, "Baby, I got your breakfast".

312
00:26:43,987 --> 00:26:48,105
"Oh, not this morning, Nadine",
he says, sitting up.

313
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,984
"Don't think I could eat a thing."

314
00:26:51,504 --> 00:26:56,781
"Well then", she says, "we can't
let this go to waste, can we?"

315
00:26:56,816 --> 00:27:01,459
and she dumped
that whole hot bubbling mess

316
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:04,258
right in that man's lap.

317
00:27:04,293 --> 00:27:06,462
Ouch!

318
00:27:06,497 --> 00:27:13,614
Then she got busy
with that hot iron on his head.

319
00:27:13,649 --> 00:27:16,412
If screams didn't bring
the neighbours in,

320
00:27:16,447 --> 00:27:18,249
she'd have killed that man.

321
00:27:18,284 --> 00:27:20,016
You've got to admit it though,

322
00:27:20,051 --> 00:27:24,649
the woman is an artist when
it comes to that Singer machine.

323
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:26,168
Excuse me.

324
00:27:27,767 --> 00:27:31,006
Which one of you is Mr Pine Top?

325
00:27:37,163 --> 00:27:39,163
We ain't hiring.

326
00:27:40,442 --> 00:27:42,286
I can play anything.

327
00:27:42,321 --> 00:27:44,600
I already got me a professional.

328
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,798
Guitar Sam really comin'
all the way down here?

329
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:51,596
That so surprising?

330
00:27:51,631 --> 00:27:54,760
No, no.

331
00:27:54,795 --> 00:27:58,353
Mr Shack Thomas told me... 
You know Shack?

332
00:27:58,388 --> 00:28:01,837
We... travelled together.

333
00:28:01,872 --> 00:28:05,271
When was the last time
you ate solid food, young man?

334
00:28:07,749 --> 00:28:11,908
Take him back and fix him something,
China Doll.

335
00:28:11,943 --> 00:28:15,066
Standing there all hungry-eyed,

336
00:28:15,101 --> 00:28:17,722
puts me off my breakfast.

337
00:28:17,757 --> 00:28:20,344
That's real kind of you.

338
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:39,095
Must've come in
on the north-bound last night.

339
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:41,591
Looks like he got the cooties too.

340
00:28:41,626 --> 00:28:44,053
Straw in them box cars, full of 'em.

341
00:28:44,088 --> 00:28:46,017
Never cared to travel that way.

342
00:28:46,052 --> 00:28:49,571
I was out there riding them rails
between the wars.

343
00:28:49,606 --> 00:28:51,255
Hm...

344
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:54,508
Seen black half of the country
headin' west.

345
00:28:54,543 --> 00:28:57,692
Rode past the other half
coming back east.

346
00:28:57,727 --> 00:29:02,005
Yeah, every one of us,
scraping for the next meal.

347
00:29:03,524 --> 00:29:06,523
This is the place.
Y'all can tear things down.

348
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:09,487
Put things up.
It's got a lot of potential.

349
00:29:09,522 --> 00:29:14,439
It looks bigger than it does from the
outside. Can I help you, gentlemen?

350
00:29:14,474 --> 00:29:18,318
I'm just showing the man who
gonna run this place what he got.

351
00:29:22,556 --> 00:29:24,275
This is my place.

352
00:29:33,152 --> 00:29:35,156
You the piano player, right?

353
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:38,988
My name's Tyrone.
They call me Pine Top Purvis.

354
00:29:39,023 --> 00:29:41,747
Pine Top Purvis.

355
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:43,111
You owe 200

356
00:29:43,146 --> 00:29:46,345
to Lucky Hardaway up in Little Rock.

357
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,064
He gonna get his.

358
00:29:48,099 --> 00:29:50,548
Pine Top...

359
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:53,222
You missed last month's rent.

360
00:29:53,257 --> 00:29:54,866
After this weekend.

361
00:29:54,901 --> 00:30:00,139
After this weekend, you gonna be
the same raggedy arse piano player

362
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:02,423
who can't pay off his debts.

363
00:30:02,458 --> 00:30:06,617
Mr Simmons here,
he's gonna be the new proprietor.

364
00:30:06,652 --> 00:30:08,181
Lucky give me two weeks.

365
00:30:08,216 --> 00:30:11,493
Lucky got a better offer. 
He can't do that.

366
00:30:13,733 --> 00:30:15,852
You don't think so?

367
00:30:17,571 --> 00:30:21,334
Whoa, now!

368
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:24,248
What if we got our payments
for him Monday?

369
00:30:24,283 --> 00:30:27,047
Saturday night. We can do that.

370
00:30:28,566 --> 00:30:30,885
Not just no taste.

371
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,169
The whole 200.

372
00:30:33,204 --> 00:30:39,042
And I'll throw in a 25 cent tip
for his messenger boy.

373
00:30:39,077 --> 00:30:41,178
In the meantime,

374
00:30:41,213 --> 00:30:43,245
we're not open yet.

375
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,159
That means y'all trespassing.

376
00:30:50,116 --> 00:30:52,395
See enough, Mr Simmons?

377
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:54,594
I believe I have.

378
00:30:57,713 --> 00:31:01,112
Somebody could do something
with this place.

379
00:31:02,751 --> 00:31:04,710
Wouldn't take a whole lot of work.

380
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:13,551
We cleared over 200 that one
A couple of years back.

381
00:31:13,586 --> 00:31:16,825
And we didn't have no Luther on
the guitar with the playing meter.

382
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:20,069
They say it draws them like flies. 
That's what they say.

383
00:31:20,104 --> 00:31:23,701
They say first thing he does
is go to the man that owns a joint,

384
00:31:23,736 --> 00:31:26,540
sticks out his hand and
watch that cash money put in it.

385
00:31:26,575 --> 00:31:28,224
I already sent 50 to his manager.

386
00:31:28,259 --> 00:31:30,823
How much you paying him all out?
Another hundred.

387
00:31:30,858 --> 00:31:35,296
We need to clear 300! What I figure
is if we charge folks 2 to get in,

388
00:31:35,331 --> 00:31:36,661
then the liquor...

389
00:31:36,696 --> 00:31:39,654
What I'm saying is
'less he see that green up front,

390
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,534
the man won't get off the train!

391
00:31:41,569 --> 00:31:43,533
HORN HONKS

392
00:31:44,492 --> 00:31:46,132
What's that now?

393
00:31:52,689 --> 00:31:54,607
About time you fellas run by!

394
00:31:54,642 --> 00:31:56,526
We're just about dry here!

395
00:31:56,561 --> 00:31:58,183
Boss in?

396
00:31:58,218 --> 00:31:59,770
Tyrone?

397
00:31:59,805 --> 00:32:01,764
Whisky wagon come by.

398
00:32:05,403 --> 00:32:06,887
Y'all a day late!

399
00:32:06,922 --> 00:32:09,846
The old man Toussaint
gonna chew me out!

400
00:32:09,881 --> 00:32:13,639
Toussaint went over
to another supplier upstate.

401
00:32:13,674 --> 00:32:14,684
We just got you,

402
00:32:14,719 --> 00:32:18,637
then we're over to the army base
to service the officers' club.

403
00:32:18,672 --> 00:32:20,636
That's 56.

404
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,595
My credit no good anymore?

405
00:32:28,673 --> 00:32:30,557
Whoa, whoa. What's your hurry?

406
00:32:30,592 --> 00:32:33,590
Nobody in their right mind
sell liquor on credit,

407
00:32:33,625 --> 00:32:36,469
especially not to no
dark town road house.

408
00:32:36,504 --> 00:32:38,345
Listen, I got a special case, see.

409
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,152
We've got the harvest coming up.

410
00:32:40,187 --> 00:32:44,105
Soldiers at the base gonna be let
off on leave Saturday night.

411
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:48,024
Ain't enough hooch in this truck
to satisfy what we gonna sell!

412
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:52,262
You pay as you go, that's business.

413
00:32:52,297 --> 00:32:55,386
Look, you come back Monday,

414
00:32:55,421 --> 00:33:01,138
get paid and take back
every damn drop that I don't sell.

415
00:33:01,173 --> 00:33:05,736
OK, we got Guitar Sam
lined up here...

416
00:33:08,134 --> 00:33:13,772
What... What if I throw in 5
up front for you fellas?

417
00:33:13,807 --> 00:33:15,928
ENGINE STARTS

418
00:33:15,963 --> 00:33:17,966
Hey! Wait.

419
00:33:18,001 --> 00:33:19,969
Come on, man!

420
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:25,007
Everybody gives credit!

421
00:33:25,042 --> 00:33:26,806
It's the American way!

422
00:33:36,642 --> 00:33:40,840
Maybe we could buy some Bushead
from Willie Pettigrew.

423
00:33:40,875 --> 00:33:43,758
With that sheriff sniffing
'round me every night,

424
00:33:43,793 --> 00:33:45,997
lay my black ass in jail for good.

425
00:33:46,032 --> 00:33:47,722
Then what we gonna do?

426
00:33:47,757 --> 00:33:51,515
# Move it on over,
move it on over... #

427
00:33:57,273 --> 00:33:59,911
Got a load of liquor
for a Mr Lucien Toussaint.

428
00:33:59,946 --> 00:34:02,595
That would be me.

429
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:04,594
I trust he got my cheque all right.

430
00:34:04,629 --> 00:34:06,674
Don't suppose I'd be here
if they didn't.

431
00:34:06,709 --> 00:34:09,947
Pull round to the back,
we'll help you unload.

432
00:34:22,301 --> 00:34:26,179
This better be some Saturday night.

433
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:30,338
Arkansas. How about you?

434
00:34:31,297 --> 00:34:34,496
We come here just after mama
met my stepdaddy.

435
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:37,695
Not much going on
in a little town like this.

436
00:34:39,214 --> 00:34:43,132
They started up the training base
again. Is that right?

437
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:49,250
You been in the army?

438
00:34:49,285 --> 00:34:50,894
Uh-huh.

439
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:53,007
You shoot people?

440
00:34:53,042 --> 00:34:55,086
Fixed radios.

441
00:34:59,884 --> 00:35:02,563
They say this new war
gonna be a short one.

442
00:35:02,598 --> 00:35:06,202
Might be, might not.

443
00:35:07,641 --> 00:35:08,800
I was in Japan.

444
00:35:08,835 --> 00:35:11,124
Yeah?

445
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:13,439
What's the people like there?

446
00:35:13,474 --> 00:35:15,335
Small. Yeah?

447
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:16,883
About...

448
00:35:16,918 --> 00:35:18,361
that high.

449
00:35:18,396 --> 00:35:20,316
Speak Japanese.

450
00:35:25,673 --> 00:35:27,672
You been to California?

451
00:35:27,707 --> 00:35:29,756
Los Angeles.

452
00:35:29,791 --> 00:35:33,674
Where they make the movies?
You go to movies? I've been once.

453
00:35:33,709 --> 00:35:38,147
A fine looking girl like you ought
to have been all kinds of places.

454
00:35:38,182 --> 00:35:40,671
I'm going to 'em, I just...

455
00:35:40,706 --> 00:35:42,585
First I'm going to beauty school.

456
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,881
When mama saves up the money.

457
00:35:44,916 --> 00:35:47,143
Then I'll have a portable skill.

458
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:49,187
Like playing music?

459
00:35:49,222 --> 00:35:51,701
My stepdaddy says that ain't a skill.

460
00:35:51,736 --> 00:35:53,061
It's an affliction.

461
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,744
Come on, China Doll.

462
00:35:58,779 --> 00:36:01,738
Business in town.
You gonna help wi' it.

463
00:36:03,176 --> 00:36:07,174
And you young man, you wanna point
yourself west down that highway

464
00:36:07,209 --> 00:36:11,013
about three miles
to the people working in the field.

465
00:36:11,048 --> 00:36:13,337
It's harvest time.

466
00:36:13,372 --> 00:36:16,970
If you can stoop and pull,
they got a job for you.

467
00:36:17,005 --> 00:36:18,889
Wash up the dishes before you go.

468
00:36:27,126 --> 00:36:29,805
What I need is for you
to go get friendly with Luther,

469
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,929
then I just happen in.

470
00:36:30,964 --> 00:36:32,729
We can't just ask Mr Skinner?

471
00:36:32,764 --> 00:36:35,442
Mr Skinner don't want nothing
from coloured folk,

472
00:36:35,477 --> 00:36:37,721
but they buy his goods
and shine his shoes.

473
00:36:37,756 --> 00:36:40,080
You go on ahead now.

474
00:36:53,994 --> 00:36:56,433
GUITAR STRUMMING

475
00:37:00,831 --> 00:37:03,050
# It was early

476
00:37:03,085 --> 00:37:05,269
# Friday evening

477
00:37:06,468 --> 00:37:10,147
# And the hound began to bark

478
00:37:11,186 --> 00:37:14,424
# Staggolee and Billy Lyons

479
00:37:14,459 --> 00:37:17,663
# Squabbling in the dark

480
00:37:19,662 --> 00:37:22,980
# Staggolee told Billy Lyons

481
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:27,059
# "What do you think about that?

482
00:37:30,297 --> 00:37:33,141
# "First you take all my money

483
00:37:33,176 --> 00:37:37,015
# "Then you spits
in my Stetson hat"... #

484
00:37:39,973 --> 00:37:41,853
I hate that damn song.

485
00:37:43,852 --> 00:37:46,051
How you been keeping, Tyrone?

486
00:37:46,086 --> 00:37:48,015
Well, just...

487
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:49,813
trying to hold it together.

488
00:37:49,848 --> 00:37:53,287
You've got your beautiful young
daughter with you this morning.

489
00:37:53,322 --> 00:37:54,726
Don't you be studying her.

490
00:37:57,205 --> 00:38:00,884
I heard tell you gonna put
on a guitar man out at your place.

491
00:38:00,919 --> 00:38:02,680
Where you hear that?

492
00:38:02,715 --> 00:38:04,442
Oh... The breeze.

493
00:38:06,041 --> 00:38:09,440
Well, this time the breeze know
what it's blowing about.

494
00:38:10,959 --> 00:38:13,523
You'd better be careful, Tyrone.

495
00:38:13,558 --> 00:38:16,717
Cos you know what them
guitar players are like.

496
00:38:18,236 --> 00:38:19,756
You be careful yourself.

497
00:38:21,475 --> 00:38:24,752
# He shot him in the shoulder

498
00:38:26,432 --> 00:38:29,431
# Three times in the side

499
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,509
# That's the last time he shot him

500
00:38:34,868 --> 00:38:37,347
# Poor Billy up and died

501
00:38:37,382 --> 00:38:39,466
# Up and died. #

502
00:38:44,344 --> 00:38:45,909
The time is ripe

503
00:38:45,944 --> 00:38:48,507
and the bill is passed due.

504
00:38:48,542 --> 00:38:51,901
You know Mr Roosevelt would've
done it already, only he died.

505
00:38:51,936 --> 00:38:55,704
They don't listen to Miss Eleanor
no more but Mr Truman,

506
00:38:55,739 --> 00:38:59,417
he's starting a band, especially now
that we got this war heated up.

507
00:38:59,452 --> 00:39:01,261
Brother Randolph says...

508
00:39:01,296 --> 00:39:05,859
Here it comes! The gospel
according to Randolph

509
00:39:05,894 --> 00:39:10,212
Tyrone! How you doing?
Oh, got my nose above the waterline.

510
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:14,531
Here's my baby. What's up, Ty?
How your mama doing, China Doll?

511
00:39:14,566 --> 00:39:16,495
She doing fine, Uncle Shack.

512
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:19,493
I'm just telling the boys here
about how Brother Randolph

513
00:39:19,528 --> 00:39:22,887
pushing this deal how boys are gonna
be a full part of the service.

514
00:39:22,922 --> 00:39:24,291
I carried a rifle in the Great War.

515
00:39:24,326 --> 00:39:26,445
Boys get in the middle
of this Korea mess,

516
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,530
they ain't gonna thank you
for your efforts.

517
00:39:28,565 --> 00:39:32,123
If we want our full due in this
country, we've got to go ho ho!

518
00:39:32,158 --> 00:39:35,441
Black folk shooting yellow folk
to keep white folks happy?

519
00:39:35,476 --> 00:39:38,045
We need to move on
from that kind of thinking.

520
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:42,358
Move right on, Shack. Then come back
and tell the rest of us how it is.

521
00:39:42,393 --> 00:39:43,797
LAUGHTER

522
00:39:45,836 --> 00:39:48,275
That's a hard headed man.

523
00:39:49,795 --> 00:39:53,038
I'd have to ask Mr Skinner.
Of course you would.

524
00:39:53,073 --> 00:39:56,472
While you're at it, remind him how one
of the reasons coloured folks come here

525
00:39:56,507 --> 00:39:58,911
is to get the low-down
on what's happening.

526
00:39:58,946 --> 00:40:02,794
China doll! You gonna let us put

527
00:40:02,829 --> 00:40:05,433
I don't think that will be
any problem at all.

528
00:40:05,468 --> 00:40:09,026
That's awful nice of you, Luther. 
You're looking special today.

529
00:40:09,061 --> 00:40:11,110
That's sweet of you to say.

530
00:40:11,145 --> 00:40:13,269
Maceo, you go with the man here,

531
00:40:13,304 --> 00:40:15,748
he'll show you where
to put these up.

532
00:40:15,783 --> 00:40:18,862
Darling, we've got a lot
of more places to go.

533
00:40:18,897 --> 00:40:20,941
Nice to see you, Luther!

534
00:40:28,497 --> 00:40:31,296
You've got that boy
eating out of your hand!

535
00:40:31,331 --> 00:40:34,095
Luther is the only one
didn't pull my hair,

536
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:36,099
he sat behind me in Sunday school.

537
00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:40,332
I hope you got a little of that sugar 
left, cos we got to spare some on 
Miss Bertha Mae Spivey.

538
00:40:40,367 --> 00:40:43,388
You gonna ask her to come sing
I'm gonna ask her for money.

539
00:40:43,423 --> 00:40:46,409
Word is, she got a whole pile
of it squirrelled away.

540
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:50,447
Daddy... Hey, come on, girl,
I got to rest.

541
00:40:53,286 --> 00:40:56,890
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

542
00:40:56,925 --> 00:40:58,444
You catch your breath, OK.

543
00:40:58,479 --> 00:41:00,683
Yeah.

544
00:41:01,683 --> 00:41:05,046
So why Miss Spivey
gonna give you money,

545
00:41:05,081 --> 00:41:07,640
if you won't let her sing
at the club no more?

546
00:41:07,675 --> 00:41:10,199
I'm gonna make her partner. 
Partner in what?

547
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:11,683
The Honeydripper.

548
00:41:11,718 --> 00:41:16,036
But all you ever say, it's just
a hole you pour good money into.

549
00:41:16,071 --> 00:41:18,675
It don't matter.
I'm gonna make her proprietor.

550
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:21,953
Tress. Like waiter and waitress.

551
00:41:23,472 --> 00:41:25,317
Proprietress.

552
00:41:25,352 --> 00:41:27,551
She got to like the sound of that.

553
00:41:31,389 --> 00:41:34,353
Lovely ladies out to make a purchase.

554
00:41:34,388 --> 00:41:37,347
Is that the same Guitar Sam is
The very one.

555
00:41:37,382 --> 00:41:38,991
What does he look like?

556
00:41:39,026 --> 00:41:43,904
A fine looking man,
a real lady killer from what I hear.

557
00:41:43,939 --> 00:41:46,228
Got that New Orleans style to him.

558
00:41:46,263 --> 00:41:47,747
Well, you ought to have
a picture up there.

559
00:41:47,782 --> 00:41:50,261
We'll be getting some of those
when he come in on the train.

560
00:41:50,296 --> 00:41:54,538
Main thing is,
the man is electrifying

561
00:41:54,573 --> 00:41:56,417
and you know what that means.

562
00:41:56,452 --> 00:41:58,537
OK.

563
00:42:00,536 --> 00:42:04,899
Make like we just come by
to see how how she keeping.

564
00:42:04,934 --> 00:42:09,092
Then I'll kind of mention I'd been
thinking of bringing her on as a partner.

565
00:42:11,131 --> 00:42:12,651
Left the door open.

566
00:42:25,845 --> 00:42:26,885
She gone.

567
00:42:27,724 --> 00:42:32,361
Oh. When she going to be back?

568
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:35,560
She just gone.

569
00:42:40,718 --> 00:42:42,237
Woke up beside her.

570
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:01,709
Oh, damn.

571
00:43:01,744 --> 00:43:03,228
24 years.

572
00:43:04,747 --> 00:43:06,831
China doll, go find your mama.

573
00:43:06,866 --> 00:43:08,625
She'll know how to fix up the body.

574
00:43:14,103 --> 00:43:16,262
Laugh and all but...

575
00:43:17,741 --> 00:43:20,500
.. I've been with that woman
24 years.

576
00:43:22,379 --> 00:43:24,418
She gave me the only home
I ever had.

577
00:43:28,417 --> 00:43:29,856
What am I gonna do now?

578
00:43:54,645 --> 00:43:56,684
What's your hurry, boy?

579
00:43:58,323 --> 00:43:59,803
No hurry.

580
00:44:00,802 --> 00:44:02,681
Take your hat off.

581
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,739
Where you headed?

582
00:44:06,774 --> 00:44:08,364
I'm looking for work.

583
00:44:08,399 --> 00:44:10,318
You're not from around here?

584
00:44:10,353 --> 00:44:12,202
No, sir.

585
00:44:12,237 --> 00:44:15,175
Stranger wandering around, no job,

586
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:18,114
that would make you a vagrant.

587
00:44:18,149 --> 00:44:20,153
But I'm looking.

588
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:24,191
I got a job for you.
Get in the back.

589
00:44:46,622 --> 00:44:48,626
I can always use another hand.

590
00:44:48,661 --> 00:44:53,618
Well, I caught this young fella in
flagrant violation of the statutes -

591
00:44:53,653 --> 00:44:55,777
gawkery, with intent to mope.

592
00:44:57,296 --> 00:44:58,861
What's he going to run me?

593
00:44:58,896 --> 00:45:01,780
3 a day, plus you feed him lunch.

594
00:45:01,815 --> 00:45:05,413
The sentence, that all depends on how
long you're gonna need the help?

595
00:45:05,448 --> 00:45:07,257
I don't get any trial?

596
00:45:07,292 --> 00:45:11,251
Sure you do, boy, and a speedy
one at that. Meet the judge.

597
00:45:11,286 --> 00:45:13,187
Judge Gatlin.

598
00:45:13,222 --> 00:45:15,089
Grab a sack.

599
00:45:19,327 --> 00:45:22,486
Oh dear, I believe
it's about that time.

600
00:45:25,324 --> 00:45:27,443
Would you care to join me?
No, thank you.

601
00:45:30,002 --> 00:45:32,481
Of course you won't join me,
you don't partake.

602
00:45:32,516 --> 00:45:35,279
That was thoughtless of me.

603
00:45:35,314 --> 00:45:37,279
No, that's all right.

604
00:45:40,277 --> 00:45:46,435
So, you don't take spirits
and what else in your church?

605
00:45:47,874 --> 00:45:52,157
I'm sort of between churchesOh.

606
00:45:52,192 --> 00:45:57,430
I've been thinking about
changing over to the Holiness,

607
00:45:57,465 --> 00:45:59,549
but I haven't been sanctified yet.

608
00:45:59,584 --> 00:46:00,868
Oh.

609
00:46:05,186 --> 00:46:08,744
There's been a minister
in this week.

610
00:46:08,779 --> 00:46:11,303
The tent over by the fairgrounds?

611
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:17,421
The church I was raised in,
we were Pentecostals.

612
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:24,778
They wouldn't have anything but
the human voice inside the church.

613
00:46:24,813 --> 00:46:28,536
Dancing, any kind of dancing,

614
00:46:28,571 --> 00:46:30,393
music, card-playing.

615
00:46:30,428 --> 00:46:32,215
It was very strict.

616
00:46:35,133 --> 00:46:37,291
They took up serpents.

617
00:46:37,326 --> 00:46:38,896
I heard of that.

618
00:46:38,931 --> 00:46:43,489
I tell Floyd these stories,
and he's... He's horrified.

619
00:46:44,408 --> 00:46:47,732
They have always been Methodists,
Floyd's family.

620
00:46:47,767 --> 00:46:50,806
It can be a trial, married folks
differ in their religion.

621
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:53,485
And your husband is a...?

622
00:46:56,363 --> 00:46:57,968
Unaffiliated.

623
00:46:58,003 --> 00:47:00,522
Unaffiliated, I see.

624
00:47:02,881 --> 00:47:05,764
But he has his social club.

625
00:47:05,799 --> 00:47:09,358
The Honeydripper?That is such 
a colourful name.

626
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:10,876
Yes.

627
00:47:14,035 --> 00:47:18,793
He must have a great deal
of his energy to it.

628
00:47:18,828 --> 00:47:21,117
It's just him
and Maceo Green runs it,

629
00:47:21,152 --> 00:47:24,595
I go over and cook some
after I get off here.

630
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:29,988
Well, that's very supportive of you,
considering the sort of environment.

631
00:47:30,023 --> 00:47:33,667
I've been in those bar rooms
most of my life, Miss Amanda.

632
00:47:35,346 --> 00:47:37,625
I see.

633
00:47:44,342 --> 00:47:46,180
I was a singer.

634
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:51,018
I met Tyrone in the Paradise,
down in Treefork.

635
00:47:51,053 --> 00:47:52,978
China doll was only two.

636
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:57,221
And I was just...

637
00:47:57,256 --> 00:48:00,134
living alone, you know,

638
00:48:00,169 --> 00:48:03,013
drinking more than I ought,

639
00:48:03,048 --> 00:48:04,733
and then Tyrone...

640
00:48:06,252 --> 00:48:09,416
.. Like a light, come into my life.

641
00:48:09,451 --> 00:48:12,889
People think things
cos he owns the lounge,

642
00:48:12,924 --> 00:48:15,368
but they don't know him.

643
00:48:16,888 --> 00:48:19,766
Small minds are never
in short supply.

644
00:48:21,325 --> 00:48:23,604
People in this town...

645
00:48:29,481 --> 00:48:35,279
I suppose they expected that Floyd,
being from a prominent family,

646
00:48:35,314 --> 00:48:40,117
as prominent as is possible
here in Harmony,

647
00:48:40,152 --> 00:48:43,595
would have chosen somebody more...

648
00:48:48,833 --> 00:48:51,792
In school,
if you didn't have shoes...

649
00:48:58,028 --> 00:49:00,827
Oh, I forgot!

650
00:49:14,301 --> 00:49:17,720
I was going through some of Emily's
old things the other day.

651
00:49:17,755 --> 00:49:21,139
I thought this would look
just darling on your China Doll.

652
00:49:22,738 --> 00:49:25,697
Oh, I don't think that would
near fit her, Miss Amanda.

653
00:49:25,732 --> 00:49:28,495
Why, how old is she, now?

654
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:30,375
17.

655
00:49:31,373 --> 00:49:32,853
Oh, my...

656
00:49:35,212 --> 00:49:38,530
I must have lost track
somewhere along the line.

657
00:49:38,565 --> 00:49:40,174
17?

658
00:49:40,209 --> 00:49:42,888
It was a very nice thought.

659
00:49:44,448 --> 00:49:47,087
Mama, mama, they need you...

660
00:49:49,206 --> 00:49:50,210
Oh, I'm sorry.

661
00:49:50,245 --> 00:49:55,008
Miss Amanda, I didn't knowChina Doll!

662
00:49:55,043 --> 00:49:58,922
We were just recalling
how you used to play right here,

663
00:49:58,957 --> 00:50:00,281
under this table.

664
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:05,278
There's not any cash money
that I know of.

665
00:50:05,313 --> 00:50:08,242
She sold a good deal
of the furniture,

666
00:50:08,277 --> 00:50:11,955
but there's still a nice looking
couch in the parlour.

667
00:50:13,475 --> 00:50:17,118
Didn't care about too much,

668
00:50:17,153 --> 00:50:19,492
other than singing
at the Pine Top's place.

669
00:50:19,527 --> 00:50:21,758
You're welcome to look
around the house,

670
00:50:21,793 --> 00:50:23,955
if there's anything
your missus might like.

671
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:27,069
As long as it's not something
personal to me and Bertha Mae.

672
00:50:27,104 --> 00:50:30,267
It's just...

673
00:50:31,267 --> 00:50:32,906
She's got to go out in style.

674
00:51:18,525 --> 00:51:21,924
You ain't never done this job before?
Can't say I have.

675
00:51:23,443 --> 00:51:29,161
You want to set your pins out wide,
bend over at the hip.

676
00:51:29,196 --> 00:51:32,159
Don't be bobbing up and down
all the time.

677
00:51:32,194 --> 00:51:33,764
When you're up, be up.

678
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:36,718
When you're on the roll, stay down.

679
00:51:36,753 --> 00:51:39,841
But most important,

680
00:51:39,876 --> 00:51:42,200
you got to get a rhythm.

681
00:51:42,235 --> 00:51:47,193
Everything in life got a rhythm,
even pulling cotton off the plant.

682
00:51:47,228 --> 00:51:51,156
Lay it out for me. Not my rhythm, 
your rhythm.

683
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:54,969
That's between you and the day
and the work you got before you.

684
00:51:55,004 --> 00:51:58,747
Once you get it, don't let nothing
or nobody push you off it.

685
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:01,311
I'm going so slow.

686
00:52:01,346 --> 00:52:04,385
Are you getting paid
by the pound or by the hour?

687
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:07,121
I ain't getting paid at all,
none of us are.

688
00:52:07,156 --> 00:52:09,788
I suggest you work that
into your rhythm too.

689
00:52:09,823 --> 00:52:12,541
Let's see more picking and
less talking over there.

690
00:52:12,576 --> 00:52:14,141
Getting right to it, boss.

691
00:52:33,132 --> 00:52:35,011
Them boys frying over there.

692
00:52:35,046 --> 00:52:36,855
That's just Gatlin's gang.

693
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:40,694
He works them people from can
into cane, every damn day.

694
00:52:40,729 --> 00:52:43,407
When the fields get picked,
he bid 'em out to the neighbours.

695
00:52:43,442 --> 00:52:45,132
Harvest time come around here,

696
00:52:45,167 --> 00:52:48,525
you'd better sign with somebody
fast, or get out of sight.

697
00:52:50,684 --> 00:52:52,383
I ate a pick of dust today.

698
00:52:52,418 --> 00:52:54,048
Why don't you get some water?

699
00:52:54,083 --> 00:52:56,727
The only thing that wash out
the dust is whisky.

700
00:52:56,762 --> 00:53:01,040
Ain't enough whisky in this world to
wash out what I swallowed in my life.

701
00:53:01,075 --> 00:53:03,638
What are we playing for?
Two bits of ham.

702
00:53:03,673 --> 00:53:05,842
Woo! That's awful steep, ain't it?

703
00:53:05,877 --> 00:53:08,961
Well... I remember playing
this game one night,

704
00:53:08,996 --> 00:53:12,474
Memphis's boss Crumpstown folks
is gambling before they can walk,

705
00:53:12,509 --> 00:53:13,839
caught me a winning streak

706
00:53:13,874 --> 00:53:17,732
that cleaned out half
the sporting men on Beale Street.

707
00:53:17,767 --> 00:53:21,590
I got up from that table,
my money was long as train smoke.

708
00:53:21,625 --> 00:53:23,190
What happened to it?

709
00:53:25,149 --> 00:53:27,668
I spent it all on fine-looking women.

710
00:53:34,145 --> 00:53:37,903
Yo, Mississippi!
His name is Hamilton. Hambo!

711
00:53:40,102 --> 00:53:41,941
You want in on this?

712
00:53:41,976 --> 00:53:43,977
Settle up on pay day.

713
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:45,979
That your deck of cards?

714
00:53:46,979 --> 00:53:48,623
What if it is?

715
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:52,261
I'll stay clear of it then.

716
00:53:52,296 --> 00:53:56,415
Are you insinuating? I'm just saying,

717
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:10,608
Looks like dinner.

718
00:54:10,643 --> 00:54:12,452
A rabbit is a rodent.

719
00:54:12,487 --> 00:54:15,406
A man eat a rabbit,
might as well eat a rat.

720
00:54:15,441 --> 00:54:16,850
Simple country nigger,

721
00:54:16,885 --> 00:54:20,364
afraid to sit down and lose
a little handful of change.

722
00:54:20,399 --> 00:54:22,563
He awful big to mess with.

723
00:54:22,598 --> 00:54:24,527
Don't scare me none.

724
00:54:24,562 --> 00:54:28,320
I'm a stepping razor, man.
I'm trouble on two legs.

725
00:54:30,679 --> 00:54:33,878
Your draw, Junebug. Don't be
dripping no sweat on my cards.

726
00:54:33,913 --> 00:54:36,482
HONKING

727
00:54:36,517 --> 00:54:38,036
Excuse me folks!

728
00:54:41,115 --> 00:54:43,319
Look here!

729
00:54:43,354 --> 00:54:47,471
Y'all heard about the show
we puttin' on at the Honeydripper.

730
00:54:47,506 --> 00:54:49,667
Saturday night.

731
00:54:49,702 --> 00:54:51,829
We got Guitar Sam!

732
00:54:55,708 --> 00:54:58,792
I expect there'll be a nice turnout
for Bertha Mae tomorrow.

733
00:54:58,827 --> 00:55:03,065
Yes, folks who wouldn't have nothing
to do with her when she was alive.

734
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:04,869
Some of them, maybe.

735
00:55:04,904 --> 00:55:06,623
Still got to pay your respects.

736
00:55:08,462 --> 00:55:12,141
That Slick is gonna have
to find him a new ride.

737
00:55:12,176 --> 00:55:13,705
That's a terrible thing to say.

738
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:15,664
That's how the man gets over,
is all.

739
00:55:15,699 --> 00:55:20,777
Always sugaring up to some woman
who's got a job or a bankroll.

740
00:55:20,812 --> 00:55:22,217
That's no way to live.

741
00:55:23,735 --> 00:55:25,374
Society is in whirl, baby.

742
00:55:26,374 --> 00:55:30,092
A man's gotta walk through the gates
of hell to get a piece of cheese.

743
00:55:32,691 --> 00:55:34,491
Not so young any more...

744
00:55:36,010 --> 00:55:38,614
.. Lose hold of what little he's got.

745
00:55:38,649 --> 00:55:41,328
If you lose the club,
I'm sure you'll find something else.

746
00:55:41,363 --> 00:55:44,771
In this town, like what?

747
00:55:44,806 --> 00:55:49,044
You know, any time you want,
I could get Miss Amanda to ask...

748
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:50,881
Watch your feet, Mr Mayor!

749
00:55:50,916 --> 00:55:52,648
I just done mopped the floor.

750
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:56,740
Ty, you work so hard at the lodge,
but what you bring in is...

751
00:55:56,775 --> 00:56:00,798
Not even as much as you make
polishing that white lady's silver.

752
00:56:09,915 --> 00:56:11,654
I didn't say that.

753
00:56:11,689 --> 00:56:13,393
You didn't have to.

754
00:56:15,552 --> 00:56:17,711
It'll just have to work out, then.

755
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:23,629
Meeting gonna start
and I'm not there.

756
00:56:27,627 --> 00:56:29,986
Your soul's not the one
needs saving, baby.

757
00:56:44,939 --> 00:56:47,543
It's all gonna be fine, Daddy.

758
00:56:47,578 --> 00:56:50,936
Everybody in town talking about
Guitar Sam coming to Harmony.

759
00:56:53,215 --> 00:56:59,453
# As I walked
all along this highway

760
00:57:01,052 --> 00:57:04,570
# I was seeking

761
00:57:04,605 --> 00:57:07,326
# My Lord each day

762
00:57:07,361 --> 00:57:11,243
# She left me standing

763
00:57:11,278 --> 00:57:15,090
# Out on this highway

764
00:57:15,125 --> 00:57:23,762
# Oh, just wondering
which way I must go

765
00:57:23,797 --> 00:57:27,038
# She left me standing

766
00:57:27,073 --> 00:57:30,244
# Out on this highway

767
00:57:30,279 --> 00:57:41,354
# Oh, just wondering
which way I must go. #

768
00:57:42,354 --> 00:57:46,052
Amen! Amen! Sing on, choir!

769
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:49,750
Amen! Let the church say Amen.

770
00:57:49,785 --> 00:57:51,794
Amen!

771
00:57:51,829 --> 00:57:54,628
Let the church say Amen! Amen!

772
00:57:55,307 --> 00:57:56,427
Amen!

773
00:57:58,706 --> 00:57:59,985
Amen!

774
00:58:01,465 --> 00:58:05,183
She left him standing
out on the highway,

775
00:58:05,218 --> 00:58:07,982
wondering which way to go.

776
00:58:08,017 --> 00:58:09,386
Yeah.

777
00:58:09,421 --> 00:58:13,585
The highway of life.

778
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:18,117
Sisters and brothers, it will twist
you and it will turn ya.

779
00:58:18,152 --> 00:58:22,615
It will run you this-a-way,
and it will run you that-a-way.

780
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:23,619
Yeah.

781
00:58:23,654 --> 00:58:26,573
Tempt you with many a detour.

782
00:58:26,608 --> 00:58:27,578
Yeah.

783
00:58:27,613 --> 00:58:33,650
Because the highway of life
is designed to lead us astray.

784
00:58:33,685 --> 00:58:35,255
Yeah.

785
00:58:35,290 --> 00:58:39,608
That's not the road that we want
to be on, brothers and sisters.

786
00:58:39,643 --> 00:58:43,086
That's not the path
that we need to follow.

787
00:58:43,121 --> 00:58:46,890
We need to be on that other road.

788
00:58:46,925 --> 00:58:52,927
We need to be on that road
that leads to glory.

789
00:58:52,962 --> 00:58:56,759
We need to be on that road
that leads to the right hand of God.

790
00:58:56,794 --> 00:58:58,959
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

791
00:59:00,158 --> 00:59:04,216
# That thoroughfare
I'm talking about

792
00:59:04,251 --> 00:59:08,275
# That righteous road
we need to travel

793
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:12,470
# It's called the highway to heaven

794
00:59:12,505 --> 00:59:16,596
# It is called
the highway to heaven

795
00:59:16,631 --> 00:59:19,510
# But we need to know,
sisters and brothers

796
00:59:19,545 --> 00:59:22,389
# We need to know
Who is walking beside ya.

797
00:59:22,424 --> 00:59:25,465
# You got to be wary of who
is tryin'

798
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:28,471
# To hold you back
from your journey

799
00:59:28,506 --> 00:59:33,268
# Cos many a loved ones
got to be left behind

800
00:59:33,303 --> 00:59:37,586
# Cos even on the road,
you're lost in the wilderness

801
00:59:37,621 --> 00:59:43,419
# You're either headin' for glory
or you're doomed for damnation

802
00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:46,977
# You're either with the Lord
or you're with the devil.

803
00:59:47,012 --> 00:59:48,822
# And there ain't no in-between.

804
00:59:48,857 --> 00:59:52,695
# No, no,
there ain't no in-between. #

805
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:55,414
Praise the Lord!

806
00:59:55,449 --> 00:59:57,733
APPLAUSE

807
01:00:06,088 --> 01:00:07,608
Charleston. Yeah.

808
01:00:11,046 --> 01:00:13,970
Tulsa. Tulsa ain't so bad.

809
01:00:14,005 --> 01:00:17,963
But for the spit.
Got them stockyards near the jail.

810
01:00:17,998 --> 01:00:19,528
Them flies.

811
01:00:19,563 --> 01:00:22,521
Course, I had me in a cell
in Georgia once.

812
01:00:22,556 --> 01:00:25,480
Six other men,
didn't have a one doing tall.

813
01:00:25,515 --> 01:00:28,404
Must've got caught hoppin'Yeah.

814
01:00:28,439 --> 01:00:31,163
Ain't no free ride
allowed through Georgia.

815
01:00:31,198 --> 01:00:34,157
And the food there? Paltry. 
Paltry ain't the word for it.

816
01:00:34,192 --> 01:00:37,115
Breakfast is a joke.
And lunch is a rumour...

817
01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:39,531
And dinner was a anecdote!

818
01:00:39,566 --> 01:00:41,877
< Do it the hard way, brother!

819
01:00:41,912 --> 01:00:44,631
You got locked in that box.
Or one just like it.

820
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:49,489
# Wake up in the morning

821
01:00:49,524 --> 01:00:52,268
# Hear the bing bong ring

822
01:00:53,427 --> 01:00:55,946
# Walk up to the table

823
01:00:55,981 --> 01:00:58,822
# See the same damn thing

824
01:00:58,857 --> 01:01:01,800
# What am I gonna tell you

825
01:01:01,835 --> 01:01:04,788
# Fork, a knife, and a pan

826
01:01:04,823 --> 01:01:07,781
# If you say a thing about it

827
01:01:07,816 --> 01:01:10,917
# You in trouble with the man.

828
01:01:10,952 --> 01:01:13,944
# Let the Midnight Special

829
01:01:13,979 --> 01:01:16,902
# Shine its light on me

830
01:01:16,937 --> 01:01:19,780
# Well, let the Midnight Special

831
01:01:19,815 --> 01:01:23,334
# Shine its ever-loving light
on me. #

832
01:01:23,369 --> 01:01:24,613
You a singer, young man?

833
01:01:24,648 --> 01:01:26,450
Yeah, I'm a singer.

834
01:01:26,485 --> 01:01:28,217
I'm a guitar player.

835
01:01:28,252 --> 01:01:32,130
I'm gonna be on the radio someday,
people are gonna know my name.

836
01:01:32,165 --> 01:01:35,094
You keep on thinking
that way, young man.

837
01:01:35,129 --> 01:01:38,847
If Judge Gatlin don't choose
to work you into your grave,

838
01:01:38,882 --> 01:01:40,287
you just might do it.

839
01:01:50,521 --> 01:01:53,965
# If you ever go to Houston

840
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,319
# Don't you stagger
Don't you fight

841
01:01:57,758 --> 01:02:00,657
# Cos the sheriff will arrest you

842
01:02:00,692 --> 01:02:03,556
# You're in the cooler
for the night

843
01:02:03,591 --> 01:02:06,835
# He'll tie your hands together

844
01:02:06,870 --> 01:02:10,031
# And he'll bring you down

845
01:02:10,066 --> 01:02:13,192
# Throw you in the black river

846
01:02:13,227 --> 01:02:15,671
# Penitentiary bound. #

847
01:03:07,567 --> 01:03:09,886
# Early this morning

848
01:03:11,405 --> 01:03:14,844
# I heard the lonesome
church bell toll

849
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:25,524
# Early this morning

850
01:03:25,559 --> 01:03:29,838
# I heard the low down
church bell toll

851
01:03:37,753 --> 01:03:40,392
# It brought me the sad news

852
01:03:41,352 --> 01:03:44,710
# My Bertha Mae was dead and gone

853
01:03:52,667 --> 01:03:55,906
# Never miss my baby

854
01:03:56,945 --> 01:04:00,304
# I never missed her
till she left my door... #

855
01:04:01,903 --> 01:04:05,662
First, he passed away,
and the seed was no more...

856
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:11,878
# I never missed my baby

857
01:04:11,913 --> 01:04:15,337
# Until she left my door

858
01:04:23,413 --> 01:04:25,372
# It breaks my heart

859
01:04:26,932 --> 01:04:31,055
# Think I never see her face
no more. #

860
01:04:31,090 --> 01:04:35,608
He will dwell within, he will
wipe every tear from their eyes.

861
01:04:36,688 --> 01:04:42,645
Death shall be no more, mourning
and dying and pain shall be no more.

862
01:04:43,725 --> 01:04:47,642
To the first things
that passed away,

863
01:04:47,677 --> 01:04:50,158
I am the Alpha and the Omega,

864
01:04:50,193 --> 01:04:52,640
the beginning and the end...

865
01:05:39,059 --> 01:05:41,898
I hear tell Miss Bertha Mae passed.

866
01:05:44,257 --> 01:05:46,141
That's right.

867
01:05:46,176 --> 01:05:48,315
Yeah, she lived it.

868
01:05:48,350 --> 01:05:50,455
Just like she sang it.

869
01:05:56,971 --> 01:05:58,970
You waiting on somebody?

870
01:06:03,768 --> 01:06:07,966
Ain't nobody on that train
gonna change your luck, Tyrone.

871
01:06:08,001 --> 01:06:11,125
You're gonna have to save
your own self.

872
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:13,044
What do you know about anything?

873
01:06:13,079 --> 01:06:15,240
Oh, nothing much.

874
01:06:15,275 --> 01:06:17,598
But I know you.

875
01:06:17,633 --> 01:06:19,896
From way back.

876
01:06:19,931 --> 01:06:22,160
GUITAR STRUMS

877
01:06:27,638 --> 01:06:29,997
# Mm...

878
01:06:42,391 --> 01:06:44,330
# Oh...

879
01:06:44,365 --> 01:06:46,269
# Oh

880
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:08,539
TRAIN HORN BLOWS

881
01:07:11,977 --> 01:07:15,376
TRAIN HORN CONTINUES

882
01:07:30,529 --> 01:07:33,493
Mournful end for a wayward sinner.

883
01:07:33,528 --> 01:07:37,167
She always seemed
at peace with herself.

884
01:07:37,202 --> 01:07:38,903
The company she kept?

885
01:07:38,938 --> 01:07:40,604
The life she lived?

886
01:07:42,643 --> 01:07:45,802
I never know Bertha Mae
to do hurt to a living soul.

887
01:07:48,281 --> 01:07:50,260
We're all hoping to see you get over

888
01:07:50,295 --> 01:07:52,239
and accept the Lord tonight,
Delilah.

889
01:07:53,479 --> 01:07:56,003
I'm hoping so too.

890
01:07:56,038 --> 01:07:59,316
You've been lingering at
the threshold long enough, sister.

891
01:07:59,351 --> 01:08:01,036
Time to step ahead.

892
01:08:39,698 --> 01:08:42,577
Tyrone! You got somebody
getting off here?

893
01:08:42,612 --> 01:08:45,413
Supposed to be. Well, 
what's the party's name?

894
01:08:45,448 --> 01:08:48,215
Sam? Guitar Sam.
Don't know his birth name.

895
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:50,334
He's coming here? Uh-huh.

896
01:08:52,332 --> 01:08:54,936
Yo, Matt!
Guitar Sam get on this train?

897
01:08:54,971 --> 01:08:57,970
Nah, man, he's in the hospital
back in Little Rock.

898
01:08:58,005 --> 01:08:59,974
Hospital? You know music folks.

899
01:09:00,009 --> 01:09:03,927
Whatever he was doing, he must
have been doing too much of it.

900
01:09:03,962 --> 01:09:07,086
Brother, maybe... Maybe he
come on in tomorrow, huh?

901
01:09:09,245 --> 01:09:10,964
Matt!

902
01:09:14,603 --> 01:09:16,362
All aboard!

903
01:09:29,595 --> 01:09:31,715
Somebody didn't show up!

904
01:09:36,872 --> 01:09:40,031
We should have made you dumb
instead of blind.

905
01:10:01,821 --> 01:10:04,100
# I done had my fun

906
01:10:06,739 --> 01:10:09,258
# If I don't get well no more

907
01:10:15,775 --> 01:10:18,574
# I said, I done had my fun

908
01:10:21,812 --> 01:10:24,491
# If I don't get well no more

909
01:10:31,129 --> 01:10:33,168
# My head is spinning

910
01:10:35,927 --> 01:10:39,124
# And I's going down real slow. #

911
01:10:53,038 --> 01:10:55,677
A man don't take care of himself...

912
01:10:57,756 --> 01:11:01,435
.. With drinking and jazz and women
every night.

913
01:11:02,314 --> 01:11:04,114
Don't make no difference now.

914
01:11:06,033 --> 01:11:08,557
It got so bad,

915
01:11:08,592 --> 01:11:13,789
I heard there was this old boy goes
round pretending to be Guitar Sam.

916
01:11:13,824 --> 01:11:15,788
Fill out the gigs he misses.

917
01:11:17,307 --> 01:11:21,026
He does pretty well for himself,
what I hearing.

918
01:11:21,061 --> 01:11:22,425
Somebody we could find?

919
01:11:24,344 --> 01:11:27,623
Hell, I don't know,
just some story I heard.

920
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:37,219
Must have been the first one.

921
01:11:37,254 --> 01:11:39,463
First what?

922
01:11:39,498 --> 01:11:43,936
Back in slavery days, them's the
one that work in the big house.

923
01:11:43,971 --> 01:11:46,899
Might not have had shoes always,

924
01:11:46,934 --> 01:11:50,372
the pants didn't have no holes in
them, they didn't pick no cotton.

925
01:11:50,407 --> 01:11:54,508
House niggers. Yeah, that's 
how they call them.

926
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:58,609
They had all their
African kinds of instruments.

927
01:11:58,644 --> 01:12:03,287
Drums, shakers,
some kind of banjo thing.

928
01:12:03,322 --> 01:12:04,691
But the piano...

929
01:12:04,726 --> 01:12:08,525
They didn't bring no piano
over on those ships from Africa.

930
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:11,009
The piano was just sitting there,

931
01:12:11,044 --> 01:12:13,922
in the white folks' big room,
all polished up.

932
01:12:15,482 --> 01:12:18,161
I'd figure this...

933
01:12:18,196 --> 01:12:20,005
first one...

934
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:24,197
He must have passed by
15, 20 times a day.

935
01:12:24,232 --> 01:12:26,441
Run the corner of his eyes over it.

936
01:12:26,476 --> 01:12:28,835
You see,
he was there when they'd play.

937
01:12:28,870 --> 01:12:30,971
The masters.

938
01:12:31,006 --> 01:12:34,298
Their minuets.

939
01:12:34,333 --> 01:12:37,591
PLAYS A MINUET

940
01:12:44,668 --> 01:12:49,546
Him standing there,
with a tray of white people's food.

941
01:12:49,581 --> 01:12:52,905
Pretending not to have
a thought in his head.

942
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:55,389
But he...

943
01:12:55,424 --> 01:12:57,467
He's watching them fingers.

944
01:12:57,502 --> 01:13:00,321
He's watching where them keys were.

945
01:13:00,356 --> 01:13:03,105
See, this old boy, the first one,

946
01:13:03,140 --> 01:13:07,258
he knows how to play all
them kinds of African instruments.

947
01:13:07,293 --> 01:13:10,736
He could play mud if you
gave him a key and a tempo.

948
01:13:10,771 --> 01:13:13,972
Yeah, he got music in his head
and his heart.

949
01:13:14,007 --> 01:13:17,174
In every damn piece of him
there's music.

950
01:13:17,209 --> 01:13:18,973
Then one day...

951
01:13:20,492 --> 01:13:22,536
.. The master's away.

952
01:13:22,571 --> 01:13:26,130
And he alone in that room,

953
01:13:26,165 --> 01:13:27,827
with that piano.

954
01:13:27,862 --> 01:13:29,375
Watch out now.

955
01:13:29,410 --> 01:13:30,853
And he goes over

956
01:13:30,888 --> 01:13:33,566
and he sits down on the bench.

957
01:13:36,844 --> 01:13:42,887
And he spreads his fingers over it,

958
01:13:42,922 --> 01:13:45,601
the way he's seen
that minuet player do.

959
01:13:45,636 --> 01:13:47,120
And he thinks...

960
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:51,119
PLAYS CHORD

961
01:13:54,877 --> 01:13:56,037
And he thinks...

962
01:13:58,995 --> 01:14:00,755
.. "Lord help me."

963
01:14:02,314 --> 01:14:05,752
"I could do some damage
with this thing."

964
01:14:05,787 --> 01:14:09,190
I would have liked
to have been there.

965
01:14:11,949 --> 01:14:14,308
I mean...

966
01:14:15,587 --> 01:14:18,346
Just to hear the cat play.

967
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:34,619
Mace...

968
01:14:37,738 --> 01:14:39,942
I'm gonna lose my club.

969
01:14:39,977 --> 01:14:45,454
If old man Toussaint find out
you stole his liquor,

970
01:14:45,489 --> 01:14:48,293
you're likely to lose
more than that.

971
01:14:48,328 --> 01:14:50,457
I got no more cards to play.

972
01:14:50,492 --> 01:14:54,210
If you was to go down
to see Lucky Hardaway in person...

973
01:14:54,245 --> 01:14:57,929
I ain't kissing up to no cokey-nose,
coke-headed asshole!

974
01:15:05,845 --> 01:15:08,604
What the hell that supposed to be?

975
01:15:17,919 --> 01:15:20,363
Some kind of guitar.

976
01:15:20,398 --> 01:15:23,916
A guitar got a hole in it.
That's how the sound come out.

977
01:15:23,951 --> 01:15:27,252
That boy must be three bricks shy
of a load upstairs.

978
01:15:27,287 --> 01:15:30,519
Daddy! They've gone and
arrested him! Arrest who?

979
01:15:30,554 --> 01:15:33,313
Sonny! The High Sheriff arrested him
and sold him to Judge Gatlin!

980
01:15:33,348 --> 01:15:36,116
Sonny who?! Sonny that was
here yesterday morning!

981
01:15:36,151 --> 01:15:39,270
Sonny that got a screw loose?
That's why they arrested him!

982
01:15:39,305 --> 01:15:43,149
Mace? Play something on that,
make some noise there.

983
01:15:43,184 --> 01:15:45,028
GUITAR STRUMS

984
01:15:46,147 --> 01:15:48,391
It's electric.

985
01:15:48,426 --> 01:15:51,265
I could plug a chunk of stovewood
in a wall and it'd get more music

986
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:54,508
than you'd get out of that mess!
Nah, man.

987
01:15:54,543 --> 01:15:58,266
No, man, it don't work
unless it's hooked up to the juice!

988
01:15:58,301 --> 01:16:04,198
See, you got the juice, you don't
need the hollow inside that box.

989
01:16:04,233 --> 01:16:10,096
The music just runs straight from
the strings, through the wire...

990
01:16:11,895 --> 01:16:16,853
.. And out of your amplifier...

991
01:16:20,892 --> 01:16:23,470
.. Which is what this thing must be.

992
01:16:23,505 --> 01:16:26,014
Sonny said he fixed radios
in the army.

993
01:16:26,049 --> 01:16:29,807
Sonny didn't do nothing
but feed bed bugs in anybody's army.

994
01:16:29,842 --> 01:16:31,811
And some of them caught in his head.

995
01:16:31,846 --> 01:16:34,944
I'm surprised he's even got
the wit to pick cotton.

996
01:16:34,979 --> 01:16:38,043
Judge Gatlin done bought himself
a drooling idiot.

997
01:16:38,078 --> 01:16:41,167
What you gonna amplifyDaddy?

998
01:16:41,202 --> 01:16:43,441
Unless you're gonna sit
over in your chair

999
01:16:43,476 --> 01:16:47,125
and play those littleAside, man.

1000
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:50,198
Sitting over there,
looking all clean and polite.

1001
01:16:50,233 --> 01:16:52,043
The guitar ain't been up front,

1002
01:16:52,078 --> 01:16:54,322
since those old pissing
moan blue shouters

1003
01:16:54,357 --> 01:16:57,275
sit their blind asses on the corner
hollering for pennies!

1004
01:16:57,310 --> 01:16:58,840
Old-time music. Daddy?

1005
01:16:58,875 --> 01:17:01,753
Sonny didn't do nothing
to get arrested for.

1006
01:17:01,788 --> 01:17:03,757
He was just looking for work.

1007
01:17:03,792 --> 01:17:07,755
They've hung coloured boys
for less than that, darling.

1008
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:11,828
Least on the work gang they feed
them, keep their strength up.

1009
01:17:11,863 --> 01:17:14,192
But he doesn't belong there.

1010
01:17:14,227 --> 01:17:18,550
You know, Guitar Sam plays him
an electric.

1011
01:17:18,585 --> 01:17:22,303
But I don't think it's
this no-hole kind of deal.

1012
01:17:22,338 --> 01:17:26,022
Hope he plugs it into
the wrong socket some night

1013
01:17:26,057 --> 01:17:28,781
and electrocutes
his sorry, no-show ass.

1014
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:32,380
Mace?

1015
01:17:33,699 --> 01:17:41,255
Now, if he showed up here
and our power went out again,

1016
01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:42,819
while he was playing...

1017
01:17:42,854 --> 01:17:44,973
Nah, I fixed it good this time, Ty.

1018
01:17:45,008 --> 01:17:46,298
Eh...

1019
01:17:46,333 --> 01:17:49,771
So he comes out, and he plugs
his axe into the wall...

1020
01:17:49,806 --> 01:17:52,730
He'd come out looking good,
from what I hear!

1021
01:17:52,765 --> 01:17:55,906
All kinds of spangly pants
and jacket!

1022
01:17:55,941 --> 01:17:59,047
Got his name spelt out on the back!

1023
01:18:00,047 --> 01:18:02,886
The clothes, right?!
All slick and shiny!

1024
01:18:02,921 --> 01:18:04,965
Flash them gold teeth at them gals!

1025
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,169
Got his sax man behind him.

1026
01:18:07,204 --> 01:18:10,168
Maybe a piano, harmonica and drums.

1027
01:18:10,203 --> 01:18:12,802
Hey, you remember that night
at the Esquire Club,

1028
01:18:12,837 --> 01:18:14,898
when the lights went out in Mobile?

1029
01:18:14,933 --> 01:18:16,924
Yeah, and they took off
with the gate.

1030
01:18:16,959 --> 01:18:19,358
Just stole the damn register
right off the counter!

1031
01:18:19,393 --> 01:18:21,757
They didn't hold Reggie Porter
for it, did they?!

1032
01:18:21,792 --> 01:18:24,716
Nah! They knew it was
this place got robbed!

1033
01:18:24,751 --> 01:18:27,639
Did nobody hold it to Reggie Porter?

1034
01:18:27,674 --> 01:18:30,633
And nobody expected
their money to come back.

1035
01:18:30,668 --> 01:18:33,592
No, cos they was too busy
diving for the pot

1036
01:18:33,627 --> 01:18:35,476
and that trump game got interrupted.

1037
01:18:35,511 --> 01:18:40,069
And nobody suspected that it might
have been Reggie Porter hisself!

1038
01:18:40,104 --> 01:18:43,228
Hisself that pulled the lights!

1039
01:18:45,627 --> 01:18:46,951
No.

1040
01:18:46,986 --> 01:18:48,185
No, Ty. No.

1041
01:18:48,220 --> 01:18:49,349
No. No. No.

1042
01:18:49,384 --> 01:18:53,542
China Doll! You mind the place till
we get back. Hey, come on, Mace.

1043
01:18:53,577 --> 01:18:55,667
Where you going, Daddy?!

1044
01:18:55,702 --> 01:18:59,380
I promised the people Guitar Sam,
and they're going to get Guitar Sam!

1045
01:18:59,415 --> 01:19:01,299
Come on, Mace,
let's get out of here!

1046
01:19:01,334 --> 01:19:02,859
We've got work to do.

1047
01:19:08,456 --> 01:19:11,455
Why are you so interested
in this boy?

1048
01:19:11,490 --> 01:19:12,974
Got a job for him.

1049
01:19:14,574 --> 01:19:18,012
You must be doing pretty well
for yourself out there, Tyrone.

1050
01:19:18,047 --> 01:19:20,011
You're hiring new people on.

1051
01:19:20,046 --> 01:19:22,855
Passing well, yeah.

1052
01:19:22,890 --> 01:19:25,808
But this boy... Name is Sonny.

1053
01:19:25,843 --> 01:19:27,812
Uh-huh.

1054
01:19:27,847 --> 01:19:31,046
Well, he's paying off his debt
to society right now.

1055
01:19:31,081 --> 01:19:33,570
If I was to pull him
out of the field...

1056
01:19:33,605 --> 01:19:37,003
Judge Gatlin paid for your day
of prison labour.

1057
01:19:38,043 --> 01:19:41,401
You willing to pay for him
for the duration of his sentence?

1058
01:19:41,436 --> 01:19:44,080
Which might be?As long as 
I care to make it.

1059
01:19:46,759 --> 01:19:49,618
Well, I was counting on...

1060
01:19:49,653 --> 01:19:53,004
more of a one-time deal.

1061
01:19:53,039 --> 01:19:56,355
If I can rent him out50.

1062
01:19:58,314 --> 01:19:59,878
It's not just the money.

1063
01:19:59,913 --> 01:20:04,191
There's legalistic principles
involved here. Public safety issues.

1064
01:20:04,226 --> 01:20:06,755
I'll pay you Sunday morning.

1065
01:20:06,790 --> 01:20:10,148
You going to pay me now,
or you can forget about it.

1066
01:20:11,388 --> 01:20:12,947
I don't have it now.

1067
01:20:12,982 --> 01:20:14,386
Hm.

1068
01:20:15,746 --> 01:20:20,304
You think you're too smart for
the rest of us, don't you, Tyrone?

1069
01:20:20,339 --> 01:20:22,863
Think you can go it all by yourself.

1070
01:20:25,222 --> 01:20:27,066
You'd rather eat roofing nails

1071
01:20:27,101 --> 01:20:30,020
than come to me for a favour now,
wouldn't you?

1072
01:20:30,055 --> 01:20:32,339
It's not a favour
if I'm gonna pay for it.

1073
01:20:32,374 --> 01:20:34,417
Oh, you're gonna pay all right.

1074
01:20:35,936 --> 01:20:39,255
If you don't hand over that money
to me by Sunday morning,

1075
01:20:39,290 --> 01:20:41,374
you've got yourself a new partner.

1076
01:20:46,812 --> 01:20:48,611
Same deal as I got with Toussaint.

1077
01:20:48,646 --> 01:20:50,090
What'll that be?

1078
01:20:53,929 --> 01:20:55,568
You'll get the 50.

1079
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:59,167
And that wife of yours.

1080
01:21:00,126 --> 01:21:02,285
Delilah? Mm-hm.

1081
01:21:03,285 --> 01:21:05,769
Them fried chicken sandwiches.

1082
01:21:05,804 --> 01:21:10,641
If I was to come by now and then
and check in on my interests?

1083
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:15,444
She be happy to fix you
whatever you want.

1084
01:21:15,479 --> 01:21:19,837
Good. Cos my wife's cooking
would gag a maggot.

1085
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:24,320
Different people got different kinds
Yeah.

1086
01:21:24,355 --> 01:21:26,994
Well Lurleen ain't discovered
what hers is yet.

1087
01:21:27,029 --> 01:21:28,353
Let's go fetch that boy.

1088
01:21:44,346 --> 01:21:46,625
Is this the one you want? Mm.

1089
01:21:49,463 --> 01:21:53,382
You got any ideas about running
rabbit on me, best get rid of them now.

1090
01:21:53,417 --> 01:21:55,621
Are you paying my way out?
Till Monday.

1091
01:21:55,656 --> 01:21:58,025
How come?

1092
01:21:58,060 --> 01:22:00,499
You like dragging that cotton sack?

1093
01:22:00,534 --> 01:22:03,737
No. Then don't ask questions.

1094
01:22:22,089 --> 01:22:25,572
# Why don't you do right

1095
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:29,006
# Like some other men do... #

1096
01:22:29,041 --> 01:22:30,930
This size, right?

1097
01:22:30,965 --> 01:22:32,969
But it's got to shine.

1098
01:22:33,004 --> 01:22:35,448
And when you need this? Tonight.

1099
01:22:35,483 --> 01:22:39,566
That's a tall order.
It's got to happen.

1100
01:22:39,601 --> 01:22:46,518
You know, I do my best work,
my fastest work,

1101
01:22:46,553 --> 01:22:48,803
when I'm happy.

1102
01:22:48,838 --> 01:22:53,196
Yeah, I suppose you do.

1103
01:22:54,874 --> 01:22:57,273
You gonna make me happy, baby?

1104
01:22:57,308 --> 01:22:59,232
Uh...

1105
01:23:00,712 --> 01:23:03,675
You come down by the club tonight.

1106
01:23:03,710 --> 01:23:07,888
We having a special show.
Tell 'em at the door, you my guest.

1107
01:23:07,923 --> 01:23:12,067
Food ain't the only thing
a woman needs three times a day.

1108
01:23:15,185 --> 01:23:16,710
What's that, baby?

1109
01:23:16,745 --> 01:23:22,342
Um, that boy gonna need time, try
this jacket on, see how he feels.

1110
01:23:22,377 --> 01:23:23,702
Later, Nadine.

1111
01:23:42,093 --> 01:23:44,777
You got to do something
to the boy's hair, darling.

1112
01:23:44,812 --> 01:23:48,570
They may not know what the real Sam
looked like, but it ain't this.

1113
01:23:48,605 --> 01:23:50,814
I can try.

1114
01:23:50,849 --> 01:23:52,534
What exactly am I supposed to do?

1115
01:23:52,569 --> 01:23:55,727
You're gonna stand up there
with that contraption you got,

1116
01:23:55,762 --> 01:23:57,724
and play Guitar Sam's numbers.

1117
01:23:57,759 --> 01:23:59,651
I can do that with my eyes closed.

1118
01:23:59,686 --> 01:24:03,044
If we can get the audience to
close theirs, we'll be better off.

1119
01:24:03,079 --> 01:24:05,002
Ty! I tracked Mr Trenier down.

1120
01:24:05,922 --> 01:24:08,201
Let's hit it.

1121
01:24:08,236 --> 01:24:10,480
Bye, Daddy.

1122
01:24:26,194 --> 01:24:29,312
You know what you're doing?

1123
01:24:29,347 --> 01:24:32,396
I fix Mama's hair all the time.

1124
01:24:32,431 --> 01:24:35,230
But you ain't been
to that school yet.

1125
01:24:35,265 --> 01:24:38,029
You go to school
to learn your guitar?

1126
01:24:39,548 --> 01:24:40,592
No.

1127
01:24:40,627 --> 01:24:43,065
I might pick up
some things at beauty school,

1128
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:45,541
but mostly it's for my certificate.

1129
01:24:45,576 --> 01:24:47,779
"And that is a ticket to adventure."

1130
01:24:47,814 --> 01:24:49,948
That's what it says in the brochure.

1131
01:24:49,983 --> 01:24:52,507
People looking for beauty
all over the world.

1132
01:24:52,542 --> 01:24:55,580
You ought to watch out for
them wires sticking down.

1133
01:24:55,615 --> 01:24:56,905
That don't look safe.

1134
01:24:56,940 --> 01:24:59,099
Yeah, power's always going out.

1135
01:24:59,134 --> 01:25:01,258
People getting shocks and whatnot.

1136
01:25:01,293 --> 01:25:03,742
Somebody ought to fix it.

1137
01:25:03,777 --> 01:25:07,735
"Career and beauty
is like money in the bank."

1138
01:25:07,770 --> 01:25:09,911
Says that in the brochure too.

1139
01:25:09,946 --> 01:25:12,018
Plus it isn't physically taxing.

1140
01:25:12,053 --> 01:25:15,971
Yeah, can't see no pretty thing
like you behind a plough.

1141
01:25:19,569 --> 01:25:22,688
I had the rheumatic fever
when I was little.

1142
01:25:22,723 --> 01:25:24,887
It left me with a weak heart.

1143
01:25:24,922 --> 01:25:27,211
Oh.

1144
01:25:27,246 --> 01:25:29,645
Mine been acting kind of funny too.

1145
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:32,044
About since I laid eyes on you.

1146
01:25:37,562 --> 01:25:41,280
What's that? Just some old
moonshine they keep around.

1147
01:25:41,315 --> 01:25:43,799
What are you gonna do with it?

1148
01:25:45,398 --> 01:25:48,997
They joke about how this stuff
will straighten your hair right out.

1149
01:25:50,196 --> 01:25:53,034
I'll just make yours relax a little.

1150
01:26:07,948 --> 01:26:10,392
Mr Time Trenier.

1151
01:26:10,427 --> 01:26:12,591
Has a name to be reckoned with.

1152
01:26:12,626 --> 01:26:15,904
The story goes you used
to play with Buddy Bolan.

1153
01:26:15,939 --> 01:26:17,909
I played with them all.

1154
01:26:17,944 --> 01:26:22,502
And King Oliver. One band falls
apart, you find yourself another.

1155
01:26:22,537 --> 01:26:25,979
There's never a shortage of bands
down in New Orleans.

1156
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:28,498
I didn't know
you were giving lessons.

1157
01:26:28,533 --> 01:26:30,297
It pays the rent, almost.

1158
01:26:31,297 --> 01:26:33,541
You interested in a playing job?

1159
01:26:33,576 --> 01:26:37,175
If you can pay, I can play.
You've got to dress sharp.

1160
01:26:39,014 --> 01:26:40,738
It ain't like an all-night thing.

1161
01:26:40,773 --> 01:26:45,731
You just got to start out, and
then there's gonna be an accident.

1162
01:26:45,766 --> 01:26:46,855
An accident?

1163
01:26:46,890 --> 01:26:49,689
Yeah, a sudden loss of power.

1164
01:26:49,724 --> 01:26:51,049
Lights out.

1165
01:26:52,128 --> 01:26:53,728
It's your gig, man.

1166
01:26:53,763 --> 01:26:55,372
8 o'clock.

1167
01:26:55,407 --> 01:26:57,726
This ain't no coloured people's
time.

1168
01:26:57,761 --> 01:27:00,122
And sure ain't New Orleans time.

1169
01:27:00,157 --> 01:27:02,448
I mean, 8 o'clock on the money.

1170
01:27:02,483 --> 01:27:04,842
If you got the green,
I'm on the scene.

1171
01:27:04,877 --> 01:27:06,598
Then that's the deal.

1172
01:27:06,633 --> 01:27:08,285
You know any drummers?

1173
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:11,879
I bring you one. And nothing fancy.

1174
01:27:11,914 --> 01:27:13,958
Just as long as he keep time.

1175
01:27:13,993 --> 01:27:16,037
Time is my name.

1176
01:27:25,113 --> 01:27:29,211
21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.

1177
01:27:29,246 --> 01:27:33,310
Make your mark here, please.

1178
01:27:33,345 --> 01:27:34,709
You owe me 30.

1179
01:27:36,548 --> 01:27:38,432
The book says 28.

1180
01:27:38,467 --> 01:27:42,905
1.50 every 100lb, and I picked...

1181
01:27:42,940 --> 01:27:45,149
2 deducted for stones.

1182
01:27:45,184 --> 01:27:48,108
But I've got no stones in the sack.

1183
01:27:48,143 --> 01:27:51,861
We mill the cotton, son.
There's always stones.

1184
01:27:51,896 --> 01:27:54,700
But there weren't none in my sack.

1185
01:27:56,899 --> 01:28:00,977
We take off 2 a week for stones.
That's the way it's always been.

1186
01:28:03,736 --> 01:28:05,860
Ain't that right, Junebug?

1187
01:28:05,895 --> 01:28:08,694
Yes, sir.
Been that way my whole life.

1188
01:28:10,213 --> 01:28:13,771
You gonna take your pay, son,
or you gonna give it up to charity?

1189
01:28:30,724 --> 01:28:32,523
Wouldn't let nobody mess
with my money like that.

1190
01:28:32,558 --> 01:28:34,407
He took the same 2 off yours.

1191
01:28:34,442 --> 01:28:38,161
Yeah, but you could pave a highway
with the rocks I threw in that mess.

1192
01:28:38,196 --> 01:28:41,097
You country negroes
let the crackers run you like dogs.

1193
01:28:41,132 --> 01:28:43,998
If the sheriff wasn't here
I'd snap your neck, boy.

1194
01:28:44,033 --> 01:28:45,961
Don't let me stop you.

1195
01:28:45,996 --> 01:28:51,394
But first, you're gonna sign
that ledger like you're supposed to.

1196
01:28:51,429 --> 01:28:54,393
Don't want nobody crying
they didn't get their due.

1197
01:29:02,909 --> 01:29:05,748
DELILAH HUMS

1198
01:29:25,619 --> 01:29:28,297
How could you do that?
I'm gonna put it back.

1199
01:29:28,332 --> 01:29:30,976
You don't go gambling
with my baby's money.

1200
01:29:31,011 --> 01:29:34,260
I ain't got no man playing.

1201
01:29:34,295 --> 01:29:36,494
I don't care what you took it for.

1202
01:29:36,529 --> 01:29:37,579
I save for China Doll

1203
01:29:37,614 --> 01:29:40,652
and you ain't got not business
putting your fingers on it.

1204
01:29:40,687 --> 01:29:42,257
China don't need any school, baby.

1205
01:29:42,292 --> 01:29:45,051
She could walk into any of those
places right now and get a job.

1206
01:29:45,086 --> 01:29:47,889
There's got to be some line
you won't cross, Ty.

1207
01:29:47,924 --> 01:29:49,826
There's got to be something
you won't do.

1208
01:29:49,861 --> 01:29:51,693
The world start throwing me
a break woman,

1209
01:29:51,728 --> 01:29:53,892
maybe I'll catch religion
and walk the straight and narrow

1210
01:29:53,927 --> 01:29:57,324
like those Bible toppers you
set up with. But until that day...

1211
01:29:57,359 --> 01:30:00,203
Reverend Cutlip was right about you.

1212
01:30:03,002 --> 01:30:04,641
Oh, shit.

1213
01:30:04,676 --> 01:30:06,281
Damn!

1214
01:30:38,746 --> 01:30:40,385
Mr Purvis?

1215
01:30:41,905 --> 01:30:46,823
People call me Ty or they call me
Pine Top, it's Mr Pine Top to you.

1216
01:30:49,821 --> 01:30:52,860
I just want to tell you how
I appreciate the opportunity.

1217
01:30:52,895 --> 01:30:54,379
Right.

1218
01:30:59,377 --> 01:31:02,356
I know every one
of Guitar Sam's songs.

1219
01:31:02,391 --> 01:31:05,335
I know the chords, I know the words.

1220
01:31:09,572 --> 01:31:12,451
China Doll was saying
how you was famous once.

1221
01:31:13,970 --> 01:31:15,494
I was known,

1222
01:31:15,529 --> 01:31:17,409
but never what you call famous.

1223
01:31:20,287 --> 01:31:22,966
How do you get your start?

1224
01:31:26,165 --> 01:31:27,809
Down in Mobile.

1225
01:31:27,844 --> 01:31:31,802
An old professional.

1226
01:31:31,837 --> 01:31:35,726
The name of Joe Dudlow.

1227
01:31:35,761 --> 01:31:38,160
He'd had a stroke on one side.

1228
01:31:39,359 --> 01:31:41,717
Curled him all up.

1229
01:31:43,237 --> 01:31:44,876
Kept on plugging.

1230
01:31:47,515 --> 01:31:52,953
I used to come out and
play his left hand for him.

1231
01:31:52,988 --> 01:31:54,717
This one night,

1232
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:56,831
he was going hot and heavy.

1233
01:31:58,590 --> 01:32:00,329
His show's just past,

1234
01:32:00,364 --> 01:32:02,034
right at the piano,

1235
01:32:02,069 --> 01:32:04,948
middle of Black Bottom Stomp.

1236
01:32:06,467 --> 01:32:09,706
They'd propped him up at the bar,

1237
01:32:09,741 --> 01:32:11,785
stuck a drink in his hand...

1238
01:32:13,344 --> 01:32:18,501
Told me to keep pounding
those ivories.

1239
01:32:19,461 --> 01:32:24,419
There was a meanness
hanging over them two johns.

1240
01:32:24,454 --> 01:32:27,415
There was murder in the air.

1241
01:32:27,450 --> 01:32:30,341
Stopped playing for the minute,

1242
01:32:30,376 --> 01:32:33,575
come down on you
like a flock of girls.

1243
01:32:33,610 --> 01:32:36,099
Hey.

1244
01:32:36,134 --> 01:32:38,333
This is you.

1245
01:32:40,012 --> 01:32:43,176
Big band days on the road.

1246
01:32:43,211 --> 01:32:47,849
Reginald Erskine.
I don't believe I've heard of him.

1247
01:32:47,884 --> 01:32:50,727
Big, tall, light skin fella
out in Carolina.

1248
01:32:51,687 --> 01:32:54,445
Said he was part Cherokee.

1249
01:32:55,404 --> 01:32:57,689
Couldn't play nothing,

1250
01:32:57,724 --> 01:33:01,402
but he'd raise a little stink
and he had just long greasy hair

1251
01:33:01,437 --> 01:33:04,321
he'd through around
like Cab Calloway.

1252
01:33:04,356 --> 01:33:06,325
And you were the piano man?

1253
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:10,363
Piano man, arranger, you name it.

1254
01:33:10,398 --> 01:33:13,197
That must have been something,
travelling the country first class.

1255
01:33:13,232 --> 01:33:17,995
I don't know about first class,
but I seen the country.

1256
01:33:18,030 --> 01:33:19,514
How come you stopped?

1257
01:33:22,673 --> 01:33:26,436
I got tired of carrying
another man's water.

1258
01:33:26,471 --> 01:33:30,349
Didn't want to die in no
coloured hotel some night

1259
01:33:30,384 --> 01:33:32,588
in who knows where Arkansas.

1260
01:33:36,186 --> 01:33:39,030
Met Delilah.

1261
01:33:39,065 --> 01:33:40,664
Wanted something of my own.

1262
01:33:44,863 --> 01:33:48,181
You don't have nothing
to worry about, Mr Pine Top.

1263
01:33:48,216 --> 01:33:50,505
I won't let you down tonight.

1264
01:33:50,540 --> 01:33:54,739
No, I... I don't suppose you will.

1265
01:34:19,407 --> 01:34:20,572
# You got to choose

1266
01:34:20,607 --> 01:34:23,286
# You got to choose
between the fire and the Lord

1267
01:34:23,321 --> 01:34:24,290
# You got to choose

1268
01:34:24,325 --> 01:34:27,503
# You got to choose
between the fire and the Lord

1269
01:34:27,538 --> 01:34:30,682
# You got to choose between
the fire and the Lord

1270
01:34:31,882 --> 01:34:33,921
# You're gonna make it all right

1271
01:34:46,915 --> 01:34:48,039
# You got to choose

1272
01:34:48,074 --> 01:34:50,353
# You got to choose between
the world and the Lord

1273
01:34:50,388 --> 01:34:51,358
# You got to choose

1274
01:34:51,393 --> 01:34:57,550
# You got to choose between
the world and the Lord

1275
01:34:58,790 --> 01:35:00,749
# You better jump on board

1276
01:35:14,862 --> 01:35:15,867
# You got to choose

1277
01:35:15,902 --> 01:35:18,621
# You got to choose
between the word and the Lord

1278
01:35:18,656 --> 01:35:19,665
# You got to choose

1279
01:35:19,700 --> 01:35:22,539
# You got to choose
between the word and the Lord

1280
01:35:22,574 --> 01:35:25,378
# You got to choose between
the word and the Lord

1281
01:35:26,897 --> 01:35:29,581
# You better jump on board

1282
01:35:29,616 --> 01:35:34,394
# When that sun no longer shines

1283
01:35:34,429 --> 01:35:39,137
# God will send his final sign

1284
01:35:39,172 --> 01:35:42,656
# Get down sinner
You got to kneel

1285
01:35:42,691 --> 01:35:45,689
# You got to kneel for the saviour
and pray

1286
01:35:46,649 --> 01:35:49,907
# You got to kneel for the saviour
and pray

1287
01:35:49,942 --> 01:35:53,173
# You got to kneel
for the saviour and pray

1288
01:35:53,208 --> 01:35:56,404
There ain't no hiding
from the judgement day

1289
01:35:56,439 --> 01:35:58,080
# There ain't no hiding

1290
01:35:58,115 --> 01:35:59,798
# From the judgement day

1291
01:35:59,833 --> 01:36:03,436
# No, there ain't no hiding

1292
01:36:03,471 --> 01:36:07,039
# From the judgement day. #

1293
01:36:07,074 --> 01:36:09,255
Have a good time.

1294
01:36:09,290 --> 01:36:11,437
Hi there, young lady.

1295
01:36:13,477 --> 01:36:16,675
Good evening, welcome to the
Honeydripper. Have a good time.

1296
01:36:22,233 --> 01:36:24,236
Everybody's getting restless.

1297
01:36:24,271 --> 01:36:27,350
How we doing? We're gonna be
full up, but the food...

1298
01:36:29,669 --> 01:36:31,788
Is Delilah coming in?

1299
01:36:33,987 --> 01:36:35,591
What if I've lost her?

1300
01:36:35,626 --> 01:36:38,985
She won't let you down, Ty. 
This ain't going to work, is it?

1301
01:36:39,020 --> 01:36:42,548
You just got to play it out and see. 
Guitar Sam!

1302
01:36:42,583 --> 01:36:44,942
See if you can push another round
of drinks while I stall them.

1303
01:36:44,977 --> 01:36:46,547
Then you going to bring him out?
Sam!

1304
01:36:46,582 --> 01:36:49,580
We coming here to hear
the guitar man play!

1305
01:36:49,615 --> 01:36:51,505
Be on the wires.

1306
01:36:51,540 --> 01:36:55,303
Give them three barsGuitar Sam!

1307
01:36:55,338 --> 01:36:58,457
I got a baseball bat under the
counter but you out here all alone.

1308
01:36:58,492 --> 01:37:00,180
Just get the liquor moving, Mace.

1309
01:37:00,215 --> 01:37:02,494
And keep the money
where you can run with it.

1310
01:37:02,529 --> 01:37:04,138
Guitar Sam!

1311
01:37:04,173 --> 01:37:09,451
The Lord don't want nobody
to sit back and suffer.

1312
01:37:09,486 --> 01:37:11,987
He want you to stand up.

1313
01:37:12,022 --> 01:37:14,495
He want you to rise up.

1314
01:37:14,530 --> 01:37:16,933
He want you to step forward

1315
01:37:16,968 --> 01:37:22,805
and come down to the merciful arms
of his eternal salvation.

1316
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:28,083
A fire is heating up,
brothers and sisters,

1317
01:37:28,118 --> 01:37:30,287
and judgement day is nigh.

1318
01:37:30,322 --> 01:37:34,125
Anybody out there tonight
want to answer his call?

1319
01:37:34,160 --> 01:37:39,597
Anybody out there tonight, is gonna
step forward and be saved?

1320
01:37:39,632 --> 01:37:42,641
Ain't no time to hesitate.

1321
01:37:42,676 --> 01:37:46,475
Got to come on down
and offer yourself to the Lord.

1322
01:37:46,510 --> 01:37:48,439
Come on. Come on, come on, sister.

1323
01:37:48,474 --> 01:37:51,672
I believe you hear the
Lord's voice talking to you sister.

1324
01:37:51,707 --> 01:37:55,191
That's the Lord's voice
and I believe you hear it.

1325
01:37:55,226 --> 01:37:57,115
I do believe you hear it.

1326
01:37:57,150 --> 01:38:00,948
Come on down.
Bring it on down to his salvation.

1327
01:38:00,983 --> 01:38:03,152
Feel the Lord at your back.

1328
01:38:03,187 --> 01:38:08,025
You got to leave them sinners behind.
Come on down.

1329
01:38:09,584 --> 01:38:12,028
Come on down.

1330
01:38:12,063 --> 01:38:14,187
I see you sister, coming.

1331
01:38:14,222 --> 01:38:16,661
I see the Lord is talking to you.

1332
01:38:16,696 --> 01:38:19,357
I hear the Lord is talking to you.

1333
01:38:19,392 --> 01:38:21,984
I believe you hear him, sister.

1334
01:38:22,019 --> 01:38:26,497
Come on down,
you hear the voice of the Lord?

1335
01:38:26,532 --> 01:38:28,713
You hear the voice of the Lord.

1336
01:38:28,748 --> 01:38:30,860
That voice is trying to tell you

1337
01:38:30,895 --> 01:38:33,733
where you need to be right now,
sister.

1338
01:38:33,768 --> 01:38:36,572
All you've got to do,
all you've got to do

1339
01:38:36,607 --> 01:38:39,428
is move your feet and get there.

1340
01:38:39,463 --> 01:38:42,250
Move your feet and get there.

1341
01:38:45,968 --> 01:38:47,767
You look good.

1342
01:38:47,802 --> 01:38:49,806
Damn.

1343
01:38:51,205 --> 01:38:53,249
He look good, don't he, Daddy? Yeah.

1344
01:38:53,284 --> 01:38:58,402
Honey, I need you to get right
by that front door

1345
01:38:58,437 --> 01:39:00,798
and take over collecting
the cover charge.

1346
01:39:00,833 --> 01:39:03,125
Anything happens,
go wrong or something,

1347
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:05,879
you just step out and walk away
from the club, you hear?

1348
01:39:05,914 --> 01:39:07,518
What's going to go wrong?

1349
01:39:09,198 --> 01:39:12,476
Guitar Sam here,
gets them soldier boys jumping,

1350
01:39:12,511 --> 01:39:14,081
get a little rough in here.

1351
01:39:14,116 --> 01:39:15,955
Just stay on your toes, that's all.

1352
01:39:15,990 --> 01:39:17,314
OK.

1353
01:39:20,472 --> 01:39:21,951
China Doll?

1354
01:39:23,471 --> 01:39:26,989
You know there ain't a thing in
this world I wouldn't do for you?

1355
01:39:27,024 --> 01:39:29,708
Even if I mess up sometimes.

1356
01:39:29,743 --> 01:39:31,784
You know that, right?

1357
01:39:31,819 --> 01:39:34,122
I know that, Daddy.

1358
01:39:34,157 --> 01:39:36,425
You go on, now.

1359
01:39:42,423 --> 01:39:47,781
Well, you look like something
that would come out of New Orleans.

1360
01:39:47,816 --> 01:39:50,579
I forget to tell you,
I fixed your hook-up.

1361
01:39:50,614 --> 01:39:52,144
My what?

1362
01:39:52,179 --> 01:39:54,538
Your hook-up, where your
electricity comes in. It was...

1363
01:39:54,573 --> 01:39:57,940
Ty, we've got a situation out there.

1364
01:39:57,975 --> 01:40:01,974
You don't think I know that?
Got the law in the house.

1365
01:40:10,490 --> 01:40:12,774
Didn't think
we'd be seeing you so soon.

1366
01:40:12,809 --> 01:40:15,848
You got a real nice crowd
here tonight, Tyrone.

1367
01:40:15,883 --> 01:40:17,652
I see them army uniforms.

1368
01:40:17,687 --> 01:40:22,045
We got ourselves
this special attraction. See...

1369
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:25,169
Chicken. Huh?

1370
01:40:25,204 --> 01:40:27,683
Them ribs outside smell real good,

1371
01:40:27,718 --> 01:40:29,207
but I'm afraid my heart's set

1372
01:40:29,242 --> 01:40:31,760
on some of your wife Delilah's
fried chicken.

1373
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:33,884
Right.

1374
01:40:33,919 --> 01:40:36,163
She made it last Saturday
at the mayor's,

1375
01:40:36,198 --> 01:40:40,077
but old Clayford Gentry came up
and he ate all the drumsticks.

1376
01:40:41,596 --> 01:40:43,755
I'm partial to dark meat.

1377
01:40:44,795 --> 01:40:47,998
The situation
regarding... sherriff...

1378
01:40:48,033 --> 01:40:50,512
She is in the back there cooking,
isn't she?

1379
01:40:54,510 --> 01:40:58,429
Maybe, if you would come back here
a little bit later.

1380
01:40:58,464 --> 01:41:00,353
Regular or spicy?

1381
01:41:00,388 --> 01:41:03,587
They both take the same time to
fix up. I just got to know which.

1382
01:41:07,064 --> 01:41:09,943
I have to make mine regular,
I'm afraid, ma'am.

1383
01:41:09,978 --> 01:41:11,347
Spicy is just fine,

1384
01:41:11,382 --> 01:41:14,466
but it always comes back
to nip at me later.

1385
01:41:14,501 --> 01:41:18,100
It's important not to bite off
more than you can chew.

1386
01:41:18,135 --> 01:41:21,138
You just make yourself at home.

1387
01:41:22,778 --> 01:41:24,457
Good luck tonight, baby.

1388
01:41:28,295 --> 01:41:30,454
Slap some mayonnaise on it.

1389
01:41:33,453 --> 01:41:35,452
You want to wait over there,
Sherriff?

1390
01:41:35,487 --> 01:41:37,451
Don't want to scare off
the customers.

1391
01:41:39,571 --> 01:41:40,974
Here he comes!

1392
01:41:41,009 --> 01:41:42,688
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1393
01:41:50,685 --> 01:41:55,443
So, here is what you all
been waiting for.

1394

FEEDBACK

1398
01:42:21,311 --> 01:42:23,195
Sorry about that, folks.

1399
01:42:23,230 --> 01:42:24,989
Must have got kicked on the train.

1400
01:42:33,186 --> 01:42:35,145
FEEDBACK STOPS

1401
01:42:55,256 --> 01:42:57,415
Thank you, Jesus.

1414
01:45:03,039 --> 01:45:04,558
Got to check that out.

01:45:05,558 --> 01:45:07,837
Let's go. Come on!

1416

CHEERING

1423
01:46:06,370 --> 01:46:09,094
Oh, my soul!

1424
01:46:09,129 --> 01:46:11,468
Don't tire yourself out, poppa.

1425
01:46:11,503 --> 01:46:13,807
Me and you got business together.

1426
01:46:13,842 --> 01:46:16,846
I believe we do.

1427
01:46:18,845 --> 01:46:20,090
All right.

1428
01:46:20,125 --> 01:46:22,168
All you men, grab a hold of a woman.

1429
01:46:22,203 --> 01:46:24,522
If you ain't got a woman,
just grab a hold of yourselves.

1430
01:46:24,557 --> 01:46:27,321
We're gonna play this one for you,
slow and tight.

1431
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:32,658
# They did the boogie real slow

1432
01:46:32,693 --> 01:46:35,837
# With the blue lights way down low

1433
01:46:39,835 --> 01:46:43,054
# They did the boogie real slow

# At the party

1438
01:47:28,134 --> 01:47:32,691
# Man, I really got a shock... #

1439
01:47:32,726 --> 01:47:37,249
42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 150.

1440
01:47:38,289 --> 01:47:41,172
And there's another 50 in here.

1441
01:47:41,207 --> 01:47:43,771
Lucky Hardaware don't mind
some change, does he?

1442
01:47:43,806 --> 01:47:47,645
What if Mr Hardaware were to say
let the chumps keep their change?

1443
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:50,723
He wants the club back,
one way or the other.

1444
01:47:52,003 --> 01:47:53,522
How that be?

1445
01:47:55,601 --> 01:47:59,400
Well, he better take that up
with my business partner.

1446
01:48:03,358 --> 01:48:05,562
The sheriff your business partner?

1447
01:48:05,597 --> 01:48:09,035
Yeah. And he's twice as mean
as he is ugly.

1448
01:48:15,832 --> 01:48:18,751
You must want this club
awful bad, brother.

1449
01:48:22,469 --> 01:48:27,107
Maybe y'all didn't notice,
but that ain't no Guitar Sam.

1450
01:48:28,946 --> 01:48:29,951
# At the party

1451
01:48:29,986 --> 01:48:32,964
# Oh, I was like a chaperone

1452
01:48:32,999 --> 01:48:35,908
# I couldn't boogie real slow

1453
01:48:35,943 --> 01:48:40,022
# With the blue lights way down low

1454
01:48:43,179 --> 01:48:45,943
# I like to boogie real slow

1455
01:48:45,978 --> 01:48:49,897
# With the blue lights
way down low. #

1456
01:48:53,655 --> 01:48:55,734
CHEERING

1457
01:49:00,852 --> 01:49:02,891
Sam!

1458
01:49:05,410 --> 01:49:08,054
You is a liar, boy.

1459
01:49:08,089 --> 01:49:11,127
I know Sammy since he was
drinking his mama's milk.

1460
01:49:11,162 --> 01:49:14,166
Hell, I know his mama,
she's lives up near mine.

1461
01:49:14,201 --> 01:49:15,686
And you ain't him.

1462
01:49:21,082 --> 01:49:25,721
That's Creole Sammy you're talking
about, pops. I'm Delta Guitar Sam.

1463
01:49:25,756 --> 01:49:27,645
As long as we straight on that.

1464
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:30,079
Get on out of here
and let the man play.

1465
01:49:30,114 --> 01:49:31,278
Yeah.

1466
01:49:35,396 --> 01:49:38,475
I'm gonna play one for you right
now that I come up with today

1467
01:49:38,510 --> 01:49:40,474

# Oh, oh, China Doll

1471
01:49:52,548 --> 01:49:55,032
# Can't get you off of my mind

1472
01:49:55,067 --> 01:49:58,946
# But if you're gonna be my baby,
leave all them others behind

1473
01:50:00,465 --> 01:50:02,949
# Oh, oh, China Doll

1474
01:50:02,984 --> 01:50:06,103
# I think about you day and night

# I think about you day and night

# Oh, baby
When you gonna treat me right? #

Don't have no fighting,
don't have no killing.

1484
01:51:35,943 --> 01:51:39,620
Don't have none of that
dismal nonsense in my house!

1485
01:51:39,655 --> 01:51:41,300
You understand?!

1486
01:51:43,019 --> 01:51:45,218
What's your name, son?

Dex.

1488

Well, gentlemen, this is a night
there won't be no pitiful song

written about you two
killing each other.

1492
01:51:58,052 --> 01:52:03,175
Don't nothing rhyme with Moncrieff
anyhow! We got a problem here?

1493
01:52:03,210 --> 01:52:08,088
Yeah, these two gentlemen seem to have
brought something in for our collection.

1494
01:52:08,123 --> 01:52:09,608
Yeah? You first.

1495
01:52:11,967 --> 01:52:13,485
Now yours.

1496
01:52:15,564 --> 01:52:18,883
Y'all still wanna mess with each
other, you go outside and do it.

1497
01:52:18,918 --> 01:52:23,321
This world is full of people
who got no use for us,

1498
01:52:23,356 --> 01:52:25,725
like to see us in the grave.

1499
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:27,559
We don't need to give them any help.

You had me from the start... #

MUSIC CONTINUES IN DISTANCE

1506
01:53:18,817 --> 01:53:21,495
Sound like the music moving on
again, don't it?

1507
01:53:23,174 --> 01:53:24,733
It always do.

1508
01:53:36,568 --> 01:53:39,167
Time to make room
for whoever coming next.

1509
01:54:15,151 --> 01:54:18,310
That boy can play some.

1510
01:54:23,627 --> 01:54:24,787
Leaving?

1511
01:54:26,306 --> 01:54:29,745
I ain't needed around here no more.

1512
01:54:29,780 --> 01:54:31,184
Where you headed?

1513
01:54:31,219 --> 01:54:33,707
Oh...

1514
01:54:33,742 --> 01:54:35,461
Down the road.

1515
01:54:43,418 --> 01:54:44,657
Tyrone.

1516
01:54:53,814 --> 01:54:56,213
Who you talking to out here?

1517
01:55:06,528 --> 01:55:08,168
Just myself.

1518
01:56:24,213 --> 01:56:27,136
# It started with a 12-bar
country moan

1519
01:56:27,171 --> 01:56:29,990
# Then the guitar bass
dropped the saxophone

1520
01:56:30,025 --> 01:56:32,809
# Up the Mississippi River
came the song

1521
01:56:32,844 --> 01:56:35,768
# Music keeps rolling, rolling on

1522
01:56:35,803 --> 01:56:37,732
# The music

1523
01:56:37,767 --> 01:56:39,286
# Keeps rolling on

1524
01:56:41,045 --> 01:56:43,964
# Use the fender
To make the notes spark

1525
01:56:43,999 --> 01:56:46,820
# Then the bass guitar
got electrified

1526
01:56:46,855 --> 01:56:49,642
# Blues are rocking
Like a good ole stomp

1527
01:56:49,677 --> 01:56:52,681
# And the music keeps rolling on

1528
01:56:52,716 --> 01:56:54,924
# The music

1529
01:56:54,959 --> 01:56:56,278
# Keeps rolling on

1530
01:57:03,435 --> 01:57:05,234
# Whoo-hoo!

1531
01:57:09,992 --> 01:57:11,272
# Whoo!

The music keeps rolling on

# Ye-e-es! Huh! #
