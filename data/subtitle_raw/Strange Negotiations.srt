I'm Robert Siegel.

18
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,310
David Bazan was once known as the first

19
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,360
cross-over Christian indie-rock musician.

20
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,030
His band, Pedro the Lion, sold hundreds

21
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,010
of thousands of records.

22
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:10,686
- [David] Hey, how's it going out there?

23
00:02:10,686 --> 00:02:13,519
(people cheering)

24
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,610
- [Michele] Then Bazan
began questioning the God

25
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,960
he sang about, alienating
many of his fans.

26
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,790
Now, he has a new album
out under his own name,

27
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,940
and recently, he went on a solo tour,

28
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,760
playing in living rooms.

29
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,210
Clay Masters, from member
station, NET Radio,

30
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,530
caught up with Bazan on the road.

31
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,270
- [Clay] It took Bazan four years after

32
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:37,080
Pedro the Lion broke up to
write his first solo record.

33
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,980
In that time, it seems, he was overwhelmed

34
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,123
by his break up with God, and
he started drinking heavily.

35
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,500
The questioning of God
isn't something new for him,

36
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,650
it dates back to early
Pedro the Lion records.

37
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,300
Many music critics
called Curse Your Braches

38
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,870
Bazan's break up with God.

39
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,720
Bazan hopes people who buy it will respond

40
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,060
to his honestly regardless
of what he might believe.

41

For NPR News, I'm Clay Masters.

games that are specialty , so.

43
00:03:10,447 --> 00:03:14,211
But I think there's three or four games

44
00:03:14,211 --> 00:03:15,044
that you'll be home for.

45
00:03:15,044 --> 00:03:17,060
So that'll be cool.
- That's great.

46
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,240
Well when I'm home, I
wanna take him to the

49
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,136
Yeah, your dad said that he's
progressively getting better.

50
00:03:27,136 --> 00:03:28,428
- Great.

51
00:03:28,428 --> 00:03:29,298

00:03:29,298 --> 00:03:31,310

Okay, sorry, I'm turned around.

00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,290
As the Republican nominating battle

65
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:29,190
moved into the fall with
the two outsider candidates,

66
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,590
Donald Trump and Ben Carson,
still on top of the polls,

67
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,200
the frustration of the other
establishment candidates,

68
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,140
is growing.

69
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,390
- [Man] One of the many
surprises this election year

70
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,330
has been the support
Donald Trump has received

71
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,330
from conservative, evangelical
voters in the primaries.

72
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,620
To build on that support,
Donald Trump met with

73
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,220
hundreds of evangelical
leaders in Manhattan yesterday

74
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,910
and he suggested that they not pray for

75
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,560
the country's current leadership.

76
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:57,050
(soft music)

77
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,540
- I grew up in Phoenix, Arizona and

78
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,240
we lived a half a mile from the church

79
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,990
that we went to and that my dad worked at

80
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:13,270
and the school that I went
to was a part of that church.

81
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,150
Every single person in my...

82
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,610
- From like Kindergarten?
- Yeah.

83
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,983
Kindergarten to sixth grade.
- Okay.

84
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,840
- Every single person
in my extended family is

85
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,090
Christian and the same kind of Christian

86
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:30,920
that we were, Pentecostal,
Assemblies of God.

87
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,260
And certain kinds of evangelical
Christianity, specifically,

88
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:40,260
there's this push for your
faith to be integrated

89
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,200
in your person, in your identity,

90
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,200
and it's not some separate
ornament to your life.

91
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,600
It's like the fundamental thing, and so,

92
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,680
that was the mindset that
I kind of grew up with,

93
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,050
was that this is, it
just permeates everything

94
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:01,050
and I enjoyed that.
I mean, there's like a
feeling of fidelity to it

95
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,983
that just, you know,
just made you feel good.

And that is.

133

134
00:08:34,552 --> 00:08:35,987
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

135
00:08:35,987 --> 00:08:40,220
- This is awesome.
- It was a great show.

136
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,637
(soft music)

137
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,130
- [David] Before inventing
house shows, you know,

138
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,010
I was at the pawn shop all the time

139
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:00,710
with my gear in pawn to make ends meet.

140
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:03,430
And once we got house shows figured out,

141
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,740
I had never went to the pawn shop again.

142
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:09,513
But all of a sudden, I'm on
the road all of the time.

143
00:09:09,513 --> 00:09:12,640
I recently realized I was
gone two years and nine months

144
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,400
of my son's first five
years on Earth, over half.

145
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,920
And I've been right on
that line for too long.

146
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,780
Like, how much can my marriage withstand?

147
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,380
A couple of years ago it became clear

148
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,260
that our marriage really can't stand

149
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,723
this amount of time away.

150
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:32,447
And watching it crack and
seeing it could be over soon,

151
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,690
I gotta get home more.
(soft music)

152
00:09:44,131 --> 00:09:45,360
- [Nils] What time is it for you?

153
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,283
- It's after midnight.

154
00:09:49,161 --> 00:09:50,770
- [Eleanor] We're at 9:36 right now.

155
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:53,080
- I know, I'm at 12:36.

156
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,333
What are you doing, Nils?

157
00:09:55,921 --> 00:09:56,754
Hi.

158
00:09:58,196 --> 00:10:00,246
- [Eleanor] I hate him so much right now.

159
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,763
- He's just looking for love.

160
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,057
I'll be home in a minute.

161
00:10:06,211 --> 00:10:07,210
- [Eleanor] In a minute?

162
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,793
In a minute?
- Mhm.

163
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,403
- I love you so much.
- I love you too.

164
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,983
I miss you guys.
- I miss you too, dad.

165
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,880
- How are dealing with all of that?

166
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,981
(laughs)

167
00:10:22,981 --> 00:10:24,735
- [Ann] I'm gonna go.

168
00:10:24,735 --> 00:10:27,853
- Pew, pew, pew, pew.
- All right, bye.

169
00:10:27,853 --> 00:10:29,183
- I love you guys.

170
00:10:30,967 --> 00:10:33,384
(soft music)

171
00:11:12,677 --> 00:11:15,770
You have to be really
crafty about logistics

172
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,280
and how to make the day to day work

173
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,360
and where to shave things off, you know,

174
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,253
hotel rooms or staying with people.

175
00:11:21,253 --> 00:11:23,350
You know, there are
just like a hundred ways

176
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,420
to figure out how to do it.

177
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,520
Being middle aged, having
kids, trying to justify

178
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,030
this weird choice that
you made when you were 19

179
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,880
and that all of your buddies
either got rich doing it,

180
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,770
or have given it up.

181
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,950
And so you're trying to
justify all this stuff

182
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,560
and it's easy to lose
faith, but if you're finding

183
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,270
that spark, if you're finding that thing

184
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:45,880
that made the White Album
just flip your chemistry

185
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,030
when you were in eighth grade.

186
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,920
And you're not Paul
McCartney or John Lennon,

187
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,140
but you're doing something that connects

188
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,090
your brain that same way,
then you can keep going

189
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:54,973
for a long time.

190
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,923
So that's the trick.

191
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,670
If Pedro had put out another
record and it was really good

192
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:05,370
and well received, that was the moment

193
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,550
where it was gonna change, you know?

194
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:11,420
There had been a string of close buddies

195
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,210
that had been in the band and were now

196
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,540
not in the band anymore.

197
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:20,070
There was some sort of failure
in each of those instances.

198
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,970
They didn't have enough
ownership or whatever.

199
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,993
It just didn't work, repeatedly.

200
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,380
All this was happening
during the realizations

201
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,490
I was having about Christianity
and the Christian narrative

202
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,260
and how it was all kind of falling apart.

203
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:36,220
I was, you know, just a
bundle of contradictions

204
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,550
and so I just thought,
well I just need to lean

205
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,610
into all those contradictions just

206
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:44,973
to be the mess that I am about this stuff.

207
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,760
I mean, Pedro the Lion was
a really beautiful thing

208
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,760
and it was really working for a time,

209
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,680
and when that couldn't
work, I just thought that

210
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,870
something is wrong,
something about the premise

211
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:03,770
of this thing is flawed
and you need to walk

212
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:06,140
away from that premise, whatever that is.

213
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:10,153
And to me, the name of that
premise was Pedro the Lion.

214
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,740
I couldn't write anything.

215
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,220
I didn't know why it wasn't working,

216
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,050
and I didn't know what I was doing wrong

217
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,726
and so I killed it, and along with it,

218
00:13:20,726 --> 00:13:23,920
I effectively killed my livelihood,

219
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,670
I mean, my career basically,
to try to find out

220
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,380
why this was happening
and get some clarity.

221
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,430
Just driving around, playing solo shows,

222
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:34,760
trying to think through it and give myself

223
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,160
some time to figure it out
and then maybe by the time

224
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,010
I put out my first solo record,

225
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,310
I would be in a position
to have a band again.

226
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,220
For me to be allowed to
continue to do this work

227
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,370
of songwriting and interacting with people

228
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:50,320
and putting out records, while
I've been figuring this out,

229
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,743
really, really helped me.

230
00:13:59,065 --> 00:14:01,482
(soft music)

231
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,143
Where is it?

232
00:14:07,143 --> 00:14:08,570
Through here?

233
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:09,670
- [Yuuki] Third floor.

234
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,680
- With this method of
touring, people didn't know

235
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,690
what to expect and so, I
got to define what it was

236
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:24,530
and so it allowed me to
be myself more frequently.

237
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,970
It was grounding for me.

238
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,900
It was a pure form of the thing.

239
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,770
There's no lights, there's
no stage, there's no pomp.

240
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,370
You're right there, on the same scale.

241
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:38,040
If it was at a rock club, it
wouldn't work the same way,

242
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,470
but you're in this place
that you've never been,

243
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,010
they've never been before.

244
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:46,780
Everybody was just off
balance and open and so

245
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:50,030
that was when I started
seeing vulnerability

246
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:54,653
as the antidote to all this
anxiety and self loathing.

247
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,910
It was really helpful
to take the problem out

248
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:02,450
of my head to sort of
interact with that work

249
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,590
over and over again and the profound

250
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,510
and vulnerable way of singing.

251
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,710
What it does to your brain when you sing

252
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:12,750
something that you know and
that you love, it heals you.

I'm called Dave Bazan,
this is Yuuki Matthews.

270
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,120
Yeah, do y'all have any questions

271
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,420
at this point in the show?

272
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:39,540
It's kind of early,
but, maybe you curiosity

273
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,343
has already been stirred, who knows.

274
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:45,790
Okay well, we can talk later, also.

275
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:48,553
We have got a couple more
songs that we can play.

276
00:16:48,553 --> 00:16:50,224
(laughing)

277
00:16:50,224 --> 00:16:52,148
What is the definition
of what couple means?

278
00:16:52,148 --> 00:16:53,473
- Two, right?
- Two?

279
00:16:53,473 --> 00:16:54,306
- [Woman] Three.

280
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:55,580
- Or three.
- Isn't a few

281
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,413
three or more?

282
00:16:56,413 --> 00:16:58,420
- Yeah but when I say go grab
couple me a couple of beers,

283
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:02,043
I do mean three.
(audience laughs)

284
00:17:02,923 --> 00:17:06,720
- Are you surprised that
people who are religious

285
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,673
are still very big fans of you?

286
00:17:08,673 --> 00:17:11,633
Does that bother you or--
- No.

287
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,260
I care about what happens
with Christianity.

288
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,543
I want it to get better.

289
00:17:18,695 --> 00:17:22,670
I want it to quit shittin'
the bed so consistently.

290
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:26,190
So when I hear that, that
there are Christians whose

291
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:29,360
faith is of the sort that you can sit

292
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,160
and listen to me blabbing
on for nine minutes,

293
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,960
to me that is a good sign.

294
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,110
In regards to, whoever is
going to like this music

295
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:42,970
is gonna like it.
I can't stop it, and
I would never want to,

296
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,857
'cause I got a few in my family.

297
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:48,096
(audience laughs)

298
00:17:48,096 --> 00:17:53,096
(soft music)
(people chattering)

299
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,540
I find myself interacting with people that

300
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,410
we have different worldviews,

301
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,270
but I'm trying to find
common ground and I say,

302
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,320
when you say God's kingdom,
what do you think about?

303
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,010
And they say, oh well
justice and these things,

304
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:06,880
and I was like, me too.

305
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,160
I think that's important too.

306
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,513
Let's join together and do that.

307
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,840
Because partially, you're
scared of burning in hell

308
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,460
for all eternity, me just 'cause
I think it's a great idea.

309
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,640
But let's do it, you know wat I'm saying?

310
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,320
The fruit on the tree, that's the thing.

311
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,440
People can claim all kinds of things,

312
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,330
but what's the fruit,
you know, in the end?

313
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,900
That's the myth of a powerful movement

314
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,820
like American Evangelical Christianity.

315
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,980
That there is one way
to think about a thing.

316
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,670
That the interpretation
that seems universal

317
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:38,510
is the real thing.

318
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,040
And so in the end, I realized that I was

319
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,333
challenging nothing more
than an institution.

320
00:18:44,181 --> 00:18:46,598
(soft music)

321
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:02,020
I think my brain always was
kind of deconstructing things,

322
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,550
even as like a kid.

323
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:06,460
Seventh grade, I remember
we were at this church

324
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,120
in Lake Havasu City, Arizona,

325
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,460
and it was Fourth of July and my dad

326
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,470
was the music pastor
this church and they had

327
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,910
a color guard that came in and had flags

328
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:20,130
and I think fake guns,
walking up the aisle,

329
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,060
and we sang a bunch of patriotic songs.

330
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,660
And I remember thinking, like,

331
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,550
I think these guys are
getting some things mixed up.

332
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,090
I wouldn't have known the world conflate

333
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:30,930
but that you're conflating
two things with one another

334
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:33,313
that don't go, that aren't the same thing.

335
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,150
That day I mentioned it to my dad, like,

336
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,320
yeah, I don't think
those things go together.

337
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,127
His response was, "Oh, interesting.

338
00:19:42,127 --> 00:19:43,447
"Tell me more about that."

339
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,862
(cars passing)

340
00:19:52,868 --> 00:19:55,368
(tense music)

341
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:17,003
Yeah.

342
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,753
What did she do in that last race?

343
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,913
Was it an IM?

344
00:20:25,706 --> 00:20:26,570
Did she do okay?

345
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:27,450
Two seconds?

346
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,300
Oh man, that's so great.

347
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,330
Oh, that's so good.

348
00:20:43,706 --> 00:20:46,456
(drill whirring)

349
00:21:00,388 --> 00:21:02,638
♪ Ooh, ooh ♪

350
00:21:04,281 --> 00:21:07,448

351
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,830
(audience applause)

352
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:16,440
You all wanna talk about anything

353
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,210
at this point in the show?

354
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,800
- [Woman] So the Whole EP
was one of the first albums

355
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,360
that I listened to by you.

356
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,225
It's a lot different.
- It is different.

357
00:21:24,225 --> 00:21:26,970
- [Woman] Than what you
have recently produced.

358
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,950
What made you so bitter?

359
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:31,605
- Whoa, I'm not even a little bit bitter.

360
00:21:31,605 --> 00:21:32,890
(audience laughs)

361
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:36,277
I changed a lot since the
time I was 18 until now

362
00:21:36,277 --> 00:21:38,573
and I just did it in front of people.

363
00:21:39,738 --> 00:21:41,130
- I have a question.
- Yep.

364
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,167
- [Audience Member] Are
you tired of talking
about Christianity?

365
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:46,090
- Oh no, it's so fascinating.
(audience members laugh)

366
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:48,580
Christianity is still
creating so many problems

367
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:51,283
all around us, like I'm
dying to talk about it.

368
00:21:51,283 --> 00:21:54,957
Dying.
(laughing)

369
00:21:54,957 --> 00:21:58,124
(soft acoustic music)

370
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,130
- Growing up in church,
listening to Christian rock

371
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,550
and this and that, or even somebody

372
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:14,040
who was like, within the church.

373
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:17,190
As soon as you found out that
somebody left the church,

374
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,298
you're done, I'm never
listening to your shit again.

375
00:22:19,298 --> 00:22:21,670
- Yeah, right.
- I find, you seem to be

376
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:24,210
an anomaly, which is a positive thing.

377
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:27,690
That you do this and you
have this large majority

378
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:30,880
of your fan base are still young believers

379
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,822
that still continue to support you

380
00:22:32,822 --> 00:22:33,900
and they're here tonight.

381
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,130
And you're the only person
that I think I can name

382
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,740
that has that type of support.

383
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,820
- What I hope is happening is that there

384
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,670
is a space, more of a middle ground,

385
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:47,210
for people to remain
Christian, and for their faith

386
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:52,210
to become faith and
not a militant sort of,

387
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,400
you're either with us or against,

388
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,770
like an othering kind
of thing where there's

389
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:59,290
a vulnerability to actual
faith that isn't just, like,

390
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:00,580
a club that you're beating people with.

391
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,413
- Right.

392
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:03,790
- Would you say that there's
stuff that's out there

393
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:06,790
that you've written and
that you used to believe in

394
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,180
that you don't believe in anymore?

395
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,013
- Yes.

396
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,033
- And, um, so people
find this music by you,

397
00:23:14,033 --> 00:23:16,750
and they're like, oh
this is David Buzan, but,

398
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,127
is it really?

399
00:23:18,127 --> 00:23:21,847
- It's David Buzan from
a certain point in time.

400
00:23:21,847 --> 00:23:25,960
At any given point, it's
always been totally in earnest

401
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,910
so yeah, I changed my
mind about certain things,

402
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:31,590
but it was genuine at the time.

403
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,343
- That's understandable.

404
00:23:33,343 --> 00:23:34,560
- Sure.
(woman laughs)

405
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,160
I think it's commendable.
- It's very commendable.

406
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:42,960
(soft acoustic rock music)

407
00:24:00,687 --> 00:24:02,780
- [Justin] In the same way
that is often communicated

408
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,720
of you, this sort of like, departure.

409
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,760
- [David] Departure.

410
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,393
- Or stepping out.
- Yep.

411
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,680
- Those words don't connect emotionally

412
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:16,510
with what you believe or
feel like is a place for you

413
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:18,240
in a broader cultural context.

414
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,830
- I don't believe in the Resurrection,

415
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:22,490
I don't believe in the fall, I
don't believe in the trinity.

416
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:24,030
I don't know if there is God at all,

417
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,780
but I know that document pretty well

418
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:30,550
and I see a thread in
it that one could follow

419
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:33,330
and the fruit of one's
life and one's community

420
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:34,763
and everything would be
something really different

421
00:24:34,763 --> 00:24:37,270
that what we see in America.

422
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,900
There is this thing that I think,

423
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,640
if we all pay a little closer attention,

424
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,090
could go better than it's
going and so if I can help,

425
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:44,330
then I'm gonna.

426
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:47,120
I am participating in a
larger Christian tradition.

427
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,260
That's what I was born into,
that's the language I know,

428
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,060
that's how I understand ethics.

429
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,617
I'm a son of Evangelical Christianity

430
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:57,280
and I'll never not be that.
(soft music)

431
00:25:04,582 --> 00:25:06,430
In high school, God was church.

432
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:08,240
And then once I got out of high school,

433
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,240
I realized that I wanted to
take my faith more seriously

434
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,150
and for me, that meant having a

435
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:16,810
more regular devotional time.

436
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:19,430
Reading more and more books, praying more.

437
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:22,390
I would try to spend an
hour or two every day

438
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:25,690
reading the Bible, doing some
Bible study devotional book,

439
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,940
praying, and trying to sin less.

440
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,890
To do Christianity in the most devoted

441
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:34,710
and thorough way that I knew how.

442
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,040
I always thought that I was gonna be

443
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,470
a pastor when I was growing up.

444
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:40,270
It was just in my head,
eventually I'll probably

445
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:43,090
be a pastor, like start a
church or something like that.

I started writing songs of my own.

456
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,950
And then when I started writing songs,

457
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,760
I thought that this is what I wanna do.

458
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,090

474
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,320
from Richmond, Virginia.

475
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,250
- [Sarah] Since the band's
inception, Pedro the Lion

476
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,570
has always towed the
line between indie rock

477
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:42,920
and Christian music.

478
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,060
One of the things that stands out to me

479
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,530
as I hear even some of
your very early work

480
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:48,000
as Pedro the Lion, a lot of these songs

481
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,950
are riddled with uncertainty and doubt

482
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,210
and criticism of religion.

483
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,280
And so this has been a
long process for you.

484
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,270
What do you think made the band

485
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:56,300
so successful in the early 2000s?

486
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,310
What is it that resonated with people?

487
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,570
- I don't totally know, but I can guess.

488
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:04,850
I think there is an
earnestness that I wrote with

489
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:09,330
and an openness with
which I sang about doubt

490
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,610
and faith at a time when I don't really

491
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:13,710
think that was going on much.

492
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:15,690
I think I did it in such
a way that it wasn't

493
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,900
slogans or trying to convert anybody.

494
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:21,050
It was just me trying to
process what was going on

495
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:25,061
inside my head, and I guess
that worked for some folks.

496
00:28:25,061 --> 00:28:30,061
♪ When I get to heaven ♪

497
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:35,399
♪ I'll be greeted warmly ♪

498
00:28:35,721 --> 00:28:40,721
♪ Surrounded by the angels ♪

499
00:28:41,327 --> 00:28:44,584
♪ As Jesus takes my hand ♪

500
00:28:44,584 --> 00:28:46,040
There was a sense early on that, like,

501
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,710
there's a version of Christianity that is

502
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:53,010
kind of pure and based on
scripture that the people

503
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,230
in the culture that I'm a part of

504
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:56,680
are just barely paying lip service to

505
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:01,030
and that was a lot to think
about forever until I was 28.

506
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:05,657
My thinking was more reform
the church, just be better.

507
00:29:10,064 --> 00:29:12,130
(audience cheering)

508
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:13,530
Thanks a lot.

509
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:16,170
There's a lot of different
factors that come to play

510
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:20,070
and have caused a pretty
severe ghetto of thought

511
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:23,370
and creativity and artistic expression

512
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:25,120
in the Christian church.

513
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,280
We should be creating things
that are risky and new,

514
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,060
attempting to sloganize the gospel I think

515
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:34,280
degraded it to the point of
making it the most unprofound

516
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,250
thing that there is so I
just encourage you guys,

517
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,017
throw off the shackles
of Christian culture

518
00:29:39,017 --> 00:29:43,671
and the Christian industry--
(audience cheers)

519
00:29:43,671 --> 00:29:47,350
And attempt to do something
that's not down or whatever.

520
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:50,900
I wanted to be able to
be a band that was on

521
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,880
general market record
labels and Tower Records

522
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,970
and play in clubs.

523
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:57,930
Not play churches, not
have my records distributed

524
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,310
on a Christian label
and not having them sold

525
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,840
only in Christian bookstores.

526
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,020
I wanted out of that subculture...

527
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,030
musically.

528
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:12,190
I wanted to just sink or swim by my merits

529
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:15,610
if I was allowed to do
that in the world at large.

530
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:17,220
When It's Hard to Find a Friend came out,

531
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,590
that's exactly what happened.

532
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:21,740
It got critical acclaim
and got played on the radio

533
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,140
and played in rock clubs with bands who

534
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,610
we didn't know from church.

535
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:28,360
That's exactly what I wanted
was just to be allowed

536
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:32,380
to be out of the bubble and just be,

537
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:35,123
and just hock my wares the best I could.

538
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,688
(audience clapping)

539
00:30:37,688 --> 00:30:40,849
Does anybody have any
questions at this point?

540
00:30:40,849 --> 00:30:44,128
- [Man] How important is Jesus to you?

541
00:30:44,128 --> 00:30:45,326
- That's like a private conversation.

542
00:30:45,326 --> 00:30:48,600
- I'm sorry man.
- That's all right.

543
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,600
I'm gonna ask for a different one, yeah?

544
00:30:53,703 --> 00:30:56,953
(soft, tinkling music)

545
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:06,010
It wasn't until after
high school that I really

546
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:10,210
had the bandwidth to start
to really take it seriously

547
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:11,680
and so then I went to Bible college

548
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:16,330
and just epiphany and
paradigm shift after epiphany.

549
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:19,460
And then some of these
deeper questions started

550
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,250
to come up where I had realized that I had

551
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:25,880
not ever evaluated the
fundamental truth claims

552
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,360
of Christianity and
that I was just sort of

553
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,010
rolling along with
these premises that were

554
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:33,840
un-sort-of-substantiated at the root

555
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,780
of my entire system of belief.

556
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:39,780
And I thought, well it makes
sense that if I'm gonna

557
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:42,530
really do this right, I
need to evaluate those.

558
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:45,630
The faithful response to them
is not to hide from them,

559
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:48,993
because these questions can't hurt God.

560
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:55,010
I certainly was reading the Bible a bunch,

561
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:58,140
like trying to read it like
I had never seen it before

562
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,870
where I didn't have a
bunch of assumptions.

563
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:02,540
But I was just like, really reading it,

564
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:05,900
and so as I mulled it over more and more,

565
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:10,270
it just seemed less
and less likely that...

566
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,800
That the picture of
God that I has accepted

567
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,083
from Christianity was true.

568
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:25,010
I think hell was one of
the first things to go,

569
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:28,060
and errancy followed pretty soon after.

570
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,283
Original sin came up pretty quick.

571
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:36,330
Moving from assuredness to anything else,

572
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:37,860
no matter what it is, is,

573
00:32:40,605 --> 00:32:41,805
is pretty destabilizing.

574
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:47,780
At that point in time, the way
that my faith had developed

575
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:50,430
and the way that God
functioned in my brain,

576
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:51,550
it was the same as me.

577
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:55,530
I mean, it was like this
God was inside of me

578
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:58,920
and knew me intimately,
knew all of my thoughts.

579
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:03,037
I was losing this tremendous
resource, a friend,

580
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:09,003
a confidant, somebody who
made my identity what it was.

581
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,100
While I was doing all that processing

582
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:22,040
and falling away in kind of slow motion,

583
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,673
I would have the impulse to
like, pray to God about it.

584
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:29,580
And then other times,
I felt the strong need

585
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:32,360
to just guard myself against any kind

586
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:37,190
of sentimentality or God, really,

587
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,590
and so then I would do that.

588
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,990
Sometimes both things would
happen in the same day.

589
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:50,810
There were a few moments,
one of which I was in church

590
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:52,880
and it was Christmastime
and we were singing

591
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,880
all of these really rad,
old hymns, Christmas carols,

592
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,870
and I was doing the work.

593
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:04,530
Like, you know, one stanza of lyrics,

594
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:06,940
I would sing and I would think to myself,

595
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:09,030
I believe that, that's real.

596
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,453
And the next stanza,

597
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,350
you know I was doing like a line item veto

598
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:16,240
of these songs and really doing the work.

599
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,180
Just sitting there and
engaging and wrestling with it,

600
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:21,760
and it was cathartic and it felt like,

601
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,970
it felt right to me, and then I sat down

602
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:29,060
and the guy who was speaking
spoke and I hated him.

603
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:34,060
I hated every moment of, it
was just so unserious to me.

604
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:37,170
It was like pandery and
just was the epitome

605
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:39,220
of what I wasn't interested in.

606
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,667
I'm sort of wrestling with
this and then he says,

607
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:43,520
"Okay, now we're gonna take communion."

608
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,020
And I thought, I can't take communion.

609
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:49,610
I'm so not in community with this.

610
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:53,900
Like, I've just sat here
and judged it so negatively

611
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,890
for 30 minutes.

612
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:58,980
I hadn't been to church,
more or less, for years,

613
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:02,130
but I had never not taken communion.

614
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:06,310
And I had just, as they
started passing out the omens,

615
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:07,470
I just stood up and left.

616
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:08,933
I just, I can't.

617
00:35:08,933 --> 00:35:11,970
I just told my wife, I was
like, "I'm gonna be in the car."

618
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:14,230
And what I did was I walked down to a bar

619
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:17,370
and had a shot and a beer and kind of had

620
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:19,800
my own little communion ceremony.

621
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,653
And then we went to lunch and I just,

622
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:26,640
I stayed in the car and just
sobbed for like 40 minutes

623
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,580
and then met them in lunch,
it was already going.

624
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:34,470
And I was devastated, I just thought,

625
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:35,540
it felt like...

626
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,600
Yeah, it was gradual, but
there were these moments

627
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,660
where there was big shifts.

628
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:47,967
And that was one.

(wind blowing)
(soft music)

645
00:39:00,783 --> 00:39:02,790
I think I continued to
kind of wrestle with it

646
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:05,070
for a long time, and in
some ways, I still do.

647
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:07,880
I mean, you know, God ridden me of God,

648
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,250
it's a powerful idea.

649
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,743
And was it just the false,

650
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,430
you know, deity that I was shedding,

651
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:19,110
and there's a real deity

652
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:23,100
that looks totally different in the

653
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,320
nooks and crannies somewhere?

654
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,156
In the dark matter, you know?

655
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:28,239
I don't know.

656
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,970
It feels impossible most of the time,

657
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:35,633
but sometimes, so yeah,
it was very painful.

658
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:38,960
The loss and the grieving
and all that stuff

659
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,623
were really pretty real and profound.

660
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,960
Particularly when I attempted to suspend

661
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:55,710
my belief that God
existed, I didn't know that

662
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,670
it was happening at the time,

663
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,930
but only could kind of put it together.

664
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:03,873
But man, that habit of drinking,

665
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,683
as much as we were,

666
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:14,490
was real bad.

667
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:16,910
It was a dissonance, I think, that my mind

668
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:17,743
just couldn't deal with.

669
00:40:17,743 --> 00:40:20,940
I was just looking to
get, I was just looking

670
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,797
to lose time, I just wanted to,

671
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:26,713
to blackout for a while....

672
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:33,140
As confused as it was, even at the time,

673
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,640
my identity was still based a lot on

674
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,500
some form of my faith.

675
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,630
- [Marianne] Some of your
songs now that you talk about

676
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:42,993
as being more autobiographical,
talk about drinking.

677
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,450
How is that sort of path gone?

678
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:47,370
I mean, have you...

679
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:53,310
- Well, in Pedro the Lion...

680
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,740
Well, then let's talk about drinking.

681
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,600
- [Marianne] Yeah, maybe we should.

682
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,000
'Cause you've actually
made it a little bit

683
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,600
of a public issue.
But then you tend to make some of your

684
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,240
private stuff pretty public.
- Yeah.

685
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,243
- [Marianne] And, um...

686
00:41:10,243 --> 00:41:11,580
- Mhm.

687
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:16,580
These habits that, at the time,
weren't particularly dark,

688
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:21,260
but they were, then,
it just was that habit

689
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:24,010
was a place when things did
kind of turn a little dark.

690
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:30,900
Then, you know, drinking
15 or 20 a day wasn't

691
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:36,240
an expression of all the good
things that we were feeling.

692
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,100
It turned into an expression of all of

693
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,803
the bad things that we were feeling.

694
00:41:41,385 --> 00:41:45,120
(soft, melancholy music)

695
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,650
On that tour, I think,
was the moment when things

696
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:49,010
really started to shift.

697
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:51,653
My drinking was at kind of an apex.

698
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,251
We haven't checked in yet.

699
00:41:55,251 --> 00:41:56,312
We're in the band Pedro the Lion,

700
00:41:56,312 --> 00:41:58,254
we checking in right now.

701
00:41:58,254 --> 00:42:00,322
- [Man] Oh man, this is crazy.

702
00:42:00,322 --> 00:42:01,240
- [David] I can't believe that not even,

703
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,309
I mean, Cody's the only
one that's been here.

704
00:42:03,309 --> 00:42:05,060
- I've never been here.

705
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,230
- You know I've never seen this one.

706
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:09,140
- And once we got onto
the festival grounds,

707
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:11,890
I switched to a jug that I had prepared,

708
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:15,330
poured like a third of the
water out of this gallon jug

709
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:16,970
and filled it up with vodka.

710
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:18,790
We had to be to the
festival grounds because

711
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:20,420
I had an interview and
it was with this guy,

712
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,750
Andrew Beaujon, who was writing a piece

713
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,072
for the Washington Post.

714
00:42:24,072 --> 00:42:29,905
Whatever you want.
There's the uh, they're short
of the hospitality trait.

715
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:31,120
I mean, he's a grown person.

716
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,980
He could tell a drunk
person when he sees one,

717
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:36,930
and he also could tell
that I was drinking out of

718
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:39,310
a water jug that was a lot of vodka, so,

719
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:42,270
that was part of the texture
in his piece was that.

720
00:42:43,657 --> 00:42:46,160
And so, later I think,
once the piece came out,

721
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,850
maybe a week or two later,
that was when Cornerstone

722
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:50,650
realized that I had been on the grounds

723
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:54,145
and I was hammered and
drinking on the grounds,

724
00:42:54,145 --> 00:42:55,695
and that's expressly forbidden.

725
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:04,000
In a way, I have, I'm
living a double life.

726
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,720
I mean, I have these two
very different spheres

727
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,863
that I'm existing in
at almost equal times.

728
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:12,161
- [Ann] Who is that?

729
00:43:12,161 --> 00:43:13,483
- Is it all the way zoomed?

730
00:43:18,635 --> 00:43:20,741
- [Ann] Who is that Eleanor?

731
00:43:20,741 --> 00:43:23,574
(Eleanor babbles)

732
00:43:25,417 --> 00:43:28,640
- There was a lot of room for me out here,

733
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,650
especially if I'm on solo tours

734
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,490
and I'm staying in hotels.

735
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:34,130
You know, after the show is over,

736
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:36,250
after I've done my job for the day,

737
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:38,950
there's five or six hours that I just have

738
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:42,290
completely to myself,
and so that was a factor.

739
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:44,740
Like I would just go back to the hotel

740
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:46,990
with a bottle of booze
and a six pack of beer

741
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:51,223
and kind of say good
night while I was still

742
00:43:51,223 --> 00:43:53,350
a little bit reasonable.

743
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:55,173
No one even knew about it.

744
00:43:56,521 --> 00:43:59,480

until I just was passed
out and throwing up.

750
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,330
There was no voice in my head that said

751
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:27,260
it's time to stop tonight.

752
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:30,970
I had really crossed a line that made Ann

753
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:32,380
feel pretty unsafe.

754
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:37,160
She was scared for my safety and my life,

755
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:42,050
so she got really upset and
asked that I stop drinking

756
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,183
for a time or whatever.

757
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,790
And I was getting ready to leave on tour

758
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:53,283
and I remember it being really hard.

759
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:00,003
And I did call her and say,

760
00:45:01,087 --> 00:45:04,280

Once I was able to kind
of make some peace with

774
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,650
leaving Christianity and just being myself

775
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:26,163
and owning my own thoughts,

776
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:30,483
the really intense,

777
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:36,410
sort of seed of that
compulsion to get blacked out

778
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,300
just kind of went away and then I was just

779
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:44,290
a guy with a drinking problem.

780
00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:48,123
But it wasn't this hopeless
spiral that it had been.

781
00:46:49,236 --> 00:46:51,620
And that's taken a lot of years to sort of

782
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:56,080
negotiate with, that, you
know, maybe somebody else

783
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,670
would've just stopped
drinking all together.

784
00:46:57,670 --> 00:47:02,360
I did not do that, but yeah,
it's not a problem anymore.

785
00:47:12,932 --> 00:47:15,349

Trump over the top in Indiana

00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:14,710
The question is, now that Kasich and Cruz

792
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:17,700
are out of the race, will
Republican evangelical voters

793
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:20,723
coalesce around Trump
in the general election?

794
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,707
- Hi.
- Hi again.

795
00:48:23,707 --> 00:48:25,012
- Thanks for having me back.
- Yeah.

796
00:48:25,012 --> 00:48:26,916

804
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:16,929
- [David] Hi, hi, hi.

805
00:49:16,929 --> 00:49:18,647
You guys wanna talk about anything?

806
00:49:18,647 --> 00:49:19,480
- I have a question.
- Yeah?

807
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:22,160
- [Woman] Do you realize
the amount of people

808
00:49:23,382 --> 00:49:26,192
that are recovering evangelicals?

809
00:49:26,192 --> 00:49:28,187
How do you feel about that,
that kind of follow you?

810
00:49:28,187 --> 00:49:30,080
- And the answer to that
question could be kind

811
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,800
of loaded, like yeah, everybody needs to

812
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,400
stop being Christian or whatever, but,

813
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,150
I certainly don't feel that way.

814
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:38,100
So people who are allowed to sort of land

815
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,510
where their brains
really are in their life

816
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:42,720
and in their kind of view of the world,

817
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,660
it just makes me happy.

818
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:46,840
I feel like history, as
it's unfolding everyday,

819
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:49,200
it's forcing a lot of people to really

820
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,357
pay closer attention to
what's going on in the world.

821
00:49:52,357 --> 00:49:54,370
And how their faith relates to that

822
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:56,170
and how their faith
relates or doesn't relate

823
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:58,350
to the teachings of the thing that they

824
00:49:58,350 --> 00:50:01,633
ostensibly ave faith in.
(soft music)

825
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:08,300
I didn't want to write "Curse
Your Branches" like it was

826
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:11,020
but what came out was
all these tunes about

827
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:12,820
can the pot say to the potter,

828
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:14,561
why have you made me this way?

829
00:50:14,561 --> 00:50:16,820
And it wasn't until people
started talking to me

830
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:18,750
about how they understood the record

831
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:20,710
that I realized what was really there.

832
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:21,970
You know, there were a lot more people

833
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:24,760
in that gray area than
I thought were there.

834
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:29,083
It was one of the 10 best
records in Christianity Today,

835
00:50:29,083 --> 00:50:32,410
and I just, it blew my mind.

836
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:35,880
- Now I'm in my mid-30s
and I know that there

837
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:39,710
is a large generation for
which you spoke to that kind of

838
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:44,710
spiritual space that was hard
for many of us to express

839
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:48,350
really clearly and succinctly.

840
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:52,590
So I'm curious how you
recognize your place, kind of,

841
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:55,727
in that space in this
big transition that many

842
00:50:55,727 --> 00:50:58,377
of us are going through.

843
00:50:58,377 --> 00:51:00,700
And we find you on tour yet again.

844
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:03,480
- I sing these songs in people's houses

845
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,350
and at rock clubs and things and

846
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:10,140
officially that's what I have to offer,

847
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:13,420
and Twitter rants, you know.
(audience laughs)

848
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:14,330
Here's what I would say to that,

849
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:16,840
I feel like the little things that we do

850
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,210
that we don't think matter,
I think the evidence is

851
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:21,740
all around us, that
especially when we kind of

852
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:25,680
fudge those things, it matters, you guys.

853
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,130
How do collapses like the one

854
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:30,170
we're experiencing now
of judgment, happen?

855
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:33,203
It's those lapses in the little things.

856
00:51:34,134 --> 00:51:35,180
You pee on the seat and you don't

857
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:39,250
wipe it up in a public space?
(audience laughs)

858
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:42,247
The aggregate is computing,
you know what I'm sayin'?

859
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,620
Everybody's still suffering.

860
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:46,580
Why so much suffering?

861
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:47,413
It's unnecessary.

862
00:51:47,413 --> 00:51:49,690
We have the resources to not suffer

863
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:52,491
if we just wipe the seat.

864
00:51:52,491 --> 00:51:54,908
(soft music)

865
00:51:56,357 --> 00:52:00,115
(people chattering)

866
00:52:00,115 --> 00:52:03,450
- I went from a solidly
Pat Robertson Christian

867
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:06,920
to a liberal, 'cause I'm
gay, I came out 10 years ago.

868
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:10,190
To an agnostic, to a
full on atheist humanist.

869
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:12,433
So, it's been a long journey.

870
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,333
- You're welcome.

871
00:52:14,333 --> 00:52:15,403
- I miss church.
- Yeah.

872
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:19,540
- But I won't go back to
a church that tells me

873
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:20,860
that I have to believe in something

874
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:25,520
that's beyond nature or
that is condemning of things

875
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,690
that I know aren't bad.
- Right, are not bad, yeah.

876
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:30,110
- It was a spiritual nourishment,

877
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:32,180
and if I had this every week,

878
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:33,380
not necessarily from you.
- Yeah, right.

879
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:34,703
From various places.
- But just in general,

880
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:39,604
I would be a more invigorated human being.

881
00:52:39,604 --> 00:52:42,220
- So then that's how you reconcile, like,

882
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:44,250
what you're doing with what you're doing,

883
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:46,950
is by touching people
and talking like this.

884
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:48,000
- [David] Yeah, yeah.

885
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:51,100
- [Man] Yeah, I'll be a
more active human being

886
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,936
because of what I experienced tonight.

887
00:52:52,936 --> 00:52:53,769
- That's all I wanted.

888
00:52:53,769 --> 00:52:55,640
Hey.
- Hey, thank you, thank you.

889
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,144
- Thank you so much, I
really appreciate it.

890
00:52:57,144 --> 00:52:59,240
- Yeah, thank you for coming, cheers.

891
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,730
- Come back sometime.
- All right.

892
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:02,320
- You're doing good work.
- Thank you so much.

893
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,270
- [Man] I'm sure you know.

894
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:04,413
I hope you know.

895
00:53:06,828 --> 00:53:10,078
(soft, tinkling music)

896
00:53:15,748 --> 00:53:16,898
- [Nils] No, not exactly.

897
00:53:16,898 --> 00:53:20,748
No, not exactly.
(David chuckles)

898
00:53:20,748 --> 00:53:21,595
- [Ann] What is it then?

899
00:53:21,595 --> 00:53:24,770
- Almost exactly.
- Measure it.

900
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:26,500
- Sometimes there's music in the world,

901
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,060
there's a lot of music
that when you hear it,

902
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:30,380
it's possible to think that everything

903
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:33,850
is okay with the world and I don't want my

904
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:35,540
music to be like that.

905
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:37,290
I feel like when you hear my music,

906
00:53:38,672 --> 00:53:40,840
even if you really enjoy
it and are sort of like

907
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:44,260
lifted up by it, that there
should be some sense of like,

908
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:46,510
there's a wrinkle in
there that means, like,

909
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:48,260
it's the Men in Black, or whatever.

910
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:51,650
Until everything is okay with the world,

911
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:54,330
there's always gonna be
that wrinkle in there

912
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:58,300
that it's just not, it's not
okay to give the impression

913
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:00,463
that everything is fine, like half mast.

914
00:54:02,357 --> 00:54:05,607
(soft, tinkling music)

915
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:10,970
The values that I think are what

916
00:54:10,970 --> 00:54:14,490
makes Christianity worth while are missing

917
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:16,950
from the politics, it's just not there.

918
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:20,570
And that's compassion and care for poor

919
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:22,540
and people who can't care for themselves.

920
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:25,650
All of the minor Prophet
books and the Old Testament

921
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:28,850
are about God getting
mad at Israel because

922
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:30,380
they have forgotten their obligation

923
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:32,163
to the poor and to justice.

924
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,900
They're theoretically connected to this

925
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:38,800
source of power and wisdom and love that

926
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,400
would be able to help them come out on

927
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,740
the right side of a lot of this stuff.

928
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:47,760
On Jesus side of a lot of this stuff.

929
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,201
But it's not working, so.

930
00:54:51,201 --> 00:54:53,890
And it's there, right
there, for people to see

931
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:57,136

- [Woman] It was an election for the ages.

947
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:11,720
Donald Trump broke all the old rules

948
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,960
of presidential politics
and made an almost

949
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,990
clean sweep of the American rust belt.

950
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:17,500
A lot of different kinds of people

951
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,160
helped elect Donald Trump.

952
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,080
White working class voters, yes,

953
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,760
but also some Hispanics, white women,

954
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,150
and an overwhelming number of

955
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:27,080
white Evangelical Christians.

956
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,740
About 80% of white evangelicals voted

957
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:32,830
for President Donald Trump,
despite Trump's three marriages,

958
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:34,490
his anti-immigrant rhetoric,

959
00:56:34,490 --> 00:56:36,560
and accusations of sexual harassment

960
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,430
and assault from multiple women.

961
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:41,320
The continued alignment of
many leading evangelicals

962
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:43,680
with Trump has caused some to question

963
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,973
whether their movement has lost its way.

964
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:51,620
- If there's any question that we've been

965
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:54,260
doing Christianity fundamentally wrong

966
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:56,920
in the United States
for our entire history,

967
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,630
I don't think that
there, if there ever was,

968
00:56:58,630 --> 00:56:59,750
there just can't be none.

969
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:04,190
In the face of this cry
from the black population

970
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:07,860
that again, you guys, it isn't fixed yet.

971
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:10,983
And the response from
Christianity is Donald Trump?

972
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:17,040
It's, it's pure sadness.
(tense, dramatic music)

973
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:24,060
Until the election, I
was under the impression

974
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:27,939
that the white American
church was not a lost cause.

975
00:57:27,939 --> 00:57:31,320
I thought I saw it maturing and evolving

976
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:34,303
and even if I couldn't
participate as a believer,

977
00:57:35,332 --> 00:57:38,910
I wanted to be a helper in
that process if I could.

978
00:57:38,910 --> 00:57:42,820
But the fruit that showed
up on the tree was,

979
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:45,760
for me, very much the
cut the damn thing down

980
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,090
and throw it in the fire kind of fruit.

981
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:52,193
It's not a pruning issue,
it's just the wrong seeds.

982
00:57:54,690 --> 00:57:56,910
I've heard so many people say
that no matter what happens,

983
00:57:56,910 --> 00:57:58,150
I'm not changing my mind.

984
00:57:58,150 --> 00:58:00,363
It's all worth that Supreme Court seat.

985
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:04,890
It represents only abortion to them and

986
00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:08,450
if somebody believes the
ends that they're going for

987
00:58:08,450 --> 00:58:12,400
justify the means that
they're using to get there,

988
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,380
that is idolatry.

989
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:17,530
I mean, most of Christianity is apparently

990
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:19,123
cool with that way of thinking.

991
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:25,570
For everything Christians
claim to believe,

992
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:29,760
the election, I think, laid
bare what they actually believe.

993
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,210
They reliably work
against the best virtues

994
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:34,930
of their traditions.

995
00:58:34,930 --> 00:58:37,860
The people that taught me
how to be a decent person are

996
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:38,933
losing their minds.

997
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,320
That's where I came from, and so it just

998
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:46,693
hit like another deconversion experience.

999
00:58:48,410 --> 00:58:51,303
I don't totally know how to proceed still.

- How are the kids?

1045
01:03:02,137 --> 01:03:03,540
- The kids are doing great.

1046
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:06,137
Seven year old decided that last week

1047
01:03:06,137 --> 01:03:08,071
he'd ride a two wheeler by himself

1048
01:03:08,071 --> 01:03:11,277
without training wheels.
(audience cheers)

1049
01:03:11,277 --> 01:03:13,320
We waited a long time for that.

1050
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:15,075
- [Woman] Were you there for that?

1051
01:03:15,075 --> 01:03:16,653
- Nope.
(audience laughs)

1052
01:03:16,653 --> 01:03:19,900
It's okay, here's my theory on that:

1053
01:03:21,064 --> 01:03:22,997
I just want it to happen.

1054
01:03:22,997 --> 01:03:26,260
I don't have to be there for it,

1055
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:29,157
although it's important that
he knows how excited I am,

1056
01:03:29,157 --> 01:03:30,263
and I think he does.

1057
01:03:32,104 --> 01:03:33,258
(soft music)

1058
01:03:33,258 --> 01:03:34,480
- [Ann] Yeah it's feeling, um,

1059
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:37,130
this one's feeling long to me.

1060
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:37,963
- [David] Yeah.

1061
01:03:38,918 --> 01:03:43,344
- Like kind of, I don't
know if it's just 'cause,

1062
01:03:43,344 --> 01:03:45,670
I don't know if we're just tired.

1063
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:48,780
We're gonna go up to Art
Darlington art show today.

1064
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:51,470
Gloria's got stuff on display.

1065
01:03:51,470 --> 01:03:53,997
- Oh yeah, she's really
good at that stuff.

1066
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:57,247
- [Ann] Well I'm gonna take them first.

1067
01:03:58,310 --> 01:03:59,590
- All right.

1068
01:03:59,590 --> 01:04:01,450
- [Woman] Talk to you later.

1069
01:04:01,450 --> 01:04:03,867
- I love you.
- Love you, bye.

1070
01:04:04,884 --> 01:04:07,301
(soft music)

1071
01:04:18,684 --> 01:04:21,486
(child chattering)

1072
01:04:21,486 --> 01:04:23,593
All right, shug, let's see you start here.

1073
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:29,913
Yes.
(soft music)

1074
01:04:37,266 --> 01:04:42,266
Hurray.
(soft music)

1075
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:51,350
How do you start?

1076
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:55,123
Two hands.

1077
01:04:56,662 --> 01:04:58,222
There you go.

1078
01:04:58,222 --> 01:04:59,072
How do you start?

1079
01:05:02,290 --> 01:05:03,850
Leg over, uh huh.

1080
01:05:08,182 --> 01:05:11,265
Uh huh.
(soft music)

1081
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:17,187
Now take off.

1082
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:23,510
Okay, stay to the right.

1083
01:05:23,510 --> 01:05:25,817
Stay to the right, you got it.

1084
01:05:27,130 --> 01:05:29,547
(soft music)

1085
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:54,560
- The sands are just racing
through the hourglass.

1086
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:58,180
Eleanor, she lives in
our house for 18 years,

1087
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:00,600
like she's two thirds of the way there.

1088
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:04,810
And I've been gone for half
of it, and it's not okay.

1089
01:06:04,810 --> 01:06:06,760
It's not getting easier.

1090
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:07,963
It's getting worse.

1091
01:06:11,150 --> 01:06:12,800
The cracks are showing all over.

1092
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:15,773
I have to rework this whole thing.

1093
01:06:17,430 --> 01:06:19,640
And I'm looking at all this
time that I've put into

1094
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:21,580
these musical relationships that I've had

1095
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:23,110
with people that just haven't worked out

1096
01:06:23,110 --> 01:06:25,280
for one reason or another.

1097
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,610
And honestly, with all
the good and all the

1098
01:06:27,610 --> 01:06:32,040
fun and joy that I
experienced with that stuff,

1099
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:35,600
it feels like I'm trading
that fun and that joy

1100
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:38,103
and whatever benefit that was for

1101
01:06:38,103 --> 01:06:40,200
the fun and joy that I could
have been having with my family

1102
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,430
because if I just had
never invested in that,

1103
01:06:42,430 --> 01:06:45,213
I would be only out 75 days of the year.

1104
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:48,100
I would've been able to
work with Nils on his

1105
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:50,490
batting the first year that
he was in little league

1106
01:06:50,490 --> 01:06:51,710
where he didn't get a hit.

1107
01:06:51,710 --> 01:06:54,160
I could've helped more, but
I couldn't 'cause I was gone.

1108
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:57,290
I didn't realize I was trading that for

1109
01:06:57,290 --> 01:07:00,560
driving my daughter to swim
every morning like I have

1110
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:02,720
in certain summers where we just have

1111
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,500
this really sweet time.

1112
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:07,570
And her getting to kind of be herself.

1113
01:07:07,570 --> 01:07:10,360
You know, I'm out here on I-95 again

1114
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,473
instead of doing that.

1115
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:16,283
I like it out here, but not that much.

1116
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:20,784
(soft, melancholy music)

1117
01:07:25,210 --> 01:07:28,340
My wife and I are growing old and we're

1118
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:30,823
only growing old together half way.

1119
01:07:32,150 --> 01:07:33,883
That doesn't feel very good to me.

1120
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:46,090
I wasn't all wrong, but
there was a miscalculation.

1121
01:07:49,488 --> 01:07:54,488
Yeah.
(soft, melancholy music)

1122
01:08:26,954 --> 01:08:31,954

I can take full
responsibility in what happens

1141

Oh.

1161
01:12:17,536 --> 01:12:19,000
- [Eleanor] Hey dad, do you have money?

1162
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,450
I'm gonna go get mom and pretzel and just

1163
01:12:20,450 --> 01:12:23,053
have a few bites of it 'cause I'm hungry.

1164
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,269
- [David] You want a couple of corn nuts?
Are you doing all right?
- Not right now.

1165
01:12:27,269 --> 01:12:29,167
- All right, good.
- I have gum.

1166
01:12:29,167 --> 01:12:30,817
- [David] Great, good to hear it.

1167
01:12:31,925 --> 01:12:33,792
Get back over to your spot.

1168
01:12:33,792 --> 01:12:36,070
- [Child] Let me hear your music voice.

1169
01:12:36,070 --> 01:12:39,112
- [David] Okay, I'll play it right now.

1170
01:12:39,112 --> 01:12:41,523
- [Child] Okay.
- [David] On your mark, get set.

1171
01:12:42,822 --> 01:12:44,380
(child laughs)
Do you hear it?

1172
01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:47,270
- No.
- Oh man, it's so good.

1173
01:12:47,270 --> 01:12:49,680
(children laughing)

1174
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:52,140
Hey, sit down you guys.

1175
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:53,690
That was my fault coach, sorry.

1176
01:12:56,990 --> 01:12:59,990

1177
01:13:01,272 --> 01:13:04,060
Almost.
(clapping)

1178
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:06,460
Oh man.
- Good try, Nils.
- I love that guy.

1179
01:13:06,460 --> 01:13:09,010
He's always the last out
when the bases are loaded.

1180
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:10,873
Poor guy.

1181
01:13:12,802 --> 01:13:15,802

1185
01:13:40,963 --> 01:13:41,796

01:13:43,202 --> 01:13:46,785

01:14:04,699 --> 01:14:08,282
(Ann and David chattering)

1189
01:14:10,906 --> 01:14:13,656
(birds chirping)

1190
01:14:18,186 --> 01:14:20,603
(soft music)

1191
01:14:23,055 --> 01:14:25,000
- [Ann] Go ahead and go.

1192
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,670
- When I stopped drinking, I started to be

1193
01:14:27,670 --> 01:14:31,573
able to see myself more clearly
and the things around me.

1194
01:14:32,610 --> 01:14:37,050
Right away, I was aware of a
very overwhelming loneliness

1195
01:14:37,050 --> 01:14:42,050
and I realized that my
native spot as a human

1196
01:14:42,420 --> 01:14:45,760
was behind the wheel of
a car, on an interstate,

1197
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:48,390
somewhere in the United States, alone.

1198
01:14:48,390 --> 01:14:51,610
If you just picked any
moment in my life at random,

1199
01:14:51,610 --> 01:14:54,108
the odds were that that was
what I was going to be doing.

1200
01:14:54,108 --> 01:14:56,491
♪ I climb the rock ♪

1201
01:14:56,491 --> 01:15:00,139
♪ Still make my home ♪

1202
01:15:00,139 --> 01:15:02,910
That was the basic unit of my career.

1203
01:15:02,910 --> 01:15:06,930
It all reverted back to,
I play solo house shows.

1204
01:15:06,930 --> 01:15:11,690
And solo house shows were
amazing in the sense that

1205
01:15:11,690 --> 01:15:14,730
I could interact with
fans in a totally new way

1206
01:15:14,730 --> 01:15:17,200
and to continue to do this work

1207
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:19,113
while I've been figuring this out.

1208
01:15:22,337 --> 01:15:24,754
(soft music)

1209
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:36,140
And so I was looking
down the barrel of just

1210
01:15:36,140 --> 01:15:38,690
kind of doing the back half of my life

1211
01:15:38,690 --> 01:15:43,623
as a solo traveler primarily
and that killed me.

1212
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:50,130
Sitting with that just
really brought me to my

1213
01:15:50,130 --> 01:15:52,360
lowest place that I had been.

1214
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:54,060
I hit bottom, basically.

1215
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:59,060
In 2016, I'm on tour playing
these club shows solo.

1216
01:16:01,950 --> 01:16:04,140
It just caused me to start
asking myself questions,

1217
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:05,810
like okay, well then what's it gonna be?

1218
01:16:05,810 --> 01:16:07,420
Like, if you had a million bucks,

1219
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:08,690
it's kind of like that question.

1220
01:16:08,690 --> 01:16:10,962
Like okay, if you could
anything, what would it be?

1221
01:16:10,962 --> 01:16:12,580
And it's like, I wanna be in a band.

1222
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:15,090
That's what I've always wanted to do.

1223
01:16:15,090 --> 01:16:17,990
I love playing solo but that wasn't what

1224
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:18,823
I set out to do.

1225
01:16:18,823 --> 01:16:21,570
You know, when I sat and
dreamt of what I wanted to do,

1226
01:16:21,570 --> 01:16:24,490
I didn't picture myself alone in a car.

1227
01:16:24,490 --> 01:16:26,900
I didn't picture myself alone on a stage.

1228
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:30,170
It was drums and it was bass
and it was electric guitar

1229
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:32,460
and that's what I wanted.

1230
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:34,795
That's what I've always wanted to do.

1231
01:16:34,795 --> 01:16:37,628
(soft rock music)

1232
01:16:43,410 --> 01:16:46,450
I asked myself, what's the
way that you have access

1233
01:16:46,450 --> 01:16:49,070
to right now, to do the band thing?

1234
01:16:49,070 --> 01:16:51,270
And I realized when I
was a kid how I did it

1235
01:16:51,270 --> 01:16:53,360
was I wrote the drum
parts and the guitar parts

1236
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:55,520
and the bass parts and I wrote the vocals

1237
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:59,583
and I had people play them.
(soft rock music)

1238
01:17:00,874 --> 01:17:04,533
♪ I saw in your bedroom ♪

1239
01:17:04,533 --> 01:17:08,843
♪ The drawers had been emptied ♪

1240
01:17:08,843 --> 01:17:11,670
I had to return to the process that I knew

1241
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:14,800
and that I had been
personally successful with.

1242
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:17,910
That's where I had come
from and so I thought, okay,

1243
01:17:17,910 --> 01:17:19,360
I gotta find my way back to that.

1244
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:23,313
And it was a revelation, it
was just like riding a bike.

1245
01:17:25,370 --> 01:17:28,000
It felt like home.

1246
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,660
It also felt a lot like Pedro the Lion

1247
01:17:31,495 --> 01:17:34,220
and it occurred to me, oh, this is Pedro.

1248
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:37,630
And as soon as that clicked,
it really felt like home.

1249
01:17:37,630 --> 01:17:41,383
Like a bunch of myself
just came right back to me.

1250
01:17:42,515 --> 01:17:44,932
(soft music)

1251
01:17:56,270 --> 01:17:59,410
Everything clicked into
place and I had a vision

1252
01:17:59,410 --> 01:18:02,340
for the future of the
way that the band sounded

1253
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:04,950
and for the way that
the shows were gonna go.

1254
01:18:04,950 --> 01:18:07,470
I had people around who
were willing to do a band

1255
01:18:07,470 --> 01:18:08,560
like that with me.

1256
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:11,860
Coincidentally, Pedro the Lion,
because it was a brand name

1257
01:18:11,860 --> 01:18:14,540
that I had developed for a
decade and that people knew,

1258
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:18,930
would allow me to go out on
tour and play fewer shows

1259
01:18:18,930 --> 01:18:20,580
and make a similar living.

1260
01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:24,170
Instead of being six weeks on,
six weeks off all year round,

1261
01:18:24,170 --> 01:18:25,940
I could be three weeks on tour

1262
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:28,930
and 10 weeks home and do
that four times in a year.

1263
01:18:28,930 --> 01:18:31,050
That would revolutionize my life

1264
01:18:31,050 --> 01:18:34,760
and my ability to connect with my family.

1265
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:36,520
- [Man] A little less, check check.

1266
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:37,353
That's fine.

1267
01:18:37,353 --> 01:18:38,441

1268
01:18:38,441 --> 01:18:40,350
Anyone have any questions?

1269
01:18:40,350 --> 01:18:42,657
Well thank you for being here, enjoy.

the KEXP live room right now.

1280
01:19:04,780 --> 01:19:05,613
- Absolutely.

1281
01:19:05,613 --> 01:19:07,494
So you have reformed?

1282
01:19:07,494 --> 01:19:08,800
- Yeah.
- This is exciting.

1283
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:09,830

and 19, and 20, and beyond, I'm sure.

1288

1289
01:19:21,510 --> 01:19:23,090

(audience cheers)

1322
01:21:23,090 --> 01:21:26,967
And this is very nearly the
20th anniversary of a show,

1323
01:21:28,340 --> 01:21:32,010
my very first club show ever in Seattle,

1324
01:21:32,010 --> 01:21:37,010
here at The Tractor, in 1997.
(audience cheers)

1325
01:21:40,890 --> 01:21:43,023
Any questions at this point in the show?

1326
01:21:44,620 --> 01:21:45,453
What's that?

1327
01:21:45,453 --> 01:21:46,680
- [Woman] Are you going to
do more living room shows?

1328
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:48,070
- There will be more living room shows,

1329
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:49,480
but it will be a minute

1330
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:55,080
because we're trying to
do a thing where I make

1331
01:21:56,370 --> 01:22:01,370
a slightly better living
and stay home more also.

1332
01:22:01,735 --> 01:22:04,568
(audience cheers)

1333
01:22:06,740 --> 01:22:11,413
No, I only tell jokes from
stage when I'm blackout drunk,

1334
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:16,310
and uh, not tonight.
(audience laughs)

1335
01:22:16,310 --> 01:22:19,050
I've done that for years
on end and that wasn't

1336
01:22:19,050 --> 01:22:21,060
as cool as this, I don't think.

1337
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:22,740
- How do you like your band?
- For real.

1338
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:24,388
What's this?
- How do you like you band?

1339
01:22:24,388 --> 01:22:25,240
How do you like playing with a band?

1340
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:28,653
- Well, playing with a band
really feeds my soul, man.

1341
01:22:29,790 --> 01:22:32,490
All these shows sold real quick

1342
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:35,393
and that was really fun for us,

1343
01:22:36,350 --> 01:22:41,350
because we didn't know
what was gonna happen.

1344
01:22:42,220 --> 01:22:44,310
And uh, thank you so much.

1345
01:22:44,310 --> 01:22:45,810
I'm really glad to be back playing

I still find myself
reaching out for something.

1369
01:24:48,020 --> 01:24:50,720
It really doesn't feel
like my consciousness

1370
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:52,560
is a closed system.

1371
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:54,060
Things feel connected somehow.

1372
01:24:56,030 --> 01:25:00,753
And I don't know, I don't
know why or how come,

1373
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:04,350
but I know what it feels
like and it doesn't

1374
01:25:04,350 --> 01:25:06,340
feel like a closed system.

1375
01:25:06,340 --> 01:25:07,940
So I don't know what that means.

1376
01:25:09,333 --> 01:25:10,430
At a certain point, I thought,

1377
01:25:10,430 --> 01:25:13,870
what if the divine is just
balance and harmony itself?

1378
01:25:13,870 --> 01:25:18,870
That in harmony, that's where
you experience transcendence.

1379
01:25:19,130 --> 01:25:21,950
Whatever metaphysical reality is that

1380
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:24,150
is the thing that's
happening all around us.

1381
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:29,213
Harmony is wanting to be had.

1382
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:32,460
Ways of interacting with other humans

1383
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:34,970
just waiting to be unlocked.

1384
01:25:34,970 --> 01:25:38,100
And in a way, crying out to be unlocked.

1385
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:41,790
Justice just waiting to be balanced.

1386
01:25:41,790 --> 01:25:45,240
I've had impulses to put
a name on it at times

1387
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:47,470
