00:00:57,068 --> 00:00:58,927
- Hello.

00:00:59,118 --> 00:01:02,033
Is Bilal. I'm in France at Calais. 

5
00:01:02,068 --> 00:01:03,380
Mine is?

00:01:03,461 --> 00:01:05,239
No, not in school. 

7
00:01:05,341 --> 00:01:06,756
How late? 

8
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,303
Mina back to that time? 

9
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,800
- At 5:00, I think. 
- At 5. 

10
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:14,479
- Good morning, my son. 
- Good morning. 

11
00:01:15,038 --> 00:01:17,094
<i> Mirko? </ i> 

12
00:01:26,914 --> 00:01:28,735
I can not speak, 
my father arrived. 

13
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:30,236
Call you back. 

14
00:01:30,243 --> 00:01:33,093
Do not call here anymore. 
Write down my phone. 

15
00:01:34,716 --> 00:01:36,861
No, no phone. 

16
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,727
<i> 00 ... 44 ... 78 ...</ i>

18
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:47,920
Tell your sister 
I'm in Calais ... 

19
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:50,706
I'll take a boat 
tonight or tomorrow morning. 

20
00:01:51,154 --> 00:01:53,154
I'll be in London tomorrow night. 

21
00:01:53,418 --> 00:01:55,517
Sure, but do not call it here. 

22
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,426
But going to tell her, right? 

23
00:01:57,555 --> 00:01:59,234
Yes Bye. 

24
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,162
- He took the bread? 
- No, I forgot. 

25
00:02:02,837 --> 00:02:05,597
- Who was that? 
- Nobody. A friend. 

26
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,158
Please! Please! 

27
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,227
- Where is the entrance to the port? 
- Afghanistan. Not understand. 

28
00:02:38,848 --> 00:02:42,368
- The entrance to the port? 
- Why? Where to go? 

29
00:02:42,465 --> 00:02:44,444
- England. 
- England? 

30
00:02:45,536 --> 00:02:47,553
He was invited by the Queen? 

31
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,108
- Where is it? 
- There, 1 km. 

32
00:02:51,197 --> 00:02:53,630
Take the first class. 
Better! 

33
00:03:02,542 --> 00:03:04,482
Take, good profit, enjoy the site! 

34

Enjoy! 

35
00:03:11,678 --> 00:03:13,730
And you're cold? 

36
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:44,440
- In the queue!

37
00:03:44,636 --> 00:03:46,877
- Not filling.

38
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:51,964
Stop! Enough! 
You go back there. 

39
00:03:53,465 --> 00:03:57,637
You, stand in line, no 
please, where are you? 

40
00:03:58,231 --> 00:03:59,559
Zoran? 

41
00:03:59,628 --> 00:04:00,952
Go to the queue. 

42
00:04:00,953 --> 00:04:02,265
He is a friend! 

43
00:04:02,266 --> 00:04:04,677
- It Mosul. 
- I do not care. 

44
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:06,540
Koban, is a friend! 

45
00:04:06,608 --> 00:04:08,360
- What are you doing here? 
- And you? 

46
00:04:09,045 --> 00:04:10,893
His mother told me 
I was in London, 

47
00:04:10,957 --> 00:04:12,729
you called, I was fine. 

48
00:04:12,863 --> 00:04:14,707
Was not to worry. 

49
00:04:14,957 --> 00:04:16,641
Since when are you here? 

50
00:04:19,178 --> 00:04:21,290
Two and a half months. 

51
00:04:21,805 --> 00:04:23,765
I three months. 

52
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,203
- Do you have money to go through? 
- I'm under a truck. 

53
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:30,900
- I do not need a middleman. 
- Here, you take the dogs. 

54
00:04:30,991 --> 00:04:34,363
And to enter the trucks, 
we need a middleman. 

55
00:04:34,851 --> 00:04:36,808
- How much did they ask? 
- 500. 

56
00:04:37,156 --> 00:04:38,845
Euros? 
Just to go? 

57
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:42,301
Yes, if I borrow, 
I paid in London. 

58
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,406
And trains? The tunnel? 

59
00:04:46,314 --> 00:04:49,330
Yes! I held down 
a train, in Albania. 

60
00:04:49,635 --> 00:04:51,322
Here, the trains go to 160. 

61
00:04:51,596 --> 00:04:54,603
Those who tried 
the train passed over. 

62
00:04:59,407 --> 00:05:04,814
Hello! You're new! 
Just get? 

63
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,239
- Yes 
- When you arrived? 

64
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:08,918
Today, now. 

65
00:05:08,998 --> 00:05:10,319
What is your name? 

66
00:05:10,497 --> 00:05:11,830
Bilal. 

67
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:13,809
- Good luck! 
- Thank you. 

68
00:05:14,442 --> 00:05:16,810
- Good night. 
- Good night. 

69
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:20,857
- And the boats? 
- What, boats? 

70
00:05:21,234 --> 00:05:22,914
Fishing boats, the sailing ... 

71
00:05:23,295 --> 00:05:24,722
We can not steal one? 

72
00:05:24,831 --> 00:05:27,302
There are police everywhere, in the port. 

73
00:05:27,515 --> 00:05:29,058
And the boats are tied. 

74
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,600
The only solution 
is the middleman. 

75
00:05:33,887 --> 00:05:37,759
For me, there are only a 50 Euros. 
I love you I return in London ... 

76
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,027
So? Can I borrow? 

77
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:54,748
- We can cross tomorrow? 
- I see. I return, I promise. 

78
00:05:59,221 --> 00:06:01,325
Is there a telephone nearby? 

79
00:06:04,001 --> 00:06:06,615
Aran! 

80
00:06:08,815 --> 00:06:10,143
Where? 

81
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:11,810
England! 

82
00:06:11,823 --> 00:06:13,202
One minute, 10 euros. 

83
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:20,336
At Pizza Hut, 
are looking for couriers. 

84
00:06:21,677 --> 00:06:24,514
You do not know the streets. 
You have to know them. 

85
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,673
Yes, I know. 

86
00:06:32,438 --> 00:06:35,231
If I say ... 
Osborne Road, as you get there? 

87
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:37,767
Eye on the map. 

88
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:40,770
Must have the map in the head. 

89
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,413
I turn around. 

90
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,952
It is always better 
to dive in the Indian Ocean. 

91
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:50,592
Eat your meat well. 

92
00:06:53,358 --> 00:06:55,185
Amed Darashia. 

93
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,592
The part of whom? 

94
00:07:02,795 --> 00:07:05,101
Mirko ... Bilal. 

95
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,269
You can not eat in peace! 

96
00:07:10,448 --> 00:07:12,310
I told you not to call here! 

97
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:15,785
Your phone does not respond. 
Mine is? 

98
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:18,128
She can not talk. 
My father is here! 

99
00:07:19,435 --> 00:07:20,874
You want? 

100
00:07:22,812 --> 00:07:24,202
You too? 

101
00:07:35,575 --> 00:07:36,887
Who is Bilal? 

102
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:38,830
A friend. 

103
00:07:53,491 --> 00:07:54,799
Who is it? 

104
00:07:59,969 --> 00:08:01,649
The son of Kayani. 

105
00:08:05,032 --> 00:08:06,717
What does he want? 

106
00:08:37,676 --> 00:08:41,061
Must breathe through the hole 
canvas, due to CO2. 

107
00:08:41,371 --> 00:08:43,468
When I say, 
go into hiding ... 

108
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:47,740
Keep this in mind, 
and breathe in there. 

109
00:08:47,841 --> 00:08:49,779
Quiet, shut up! 

110
00:08:55,605 --> 00:08:58,289
Okay, I'm going to sleep! 

111
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,979
Come! Fast! 

112
00:10:26,802 --> 00:10:29,502
- All right? 
- I hurt myself. 

113
00:10:49,366 --> 00:10:51,595
Place the bag on your head!

Hurry!

00:12:24,155 --> 00:12:26,887
Will make us pick up, you idiot!

126
00:13:08,016 --> 00:13:09,328
Papers. 

127
00:13:09,627 --> 00:13:11,551
License. 

128
00:13:19,446 --> 00:13:20,770
Where from? 

129
00:13:20,876 --> 00:13:22,497
Pelzni. Czech Republic. 

130
00:13:25,953 --> 00:13:27,276
What? 

131
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:41,446
Make him shut up, gonna get us. 

132
00:13:49,661 --> 00:13:53,373
- What are you taking? Vessels? 
- There are people in there! 

133
00:13:54,238 --> 00:13:56,087
There are some people! 

134
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:02,686
You know how much it will cost you! 
Open the door! 

135
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:05,220
Where's your friend? 

136
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,000
Damn! Son of a bitch! 

137
00:14:10,233 --> 00:14:12,100
Stop, Koban! Stop! 

138
00:14:16,038 --> 00:14:18,522
Everybody out! Come! 

139
00:14:23,675 --> 00:14:25,571
Eyaz! 

140
00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:28,107
Eyaz! 

141
00:14:29,055 --> 00:14:31,146
Everybody out! 

142
00:14:52,682 --> 00:14:55,281
All this, it is your fault, stupid! 

143
00:14:55,438 --> 00:14:57,130
You owe me 500 Euros! 

144
00:14:57,211 --> 00:14:58,539
Silence! 

145
00:14:58,714 --> 00:15:00,242
Forget it! 

146
00:15:00,462 --> 00:15:02,231
Pay me or I'll kill you. 

147
00:15:02,232 --> 00:15:03,682
Know what I mean? Silence! 

148
00:15:05,752 --> 00:15:08,076
- Bathrooms, please. I am sick. 
- Come on! 

149
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,935
Kayani, K.. A.. Y.. A.. N.. I

151
00:15:24,652 --> 00:15:26,511
812. 

152
00:15:32,152 --> 00:15:34,871
Who is she? His girlfriend? 

153
00:15:37,151 --> 00:15:40,645
Answer is your girlfriend? Beautiful! 

154
00:15:40,724 --> 00:15:43,423
625 Euros and 40 cents, 
exempt from fees. 

155
00:15:44,548 --> 00:15:46,614
- Return. 
- And what else? 

156
00:15:46,815 --> 00:15:49,480
- Please. 
- Let go! Go! 

157
00:15:49,598 --> 00:15:51,347
Enough, Francis! 

158
00:15:51,975 --> 00:15:56,802
- Ready! 
- Enough! Next. Gathering all this. 

159
00:15:57,007 --> 00:15:59,194
- Next. 
- Collecting all. 

160
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:04,870
If next appears, Bilal Kayani. 

161
00:16:05,043 --> 00:16:08,151
Born on 8 December 1991 
Mosul, Iraq, 

162
00:16:08,321 --> 00:16:09,917
illegally entered the territory 

163
00:16:10,064 --> 00:16:12,005
and was arrested on 15 February 
when trying 

164
00:16:12,045 --> 00:16:14,193
embark clandestinely 
for the United Kingdom. 

165
00:16:14,201 --> 00:16:16,435
You admit the facts? 

166
00:16:17,758 --> 00:16:20,653
- Say yes. 
- Yes 

167
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:23,987
In accordance with the provisions 
for people 

168
00:16:24,004 --> 00:16:25,804
from countries at war, 

169
00:16:25,876 --> 00:16:28,424
you escape measures 
Extradition across the border. 

170
00:16:28,814 --> 00:16:31,971
But know that here will be taken 
stricter measures, 

171
00:16:32,171 --> 00:16:34,802
calling people like you 
return to their country of origin. 

172
00:16:34,924 --> 00:16:36,913
I did it right? 

173
00:16:39,761 --> 00:16:41,758
Since no 
offenders, 

174
00:16:41,832 --> 00:16:45,692
I will not hold it, 
but do not want to see him again. 

175
00:16:45,925 --> 00:16:49,097
I do not know what you said, but 
can not enter England. 

176
00:16:49,116 --> 00:16:53,132
Do not cross over, should return to 
his country to avoid serious problems. 

177
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,370
Sir, allow me to say that 

178
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,485
this child is less 
of age, and therefore 

179
00:16:57,529 --> 00:16:59,250
qualifies for a place 
a public school. 

180
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,131
You know very well that 
not where to go, 

181
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,960
let's not waste time 
with it, next case. 

182
00:17:04,961 --> 00:17:09,934
Cometh Bafaoua Malman. 

183
00:17:25,324 --> 00:17:26,686
Excuse me, ... 

184
00:17:27,624 --> 00:17:29,349
Calais? Is there? 

185
00:17:29,858 --> 00:17:31,442
Calais is there, yes! 

186
00:17:31,543 --> 00:17:32,905
Thank you. 

187
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:13,191
Come on, open your legs. So. 

188
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:16,118
Like a frog. 

189
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:22,635
Do not hold the line, please. 

190
00:18:24,816 --> 00:18:27,874
The line should not hold! 

191
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,260
Come on back to the legs. So. 

192
00:18:38,828 --> 00:18:40,748
Bend, stretch, and join. 

193
00:18:41,865 --> 00:18:44,825
Bend, stretch and join. 

194
00:18:44,826 --> 00:18:46,854
Again. 

195
00:18:48,389 --> 00:18:49,782
Soft, soft, soft. 

196
00:19:00,761 --> 00:19:03,552
- Sorry! 
- Yes? 

197
00:19:04,115 --> 00:19:07,687
- How much are the classes? 
- What? 

198
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:10,428
Classes. As the boy. 

199
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:12,468
Want to learn to swim? 

200
00:19:12,503 --> 00:19:15,086
Yes, the crawl. 

201
00:19:16,332 --> 00:19:18,785
A class, 15 euros. 

202
00:19:19,928 --> 00:19:22,880
- For an hour? 
- Half an hour. 

203
00:19:23,379 --> 00:19:26,692
And the package is 120 Euros. 

204
00:19:26,894 --> 00:19:28,438
For ten classes. 

205
00:19:29,146 --> 00:19:31,710
- Can we start now? 
- Not now! 

206
00:19:36,261 --> 00:19:38,897
Tomorrow afternoon. 2am. 

207
00:19:40,417 --> 00:19:41,786
2am, agree. 

208
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,207
Thank you. 

209
00:19:56,169 --> 00:19:57,889
Yes? 

210
00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:02,463
I said 15. Just a note. 

211
00:20:02,877 --> 00:20:05,025
Payment of 2 classes. 

212
00:20:10,445 --> 00:20:12,105
Where are you from? 

213
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:15,390
Iraq, sir ... Kurdistan. 

214
00:20:32,849 --> 00:20:35,430
Do not pay to stay 
calling, right? 

215
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,300
One moment! 

216
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,000
Hey, you! 

217
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,800
Only one call! 

218
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,800
Get out now! 

219
00:20:57,071 --> 00:20:59,061
Still owes me 500 euros. 

220
00:20:59,153 --> 00:21:00,457
Okay, let me! 

221
00:21:00,553 --> 00:21:02,581
You'll see if I let you! 

222
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:05,377
Tomorrow, without fail. 
Otherwise I will kill you. Idiot! 

223
00:21:48,654 --> 00:21:50,381
When I left Iraq, 

224
00:21:50,425 --> 00:21:52,426
Turkish soldiers captured me. 

225
00:21:54,136 --> 00:21:58,185
They tied my hands and put 
a black bag on my head. 

226
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,460
Left me with the bag for 8 days. 

227
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:20,957
You took a shower? 

228
00:22:26,608 --> 00:22:28,597
It smells like soap. 
Where did you shower? 

229
00:22:33,257 --> 00:22:35,512
Please! We have money ... 

230
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:39,700
- What is happening? 
- I called Marty. Not him. 

231
00:22:39,766 --> 00:22:41,437
Please, only one 
shower. We pay. 

232
00:22:41,685 --> 00:22:43,325
- No shower. 
- 10 minutes! 

233
00:22:43,352 --> 00:22:45,782
- I said no. Out! 
- Why? 

234
00:22:46,183 --> 00:22:48,783
Why yes, leave 
but call the police. 

235
00:22:49,293 --> 00:22:51,510
Is prohibited. It is 
a public toilet! 

236
00:22:51,762 --> 00:22:53,123
Out! 

237
00:22:53,734 --> 00:22:55,334
I came to class. 

238
00:22:55,418 --> 00:22:58,033
Ah Yes, the classroom, he paid! Out! 

239
00:22:59,401 --> 00:23:02,336
Now come on, out, out. 

240
00:23:03,837 --> 00:23:05,437
But tomorrow will be 50. 

241
00:23:05,598 --> 00:23:07,929
But your friends ... should never return. 

242
00:23:08,255 --> 00:23:10,302
If I see one here, learn 
swimming in the harbor! 

243
00:23:11,465 --> 00:23:13,361
Your ticket. 

244
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:34,310
Not good. 

245
00:23:34,811 --> 00:23:37,662
First, his head 
should be in the water. 

246
00:23:38,988 --> 00:23:41,142
Must blow into the water. 

247
00:23:41,684 --> 00:23:45,061
So ... one, two ... breathing. 

248
00:23:45,205 --> 00:23:47,687
Every three movements, 
you breathe. 

249
00:23:48,003 --> 00:23:49,514
Loud. So ... 

250
00:23:50,268 --> 00:23:53,067
Once the left ... 

251
00:23:53,275 --> 00:23:55,274
once on the right. 

252
00:23:55,499 --> 00:23:57,971
And blows into the water, mouth closed. 

253
00:23:58,406 --> 00:24:00,005
How to make bubbles. 

254
00:24:00,878 --> 00:24:05,028
Right? ... What is this? 

255
00:24:05,781 --> 00:24:07,293
Nothing. 

256
00:24:10,398 --> 00:24:12,650
Come on. Show me. 

257
00:24:32,201 --> 00:24:37,057
<i> ladies and gentlemen, we close in 
20 minutes, please go to the locker room. </ I> 

258
00:24:52,716 --> 00:24:54,113
Okay? 

259
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:58,027
No, the head is not going well, 
should breathe higher, 

260
00:24:58,124 --> 00:25:00,540
and feet too, but 
'll see about that tomorrow. 

261
00:25:00,636 --> 00:25:01,967
Time to leave. 

262
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:03,526
One more! 

263
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,398
Let's close! 

264
00:25:32,878 --> 00:25:34,486
Tomorrow at 2 hours? 

265
00:25:36,922 --> 00:25:38,346
How old are you? 

266
00:25:40,318 --> 00:25:42,018
17. 

267
00:25:45,024 --> 00:25:48,094
E. .. Why do you want both 
learn to swim? 

268
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,905
Come on, we are waiting to close. 

269
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,113
Simon! 

270
00:26:34,023 --> 00:26:36,319
Sorry, we are together. 

271
00:26:48,614 --> 00:26:49,998
You okay? 

272
00:26:50,002 --> 00:26:52,370
- And you? 
- Yes, waiting for the holidays! 

273
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,055
38.30 please. 

274
00:26:55,243 --> 00:26:57,260
- Wait, let me pay! 
- No, thanks. 

275
00:27:03,178 --> 00:27:04,769
Received the letter? 

276
00:27:05,434 --> 00:27:07,182
Judge ... I received yesterday. 

277
00:27:07,217 --> 00:27:08,617
It looked at the mail. 

278
00:27:09,938 --> 00:27:11,550
Attend the Thursday. 

279
00:27:13,655 --> 00:27:15,904
Thanks, bye. 

280
00:27:17,854 --> 00:27:19,614
I have to check my books, 

281
00:27:19,691 --> 00:27:21,486
I need them for my courses. 

282
00:27:21,955 --> 00:27:23,824
- Just a minute! 
- I said no. 

283
00:27:23,834 --> 00:27:27,446
- Only for food and water. 
- Come on, get out now! Let. 

284
00:27:28,268 --> 00:27:29,647
What did they do? 

285
00:27:29,708 --> 00:27:31,376
Why are prevented from entering? 

286
00:27:31,743 --> 00:27:34,072
Sorry, ma'am, but I do the 
my work. Come on, please. 

287
00:27:34,099 --> 00:27:36,853
- Do not answer me, what they did! 
- Come on, you can not talk to him. 

288
00:27:36,854 --> 00:27:39,595
Madam, please 
he only obeys orders. 

289
00:27:40,396 --> 00:27:42,159
Oh? Whose? We know? 

290
00:27:42,365 --> 00:27:44,518
Management, irritate customers. 

291
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:47,819
But do not bother us. 

292
00:27:48,716 --> 00:27:51,328
For you, madam, bother 
people to do their shopping? 

293
00:27:51,329 --> 00:27:53,991
Well, please let the 
customers in peace now. 

294
00:27:54,026 --> 00:27:56,637
Come on, get out now or 
call the police, right? 

295
00:27:59,097 --> 00:28:00,482
Bravo! 

296
00:28:05,644 --> 00:28:07,499
You obviously did not say anything! 

297
00:28:08,656 --> 00:28:10,836
Lowers his head and back 
home, is it? 

298
00:28:11,137 --> 00:28:14,485
What do you do? It's just not 
back here and ready. 

299
00:28:14,486 --> 00:28:16,065
- Gimme! 
- After. 

300
00:28:16,507 --> 00:28:19,575
You know what I mean when they 
prevent people from entering a store. 

301
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:21,711
Want me to buy 
a history book? 

302
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:24,882
What do you do? 

303
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:30,467
Annoy me, hatred of 
people and their indifference as well. 

304
00:28:36,001 --> 00:28:39,044
For books, I will after tomorrow 
tomorrow, I have proof. 

305
00:28:39,045 --> 00:28:40,872
I'll put them in a box. 

306
00:28:41,373 --> 00:28:44,685
You are good on Thursday, 
then go to court? 

307
00:28:45,001 --> 00:28:46,719
Yeah, okay. 

308
00:28:48,822 --> 00:28:52,711
We'll see after tomorrow, 
after school. 

309
00:28:55,074 --> 00:28:57,666
I have a small office 
the apartment, if you agree. 

310
00:28:58,303 --> 00:28:59,956
Yes, of course. 

311
00:29:02,884 --> 00:29:04,908
Go to your home? 

312
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:07,170
I'm having dinner with Alain. 

313
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,287
Give a hug for me! 

314
00:29:23,551 --> 00:29:25,247
Here it is. 

315
00:30:43,146 --> 00:30:44,564
Okay? 

316
00:30:49,843 --> 00:30:52,337
One must be very good swimmer 
to cross the English Channel. 

317
00:30:52,345 --> 00:30:53,896
Did you know? 

318
00:30:56,318 --> 00:30:59,697
It is ten o'clock at least, to cross. 
Understand? 

319
00:31:02,165 --> 00:31:04,324
And the water is 10 degrees 

320
00:31:04,461 --> 00:31:07,741
Think you can swim 10 hours 
in water at 10 degrees? 

321
00:31:10,456 --> 00:31:11,791
Know what I mean? 

322
00:31:12,721 --> 00:31:15,232
- Yes! 
- So? 

323
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:19,251
Pay for classes, sir. 

324
00:31:21,666 --> 00:31:25,505
OK, swim! ... Let's swim! 

325
00:32:13,612 --> 00:32:15,259
Where you going? 

326
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,607
Where you going? 

327
00:32:19,379 --> 00:32:21,075
Port. 

328
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,700
Come. 

329
00:32:24,416 --> 00:32:25,716
I know him. 

330
00:32:25,916 --> 00:32:27,216
Come! 

331
00:32:35,343 --> 00:32:36,677
Thank you. 

332
00:32:42,492 --> 00:32:44,376
He also wants to go to England? 

333
00:32:44,723 --> 00:32:46,671
England, yes. 

334
00:32:46,672 --> 00:32:50,390
You took a bath, ... had 
told not to take bath. 

335
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:52,642
Does what I say. 

336
00:33:13,479 --> 00:33:16,658
- We hope you? 
- Come on. 

337
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:19,498
Come, come. 

338
00:33:45,985 --> 00:33:49,145
- Do you like pizza? 
- Yes 

339
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:53,925
Sit! 

340
00:34:11,438 --> 00:34:13,826
Seven degrees tomorrow. Not good for swimming. 

341
00:34:13,866 --> 00:34:16,382
- You? 
- Yes 

342
00:34:18,455 --> 00:34:20,201
- You are a champion? 
- No. 

343
00:34:20,923 --> 00:34:23,148
What would you drink? 
Wine, beer, water? 

344
00:34:23,268 --> 00:34:24,620
Beer, yes. 

345
00:34:24,918 --> 00:34:26,227
Water for me. 

346
00:34:26,324 --> 00:34:27,783
Gold, Lord? 

347
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:29,805
Gold medal? 

348
00:34:29,806 --> 00:34:32,640
Yes .. Leave it ... 
Come on, sit down. 

349
00:34:41,635 --> 00:34:43,932
How long 
need to come from Iraq? 

350
00:34:45,815 --> 00:34:48,420
- Three months. 
- Three months. 

351
00:34:50,472 --> 00:34:52,415
- Walking the walk? 
- Yes 

352
00:34:55,373 --> 00:34:58,777
- He fled because of war? 
- Thank you. 

353
00:35:00,128 --> 00:35:02,274
Send money 
for our families. 

354
00:35:06,212 --> 00:35:09,193
And sure you will find 
a job in England? 

355
00:35:09,287 --> 00:35:10,980
A job, yes ... 

356
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:18,224
His brother works in a 
supermarket in London. 

357
00:35:18,691 --> 00:35:20,267
He found a job. 

358
00:35:21,238 --> 00:35:22,556
And you? 

359
00:35:23,727 --> 00:35:25,028
Find. 

360
00:35:25,919 --> 00:35:27,267
What do you do? 

361
00:35:28,318 --> 00:35:29,680
Football. 

362
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,527
Want to play football in England? 

363
00:35:33,963 --> 00:35:37,131
Yes, there are good clubs. 

364
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,613
I'll find a way inside. 

365
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:42,729
He, good player. Quick ... 

366
00:35:42,901 --> 00:35:44,274
Bazda! 

367
00:35:45,595 --> 00:35:48,044
In Mosul, call me bazda. 

368
00:35:48,356 --> 00:35:49,803
The corridor. 

369
00:35:49,821 --> 00:35:51,189
Bazda? 

370
00:35:51,845 --> 00:35:53,766
Yes, bazda. The corridor. 

371
00:35:54,823 --> 00:35:57,356
In my house, I have many 
trophies too. 

372
00:35:57,661 --> 00:35:59,057
Ten, maybe. 

373
00:35:59,608 --> 00:36:00,927
You are a champion, then. 

374
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:08,271
My favorite club is Manchester. 

375
00:36:08,306 --> 00:36:11,168
- Manchester United ... know? 
- Yes! 

376
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:16,126
Beckham, Ronaldo ... 
They are the best. 

377
00:36:16,135 --> 00:36:18,072
I try to play there. 

378
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:38,046
Forget the idea of crossing the swim. 

379
00:36:39,919 --> 00:36:41,900
Only good swimmers do. 

380
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:45,420
In the summer, with a good team ... 

381
00:36:45,549 --> 00:36:47,252
and a boat to follow it. 

382
00:36:49,074 --> 00:36:50,527
And a year of training. 

383
00:36:50,633 --> 00:36:52,586
Impossible for you. 
It's too far. 

384
00:36:53,384 --> 00:36:56,001
The water is very cold, 
strong currents. 

385
00:36:57,437 --> 00:36:58,905
Understand? 

386
00:37:00,163 --> 00:37:04,056
Large cargo ships. 
300 meters long. 

387
00:37:04,955 --> 00:37:06,487
One every 10 minutes. 

388
00:37:07,031 --> 00:37:10,609
And you, so small, 
alone, in front of them. 

389
00:37:11,573 --> 00:37:14,962
- Understand? 
- Yes, sir. 

390
00:37:16,936 --> 00:37:19,706
This evening you can sleep here. 
Your friend also. 

391
00:37:19,776 --> 00:37:21,765
- But not tonight. 
- Thank you. 

392
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:26,307
Come help me, do not be 
arms crossed 

393
00:37:33,902 --> 00:37:36,198
Push the table ... the table. 

394
00:37:58,672 --> 00:38:00,483
Ready. 

395
00:38:01,284 --> 00:38:03,722
Thanks ... Thank you. 

396
00:38:03,958 --> 00:38:06,361
And do not say "thank you" 
all the time, is annoying. 

397
00:38:10,143 --> 00:38:11,744
The bathrooms are there. 

398
00:38:11,937 --> 00:38:15,669
- Let them clean, ok? 
- Yes .. Yes 

399
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,987
- Good night. 
- Good evening, thank you. 

400
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:48,512
What is this shit you're doing? 

401
00:39:49,245 --> 00:39:53,113
Sorry ... I try 
used to the bag. 

402
00:39:53,114 --> 00:39:54,501
What? 

403
00:39:57,665 --> 00:40:00,780
If you want to kill 
go do it somewhere else, ok? 

404
00:40:02,262 --> 00:40:06,742
What do you want? 
Get out of here, enough. 

405
00:40:07,631 --> 00:40:09,614
In that I got with you? 

406
00:40:09,837 --> 00:40:14,426
Sorry, I try to keep the bag 
head for the trucks. 

407
00:40:15,437 --> 00:40:17,644
Go to bed alone 
or want to help! 

408
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:21,778
Trucks for England. 

409
00:40:22,915 --> 00:40:25,000
To control CO2. 

410
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:26,618
We have to stay with the bag. 

411
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:31,898
I could never, sir. 

412
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:33,482
Never. 

413
00:40:54,602 --> 00:40:57,507
- You do not have your keys? 
- Maybe she was not alone! 

414
00:40:57,708 --> 00:40:59,096
Who wants me to be? 

415
00:41:01,235 --> 00:41:03,649
- Want a coffee? 
- No, I have time. 

416
00:41:08,186 --> 00:41:09,565
- Here, take mine. 
- Thank you. 

417
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:11,612
Was arranging the books. 

418
00:41:26,195 --> 00:41:27,850
Who? 

419
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:31,589
- Good morning. 
- Good morning. 

420
00:41:33,676 --> 00:41:35,012
Are the guys that helped. 

421
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:38,843
My wife, Marion. 

422
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:45,879
What are you doing here? 

423
00:41:46,144 --> 00:41:49,904
Nothing, go to the pool, 
take a bath. 

424
00:41:49,905 --> 00:41:53,068
- It will take these, too? 
- No, only Whitman. 

425
00:41:53,608 --> 00:41:55,113
They are in his house since when? 

426
00:41:55,114 --> 00:41:57,362
I do not know, 3 or 4 days, maybe. 

427
00:41:57,363 --> 00:42:00,294
They were frozen out, I felt sorry. 

428
00:42:05,351 --> 00:42:06,872
We're leaving. 

429
00:42:09,859 --> 00:42:11,565
Bye. See ya. 

430
00:42:12,466 --> 00:42:15,945
- Where are you from? 
- Iraq, ma'am. Kurdistan. 

431
00:42:16,246 --> 00:42:17,546
Thank you. 

432
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,800
Thank you. 

433
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:32,837
Are kind of crazy, great! 

434
00:42:32,838 --> 00:42:34,444
Want to go swimming there. 

435
00:42:34,445 --> 00:42:35,745
Where? 

436
00:42:35,746 --> 00:42:39,134
England. So, I'm training. 

437
00:42:42,917 --> 00:42:44,849
For the office, 
how? 

438
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:49,927
I do not know ... let it now. 
Come back another day. 

439
00:42:52,189 --> 00:42:54,332
For that, Simon? 

440
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:56,886
For nothing! 

441
00:43:01,333 --> 00:43:02,670
Yes? 

442
00:43:04,722 --> 00:43:10,675
Yes .. why? No. .. yes. 

443
00:43:21,878 --> 00:43:24,153
You know you can have 
problems doing this? 

444
00:43:24,371 --> 00:43:26,185
- What? 
- With its Kurds! 

445
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:29,073
Of course not. The only problem 
I have, is you. 

446
00:43:29,074 --> 00:43:32,333
- No, Bruno is down there, leave. 
- We will not fight for so little. 

447
00:43:32,334 --> 00:43:36,748
You can hurt your back. 
You can take my keys and open? 

448
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,372
- Hello 
- Hello 

449
00:43:54,721 --> 00:43:56,729
And the office, 
when will we see? 

450
00:43:57,012 --> 00:43:59,179
I do not know, Saturday morning, 
is good for you? 

451
00:44:01,779 --> 00:44:03,252
- Bye. 
- Bye. 

452
00:44:11,401 --> 00:44:12,868
What? 

453
00:44:14,718 --> 00:44:16,909
- Took a few Kurds in his house. 
- What? 

454
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:19,444
Ah, yes, I saw two out. 

455
00:44:19,445 --> 00:44:21,455
Does he know that 
they risk doing this? 

456
00:44:23,457 --> 00:44:24,820
I do not know. 

457
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,011
What nonsense! 

458
00:44:36,077 --> 00:44:38,327
Turn, I'm sorry. 

459
00:44:42,052 --> 00:44:45,253
Yes .. here it is. 

460
00:44:48,474 --> 00:44:50,039
We received this from the barracks. 

461
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:53,520
Tuesday, February 18, 
19:10, Plaza de Armas. 

462
00:44:53,521 --> 00:44:56,506
A vehicle of the Renault Clio Gray, 

463
00:44:56,559 --> 00:44:59,303
5433 RS 62 plate is yours? 

464
00:44:59,499 --> 00:45:02,161
- Maybe, I do not know. 
- Yes, it's yours. 

465
00:45:02,196 --> 00:45:05,956
Loading 2 suspects; 
probably immigrants. 

466
00:45:05,957 --> 00:45:07,457
Can you confirm? 

467
00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:10,171
What? 

468
00:45:10,172 --> 00:45:11,919
Have them collected. 

469
00:45:13,449 --> 00:45:15,520
And why? I'm suspicious of what? 

470
00:45:15,521 --> 00:45:18,785
Helping people 
Illegal is a crime. 

471
00:45:18,786 --> 00:45:20,619
Where did it take? 

472
00:45:21,082 --> 00:45:23,588
Are you saying that you can not 
help people, is it? 

473
00:45:23,589 --> 00:45:26,177
For these people, no, 
more than 500 today in 

474
00:45:26,178 --> 00:45:28,257
coast seeking a 
way to cross to England. 

475
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:29,558
They arrive every day. 

476
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:32,535
I pay for 
the city does not become 

477
00:45:32,536 --> 00:45:34,335
a camp 
illegal immigrants. 

478
00:45:34,336 --> 00:45:36,882
- So I ask another ... 
- What does this have to do with me? 

479
00:45:38,044 --> 00:45:40,187
Is not I who bring them here. 

480
00:45:40,688 --> 00:45:42,849
No, but if you help them reach more. 

481
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:45,310
We have strict rules for the 

482
00:45:45,311 --> 00:45:47,871
Calaisianos not start 
to help these people. 

483
00:45:47,872 --> 00:45:51,775
So I ask again, 
led them to where? 

484
00:45:53,902 --> 00:45:55,517
Cinema. 

485
00:45:57,485 --> 00:45:59,078
Went to see what? 

486
00:46:00,293 --> 00:46:03,256
British film, so 
become accustomed to the language. 

487
00:46:04,593 --> 00:46:08,688
Knee, elbow! Come on, ladies. 

488
00:46:11,075 --> 00:46:12,381
Hello, sorry for the delay. 

489
00:46:12,382 --> 00:46:13,825
- Can I continue to want to ... 
- No, that's fine. 

490
00:46:13,879 --> 00:46:16,479
Gentlemen Good morning. 

491
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:23,579
Come for the abs now. 
A float under each arm. 

492
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:26,014
Lie on back, 
raise your legs up high, 

493
00:46:26,015 --> 00:46:28,618
and count to 10. Let. 

494
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:32,654
1 ... 2 ... 3 ... 

495
00:46:32,655 --> 00:46:37,022
4 ... 5 ... 6 ... 

496
00:46:37,023 --> 00:46:41,690
7 ... 8 ... 9 ... 10 

497
00:46:41,875 --> 00:46:45,610
Again! 1 ... 2 ... 

498
00:46:47,795 --> 00:46:51,334
In fact, I would like to continue, 
I have to do something now. 

499
00:46:58,705 --> 00:47:03,644
Come with me. Come, come ... come. 

500
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:10,572
Simon, I, listen, I thought well, not 
should leave these people in your home. 

501
00:47:10,897 --> 00:47:14,665
No idea where you're getting into, 
police guard around the world. 

502
00:47:14,698 --> 00:47:17,144
They do everything to get us, so 
not hurt hot meals and clothing. 

503
00:47:17,229 --> 00:47:19,484
<i> On Monday morning 
got a volunteer who had </ i> 

504
00:47:19,485 --> 00:47:21,921
<i> refugees in his house 
you risk 5 years in prison. </ i> 

505
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:23,722
<i> is the price, now you know? </ i> 

506
00:47:23,723 --> 00:47:25,811
So there will be more 
a burden to you. 

507
00:47:25,849 --> 00:47:27,816
Judges do not relax with it. 

508
00:47:27,941 --> 00:47:30,767
I do not know what I wanted to prove 
with it, but now comes. 

509
00:47:30,872 --> 00:47:32,792
Receive them in your home 
was very good, very 

510
00:47:32,793 --> 00:47:35,304
generous, but must stop 
it now, even. 

511
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:37,285
Good morning, everyone, sit down. 

512
00:47:39,205 --> 00:47:41,964
I can not say more now. 
Promise you'll stop it? 

513
00:47:41,965 --> 00:47:43,265
Yes 

514
00:47:44,755 --> 00:47:47,852
- A hug. 
- Me too. 

515
00:47:48,753 --> 00:47:51,753
Simon! Simon! 

516
00:48:01,803 --> 00:48:05,186
Are you done? ... Very good! 

517
00:48:06,593 --> 00:48:08,088
Many chains! 

518
00:48:08,152 --> 00:48:09,501
Get it now? 

519
00:48:09,586 --> 00:48:11,322
Impossible. I told you! 

520
00:48:12,321 --> 00:48:13,966
Good costume. Not cold. 

521
00:48:13,967 --> 00:48:17,502
My nose is not cold, is blue! 
An hour and is already blue. 

522
00:48:17,843 --> 00:48:19,354
I have towels. 

523
00:48:26,544 --> 00:48:28,693
Want to go there for a girl? 

524
00:48:30,321 --> 00:48:31,759
Yes 

525
00:48:38,975 --> 00:48:40,582
Mina. 

526
00:48:43,782 --> 00:48:45,894
I met three years ago. 

527
00:48:46,606 --> 00:48:48,839
Is the sister of a friend. 

528
00:48:48,872 --> 00:48:50,442
A friend of football. 

529
00:49:11,184 --> 00:49:12,984
Is beautiful. 

530
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,456
Very pretty. 

531
00:49:17,597 --> 00:49:19,977
His father works in England 
long. 

532
00:49:21,429 --> 00:49:23,326
He got a visa for 6 months. 

533
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:26,485
She knows that you go there? 

534
00:49:27,716 --> 00:49:33,053
Yes, but I could not talk to her 
since I left Iraq. 

535
00:49:36,535 --> 00:49:37,942
Take, call her. 

536
00:49:37,999 --> 00:49:39,491
- No, no, thanks. 
- Yes, call her. 

537
00:49:39,534 --> 00:49:40,874
No, seriously. 

538
00:49:41,033 --> 00:49:42,944
I'll call from a payphone. 

539
00:50:02,372 --> 00:50:04,053
Where to go? 

540
00:50:04,195 --> 00:50:06,920
- At the center? 
- Yes 

541
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,768
Has power everywhere? 

542
00:50:19,774 --> 00:50:22,332
- What? 
- The currents in the channel? 

543
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:23,773
Everywhere, yes. 

544
00:50:36,807 --> 00:50:42,083
Mr. Calmato by mutual agreement, put 
income from the apartment in his name. 

545
00:50:42,084 --> 00:50:45,045
In the absence of children ... 

546
00:50:45,046 --> 00:50:49,261
it is not a pension 
or a custody agreement. 

547
00:50:49,262 --> 00:50:53,656
Remains the provision compensatory 
on which you agree 

548
00:50:53,657 --> 00:50:57,483
that there was great 
income gap between the two 

549
00:50:57,518 --> 00:50:59,563
and therefore there is no need. 

550
00:50:59,564 --> 00:51:01,584
Is there anything more 
to add, lawyer? 

551
00:51:01,585 --> 00:51:02,923
No, Your Honor. 

552
00:51:02,924 --> 00:51:06,417
- Madam: ... Lord? ... 
- No. 

553
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:32,851
- Aspirin. Take. 
- Thank you. 

554
00:51:39,492 --> 00:51:41,365
How do you feel? 

555
00:51:43,034 --> 00:51:44,780
Over, then. 

556
00:51:46,488 --> 00:51:47,788
Sad. 

557
00:51:51,592 --> 00:51:53,160
No longer use your ring? 

558
00:51:56,551 --> 00:51:58,842
I can not find it, 
For months I look for 

559
00:51:58,843 --> 00:52:01,870
I do not know what I did with him, 
looked everywhere. 

560
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,840
Anyway, that ring 
means nothing now. 

561
00:52:09,072 --> 00:52:11,685
- I finished my turn, I can charge? 
- Let. 

562
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:17,331
Sorry, be right back. 

563
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:26,197
What made her the Kurds? 

564
00:52:28,107 --> 00:52:30,171
We did a test at sea, fared well. 

565
00:52:32,602 --> 00:52:35,356
We must place greater emphasis on training, 
but soon will be ready. 

566
00:52:36,377 --> 00:52:38,908
And then, I will train others, and more 

567
00:52:38,909 --> 00:52:43,521
other, is not very complicated, you know? 

568
00:52:46,222 --> 00:52:48,389
This summer, I double the pace. 

569
00:52:52,339 --> 00:52:55,707
- Madness! 
- Here. Thanks 

570
00:53:04,197 --> 00:53:09,612
Know why he wants to cross? 
To find your girlfriend. 

571
00:53:09,709 --> 00:53:11,544
He walked 400 km to go back to find it. 

572
00:53:11,724 --> 00:53:13,840
And now you want to cross the 
English Channel, swimming! 

573
00:53:17,297 --> 00:53:21,848
I, when you left, I was not able to 
cross the street to reach you. 

574
00:55:00,333 --> 00:55:03,710
What are you doing? Slept here? 

575
00:55:03,931 --> 00:55:05,323
Sorry, sir. 

576
00:55:05,384 --> 00:55:08,009
But you do not understand anything! 
You want me to hold again! 

577
00:55:08,253 --> 00:55:09,649
The door was locked. 

578
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:12,130
No, I do not want to hear anything, 
out of here already! 

579
00:55:13,585 --> 00:55:16,230
I do not want to see more here. 
Right? Right? 

580
00:55:16,685 --> 00:55:18,606
- What are you doing here? 
- He will. 

581
00:55:19,146 --> 00:55:23,738
Slept here? Shit, that abuse! 
Not want a coffee, too? 

582
00:55:23,832 --> 00:55:25,910
That's enough, do not fret for so little. 

583
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,615
Marion gone. 

584
00:56:35,122 --> 00:56:37,879
What happened here? 
Where is everybody? 

585
00:56:37,915 --> 00:56:42,770
The police came again, threw gas 
tear, held 2 or 3 and went. 

586
00:56:43,267 --> 00:56:44,899
Just to keep them from eating. 

587
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,604
- Can you help? 
- Yes 

588
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:52,573
- And the children, where are they? 
- Scattered throughout the forest. 

589
00:56:53,609 --> 00:56:55,673
Can you help me put 
others, too? 

590
00:56:56,832 --> 00:57:00,935
There are already two restaurants. 
This, and a near Heathrow. 

591
00:57:01,004 --> 00:57:03,234
Will open another in Brick Lane. 

592
00:57:03,305 --> 00:57:05,206
And they want me to be the manager. 

593
00:57:05,775 --> 00:57:08,595
- That's good, right? 
- So I take it with me. 

594
00:57:09,009 --> 00:57:10,378
Cool, huh? 

595
00:57:10,463 --> 00:57:12,303
Lounge. Not in the kitchen. 

596
00:57:12,463 --> 00:57:14,711
Of course, in the lounge. No more scrubbing. 

597
00:57:15,501 --> 00:57:17,998
- Where is Brick Lane? 
- The East End 

598
00:57:18,266 --> 00:57:20,594
A large street full of restaurants. 

599
00:57:20,964 --> 00:57:22,850
Hasan, is a great guy. 

600
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:26,267
I'm going with you? 

601
00:57:26,325 --> 00:57:29,282
- Let's see. 
- You put me in the hall, too? 

602
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:31,367
Of course, in the hall! 

603
00:57:38,947 --> 00:57:41,047
- Glad you're here. 
- Good night! 

604
00:57:42,605 --> 00:57:44,849
- Good evening, how are you? 
- Well, are you? 

605
00:57:45,187 --> 00:57:47,322
Hasan, his cousin. 

606
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:50,099
- Remember him? 
- No matter. 

607
00:57:50,132 --> 00:57:51,708
Make yourself at home. 

608
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,498
- Hello 
- Hello 

609
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:57,370
Good evening and welcome. 

610
00:58:00,927 --> 00:58:02,526
Come. Sit. 

611
00:58:13,249 --> 00:58:15,545
For middlemen 
have to be six. 

612
00:58:15,701 --> 00:58:17,879
I am looking for people, 

613
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:20,058
but no one has more money. 

614
00:58:21,402 --> 00:58:22,706
And you have? 

615
00:58:25,667 --> 00:58:27,555
I thought I had more. 

616
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:31,108
I arranged. 

617
00:58:32,128 --> 00:58:33,626
But you can not come. 

618
00:58:34,095 --> 00:58:35,890
Do not want you in the truck. 

619
00:58:41,202 --> 00:58:43,922
You're here? 
Here, Rogue? 

620
00:58:44,011 --> 00:58:46,131
- Stop, Koban! 
- My 500 Euros. 

621
00:58:46,166 --> 00:58:48,003
Stop bother me with it! 

622
00:58:48,078 --> 00:58:49,705
- Will pay me! 
- Stop, shit! 

623
00:58:49,766 --> 00:58:52,517
- I promise that I will pay! 
- Leave it, damn it! 

624
00:58:53,852 --> 00:58:55,327
Stop, Koban! 

625
00:58:55,419 --> 00:58:56,742
Okay! 

626
00:58:58,691 --> 00:59:00,375
Stop, Koban! 

627
00:59:01,589 --> 00:59:02,889
Bitch, you pay me! 

628
00:59:06,988 --> 00:59:09,457
- What? 
- Who is Bilal? 

629
00:59:46,556 --> 00:59:48,171
Amed Darashia. 

630
00:59:51,042 --> 00:59:52,426
Hold on. 

631
00:59:52,534 --> 00:59:54,517
Put them in bed, please. 

632
00:59:55,602 --> 00:59:58,123
Mina ... Help your mother. 

633
01:00:02,768 --> 01:00:05,146
Listen carefully: Stop calling now. 

634
01:00:05,374 --> 01:00:06,878
Mine is not going to talk to you. 

635
01:00:07,529 --> 01:00:09,045
Understood? You are sick! 

636
01:00:09,929 --> 01:00:11,569
Now, leave her alone. 

637
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,634
Over! Understood? 

638
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:23,405
Who was that? 

639
01:00:24,044 --> 01:00:25,949
Who were you talking about? 

640
01:00:26,964 --> 01:00:28,549
Who was that? 

641
01:00:30,169 --> 01:00:31,845
Come. 

642
01:00:33,117 --> 01:00:34,686
Come on, come on. 

643
01:00:37,068 --> 01:00:39,325
Come, I say! 

644
01:00:40,841 --> 01:00:42,316
Between! 

645
01:00:44,629 --> 01:00:46,173
Sit. 

646
01:00:48,935 --> 01:00:50,466
Sit! 

647
01:01:12,391 --> 01:01:14,067
Do not want to eat? 

648
01:01:14,568 --> 01:01:17,156
You are not bazda? The corridor. 

649
01:01:17,234 --> 01:01:18,991
Have to eat. 

650
01:01:22,496 --> 01:01:25,870
- Thank you. 
- You see, speak French. 

651
01:01:27,589 --> 01:01:30,144
Why not learn French and is here? 

652
01:01:33,026 --> 01:01:35,890
Do not know if it will get 
the Manchester ... 

653
01:01:36,305 --> 01:01:38,737
but in water, to train law 

654
01:01:39,317 --> 01:01:42,181
I'm sure it will 
achieve good thing. 

655
01:01:42,703 --> 01:01:44,048
And become a good swimmer. 

656
01:01:44,197 --> 01:01:46,850
A very good. Believe me. 

657
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:52,113
Forget running ... 
and become a swimmer. 

658
01:01:58,265 --> 01:02:01,217
If I am a good swimmer 
I cross the English Channel 

659
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:40,263
My medal, where is it? 

660
01:02:40,809 --> 01:02:42,663
My gold medal, where is it? 

661
01:02:43,939 --> 01:02:45,635
- Where is it? 
- I do not know. 

662
01:02:45,908 --> 01:02:47,784
You mocking me? 
Where, do not you? 

663
01:02:49,631 --> 01:02:52,519
I give you food and shelter, and the only 
thing I think, is to rob me! 

664
01:03:01,483 --> 01:03:03,786
Here, put the bag in 
head, come on 

665
01:03:03,787 --> 01:03:06,032
Take the fucking truck 
and go away from here! 

666
01:03:06,064 --> 01:03:08,052
Come on, put, go get, shit! 

667
01:03:08,153 --> 01:03:10,318
You have to know what they want. 

668
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:13,507
Want to go? So go! 
Let us put. 

669
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:47,695
Hold on! 

670
01:03:47,923 --> 01:03:49,223
Sorry, sorry. 

671
01:03:49,423 --> 01:03:50,754
Okay. 

672
01:03:50,823 --> 01:03:52,123
Sorry. 

673
01:03:55,713 --> 01:03:57,353
Forgive me. I'm nervous. 

674
01:03:57,415 --> 01:03:59,512
I also have problems. Sorry. 

675
01:04:07,408 --> 01:04:09,399
Come on, come on, sorry. 

676
01:04:13,524 --> 01:04:14,916
Come! 

677
01:04:17,409 --> 01:04:19,462
It is you who are crying so? 
Know what time it is? 

678
01:04:19,666 --> 01:04:21,046
Has ended. Sorry. 

679
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:22,706
Brought back 
this guy into the building? 

680
01:04:22,737 --> 01:04:24,280
The building not, to my apartment. 

681
01:04:24,357 --> 01:04:26,653
It is forbidden! Here we are quiet 
do not want problems. 

682
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:28,677
What is the problem, 
is a child, is 17. 

683
01:04:28,746 --> 01:04:30,530
You have no right to bring him here. 

684
01:04:30,612 --> 01:04:32,583
- Wait. 
- What? 

685
01:04:32,922 --> 01:04:34,854
It turns out that this gentleman 
brings immigrants to the building. 

686
01:04:34,984 --> 01:04:36,303
Okay, enough. 

687
01:04:36,304 --> 01:04:39,023
Of course not, look 
that state is. 

688
01:04:39,024 --> 01:04:40,844
They are dirty, 
have diseases and steal. 

689
01:04:40,845 --> 01:04:42,745
- I'm warning you, I'll call the liquidator. 
- Call! 

690
01:04:42,746 --> 01:04:44,890
Oh, and call the Navy 
also if you want! 

691
01:04:44,891 --> 01:04:47,214
But do not understand what 
I say. Also, 

692
01:04:47,215 --> 01:04:49,241
I do not know what causes it, 
but is suspect. 

693
01:04:49,242 --> 01:04:52,585
How is it? What say? 

694
01:04:52,586 --> 01:04:54,495
You can repeat what I said? 

695
01:04:58,864 --> 01:05:00,616
Between. 

696
01:05:03,117 --> 01:05:04,568
Come in! 

697
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:07,106
Will there be problems because of me. 

698
01:05:07,262 --> 01:05:08,590
Lie. Let. 

699
01:05:15,178 --> 01:05:16,972
Good night. 

700
01:05:40,015 --> 01:05:41,380
Yes? 

701
01:05:41,381 --> 01:05:45,039
Good evening, sir. I speak 
with Mr. Kayani, please? 

702
01:05:45,166 --> 01:05:46,534
How? 

703
01:05:46,535 --> 01:05:48,063
Bilal Kayani, in your home? 

704
01:05:48,273 --> 01:05:50,591
Ah, yes, one minute. 

705
01:05:54,578 --> 01:05:56,201
It is for you. 

706
01:06:00,429 --> 01:06:02,799
- Yes? ... 
- Bilal ... 

707
01:06:04,082 --> 01:06:05,737
My father wants to marry. 

708
01:06:06,561 --> 01:06:08,218
Marry a cousin! 

709
01:06:08,569 --> 01:06:10,170
What? 

710
01:06:10,414 --> 01:06:14,122
A cousin, who owns a restaurant. 
Do not know! 

711
01:06:14,601 --> 01:06:16,754
Bilal, what I do? 

712
01:06:17,539 --> 01:06:19,697
I'm going. Relax. 

713
01:06:20,418 --> 01:06:21,857
But when you gonna come? 

714
01:06:23,281 --> 01:06:25,073
I do not know. I'm going. 

715
01:06:26,273 --> 01:06:28,170
Tell me what to do. 

716
01:06:28,253 --> 01:06:32,450
He does not want to see, 
not even talk to us! 

717
01:06:33,237 --> 01:06:35,998
- Bilal, I gotta go! 
- Mine? 

718
01:06:50,027 --> 01:06:51,580
Good news, right? 

719
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:57,716
An hour ago, you thought 
she did not want to see you. 

720
01:06:57,996 --> 01:07:00,900
And now, she knows that you expect. 

721
01:07:01,819 --> 01:07:03,788
So it's good news. 

722
01:07:10,284 --> 01:07:12,148
Perhaps you could talk to her father. 

723
01:07:15,092 --> 01:07:17,707
If he wants to marry her, he will. 

724
01:07:18,067 --> 01:07:19,387
It is so. 

725
01:07:39,433 --> 01:07:41,380
To get to this one. 

726
01:07:42,535 --> 01:07:44,451
And to impress her father. 

727
01:07:46,491 --> 01:07:48,428
It's an antique ring. 

728
01:07:49,005 --> 01:07:50,452
Very nice. 

729
01:07:51,559 --> 01:07:53,492
Diamonds and sapphires. 

730
01:07:54,916 --> 01:07:56,427
She'll like it. 

731
01:07:58,136 --> 01:07:59,460
Take. 

732
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:02,764
You will find a way to cross. 

733
01:08:05,107 --> 01:08:07,015
Take, we do not make undone! 

734
01:08:10,404 --> 01:08:12,623
But ... is his wife. 

735
01:08:13,139 --> 01:08:14,564
Take it and give it. 

736
01:08:16,268 --> 01:08:18,264
Invited me to your wedding? 

737
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:40,323
- Mr. Calmato? 
- Yes 

738
01:08:40,324 --> 01:08:42,535
We would like to make some 
questions, we can enter? 

739
01:08:43,713 --> 01:08:46,376
- Are you alone? 
- You do not have the right to enter as well. 

740
01:09:00,407 --> 01:09:01,711
Paul! 

741
01:09:06,430 --> 01:09:08,031
Please! 

742
01:09:12,582 --> 01:09:14,463
Can you tell us who slept there? 

743
01:09:15,706 --> 01:09:19,077
Eu Vi television is banned? 

744
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:24,097
They say it is illegal 
under his roof. 

745
01:09:24,417 --> 01:09:26,197
Well, you can see that! 

746
01:09:26,905 --> 01:09:28,494
It was that damned who called? 

747
01:09:29,237 --> 01:09:31,502
It seems that you wanted 
beat him, too. 

748
01:09:31,705 --> 01:09:33,647
Of course not, is an idiot. 

749
01:09:44,449 --> 01:09:46,844
Next time will come sooner! 

750
01:10:00,293 --> 01:10:01,817
Bilal? 

751
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:03,308
Pablo! 

752
01:11:05,109 --> 01:11:06,508
Come! 

753
01:11:08,467 --> 01:11:11,767
He wants you to play. 
Want to play. 

754
01:11:11,968 --> 01:11:13,268
Where did you find it. 

755
01:11:13,425 --> 01:11:16,648
I do not know, that way. Why? 

756
01:11:28,191 --> 01:11:30,695
- Are you sure he was? 
- Yes, of course. 

757
01:11:33,090 --> 01:11:36,275
Two hours, maybe three, I do not know. 

758
01:11:37,057 --> 01:11:40,137
If the beach 
is wearing a blue and black. 

759
01:11:40,647 --> 01:11:44,015
Who are you? Your last name? 

760
01:11:44,016 --> 01:11:47,349
Simon Calmato. C-A-L-M-A-T 

761
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:51,127
- And it? 
- Bilal. 

762
01:11:51,162 --> 01:11:55,583
Is your name, Bilal? 
And what is the surname? 

763
01:11:57,063 --> 01:11:59,554
Calmato, too! It's my son. 

764
01:12:00,987 --> 01:12:03,538
- How old are you? 
- 17 years. 

765
01:12:05,994 --> 01:12:07,491
I hope. 

766
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:19,272
Forgotten me ... office. 

767
01:12:19,707 --> 01:12:21,124
Ah, yes. 

768
01:12:22,685 --> 01:12:24,204
He did not sleep here? 

769
01:12:26,334 --> 01:12:27,667
Good morning. 

770
01:12:29,135 --> 01:12:31,081
Very nice, this, as always! 

771
01:12:43,783 --> 01:12:45,747
I told you to stop. 

772
01:12:52,314 --> 01:12:54,026
And why all this? 

773
01:13:01,409 --> 01:13:03,961
When he realizes that 
will not succeed, will return. 

774
01:13:05,797 --> 01:13:08,290
When you notice, it will be late. 
Not get more. 

775
01:13:15,783 --> 01:13:17,675
You call the police? 

776
01:13:17,782 --> 01:13:20,382
The Red Cross. 
And maritime affairs. 

777
01:13:22,173 --> 01:13:24,457
For an illegal immigrant, 
not make much effort. 

778
01:13:40,329 --> 01:13:42,009
Do not take it anymore, Marion. 

779
01:13:47,368 --> 01:13:49,665
Eat without you, sleep 
without you, I can not. 

780
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:51,432
Just got done nonsense. 

781
01:13:52,799 --> 01:13:56,555
Simon, stop. 

782
01:13:58,556 --> 01:14:00,011
Please. 

783
01:14:19,723 --> 01:14:22,851
Stop, please. 

784
01:14:38,961 --> 01:14:40,649
Simon! 

785
01:15:20,845 --> 01:15:24,211
Hello! ... yes ... 

786
01:15:25,565 --> 01:15:27,421
Again, why? 

787
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:31,036
I do not know, later. 
When I can. 

788
01:16:04,827 --> 01:16:06,239
What is it? 

789
01:16:06,970 --> 01:16:08,814
The address of the girl, 
his girlfriend. 

790
01:16:09,790 --> 01:16:11,535
After all, it was without him. 

791
01:16:30,216 --> 01:16:32,082
We must no longer see us, Simon. 

792
01:16:33,673 --> 01:16:35,073
No more. 

793
01:17:00,599 --> 01:17:05,052
There seems to be a good environment 
in your building! Come. 

794
01:17:07,736 --> 01:17:09,436
I have good news for you. 

795
01:17:09,743 --> 01:17:11,355
We fished her son! 

796
01:17:12,881 --> 01:17:14,737
This is a recent adoption, no? 

797
01:17:16,011 --> 01:17:17,475
How is he? 

798
01:17:18,225 --> 01:17:20,952
As a guy who 
spent 5 hours in cold water. 

799
01:17:21,498 --> 01:17:23,798
Was a fisherman who recovered it. 

800
01:17:23,799 --> 01:17:26,580
Did not want to go, had 
to carry him to power. 

801
01:17:27,794 --> 01:17:29,985
What are you doing 
with that boy, Mr. Calmato? 

802
01:17:30,249 --> 01:17:31,601
What do you mean? 

803
01:17:31,651 --> 01:17:33,677
Well, you train in the pool, 
everybody saw. 

804
01:17:34,713 --> 01:17:36,102
Gave two lectures. 

805
01:17:36,340 --> 01:17:38,164
Yes, and a swimming costume as well. 

806
01:17:39,015 --> 01:17:40,471
That he stole in my house. 

807
01:17:42,054 --> 01:17:44,378
Then recognizes 
who had under your roof? 

808
01:17:44,679 --> 01:17:47,208
I have the testimony of his neighbor. 

809
01:17:48,216 --> 01:17:50,216
And that seems to be true. 

810
01:17:51,042 --> 01:17:53,764
Even told you 
had a special relationship 

811
01:17:53,765 --> 01:17:56,113
with the boy, if you 
understand what I mean! 

812
01:17:59,602 --> 01:18:04,491
We will arrest him, Mr. Calmato. 
By helping illegal immigrants. 

813
01:18:05,082 --> 01:18:08,314
And trafficking in human beings, 
what is even worse. 

814
01:18:11,683 --> 01:18:13,837
His wife is a volunteer 
very active, no? 

815
01:18:14,493 --> 01:18:16,798
Stop it, it has nothing 
to do with it, moreover, 

816
01:18:16,799 --> 01:18:18,570
is no longer my wife, 
we separated eight months ago. 

817
01:18:18,766 --> 01:18:20,258
And divorced two days ago. 

818
01:18:21,391 --> 01:18:23,975
His neighbor saw them 
in your home together. 

819
01:18:26,557 --> 01:18:28,839
For months I asked to 
involve volunteers 

820
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:31,589
Mr. Calmato do not give me peace. 

821
01:18:31,917 --> 01:18:35,629
And now, thanks to you, I'll get them. 
At least one! 

822
01:18:35,999 --> 01:18:40,951
If legal or not his wife, 
makes no difference. 

823
01:18:41,164 --> 01:18:43,316
There complicity 
will not change anything. 

824
01:18:48,181 --> 01:18:50,445
Okay, I gathered 
under my roof and the trained. 

825
01:18:50,549 --> 01:18:53,460
I gave him the suit and fins 
put it in water and he paid me. 

826
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:56,152
1000 euros, is good? 

827
01:18:58,497 --> 01:19:00,301
I slept with him too. 

828
01:19:00,476 --> 01:19:04,180
You are right the other, sleep with men, 
but she left me. 

829
01:19:06,075 --> 01:19:10,116
So, leave it alone now, 
has nothing to do with it. 

830
01:20:08,892 --> 01:20:10,804
You are under judicial custody. 

831
01:20:11,005 --> 01:20:14,715
Until it is called before the judge, 
can not leave the region. 

832
01:20:15,008 --> 01:20:18,037
And it should go here 
every day. Dismissed. 

833
01:20:20,766 --> 01:20:22,229
Dismissed. 

834
01:20:26,331 --> 01:20:29,618
Not so fast, and open the 
legs like a frog. 

835
01:20:30,646 --> 01:20:32,142
Do not run, boys! 

836
01:20:33,510 --> 01:20:36,110
We, therefore, open the legs. 

837
01:20:39,821 --> 01:20:42,197
- Simon! 
- Give me. 

838
01:20:42,705 --> 01:20:44,495
Knock there, and take another turn. Right? 

839
01:20:44,962 --> 01:20:46,522
Take a look, please. 

840
01:20:46,523 --> 01:20:47,823
Hallo! 

841
01:20:48,134 --> 01:20:51,849
Good morning sir, could 
speak with Bilal Kayani, please. 

842
01:20:52,094 --> 01:20:54,007
Sorry, but not here. 

843
01:20:54,610 --> 01:20:55,990
It's Mine? 

844
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:57,460
Yes 

845
01:20:57,506 --> 01:20:59,530
You know when 
I can talk to him? 

846
01:21:00,762 --> 01:21:03,667
Are retained in a detention center. 

847
01:21:03,793 --> 01:21:05,103
What? 

848
01:21:05,155 --> 01:21:07,130
A detention center. It ... 

849
01:21:08,322 --> 01:21:10,650
as a prison for 
illegal immigrants. 

850
01:21:10,721 --> 01:21:12,030
Why? 

851
01:21:12,153 --> 01:21:16,161
<i> tried to cross the English Channel. 
But the police caught him. </ I> 

852
01:21:18,586 --> 01:21:20,241
You know when they release it? 

853
01:21:21,076 --> 01:21:22,428
Soon, I hope. 

854
01:21:22,513 --> 01:21:24,505
A week, maybe. I do not know. 

855
01:21:25,295 --> 01:21:26,920
Want to leave a comment? 

856
01:21:29,826 --> 01:21:31,795
Tell him not to come. 

857
01:21:31,949 --> 01:21:33,579
I'm getting married. 

858
01:21:35,167 --> 01:21:37,123
You have to wait, Mina. 

859
01:21:38,426 --> 01:21:41,081
He can cross. I know. 

860
01:21:42,465 --> 01:21:46,717
Tell him to stay in 
France, sir. Please. 

861
01:22:43,303 --> 01:22:44,968
How are you, bazda? 

862
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:49,540
Seems tired. 

863
01:22:51,518 --> 01:22:54,338
Have to stay in shape 
to play in Manchester. 

864
01:22:56,805 --> 01:22:58,998
He knew he had problems 
my fault. 

865
01:22:59,648 --> 01:23:02,521
- Sorry. 
- Do not worry. 

866
01:23:07,453 --> 01:23:09,299
You're a swimmer, now. 

867
01:23:10,940 --> 01:23:14,676
Lost her costume. I will return it. 

868
01:23:18,884 --> 01:23:20,280
Mina called. 

869
01:23:21,884 --> 01:23:23,208
When? 

870
01:23:24,195 --> 01:23:25,504
Monday morning. 

871
01:23:27,092 --> 01:23:28,644
What did she say? 

872
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:31,579
He said to call her. 

873
01:23:33,548 --> 01:23:35,089
Anything else? 

874
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:38,948
Can not stay here! If the police see, 
complicit and close the soup. 

875
01:23:39,001 --> 01:23:40,573
What did she say? 

876
01:23:40,668 --> 01:23:42,007
Go, please! 

877
01:23:44,417 --> 01:23:46,220
She can not wait. 

878
01:23:47,678 --> 01:23:50,876
Getting married. Was very sad ... 

879
01:23:51,425 --> 01:23:53,562
She said you should not go. 

880
01:23:53,623 --> 01:23:55,328
Go now, we should not see it anymore. 

881
01:23:55,468 --> 01:23:56,940
Leave me alone. 

882
01:23:57,015 --> 01:23:59,839
Go away, Simon, will bring us 
problems and to them also. 

883
01:24:01,577 --> 01:24:02,937
Are cold. 

884
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:08,344
Stop, I'm responsible for it, 
I get clothes. I'll take care. 

885
01:24:09,715 --> 01:24:11,109
Call me. 

886
01:27:51,162 --> 01:27:53,818
- So? 
- Yes 

887
01:27:54,796 --> 01:27:56,244
Let's continue. 

888
01:28:41,048 --> 01:28:43,043
Is there someone in the water! 

889
01:28:46,908 --> 01:28:48,807
- A face in the water! 
- Where? 

890
01:28:48,894 --> 01:28:50,443
There! 

891
01:28:51,247 --> 01:28:53,833
- Where? 
- There! 

892
01:28:53,994 --> 01:28:55,860
Right there! There! 

893
01:29:19,527 --> 01:29:21,084
200 meters. 

894
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:23,911
Right! 

895
01:29:23,912 --> 01:29:25,782
Right in front. 

896
01:29:27,424 --> 01:29:28,759
Here! 

897
01:30:24,032 --> 01:30:26,731
Stop the engines! Stop! Turn! 

898
01:31:30,217 --> 01:31:31,777
Good morning. 

899
01:31:33,642 --> 01:31:35,451
Wait a minute, please. 

900
01:31:35,661 --> 01:31:36,966
What? 

901
01:31:37,111 --> 01:31:38,631
That's all. 

902
01:31:46,154 --> 01:31:48,818
You've been French champion 
the 400 meters, I did not know. 

903
01:31:48,918 --> 01:31:50,233
Now, you know. 

904
01:31:51,343 --> 01:31:54,568
In 1984, the games were in Los Angeles, 
why was not the Olympics? 

905
01:31:54,604 --> 01:31:56,645
Because the coach was a cop! 

906
01:31:56,736 --> 01:31:58,953
It was to ask that 
I wanted to see me? 

907
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:04,727
We found this with a 
these middlemen. 

908
01:32:07,247 --> 01:32:11,842
A certain Zoran Makma 
paid with this, you want it? 

909
01:32:15,449 --> 01:32:16,895
I gave him. 

910
01:32:22,650 --> 01:32:24,006
Managed to cross? 

911
01:32:24,071 --> 01:32:28,086
I do not know, probably yes. 
He did it! 

912
01:32:30,652 --> 01:32:33,837
I have good news, Mr. Calmato. 

913
01:32:35,361 --> 01:32:37,129
Where is it? 

914
01:32:37,898 --> 01:32:41,594
Here. The British sent him back. 

915
01:32:43,208 --> 01:32:44,849
In a plastic bag! 

916
01:32:46,964 --> 01:32:51,216
Was found to 800 meters 
the coast, English coast. 

917
01:32:53,747 --> 01:32:56,236
Is the first time 
someone crosses that! 

918
01:33:02,128 --> 01:33:03,788
Had it with him. 

919
01:33:08,006 --> 01:33:10,085
I suppose it has given him, too? 

920
01:34:30,204 --> 01:34:34,463
- Mina ... You're Mine? 
- Yes 

921
01:34:37,672 --> 01:34:39,220
'm A friend of Bilal. 

922
01:34:39,646 --> 01:34:40,959
I'm French. 

923
01:34:41,594 --> 01:34:43,115
Can I talk to you? 

924
01:34:44,911 --> 01:34:46,356
One minute. 

925
01:34:47,447 --> 01:34:49,078
I'm going home later. 

926
01:35:05,633 --> 01:35:07,486
Like him? 

927
01:35:09,458 --> 01:35:11,052
Pool. 

928

929
01:35:22,392 --> 01:35:24,400
He had bought it for you. 

930
01:35:31,279 --> 01:35:33,664
It's an antique ring. Very old. 

931
01:35:34,357 --> 01:35:36,017
Diamonds and sapphires. 

932
01:35:39,716 --> 01:35:41,608
I can never use it ... 

933
01:35:45,030 --> 01:35:47,327
The wedding is in 10 days. 

934
01:36:01,378 --> 01:36:04,610
Why not tell him not to come? 

935
01:36:07,211 --> 01:36:08,659
I said. 

936
01:36:29,291 --> 01:36:31,162
Gotta go. 

937
01:37:04,107 --> 01:37:05,407

I know, but have to go back now. 

945
01:37:22,793 --> 01:37:26,227
It has to stop.

946
01:37:26,784 --> 01:37:28,110
