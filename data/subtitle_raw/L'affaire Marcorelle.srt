1
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,340
It felt as if he was ploughing
a furrow in my flesh.

2
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,300
He pulled my skirt up,

3
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,660
slid his hand
between my thighs,

4
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,140
stroked my pussy,

5
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,860
my stomach, my breasts.

6
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,740
I felt the faintest sensation
on my back.

7
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,380
His other hand squeezed
my stomach.

8
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,820
His claws dug into my shoulder.

9
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,340
His face was covered in hair.

10
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,860
His mouth revealed
two yellowish fangs.

11
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,100
Did you kiss him?

12
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,140
Did you kiss this monster?

13
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,620
He lay on top of me.

14
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,940
His body was light,

15
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,540
incredibly light,

16
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,500
like that of a child.

17
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,740
I don't remember
what happened next.

18
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,380
- She's dead.
- Who found the body?

19
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:10,980
I did.

20
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,500
Did anyone else see anything?

21
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,740
Did you see the killer?

22
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,820
It was him.

23
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,620
He killed her.

24
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,420
- Yes, it was him.
- It was him.

25
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,700
It was him.

26
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,260
He is the murderer.

27
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,540
Yes, it was him.

28
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,140
I'm certain he did it.

29
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:55,100
<b>THE MARCORELLE AFFAIR</b>

30
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,500
We are all guilty...

31
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:16,540
And I am guiltier than the rest.

32
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,580
I've been in the job for 30 years

33
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,420
and I've never witnessed
a scene like it.

34
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,340
What had got into Judge Marcorelle?

35
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,100
What secret motive
had tipped him over the edge?

36
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,660
He was known
for being a workaholic.

37
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,380
He showed such persistence

38
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,180
in getting to the bottom
of all his cases,

39
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,500
sometimes sparking
anger or hatred

40
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,620
in powerful figures in the courts.

41
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,700
But he felt nothing
but scorn for them.

42
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,500
The judge was a strange man.

43
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,900
I often saw him
early in the morning

44
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,700
wandering like a ghost
near the prison,

45
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,980
visibly tormented.

46
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,300
It was on one such morning

47
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,100
that he started questioning
Robert Viguier,

48
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,220
a first-time offender,
whose case led to his downfall.

49
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,900
For me the damage
had already been done.

50
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,580
Robert Viguier.

51
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,100
You are accused of having,

52
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,820
on 8 July last year,

53
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,980
killed your wife...

54
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,700
What was the motive
for this murder?

55
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,500
There was no motive.

56
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,100
Did you argue?
Had you been drinking?

57
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,060
No doubt,

58
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,660
like every other evening.

59
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,060
Tell me what happened
on the evening of 8 July.

60
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,380
Right.

61
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,220
I came home a bit later than usual,
a bit drunker than usual.

62
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,340
She yelled at me
a bit more than usual.

63
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,940
It was a night of excess.

64
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,460
Nothing extreme,
just more than usual.

65
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,820
It all came out.

66
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,820
The money I hadn't earned
but had spent.

67
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,380
The promises I had made
and not kept.

68
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,940
The wakeful nights she had spent
and the misery of endlessly waiting.

69
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,820
It was hard for an idealist like me
to listen to all that.

70
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,540
While she was talking,
I thought back to my youth

71
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,100
and the vision
I once had of life.

72
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,860
It didn't involve
Monique's face yelling at me

73
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,180
every day from morning till night.

74
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,300
I couldn't stand
the sound of her voice.

75
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,180
I grabbed her throat
where the sound came from.

76
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,380
Then I went to bed
hoping never to wake up again.

77
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,540
Your Honour,

78
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,380
at the start of the '70s
my client was a young man

79
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,940
living in a shanty town
in Nanterre near Paris.

80
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,180
Did you live in the shanty town?

81
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,580
The Fraternité estate,

82
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,460
until the age of 21.

83
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,740
It was a troubling time
for my client.

84
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,340
In the midst
of this material and moral poverty

85
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,820
Robert Viguier met
some young students

86
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,660
who had come to the shanty town
to spread the word.

87
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,660
Is that going to be your defence?

88
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:49,660
I'm not saying those encounters
necessarily led to the crime

89
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,380
but I wanted
to put it into perspective.

90
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,580
We're not in court yet.

91
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,100
Of course we must react.

92
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,660
Why not? It's boiling out there.

93
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,340
Do you want to get fat?

94
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,780
Are they for jam?

95
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,460
Draft a letter.
We'll go over it later.

96
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,460
Puyricard is bringing charges
against Bignon.

97
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,220
What's he done now?

98
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,420
His desk and chair
have gone missing.

99
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,380
- Did he steal them?
- So Puyricard claims.

100
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,220
- Poor old Bignon.
- It's so heavy-handed.

101
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,500
Just because he had Puyricard's
political allies sent down.

102
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,540
Don't you care?

103
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,580
I was thinking of something else.

104
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,220
Your Nanterre strangler?

105
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,620
The name Robert Viguier
doesn't ring a bell?

106
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,580
No.

107
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,820
- Who did this?
- Nicolas.

108
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,500
- Liar. You dropped it.
- You pushed me.

109
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,980
All right, that will do.

110
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,100
Remember that young rebel
at the shanty town

111
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,660
who went round
collecting scrap metal?

112
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,500
I'm sure it's him.

113
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,580
Back then the shanty town
was full of immigrants,

114
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,820
Algerians and Portuguese.

115
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,340
He looked a bit like "Oustachi".

116
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,540
Who's Ouskachi.

117
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,740
Oustachi.

118
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,460
He lived with a friend of ours
in Saint-Étienne.

119
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,580
- Why was he called that?
- He had a big moustache.

120
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,660
Did you meet
at the sausage factory?

121
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,900
You're thinking of Corcarneau.

122
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:39,180
And I keep telling you,
it was a sardine canning factory.

123
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,940
Come on, get in the car.

124
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,100
Careful.

125
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,700
François.

126
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,900
- Just ignore that idiot lawyer.
- There's a surprise.

127
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,700
Let's go.

128
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,020
I can't help thinking
that 25 years ago

129
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,940
I too was in Nanterre.

130
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,740
Meanwhile I've become a judge

131
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,660
and he a murderer.

132
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,100
- That's life. What can you do?
- Go ahead.

133
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,100
- Laugh.
- I'm not laughing.

134
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,300
I just want you to put on
your jacket and lock up.

135
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,420
A weekend away
will clear our heads and lungs.

136
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,700
Clear our heads?
You must be joking.

137
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,140
I heard you on the phone just now.

138
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:23,140
Drafting motions and press releases,
and so on and so forth.

139
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,300
We can't just stand back
and watch them send Bignon down.

140
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,980
He's been digging his own grave
for 25 years

141
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,820
ever since he started
dropping acid, remember?

142
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,980
Perhaps stealing office furniture
gives him peace of mind.

143
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,180
What do I know?
I'm not a chemist.

144
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,500
Here you go again,
ducking out of it.

145
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,380
Don't worry, your friends
gave up on you long ago.

146
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:49,180
Gave up on me?
And have they kept the ball rolling,

147
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,180
continuing their discussions
of worthy causes?

148
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,700
I hope so.

149
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,940
Do you think
he suspects anything?

150
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,900
He suspects nothing
but he questions everything.

151
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,860
He's been like that
for almost half a century now.

152
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,980
I came home a bit later than usual,
a bit drunker than usual.

153
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:31,620
She yelled at me
a bit more than usual.

154
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,300
It was a night of excess.

155
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,660
Nothing extreme,
just more than usual.

156
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,180
Did you live in the shanty town?

157
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:45,020
A young man living in a shanty town
in Nanterre near Paris.

158
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,300
Everybody happy.

159
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,900
A life of luxury for all.

160
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,820
Universal solidarity.

161
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,660
Here's the wine you asked for.

162
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,460
Thank you, Kemal.

163
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,180
Good health.

164
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,740
- It's quiet tonight.
- Tell me about it.

165
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,860
It's the spring
bank holiday weekend.

166
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,400
- Bank holiday weekend?
- The longest in the year.

167
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,780
People are making the most
of this sunshine.

168
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,660
- What on earth for?
- Well...

169
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,740
Fresh air, greenery,
peace and quiet.

170
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,220
Peace and quiet?

171
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,980
Don't you like the countryside?

172
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,660
No.

173
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,180
Each to his own.

174
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,380
My head is spinning.

175
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,260
- I need to eat something.
- Coming right up.

176
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,860
Agneska.

177
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,260
- Yes?
- I'm off.

178
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,420
- Send everyone home at ten.
- Ten? OK.

179
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,460
Thank you.
Good evening.

180
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,860
- Good night.
- Good night.

181
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,820
Is it true
that you don't like the countryside?

182
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,220
- Especially at night.
- I love being scared.

183
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,500
Me too, at the cinema.

184
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,140
Do you like horror films too?

185
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,940
Horror films? Yes. Why not?

186
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,740
I saw a great one today.

187
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,700
"Night of the Living Dead."

188
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,100
George Romero.
It's a classic.

189
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,580
It was great.
It was so scary.

190
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,780
So you're a film buff?

191
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,260
I used to go
to the cinema next door a lot,

192
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,620
up to three or four times a week.

193
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,300
Ah, yes. They have
an excellent programme.

194
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,100
How will you get home?

195
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,900
I'll manage.
I'll hail a cab.

196
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,260
I can give you a lift if you like.

197
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,980
- That's kind of you.
- I'm parked over there.

198
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,340
Who built these monstrosities?

199
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,060
It used to be a shanty town.

200
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,860
Before that it was the countryside.
You'd have hated that too.

201
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:07,020
People who build these estates hate
the city as much as the countryside.

202
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,780
We have laws against looting

203
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,380
but none against
building monstrosities.

204
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,700
Look at that.

205
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,660
Is it as bad as all that?

206
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,420
I don't know any more.

207
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,940
It's left there.

208
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,620
There.

209
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,860
Won't you come up for a drink?

210
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,780
Well, I...

211
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,060
There's no cognac
but I have vodka.

212
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,380
Well, in that case...

213
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:07,300
- Because of the neighbours?
- No, my father is a light sleeper.

214
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,860
Your father...

215
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,100
This way.

216
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,300
That's his room.

217
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,300
Have a seat.

218
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,580
It's nice here.

219
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,700
It's well laid out.

220
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,220
So you live with your father?

221
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,300
Don't remind me.

222
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,060
But it's him who lives with me.

223
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,860
He turned up here
over six months ago.

224
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,580
He's out of work.

225
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,140
He spends all day drinking.
He doesn't speak French.

226
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,380
- He hates me having visitors.
- That bad, huh?

227
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,940
My father's a fan of Walesa.
He's as Catholic as they come.

228
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,220
Ah. Polish.

229
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,500
Catholicism.

230
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,460
My father insists I hang it up.

231
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,780
I don't know how I feel about it.

232
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,220
- Agneska?
- Yes?

233
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,980
Why did you invite me up
despite all the associated risks?

234
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,540
Because...

235
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,500
I sensed that you were lonely.

236
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,180
I feel lonely too sometimes.

237
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:06,300
That was very kind of you.
I have had a dreadful day.

238
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,980
Before becoming a magistrate
I was...

239
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,300
You were a man like any other.

240
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,540
Like any other, yes.

241
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,580
Agneska? What's wrong?

242
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,220
Are you feeling unwell?

243
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,340
Are you on some sort of trip?

244
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,020
I didn't lay a finger on her.

245
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,100
- I didn't kill him?
- Yes.

246
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,420
Oh, my God.

247
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:15,900
I'm going to wake up.
I'm going to wake up soon.

248
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,140
Dad.

249
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,780
Dad.

250
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,940
You need to calm down, Agneska.

251
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,180
- Let's call a doctor.
- He's dead.

252
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,860
- Then let's call the police.
- No.

253
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,580
Not the police, please.

254
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,020
- What do we do, then?
- Leave it to me. I'll see to it.

255
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,300
My Polish friends
will know what to do.

256
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,700
What do you mean?
Is this common in Poland?

257
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,060
Please just go.

258
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,060
If you think it's for the best.

259
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,500
- But I want to be sure.
- Just go.

260
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,820
There's been a murder.
The body is still warm.

261
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,500
- I think the killer's still inside.
- Yes, yes.

262
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:37,300
It's a sunny bank holiday.
Georges will be away until Monday.

263
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,820
It's closed.
Your efforts are wasted.

264
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,820
Closed? Since when.

265
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,980
I don't know.
I'm not the janitor.

266
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,020
The central courtyard
is about to be blown up.

267
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,740
That's weird.
I visited a friend here recently.

268
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,820
There have been no tenants
in the block for over a year.

269
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,060
It's about to be demolished.

270
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:23,700
- I can assure you.
- And I can assure you.

271
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,900
No one has lived in this block
for a year.

272
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,100
Not even some Polish people?

273
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,540
Squatters?

274
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,380
There are no Poles here.

275
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,140
Only blacks and Arabs.
Got it?

276
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,340
Now, if you don't mind.

277
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,380
We haven't found any lighters.

278
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:13,380
I must have left it elsewhere.
Never mind. I hardly smoke any more.

279
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,020
That's what I thought.

280
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,380
This is turning out
to be quite a day.

281
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,900
What do you mean?

282
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,660
You've lost your lighter

283
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,260
and I've lost my waitress.

284
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,620
- Which waitress? Agneska?
- Yes, the Polish girl.

285
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,860
- She left of the blue?
- Out of the blue.

286
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,860
She phoned this morning

287
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:39,420
to say she had to go back
to Poland right away.

288
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,580
- She was a strange girl.
- What do you mean?

289
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,380
She was such a flirt.

290
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:47,220
She kept flashing her thighs
in that short skirt.

291
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,980
She would lure clients
to some place or other.

292
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,780
To her house?

293
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,500
Did she try it on with you?

294
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,380
No, no. I was just trying
to imagine the scene.

295
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,740
She may well
have stolen your lighter.

296
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,620
You never can tell
with girls like that.

297
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,140
Never mind. Forget it.

298
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,900
An old lighter hardly warrants
a search party.

299
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,740
And there are plenty
more waitresses out there.

300
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,260
Cheers.

301
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,820
- Let me know if you hear anything.
- Of course.

302
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,740
- Thanks.
- You can count on me.

303
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,700
- Judge.
- Sir.

304
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,620
What brings you here?

305
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,620
I'm on call this weekend so...

306
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:40,860
To think our colleagues
are living it up in the sunshine.

307
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:43,700
I wanted to check out
the afternoon's clients.

308
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,980
Nothing too serious.

309
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,620
Nothing that can't wait till Monday.

310
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,060
Nothing to keep you in the city,
if you know what I mean.

311
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,900
- Nothing out of the ordinary?
- Routine cases.

312
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,340
The odd burglary,
like every weekend.

313
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,620
And one death last night
in the suburbs.

314
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:05,780
- In the north?
- No, in the south.

315
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,380
Some bourgeois tragedy.
Do you want to see?

316
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:20,140
The usual small fry,
plus a few tramps.

317
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,660
Yours is this way.

318
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,660
Do you see
the conditions we work in?

319
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,100
Last night's killer.

320
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,060
Are you OK?

321
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:50,260
I'll...
I'll see you this afternoon.

322
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:58,060
And you have nothing
from eastern Europe?

323
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,220
No.

324
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:02,460
Russians, Czechs, Poles?

325
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,460
Not for the moment.

326
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:08,020
No Lithuanians, either?

327
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,900
Crime from the cold countries

328
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,660
is predominantly
sex and drugs-related.

329
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,020
Oh, yes, so-called Polish soup,

330
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:18,380
or poor quality heroin.

331
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:21,420
Yes, it doesn't take long
for them to resort to crime.

332
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,540
- It's a question of arithmetic.
- They start young too.

333
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,660
You're quite right.

334
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,180
He's here.

335
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,100
What's going on here?

336
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,940
Happy birthday, darling.

337
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,900
The song was Georges' idea.
We wanted to surprise you.

338
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:17,220
You taught it to me
on my 18th birthday, remember?

339
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,220
It seems to have slipped my mind.

340
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,700
Happy birthday, Dad.

341
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:57,300
Happy birthday to you

342
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:00,700
Happy birthday to you

343
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:04,220
Happy birthday to you

344
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,340
Happy birthday...

345
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,700
Here, take this
and you'll get a good night's sleep.

346
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,340
Are there any side effects?

347
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,780
No, you could take this for 20 years

348
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:28,180
without wanting to steal
furniture from the chancery.

349
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,100
Was Bignon here?
I didn't even see him.

350
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:35,580
It's very gentle.
You'll gradually drop off.

351
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,860
Go on.

352
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,340
No, I don't want it.

353
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:43,060
This is not my lucky night.

354
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,620
First my song was a flop

355
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,460
and now my magic potion.

356
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,700
It's never been easy
being your friend

357
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,780
and you haven't mellowed
in old age.

358
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,780
Thanks for reminding me.

359
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,260
What?

360
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,020
Is that it? Does it bother you?

361
00:28:56,180 --> 00:29:00,260
I'm sure most people here tonight
don't know my exact age.

362
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,620
But still...

363
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,020
Don't tell me
that's why you fainted.

364
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,940
It's far more serious,
unfortunately.

365
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,780
Are you sure?

366
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,460
I killed a man, Georges.

367
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,820
- When?
- Last night.

368
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:24,380
It was just another one
of your guilt dreams.

369
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:27,100
Did you go to the cinema
with the redhead?

370
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,900
It wasn't a dream, Georges.
It was real.

371
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,900
Terrifyingly real.

372
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,020
Listen, you're going to sleep

373
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,660
and we'll talk about it tomorrow.

374
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:39,020
I got dragged
into some sordid affair.

375
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:43,100
- At Kemal's place.
- The Turkish restaurant?

376
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,660
- The Polish waitress asked me in.
- Really?

377
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,740
She did it to annoy her father.

378
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,660
This guy was more Catholic
than Lech Walesa.

379
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,660
I killed him.

380
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,740
For real.

381
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:59,540
Do you have proof
of what you're saying?

382
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:02,740
Not proof, only the memory.

383
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,300
But believe me...

384
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,660
that's enough.

385
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:12,020
François,
you and I are materialists.

386
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:18,900
Don't tell me you no longer believe
in hard evidence.

387
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,660
- Of course I do.
- Good.

388
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,180
So before you accuse yourself
of some crime,

389
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:26,260
please bring me some tangible clues

390
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,100
or else keep your trap shut.

391
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,100
I don't know,
a body or blood on your clothes.

392
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,460
The proof of the pudding
is in the eating.

393
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,180
You taught me that too.

394
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,660
I'm telling you, I killed a man.

395
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,900
I saw his bulging eyes.

396
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:47,100
I heard his last gasp.

397
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,460
I saw blood flow
from his smashed skull.

398
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,020
You know about
brain haemorrhages.

399
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,300
Here, another pill perhaps.

400
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,380
No, no, no.

401
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,460
It's very kind of you, Georges,

402
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,740
but there's nothing
you can do for me.

403
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,460
Right. Listen, I've heard
quite enough for one day.

404
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,460
You must rest for at least a week.

405
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,580
Don't call me
till you've recovered.

406
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,380
- Judge?
- Hm?

407
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,620
Miss Pingaux?

408
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,780
May I?

409
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,140
Please.

410
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:34,260
Tell me, is that Alain Bignon,
the examining magistrate?

411
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,020
Yes, that's him.

412
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:41,500
I don't think he recognised me
but we have met before.

413
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:47,380
No wonder, given what he's being
subjected to at the moment.

414
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,620
Just because he's spent his life
taking a bold stance.

415
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,540
It's true. It's intolerable.

416
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,380
Mr Bignon is like my boss.

417
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,780
Those men are too passionate
about their work, too sincere.

418
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,380
Judge Marcorelle
is impressive, isn't he?

419
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,140
He's had to be, believe me,

420
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,780
to shake this place up
the way he has.

421
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,820
Before his time

422
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:13,780
no important political figure
had ever been tried in the region.

423
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,020
That was 15 years go.

424
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,100
It was unheard of, you know.

425
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,940
Imagine the rogue's face.

426
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,340
I can imagine Puyricard's face.

427
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,100
He did all he could
to break him.

428
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:31,020
He found nothing
to reproach him for.

429
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:34,220
I wasn't very nice to him
the other day.

430
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:38,060
I should have remembered that
he knew the Nanterre shanty towns.

431
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,940
Instead of forming an ally
I seemed to offend him.

432
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,740
That was bad.

433
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:46,260
You're young.
It doesn't matter. I must go.

434
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,980
Do you think he could
have known my client back then?

435
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,020
I don't think so, no.

436
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,460
Thousands of poor people
lived there,

437
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,980
tens of thousands.

438
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:16,540
- Talk of the devil.
- State prosecutor Puyricard.

439
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,900
He's the source
of all our troubles.

440
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,100
Good day.

441
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,700
Seeing that guy unnerves me.

442
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:43,460
Miss Pingaux, I was going
to send a petition to the judge,

443
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,380
a profile of my client.

444
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,340
Can I hand it to him
in person?

445
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,460
Yes, all right.

446
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:57,860
Judge, Mr Fourcade
has a petition for you.

447
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,300
Your Honour.

448
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,220
Which case?

449
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,860
The Robert Viguier case.

450
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,860
Viguier?

451
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:09,540
He's just written to me to say
he has appointed Siderot.

452
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,700
Doesn't that mean
we're off the case?

453
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,820
Not that I know of.

454
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,420
But I haven't picked up my post yet.

455
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:20,220
Go and see.
You're bound to have this letter.

456
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,940
Yes, no doubt.

457
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:25,700
He must have wanted
a more experienced lawyer.

458
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,620
These things happen
to all young lawyers.

459
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,620
Don't take it personally.

460
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,540
I'm sure you're right.

461
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,420
Still, it's a shame.
It was an interesting case.

462
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:42,620
There will be others.
Come, now.

463
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:46,980
Your Honour.

464
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,300
That was harsh,

465
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,300
telling him like that.

466
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:00,820
Imagine him in court.
Viguier would get at least 20 years.

467
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,220
It's true that he's not very adept.

468
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,020
The case rests on the defence.

469
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,380
Siderot will be perfect.

470
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,700
Did you mention Siderot
to Viguier?

471
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,140
Hello.

472
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,260
Judge Marcorelle's office.

473
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,140
I'll put you through.

474
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,220
The drug squad,
returning your call.

475
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,420
Yes?

476
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,580
Polish?

477
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,780
No...

478
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,620
...complications?

479
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,180
All right.

480
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,860
Yes, yes.

481
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:48,140
It's for a case.

482
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,260
No, forget it.

483
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,020
Forget it, I said.

484
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,340
Yes, keep me posted.

485
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:44,620
Won't you come up for a drink?

486
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,860
Well, I...

487
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,580
There's no cognac
but I have vodka.

488
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,700
Well, in that case...

489
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,100
What's this?

490
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,420
Nicolas has been pestering me
to buy it for him for weeks.

491
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:10,100
- Whatever for?
- Who knows?

492
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:13,220
Sylvie's daughter is going
to get baptised, you know.

493
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,100
She told her mother
she was out demonstrating.

494
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,820
Instead she was at church
talking to the priest.

495
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,260
The youth of today!

496
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:40,620
- What was that?
- You chanting your slogans.

497
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,740
It sounds like a train pulling away.

498
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:47,380
- I don't see it.
- You never see it,

499
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,740
unless it's to do
with social issues

500
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,940
or the magistrates' union.

501
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,780
That's all you care about.

502
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,820
What's got into him?

503
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:00,980
If you spent a few days with us
you might find out.

504
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:05,140
I can't.
I'm too behind with my work.

505
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,900
Of course you are!

506
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:07,940
Fourcade.

507
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,500
What happened to you?

508
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:12,580
I made a mistake
so I was punished.

509
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:15,300
Punished? Because of me?

510
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,060
No, not because of you.

511
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,420
No?

512
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,860
Thank you.

513
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,980
Mum!

514
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,820
Quiet!

515
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,140
Really!

516
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:31,220
She was there, three rows behind me.
It wasn't a ghost.

517
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,780
- Did you catch her?
- Yes.

518
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,540
It was easy.

519
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,340
Let go of me.

520
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,540
Well?

521
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,860
She's Polish all right.

522
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:43,500
But she's a prostitute,
not a waitress.

523
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,860
She used the restaurant
for soliciting.

524
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,540
She has a good excuse.

525
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,820
Poverty, the dictatorship,
the mafia.

526
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,660
- The mafia?
- Yes, organised crime.

527
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:57,380
Poland had a thriving underworld
long before the fall of Communism.

528
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,660
Most of the PDS were in it.

529
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:02,260
Another thing
no one likes to mention.

530
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:06,740
- What about the dad you killed.
- He was her pimp, not her dad.

531
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,700
Some crook
who brought her to France

532
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,980
and forced her on the game
in this abandoned tower block

533
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:16,540
in collusion with the janitor
and the local police.

534
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,500
Bastards!

535
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:20,860
He just needed a few stitches
on his forehead and his skull.

536
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,500
He was a blockhead.

537
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:24,460
Polish prisons are full of them.

538
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,540
So she says.
I never saw him again.

539
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,820
I want to meet this guy
and talk to him,

540
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,100
compensate him
for nearly killing him.

541
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,700
- But he's gone back to Poland.
- No wonder.

542
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:38,180
That was her aim
when she took me back to hers.

543
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,900
She was writhing around
and shouting in Polish.

544
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:44,020
I didn't understand a word
but he understood.

545
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:46,660
After a while he got annoyed
and intervened.

546
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:50,500
And I hit him. Bang!
That was just what she wanted.

547
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,900
For him to get a thrashing
and return home.

548
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:56,060
- She's a plucky girl.
- But should I believe the girl

549
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,300
who dragged me
into that situation?

550
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:00,860
She was only trying
to escape prostitution.

551
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:04,780
That's typical of you, Georges.
All in a good cause.

552
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:06,260
- Then what?
- What?

553
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:10,700
Did you go back and watch the film
or did you take her to a restaurant?

554
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:13,540
No, we went to a café.

555
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:16,800
We talked.
She started talking.

556
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,420
We got talking.

557
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,020
- You talked.
- We talked.

558
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:24,700
And then, suddenly,
I don't know why,

559
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,740
she started talking about films.

560
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,820
So I talked to her
about classic horror films.

561
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:33,860
Vampyr, Dracula,
The Phantom of the Opera.

562
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:36,020
And since I've got
the videos at home,

563
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,060
I invited her back
to watch a film.

564
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:39,660
Did you, now?

565
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:41,660
We watched the film.

566
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:46,780
Agneska was obviously very sensitive
to the poetry of the characters.

567
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,940
And at the end,

568
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,260
I don't know what happened.

569
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:20,180
The credits stopped rolling
and I took her in my arms

570
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:24,220
She didn't object and...

571
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:41,140
- That's what I call a happy ending.
- It wasn't the end.

572
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:44,700
We saw one another again.
We went to the cinema a lot.

573
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:29,140
I don't know what to do
about this girl.

574
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,340
You've cheated on Claudie before.

575
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:36,060
I had to make up
for all those years as an activist.

576
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:39,300
I had kids, my work.

577
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:42,540
I'm not saying
I didn't stray, but...

578
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:45,500
This time you've taken it further.

579
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:48,100
No wonder, with a girl like that.

580
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:50,980
I hope she doesn't bear grudges.

581
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,420
Grudges?

582
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:55,780
After all she suffered
under Communism.

583
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:58,460
- Your Marxist past.
- That's true.

584
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:00,780
We haven't discussed that yet.

585
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,340
I'm kidding, you fool.

586
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:05,020
Make the most of it.
Let off steam. Have fun.

587
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:07,140
Live your life to the full.

588
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:10,700
You know, sooner or later
we all end up on the slab.

589
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:14,180
And when that day comes,
it's too late for regrets.

590
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:47,300
Time to get up.

591
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:53,900
Can you draw the curtains a bit?

592
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:57,180
Of course. The neighbours.

593
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:02,060
They're standing at the window

594
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:05,140
watching us with a telescope,
right?

595
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,700
They're taking photos

596
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:12,540
and they're going to hand them out
at the entrance to the law courts.

597
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:17,340
It's easy for you to make fun of me.
You don't suffer from anxiety.

598
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,420
My poor darling.

599
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:22,100
- Why are you like this?
- I don't know.

600
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:24,300
My father was the anxious type too.

601
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:26,700
My mother,
who was very religious,

602
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:29,300
said it dated
from the German occupation.

603
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:32,980
Really?
Was he in the Resistance?

604
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:35,340
The Resistance?

605
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,500
Sort of.

606
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:42,420
But my Grandpa said it was
what he didn't do that worried him.

607
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:45,060
Grandpa was anxious too,

608
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:47,020
but he knew why.

609
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:49,740
He served in the colonies army
during the '30s.

610
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:56,300
And at night his victims' ghosts
came... and tickled his feet.

611
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:59,380
It made him cry out in terror.

612
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:05,900
Anyway, after next week
you'll have nothing to worry about.

613
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:10,700
There will be no risk
of anyone seeing me here.

614
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:13,500
The end of the holidays.
What are we going to do?

615
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:15,340
We'll meet at my place,

616
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,540
my very own place.

617
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,700
What about your girlfriends?

618
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:22,420
I've found respectable digs
for next term.

619
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:24,140
Really?

620
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,020
In halls of residence.

621
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:29,140
Aren't halls of residence
reserved for students?

622
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,620
I am a student.

623
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:35,700
Well, almost.
I've enrolled on a law course.

624
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:38,780
- Why didn't you say?
- I wanted it to be a surprise.

625
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:41,020
I might have been able to help you.

626
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:43,860
I know quite a few teachers
at the university.

627
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:46,940
I'd rather do it myself.
I'm not a whore any more.

628
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:49,180
- That's not what I meant.
- Right.

629
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:54,100
I hope you'll let me help you
study in the evenings

630
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:57,500
without you seeing it
as a commercial transaction.

631
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:02,140
You can help me find a job.

632
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,340
That's the most important thing now.

633
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:07,460
- Don't you want to work for Kemal?
- No, thank you.

634
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:14,060
He'll only try to get his leg over.
He's a bastard.

635
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:16,340
Kemal?

636
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:20,220
He shags all his waitresses.
That's why they're always leaving.

637
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:22,100
It's hellish.

638
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,460
He seems like a decent guy.

639
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:26,820
He'll get into trouble with the law.

640
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:30,460
There's a hefty penalty to pay
for sexual harassment these days.

641
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:32,940
With the girls he employs
he needn't worry.

642
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:35,100
He knows he can get
anything he wants,

643
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:36,740
no problem.

644
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,580
You know,

645
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:40,740
there is one thing
that scares him.

646
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:44,260
The Kurds who come
to extort money for their movement.

647
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:46,820
He's meek as anything with them.

648
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:49,020
Extortion rackets?

649
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:51,220
In a nice town like Chambéry?

650
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:53,460
What are the police doing about it?

651
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:57,700
You should see
what the police get up to.

652
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:03,820
When do you have to report
to police headquarters?

653
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:08,620
Tomorrow afternoon.

654
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:10,060
I'll come with you.

655
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:13,940
It's not necessary.
It's a mere formality.

656
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:15,700
You're right.

657
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:20,260
I'll make on-the-spot enquiries,
ascertain the situation for myself.

658
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:24,060
I'll keep quiet until I've conducted
a preliminary investigation.

659
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:26,100
Incognito, naturally.

660
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:29,220
No one will even know I'm with you.

661
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:53,140
This could take a while.
You can go if you like.

662
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,820
No, I'll wait.

663
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:24,180
He says he can produce
a work contract tomorrow.

664
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:26,780
He has been working illegally
for six months.

665
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:29,060
If he had a contract,
we'd know about it.

666
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:31,900
Why is he here
if you already know the facts?

667
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:33,700
I'm just doing my job.

668
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:36,060
- Who are you?
- Never you mind.

669
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:38,780
Are you a journalist?
Doctors without Borders?

670
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:43,100
Calm down, will you? You appear
to have a guilty conscience.

671
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:44,740
Me, a guilty conscience?

672
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:46,860
Why would that be?

673
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:50,940
I don't know.

674
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:54,780
You called a foreigner in,
offering to renew his work permit,

675
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:58,180
whereas in fact
you were setting him a trap.

676
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:00,220
Go ahead, gentlemen.

677
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:01,780
Show me your papers.

678
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:05,500
Here we go.

679
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:10,260
That good old collaboration
between government and police.

680
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:11,860
Sir, I will not permit you.

681
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:13,860
My family was in the Resistance.

682
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:15,820
Your family must be proud of you.

683
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:17,420
Will you calm down?

684
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:19,700
Bureaucratic cowardice
enrages me.

685
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:20,900
What?

686
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:29,900
Shit!

687
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:39,660
Jesus!

688
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:41,020
Let me go!

689
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:45,620
Are you satisfied?

690
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:49,060
- I'm not dissatisfied.
- You poor fool!

691
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:58,420
Yes, I know.

692
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:00,180
A moment of madness.

693
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:02,660
Yes, sir, I lost my cool.

694
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:05,700
Yes, sir.

695
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:09,180
Of course, sir. Of course.

696
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:20,820
All right? Good evening.

697
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:23,340
- Good evening, Cédrique.
- Good evening.

698
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,500
It's him.

699
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:28,780
- What's he in for?
- Bag snatching.

700
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,860
We found him hiding under a car
clutching his victim's bag.

701
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:37,100
He said he'd found it
and got scared.

702
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:39,180
He denies everything.

703
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:42,140
He wants a lawyer
so I thought of you.

704
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:45,260
Thank you, Cédrique.

705
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:49,260
It's not the case of the century
but still...

706
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:52,060
My sincere apologies.

707
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:54,140
I understand.
You cracked up.

708
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:06,540
I got scared and panicked
so I hid under the car.

709
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:09,260
Why didn't you simply
return the bag?

710
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:12,540
I needed the money.
I had no choice.

711
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:14,460
So I hid.

712
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:16,740
Are you planning
to stick to that story?

713
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:18,340
It's the truth.

714
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:27,420
- Thanks.
- I panicked...

715
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:31,300
A colleague has parked your car
on the square.

716
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:35,220
Have a safe journey home, Judge.

717
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:38,460
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

718
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:48,740
What's Judge Marcorelle doing here?

719
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:51,780
He hit a government official
at police headquarters.

720
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:53,340
You should have seen him.

721
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,300
- At police headquarters?
- Yes.

722
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:23,180
Agneska.

723
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:37,380
Now you know everything
about the Chambéry police.

724
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:41,180
Was it a good experience?

725
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:57,380
They never caught
that South American guy, you know.

726
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:59,540
They can still run after him.

727
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:42,020
THE LAW

728
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:41,980
My dear comrades,

729
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:46,380
I am sad to be stepping down
as president of the union.

730
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:52,460
However, I am delighted to be
handing over to Claudie Marcorelle.

731
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:55,380
Claudie Marcorelle,
our future president.

732
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:04,460
What you did at police headquarters
was great.

733
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:07,900
- You are an example to us all.
- We contested the charges

734
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:11,380
brought against
our comrade Alain Bignon,

735
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:14,100
and won our case.

736
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:16,100
Alain Bignon is with us today.

737
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:21,020
But we must remain immobilised.

738
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:25,820
Our campaign for justice
continues to make waves

739
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:30,380
but we are taken for delinquents,
as was the case for Alain Bignon,

740
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:34,100
or for fools, as in the case
of our colleague Philippe Courcy

741
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:35,260
who denounced...

742
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:41,460
Who is this?

743
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:44,660
He is...

744
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:53,180
He is an eminent member
of the magistrates' union, sir.

745
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:58,180
His wife is about to take over
the leadership of this union.

746
01:00:58,340 --> 01:01:01,260
Are you talking
about Judge Marcorelle?

747
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:02,820
Precisely.

748
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:05,820
The incident at police headquarters?

749
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:07,460
Among other things.

750
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:12,060
But I wanted to tell you
something else about Marcorelle.

751
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:14,060
About his relationship with a girl

752
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:17,620
who was recently a prostitute
working in this town

753
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:19,900
and who has remained in contact

754
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:22,380
with the Polish network
she was part of.

755
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:26,340
A Polish prostitution network?

756
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,140
A network known to the police

757
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:31,540
who are just awaiting your orders
to arrest its leaders.

758
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:34,100
I tend to leave it
to the men on the ground

759
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:36,540
to decide
who to arrest and when.

760
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:41,380
Unless your intervention
is necessary.

761
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:44,820
Given your determination
to limit the growing influence

762
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:46,940
of Mr and Mrs Marcorelle's
union...

763
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:50,580
I thought that perhaps...

764
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:52,700
You thought, my dear Fourcade?

765
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:59,460
That you could launch an inquiry
into the members of this network

766
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:01,780
and put Judge Marcorelle
on the case.

767
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:03,260
You have the power.

768
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:07,020
To what end?

769
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:11,340
To force Marcorelle
to commit the worst crime

770
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,100
a magistrate can commit.

771
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:17,540
Abuse of authority?

772
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:22,740
Is Marcorelle intimate enough
with this network

773
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:25,260
for us to talk
about an abuse of authority?

774
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:31,820
His intimacy with a certain
Agneska Makovietz is indisputable.

775
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:35,820
I can confirm that she has remained
in close contact with her friends.

776
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:39,820
Marcorelle is either in direct
or indirect contact with the gang.

777
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:44,100
We have no concrete proof.

778
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:47,260
And Marcorelle has the right
to refuse to take on the case

779
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:49,020
on the grounds of conscience.

780
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:53,660
He can hardly admit to knowing
Polish pimps and drug dealers.

781
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:56,340
But you can count on me
for word to get round.

782
01:02:56,500 --> 01:03:00,260
You're more formidable
than you seem, Fourcade.

783
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:05,460
That's the name of a submarine.
I'm trying to emerge, not sink.

784
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:06,420
Yes.

785
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:10,340
Impatient but formidable.

786
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:37,980
PRISON

787
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:13,740
Youri Stefanovitch

788
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:21,500
and Boris Alexeiev,
both of Lithuanian nationality.

789
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:25,380
Januz Zalewski,
of polish nationality.

790
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:26,620
That's right.

791
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:28,060
Are you his lawyer?

792
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:31,140
Chambéry court
has ordered

793
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:37,460
your joint indictment
for procuring, supplying drugs,

794
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:41,660
and attempting to murder
Alexander Yakovlev

795
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:43,260
of Russian nationality,

796
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:45,100
a member of your network

797
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:47,140
currently in the prison hospital.

798
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:48,700
Is that right?

799
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:57,580
Are you suffering?

800
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:04,460
Your Honour, if you're wondering
where he got these scars,

801
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:07,860
they are not the only ones.
Look.

802
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:16,940
My client was subjected
as a teenager

803
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:22,140
to barbaric violence perpetrated
by the constitutional authorities

804
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:24,740
of a country that put
transforming mankind

805
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:27,380
on the statute book.

806
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:28,540
Mr Zalewski,

807
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:32,580
under what circumstances
were the blows whose scars you bear

808
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:35,580
administered to you?

809
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:44,620
He can't remember, your Honour.

810
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:47,420
How long have you been living
in the region?

811
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:52,540
He can't remember.

812
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:55,140
What are you getting at,
your Honour?

813
01:05:57,180 --> 01:06:00,100
I'm just trying to understand,
that's all.

814
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:06,460
It's not him.

815
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:08,900
How can you tell
from these forms?

816
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:11,660
If that was him,
I'd recognise him, believe me.

817
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:13,700
He had the same voice and build

818
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:15,820
and scars where I hit him.

819
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:18,860
All Polish gangsters
have scars on their heads.

820
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:21,020
It's a sign of recognition,

821
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:22,500
of pride.

822
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:28,180
Didn't you say
he was called Januz?

823
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:30,820
Thousands of Poles
are called Januz.

824
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:33,140
My pimp changed his identity
every week.

825
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:35,500
I don't even know
what his real name was.

826
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,540
You must find him, Agneska.

827
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:39,500
I must meet him.

828
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:40,820
Find him?

829
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:45,740
Do you think guys like that
leave a forwarding address?

830
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:49,020
There must be a café or bar,
some dive he frequents.

831
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:51,100
You must have met him somewhere.

832
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:53,140
Yes, in a bar in Warsaw.

833
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:56,100
Pimps picked up young girls there
so it closed down.

834
01:06:56,260 --> 01:06:58,060
That's why they sent me here.

835
01:06:58,220 --> 01:06:59,620
It seems incredible.

836
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:01,100
If Januz is alive

837
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:04,100
he will have been in touch
with people you know.

838
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:09,140
You'll never find him, François.

839
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:12,380
The police have been looking for him
for years to no avail.

840
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:15,100
What if he is the guy
who was in my office earlier?

841
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:18,900
A bastard like him
should be convicted, that's all.

842
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:23,380
You're blinded by hatred, Agneska.

843
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:25,700
You must reason and forgive.

844
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:28,500
Forgive?
You're worse than a Pole

845
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:30,860
and more hypocritical
than John Paul II.

846
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:32,020
What?

847
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:35,740
What exactly are you afraid of?

848
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:37,300
Divine justice?

849
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:40,740
You need to have killed Januz
as if he was the devil incarnate.

850
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:50,140
In my darkest nightmares
I've never been in this situation.

851
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:53,340
Having to judge a man
I might have killed.

852
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:55,180
Do you understand that?

853
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:58,300
No, you don't understand.

854
01:07:59,180 --> 01:08:02,820
1,000 times I've wondered
about criminals I've had to judge,

855
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:06,260
whether if I'd been in their shoes
I would have done the same.

856
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:09,180
No one is totally innocent, Agneska.

857
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:12,140
You no more than the rest.
But this...

858
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:15,140
- What have I done?
- What have you done?

859
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:17,220
Have you forgotten the tower block,

860
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:19,620
the trap you set for us?

861
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:21,300
It's a miracle if he's alive.

862
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:22,980
A miracle or a curse.

863
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:29,780
I'm telling you, it's not him.

864
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:34,980
- Where are you going?
- I need some fresh air.

865
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:38,020
Poor François.

866
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:42,100
You never kill anyone but
you think you killed everyone.

867
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:45,420
You should see a psychoanalyst.
You'd feel better for it.

868
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:20,380
Hello? Can I speak
to Mr Puyricard, please?

869
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:22,260
It's Miss Makovietz.

870
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:25,740
Makovietz.

871
01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:51,260
Right.

872
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:53,100
She suffered under socialism.

873
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:57,260
Guys like us never sought
her opinion on universal happiness.

874
01:09:57,420 --> 01:09:59,740
That's no reason
to want to get even.

875
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:01,980
Can you imagine
a law student,

876
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:04,980
perhaps a future judge,
prosecutor or lawyer,

877
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:07,460
having that attitude?

878
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:11,140
It's incredible
this total absence of guilt.

879
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:14,380
She's totally lacking in scruples
and discernment.

880
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:17,660
François, Agneska has a point.

881
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:28,100
- Why do you feel guilty?
- Not you as well.

882
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:30,220
I'm just trying to understand.

883
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:35,220
There is a group of people who think
they've committed imaginary crimes,

884
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:37,380
crimes they read about in the paper.

885
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:40,460
- Some of my patients are like that.
- Please, Georges,

886
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:43,580
Don't bring your vast
scientific knowledge into this.

887
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:45,420
You'll only confuse the issue.

888
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:50,100
Police stations are full
of false culprits.

889
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:53,500
It's a modern phenomenon
and it's becoming more prevalent.

890
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:57,500
I'm talking about concrete facts,
not a modern phenomenon.

891
01:10:57,660 --> 01:10:59,220
I'm trying to decipher them.

892
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:01,700
Right, let's drop
the sociology lesson.

893
01:11:02,620 --> 01:11:05,260
How about psychoanalysis instead?

894
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:11,060
Give me some advice.
Tell me what to do.

895
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:13,980
Do your job.
That's all they're asking of you.

896
01:11:14,180 --> 01:11:16,740
If that guy is the pimp
who almost killed Agneska

897
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:19,940
for once you will have
full knowledge of the facts.

898
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:25,020
Listen, you saw that brute
go for that poor girl.

899
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:27,420
You felt his fetid breath
on your face,

900
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:30,060
his big killer hands
around your neck.

901
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:34,420
You are better placed than anyone
to judge this bastard's trial.

902
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:36,980
No, I can't do it.

903
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:39,220
- I'm going to stand down.
- You can't.

904
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:41,980
You need a valid reason
to stand down.

905
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:43,500
The conscience clause.

906
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:47,660
For a Polish pimp and drug dealer
with Fourcade as his lawyer?

907
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:50,420
What about Fourcade?

908
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:52,660
For years that guy
has been searching

909
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:55,700
for the slightest peccadillo
to get himself noticed.

910
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:59,380
He won't be satisfied
with the conscience clause.

911
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:03,700
This is too good an opportunity
for that go-getter to pass up.

912
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:06,740
He'll uncover the real reason
for you standing down.

913
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:11,220
Don't give him the satisfaction.

914
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:13,220
Think of Claudie and your kids.

915
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:16,300
Think of the battles
that await us.

916
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:52,700
Fourcade!

917
01:13:55,820 --> 01:13:57,460
That sounded like a bad one.

918
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:01,380
Yes, it was a bad one.

919
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:03,220
Unexpected too.

920
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:14,740
What's all this?

921
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:18,940
- It's for Dad. Now he asks me!
- Asks you what?

922
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:22,020
For advice on a client
I'm seeing this morning.

923
01:14:24,220 --> 01:14:27,020
Are you putting Nicolas to work
on your cases now?

924
01:14:27,220 --> 01:14:30,620
He's into religious phenomena.
I need his help to understand.

925
01:14:30,780 --> 01:14:32,820
This smacks
of some sort of ritual.

926
01:14:32,980 --> 01:14:35,100
It may be linked
to a possession ritual.

927
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:36,940
But I can't be certain.

928
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:39,220
I'd need more time.

929
01:14:39,380 --> 01:14:41,220
I get it.

930
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:42,820
I'm on my own yet again.

931
01:14:53,220 --> 01:14:54,220
Coming.

932
01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:09,180
Where did you find this?

933
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:11,580
Mum gave them to me
to use as a model.

934
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:13,700
I had to draft a leaflet.

935
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:16,340
- Really?
- What a load of waffle.

936
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:19,340
The middle and working classes,
the class struggle.

937
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:21,180
It's not exactly detailed.

938
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:23,620
A couple of the points
are still relevant.

939
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:26,220
Relevant? To what?

940
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:28,180
We've set up
a support committee

941
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:30,580
for a Kurdish family
facing deportation.

942
01:15:30,740 --> 01:15:33,340
The daughter is in my class.
Farousia.

943
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,260
You must have seen her here.

944
01:15:35,420 --> 01:15:38,740
I was given the job
of writing the leaflet.

945
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:42,540
- Are you OK? You look tired.
- Not at all. I'm fine.

946
01:15:45,980 --> 01:15:46,980
Thank you.

947
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:55,860
- Judge.
- Mr Fourcade.

948
01:15:56,020 --> 01:15:57,820
- Have you heard?
- About what?

949
01:15:57,980 --> 01:16:00,940
My client, Januz Zalewski,
died last night.

950
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:07,100
- What did you say?
- Internal bleeding.

951
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:09,460
Just like that,
for no reason?

952
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:12,140
It was all those blows
to his head.

953
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:14,860
All the same, so suddenly?

954
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:19,340
Sooner or later the effects
of brutality prove fatal.

955
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:23,020
Communism isn't the sole cause
of death for eastern Europeans.

956
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:25,100
Be serious.

957
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:29,700
A clot formed
on the right side of his brain.

958
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:32,900
It burst last night
and killed him.

959
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:35,180
I'm sorry.

960
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:38,220
We managed
to find a Polish priest.

961
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:40,540
The funeral is this morning.

962
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:41,700
This morning?

963
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:45,300
Yes, the body will be picked up
from the prison in 35 minutes.

964
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:49,940
Good day, Judge.

965
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:14,660
- Judge?
- Miss Pingaux.

966
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:17,820
Mr Djabi's lawyer just called.
He's on his way over.

967
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:21,140
We'll have to postpone the meeting.

968
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:23,900
I need to go to the prison cemetery.

969
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:26,820
Januz Zalewski has died
of a brain haemorrhage.

970
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:30,660
Zalewski, the Polish mafia?

971
01:17:33,660 --> 01:17:36,380
Don't go, Judge.
That's no place for you.

972
01:17:39,140 --> 01:17:42,300
Don't make the mistake you made
at police headquarters.

973
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:46,340
This has nothing to do with that.
It is a question of conscience.

974
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,340
You do realise
this is a mistake?

975
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:50,420
Please, Miss Pingaux.

976
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:14,780
- Judge.
- Sir.

977
01:20:00,020 --> 01:20:01,420
François.

978
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:44,500
So it was him.

979
01:20:46,060 --> 01:20:48,260
It was him.

980
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:50,860
What exactly
did he mean to you?

981
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:53,700
- Was he a member of your family?
- No.

982
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:55,660
He was the pimp
I told you about.

983
01:20:55,820 --> 01:20:58,500
So why have you come
to his funeral?

984
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:02,220
I came with his sister.
She's a childhood friend of mine.

985
01:21:02,380 --> 01:21:05,500
She wasn't responsible
for the harm Januz caused me.

986
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:08,300
He put her on the game too.

987
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:11,020
But why?
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

988
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:15,020
I couldn't, François.

989
01:21:15,180 --> 01:21:18,300
From the start
I've had no option but to lie.

990
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:22,660
From the start?

991
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:29,140
It was no coincidence that
you ended up in that tower block.

992
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:32,060
It was a deliberate attempt
to compromise you.

993
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:35,140
I was instrumental
in the operation, as was Januz.

994
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:36,980
He was in charge.

995
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:39,140
But who was Januz working for?

996
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:44,340
The guy who controls
the underworld in this town,

997
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:46,420
and the vice squad.

998
01:21:46,620 --> 01:21:49,140
He's your friend at the courts.

999
01:21:51,060 --> 01:21:52,500
Puyricard?

1000
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:58,060
He has files on all your friends
and on you too.

1001
01:21:58,260 --> 01:22:00,220
He set his sights on you.

1002
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:03,140
Januz was meant
to take photos of us together.

1003
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:04,700
Failing wasn't an option.

1004
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:08,100
I caused a scene
to prevent it happening.

1005
01:22:08,260 --> 01:22:12,580
As a result Puyricard
sent Januz back to Poland

1006
01:22:12,740 --> 01:22:16,500
and he left me alone
until that idiot Fourcharde...

1007
01:22:17,940 --> 01:22:19,500
Fourcade.

1008
01:22:19,660 --> 01:22:21,460
Fourcade got involved.

1009
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:24,620
He saw us together one evening.

1010
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:28,060
He followed me, identified me

1011
01:22:28,220 --> 01:22:31,580
and tracked down the girls
who were still working for Januz.

1012
01:22:31,740 --> 01:22:34,060
Then he took his findings
to Puyricard.

1013
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:35,500
It was some haul.

1014
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:39,420
What a nuisance for Puyricard.
What was he meant to do now?

1015
01:22:40,660 --> 01:22:43,340
So he had Januz locked up,

1016
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:46,300
with his agreement,
to land you in it.

1017
01:22:47,860 --> 01:22:52,140
You went mad and I got scared
so I warned Puyricard.

1018
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:55,500
And Januz died.

1019
01:22:55,660 --> 01:22:57,980
Do you mean Puyricard...

1020
01:22:59,780 --> 01:23:01,300
...killed him?

1021
01:23:01,460 --> 01:23:04,460
I didn't say that. All I know
is that you didn't kill him.

1022
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:08,780
Indeed. Lots of people
had a hand in his death.

1023
01:23:08,980 --> 01:23:13,500
Yes. It's been a long time coming
but it's for the best.

1024
01:23:32,700 --> 01:23:34,900
Are you still living in halls?

1025
01:23:35,060 --> 01:23:37,300
- I never see you.
- I've been working hard.

1026
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:40,180
The exams are tough
but I'm getting there.

1027
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:42,500
- Do you want to be a judge too?
- No.

1028
01:23:42,660 --> 01:23:45,260
Commercial law is more my thing.

1029
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:47,220
People never change.

1030
01:23:54,380 --> 01:23:56,420
Are you suffering?

1031
01:23:56,620 --> 01:24:00,060
Sooner or later the effects
of brutality prove fatal.

1032
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:18,660
Fourcade!

1033
01:24:23,220 --> 01:24:25,900
- You were there all along.
- Yes.

1034
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:29,700
- You've been made a fool of too.
- So it would seem.

1035
01:24:29,860 --> 01:24:32,860
Mr Puyricard is a false friend.

1036
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:35,900
He took me for a ride all right.
He's such a bastard.

1037
01:24:37,620 --> 01:24:41,260
But you have before you
the best case of your career.

1038
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:44,300
I'd have to bring down
all the town's magistrates.

1039
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:48,740
Precisely,
the right and the left.

1040
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:52,700
It's ideal.
All that counts is the truth.

1041
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:54,980
There's no real conflict.

1042
01:24:55,180 --> 01:24:58,260
Take on your friends and Puyricard?
Are you joking?

1043
01:24:58,420 --> 01:24:59,780
No, Fourcade.

1044
01:24:59,980 --> 01:25:02,740
You have the means
to clean up this mess.

1045
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:04,540
It will do us all good.

1046
01:25:04,740 --> 01:25:06,740
- I'll help you if you like.
- Help me?

1047
01:25:09,620 --> 01:25:11,860
You'll help me?

1048
01:25:12,020 --> 01:25:14,180
With my case, I mean.

1049
01:25:14,340 --> 01:25:15,740
And also with Puyricard.

1050
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:19,220
He's not as untouchable as all that,
you know.

1051
01:25:19,260 --> 01:25:23,460
You'll see.
Tongues will become untied.

1052
01:25:23,620 --> 01:25:26,860
You're talking as if
you weren't involved in the case.

1053
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:29,620
But by hiding
your relationship with Agneska

1054
01:25:29,780 --> 01:25:31,940
you've committed the worst crime.

1055
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:35,740
- You could go to prison for that.
- Don't worry about me.

1056
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:39,220
Concentrate on the case.
It's a good one.

1057
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:44,820
But I'm unintentionally mixed up
in this case myself.

1058
01:25:44,980 --> 01:25:47,620
What, you told the prosecutor

1059
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:51,500
you suspected a judge of having
a relationship with a prostitute?

1060
01:25:51,660 --> 01:25:53,420
There's no harm in that.

1061
01:25:53,580 --> 01:25:56,300
The fact that he took it further
and had a man killed

1062
01:25:56,460 --> 01:25:58,860
is hardly your fault.

1063
01:25:59,620 --> 01:26:01,500
That's still just a hypothesis.

1064
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:04,340
That Pole was killed.

1065
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:06,220
It's obvious.

1066
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:09,140
Start by requesting
another autopsy.

1067
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:11,300
And we will...

1068
01:26:11,460 --> 01:26:13,140
You will find the culprits.

1069
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:04,660
Marcorelle?

1070
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:14,940
Your case is in the paper.

1071
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:24,620
"After the arrest last month
of Judge Marcorelle,"

1072
01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:27,420
"found guilty of having hidden
his relationship"

1073
01:27:27,580 --> 01:27:30,300
"with a prostitute
in a case he was judging,"

1074
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:34,420
"Mr Fourcade has just had
Prosecutor Albert Puyricard indicted"

1075
01:27:34,580 --> 01:27:36,540
"for being an accessory to murder."

1076
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:40,340
"According to the lawyer,
Puyricard had his client killed."

1077
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:43,100
"Puyricard swears
that he is innocent"

1078
01:27:43,260 --> 01:27:46,380
"and his friends say it is a plot
against the judiciary."

1079
01:27:46,540 --> 01:27:47,540
Interesting.

1080
01:27:49,420 --> 01:27:52,060
He's making a packet
from your case.

1081
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:54,420
He'll hit the big time,
thanks to you.

1082
01:27:56,060 --> 01:27:58,940
It's not that simple.
Look at his face.

1083
01:28:00,340 --> 01:28:01,820
Exercise yard.

1084
01:28:04,140 --> 01:28:05,740
We've got a surprise for you.

1085
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:18,060
Well, well.

1086
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:20,060
Viguier.

1087
01:28:31,660 --> 01:28:33,340
My old mate.

1088
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:47,940
I too have encountered the demons
that brought Marcorelle here.

1089
01:28:48,140 --> 01:28:50,340
Perhaps I lack his courage
or his luck.

1090
01:28:51,940 --> 01:28:54,100
I must make arrangements.

1091
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:57,900
Half the town's dignitaries will
be joining Marcorelle here soon.

1092
01:28:58,060 --> 01:29:01,060
I'm afraid this case
has only just begun.
