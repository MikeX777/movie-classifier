1
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,796
<i>Welcome to the premiere
of "Pacific".</i>

2
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,077
We're about to see
Hollywood's hottest couple,

3
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,276
Diana Díaz, DiDi,
and Steve Richards.

4
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,997
<i>I heard the applause</i>

5
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,994
<i>and I felt I had achieved
what I'd been fighting for.</i>

6
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,914
<i>Even though I was having
the hardest time of my life.</i>

7
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,393
MADRID, 5 YEARS EARLIER

8
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,309
- See you tomorrow, girls.
- See you.

9
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,275
Mary, Trankimazin and booze
will blow you away.

10
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,238
I know, sweetie.
But I need to relax.

11
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,709
Go on, come with us.

12
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,629
<i>You've had a weird time,
you need a good party.</i>

13
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,156
Not weird, unbearable.
I'm sick of it.

14
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,511
I can't do this job anymore.

15
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,475
I'm leaving.

16
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,029
How? Where will you go?

17
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,510
Since I started doing this
I've stopped acting.

18
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,438
And that's my dream.

19
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,955
<i>That's what I want,
not this shit.</i>

20
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,158
I'm going to Miami.

21
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,313
Miami?

22
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,036
Do you think
the Yanks will accept you?

23
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,354
You're tired. Ask David for
a few days off and think it over.

24
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,678
I've made up my mind.

25
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,394
María!

26
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,828
What about me, Diana?
I need you.

27
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,274
Come with me.

28
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,795
Me?

29
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,313
I can't.

30
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,510
<i>I can't leave David.</i>

31
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,038
- Think it over.
- María!

32
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,353
He's stronger than me.

33
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,715
Are you coming, or what?

34
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,637
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

35
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,879
Here.

36
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,154
Not now.

37
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,670
When I tell you to do something,

38
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,479
you do it.

39
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,394
Got it?

40
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,354
Up!

41
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,952
<i>You're mine.</i>

42
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,514
You know that?

43
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,829
Damn it.

44
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,319
Mine.

45
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,393
María.

46
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,469
<i>- Hello?
- Mom?</i>

47
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,790
<i>Diana? What time is it?
Are you okay?</i>

48
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,270
<i>- Did I wake you up?
- No, it's okay. What is it?</i>

49
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,715
I'm leaving.

50
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,871
<i>Can't you come here?</i>

51
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,271
I can't end up a hairdresser
without having tried.

52
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,109
<i>In the end, without knowing it,</i>

53
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,638
<i>I took the most important
decision of my life.</i>

54
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,599
<i>I moved to Miami.</i>

55
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,869
<i>I'd heard the Latin connection
worked well there</i>

56
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,994
<i>and that it was
full of opportunities,</i>

57
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,429
<i>and I was ready to find them
and go for them.</i>

58
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,469
<i>Towels aren't included.
The room's up there.</i>

59
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,675
Thanks.

60
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,236
MARÍA, MIAMI IS GREAT,

61
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,233
YOU'D LOVE IT. THINKING OF YOU.

62
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,790
Diana Díaz.

63
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,080
<i>I went to every casting in town,</i>

64
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,755
<i>until I ran out of money
and energy.</i>

65
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,069
<i>I felt empty.</i>

66
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,708
VISITING AGENCIES ALL DAY.
RUNNING OUT OF CASH

67
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,350
<i>I was lost and far from home.
In another world.</i>

68
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,398
<i>I was alone, truly alone.</i>

69
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,075
Don't come back here
without money.

70
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,753
We don't want to see you again.

71
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,316
<i>- Don't come back here.
- Okay, okay!</i>

72
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,317
<i>I've been to some castings,
one of them will take me.</i>

73
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,953
And how are you?

74
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,314
<i>I'm fine.</i>

75
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,472
<i>I made a cake, that one you like.</i>

76
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,479
The biscuit and chocolate?

77
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,154
Yes, cookies and chocolate.

78
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,994
Are you all right?

79
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,111
<i>Yes.</i>

80
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,558
I was thinking about the cake

81
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,711
and how much
I'd like to be there.

82
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,190
<i>Diana, something's wrong,
I can tell.</i>

83
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,552
<i>No, Mom, it's just a bad line.</i>

84
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,830
<i>I have to go, I'II call you later.</i>

85
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,072
Take care, okay?
Call me again tomorrow.

86
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,312
<i>I love you so much.</i>

87
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,238
I love you too, Mom.

88
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,355
Bye.

89
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,558
Is something wrong?

90
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,553
Are you okay?

91
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,595
Yes.

92
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,911
<i>I'm looking for work.</i>

93
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,033
Your job is to mop.
Mop and mop,

94
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,953
and when you get done mopping,
mop some more.

95
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,678
There's always something dirty.

96
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,034
<i>There's your mop.</i>

97
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,034
<i>With no papers, the pay isn't much,
but you'll survive.</i>

98
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,594
So when do I start?

99
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,275
Now!

100
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,230
<i>Let's go!</i>

101
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,034
Let's get to work!
Wake up!

102
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,155
Let's move!

103
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,632
So it's settled then.

104
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,834
Pay me what you can
until you find a better job.

105
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,357
<i>It's only small,</i>

106
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,996
<i>but we'll make room.</i>

107
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,718
This is a sofa bed.

108
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,791
I didn't know
we could bring food home.

109
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,635
<i>We can't, but I do it
when they're not looking.</i>

110
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,238
<i>It's the least we deserve
for that shitty pay.</i>

111
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,836
Look, I've got chicken,
beans, rice...

112
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,310
I hide it in the bins
and then I bring it home.

113
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,395
- Are you hungry?
- Starving.

114
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,874
Then get stuck in.

115
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,514
<i>- Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.</i>

116
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,115
Apart from feeling like a fool.

117
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,157
I thought you were perfect.

118
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,436
I never saw anyone
fall over so well.

119
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,269
What's your name?

120
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,475
Diana.

121
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,074
I'm Robert. Nice to meet you.

122
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,118
You could teach me
how to fall some time.

123
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,708
We arrive on time here!

124
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,555
I'm taking those ten minutes
out of your pay.

125
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,274
- How was it?
- Awful.

126
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,039
They'll never take me.

127
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,395
But I met a cute guy.

128
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,994
Really? You tiger!

129
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,195
He's gonna call me.

130
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,999
Not only is she late,
now she's chatting!

131
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,994
You're here to work.
Everyone, get to work!

132
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,999
Have you've been here long?

133
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,833
About three months.

134
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,750
And you?

135
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,480
- Do you live here?
- No. I live in Los Angeles.

136
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,189
I'm an assistant,
but I really want to direct.

137
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,876
I always wanted to go
to Los Angeles.

138
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:16,790
Of course.

139
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,554
But most girls there
just want to bluff it,

140
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,439
do crappy roles
and get into Hello magazine.

141
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,434
They don't want to act,
they're happy doing perfume ads.

142
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,428
I don't know
if I should tell you this,

143
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,796
but I like you,
I want to help you.

144
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,351
I don't want to see you
in the Latin actress meat market.

145
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,193
<i>They get invited to
all the producers' parties,</i>

146
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,952
go with some gringo actor,

147
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,998
and will do anything
to avoid going back home.

148
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,596
They're victims of the agents,
producers and even themselves.

149
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,557
I don't want that for you.

150
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,470
Hey,

151
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,757
my friend Nora and I are going
to the beach later.

152
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,035
You want to come?

153
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,155
You bet.

154
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,952
If you make a film,
I could be your actress.

155
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,951
<i>- You'll have to seduce me.
- What?</i>

156
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,111
You'll have to seduce me!

157
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,718
I thought I already had.

158
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,234
Over here, girls!

159
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,514
<i>I can't do it! I can't go!</i>

160
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,240
Who's got the biggest?

161
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,353
Viva the Latina piss!

162
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,358
Bye, girls. See you tomorrow.

163
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,112
See you tomorrow.

164
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,718
Hey, take the rubbish out,
and we can go.

165
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,952
What have you got there?

166
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:16,911
Nothing.

167
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,752
Nothing, huh?

168
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,195
I know you steal food
from my uncle.

169
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,750
So let me feel your tits
or I'll tell him.

170
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,956
- Get off me!
- You like that, huh?

171
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,519
Let go!

172
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,194
Eat shit!
You horny Cuban bastard!

173
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,316
- I'll kill you!
- Easy, baby!

174
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,959
Let me go!

175
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,033
- Let go, you fucker!
- Back off, bitch!

176
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,714
What the fuck are you doing?

177
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,075
- He's a pervert.
- You two are sluts!

178
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,913
Come on, you scum!

179
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,789
Out! Both of you!
Get the fuck out!

180
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,632
Anything interesting?

181
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,637
Same as always.
Waitress in a hotel or a bar.

182
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,317
What are you smiling about?

183
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,756
<i>Who's lit up you face?</i>

184
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,875
It's Robert.

185
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,474
I like you.

186
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,470
<i>I can't believe that
now I met you I have to go.</i>

187
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,517
<i>I don't want to leave you.</i>

188
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,992
<i>Then don't.</i>

189
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,634
I told you, I always wanted
to go to Los Angeles.

190
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,789
Would you come with me?

191
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,794
<i>I'VE MET AN AMAZING GUY.
I'M GOING TO LOS ANGELES.</i>

192
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,077
I'M IN LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

193
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,628
Girls, a bit more to the right.

194
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,949
<i>That's it, smile!</i>

195
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,837
Sir, can you step on it?
I want to get there!

196
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,479
What a lovely house.

197
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,392
This is yours, Nora.

198
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,030
When I arrived from Mexico,
there were five of us in here.

199
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,111
Then the landlord kicked them out.

200
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,669
- The bathroom's over there.
- Thanks.

201
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,078
And this is my room.

202
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,594
<i>I've reserved a mansion
in Beverly Hills for you.</i>

203
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,955
Really?

204
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,275
Where am I going to sleep?

205
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,108
I think you'll have to sleep with me.

206
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,108
Oh, yes?

207
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,389
I'll introduce you to everyone
I know in the movie business.

208
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,830
I want you to meet Aldo Vega.

209
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,591
<i>Who's that?</i>

210
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,752
A friend.
His series is massive right now.

211
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,955
Really?

212
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,269
I'd like to wake up with you
every day.

213
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,953
Me too.

214
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,239
GOOD MORNING, PRINCESS.

215
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,672
FOLLOW THE ARROWS

216
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,231
HAVE A WONDERFUL DAY!
GET DRESSED UP.

217
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,311
PARTY TONIGHT
AT THE ANAHEIM CENTER.

218
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,355
Diana?

219
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,589
How are you?

220
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,314
Great.
I'm at Robert's place.

221
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,868
It's really cool.

222
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,557
I'm crazy about him,
you'll have to meet him.

223
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,755
Yes.

224
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,748
He's incredible,

225
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,071
he made breakfast for me,
with croissants!

226
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,232
<i>When are you coming?
You have to meet him.</i>

227
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,631
<i>- I'm sorry I can't be there.
- Me too.</i>

228
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,873
<i>And how are you?</i>

229
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,078
Pissed off.

230
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,235
David is an asshole, he can't
keep his eyes off Susi's ass.

231
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,277
<i>You should just dump him.</i>

232
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,069
<i>You know what? You're right,
I'm gonna ditch the bastard.</i>

233
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,756
<i>- Diana, I'll call you later!
- Okay, speak to you then.</i>

234
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,155
María!

235
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,909
María!

236
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,518
<i>Look, that's Aldo Vega.</i>

237
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,474
<i>Come on, I'll introduce you.
Aldo!</i>

238
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,669
Excuse me a moment, ladies.

239
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,710
<i>I'm so glad you made it.</i>

240
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,434
This is Diana.

241
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,828
- Hi, Diana.
- Hi.

242
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,430
Robert tells me you want to act.

243
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,555
Yes.

244
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,473
- You know what I love about cinema?
- What?

245
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,474
<i>You can reach out from the screen
and touch people's hearts.</i>

246
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,150
- You really want to act?
- Yes.

247
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,670
Perfect. You have an appointment.

248
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,832
- Can you play something lively?
- Of course, darling.

249
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,468
<i>Hey, bro, play "La Prima".</i>

250
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,357
Now you're talking!

251
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,673
You don't look Latina,
that will help you.

252
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,477
What?

253
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,757
You don't look Latina,
that will help you a lot.

254
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,153
I need to make a book.
Will you help me?

255
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,154
<i>Sure, we'll get some photos,
I'll introduce you to everyone.</i>

256
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,629
Really?

257
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,796
You'll be a great actress,

258
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,918
and I'll be a great director
with you as my muse.

259
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,758
- Your muse?
- Of course.

260
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,356
- What role will you give me?
- I see you...

261
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,998
being from Egypt.

262
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,118
- Like Cleopatra or something.
- Cleopatra!

263
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,755
Hello?

264
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:35,439
I GOT THE PART

265
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,473
I dreamed...

266
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,389
I dreamed it went wrong,
they were chasing us.

267
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,028
I dreamed it all...

268
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,870
I dreamed it went wrong,
they were chasing us.

269
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,915
Are you okay?

270
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,872
I hope I didn't make you look bad.

271
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,758
<i>No, don't worry,
you'll be fine.</i>

272
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,276
<i>Deep breaths, relax,
you'll be fine, okay?</i>

273
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,671
<i>- Hello.
- How's it going?</i>

274
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,799
I'm exhausted.

275
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,836
And you?

276
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,434
Really good.
I'm going to live with Joel.

277
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,471
<i>His room-mate is leaving
and he can't afford the rent.</i>

278
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,757
I'm going to miss you.

279
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,399
What's the matter?

280
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,109
Diana.

281
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,871
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

282
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,752
Yes, I'm just a bit tired.

283
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,549
<i>No, you're not okay,
I won't let you leave like this.</i>

284
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,188
Let's go to my place
and work on it.

285
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,591
No, no. I'm going home,
and anyway I look awful.

286
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,274
<i>That's not true, you're beautiful.</i>

287
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,078
I'll get changed and we'll go.

288
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,236
- A long day, huh?
- Yeah.

289
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,676
But this is your big shot
at being an actress.

290
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,956
You're not going to blow it,
are you?

291
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,393
I have to go.

292
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,035
I have to go!

293
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,191
<i>It's okay, Diana, it's okay.</i>

294
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,749
Robert is on his way home.
Aldo, don't.

295
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,354
<i>Diana, it's okay. Diana...</i>

296
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,315
Diana!

297
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,869
Don't leave.
Diana, come back here.

298
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,075
Diana!

299
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,195
Diana!

300
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,274
Robert?

301
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,120
<i>I'M SHOOTING UNTIL LATE.
DON'T WAIT UP.</i>

302
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,316
<i>I'll never let you leave.</i>

303
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,152
I'm not afraid anymore.

304
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,155
Make your lips nice and soft,
open your mouth...

305
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,315
and then grab me.

306
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,716
<i>I'll never let you leave.</i>

307
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,438
I'm not afraid anymore.

308
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,032
Where are you going?

309
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,918
Come back here.

310
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,112
I thought you were shooting.

311
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,437
Where were you, Diana?

312
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,871
I called, they said
you left with Aldo, hours ago!

313
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,918
Did you screw him?

314
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,312
<i>- Robert...
- No, don't tell me!</i>

315
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,754
- Robert, it's not that.
- Then what is it?

316
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,553
- Robert, forgive me.
- Shut up!

317
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,632
<i>It's over!
I have nothing to say to you!</i>

318
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,397
<i>I've been offered a shoot
in New York, and I'm taking it.</i>

319
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,518
When I get back, I don't want
to see you here. Ever again!

320
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,073
What happened?

321
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,113
I screwed up, Nora.

322
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,838
Robert has left me.

323
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,598
Can I stay with you?

324
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,719
Come on in.

325
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,797
You know you can
stay here anytime.

326
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,750
<i>- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.</i>

327
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,919
How are you?

328
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,431
I screwed it all up, Nora.

329
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,033
<i>I'm so stupid.</i>

330
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,958
<i>- I brought you some food.
- I'm not hungry.</i>

331
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,989
Sit up.

332
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,718
Sit up!

333
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,918
You can't go on like this,

334
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,638
you've got to eat something.

335
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,799
<i>Look at you,
you're just skin and bone.</i>

336
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,988
I'm leaving.

337
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,309
Where to?

338
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:33,114
<i>So far, I've had one shitty part
and I've ruined my life.</i>

339
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,477
What did you expect?
A fairytale?

340
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,757
The poor Spanish girl
who arrives and conquers Hollywood?

341
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,558
Don't make me laugh.

342
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,678
Now is the time to be strong.

343
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,790
When was the last time
you got dressed?

344
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,599
You won't get anywhere
with this hair.

345
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,397
Go for it, Diana.

346
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,833
Go for it.

347
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,275
María?

348
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,158
I have an agent now.

349
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,470
It's so cool. I did it.

350
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,516
Now I need to get a manager,

351
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,989
and once I make some money,
a business manager.

352
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,993
<i>It's complicated.
But I'll explain it to you.</i>

353
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,311
<i>I have to go to a party now.</i>

354
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,275
<i>Mary?</i>

355
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,916
David is fucking Susi.

356
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,834
But he says
he can't live without me.

357
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,477
<i>I can't go on like this.</i>

358
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,392
Really, I can't.

359
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,032
<i>Don't worry.</i>

360
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,554
I'm sorry.

361
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,069
I'm really happy for you.

362
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,670
I miss you so much, Diana.

363
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,192
I could come and see you.

364
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,830
<i>That's impossible right now.
I'm gonna be really busy.</i>

365
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,275
<i>Mary?</i>

366
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,598
<i>Okay, it doesn't matter.</i>

367
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,713
Diana, we'll talk later, okay?
I don't feel well.

368
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,110
<i>Okay. I'll call you. Bye.</i>

369
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,509
Stop it!

370
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:27,839
María.

371
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,517
She's a little busy.

372
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,518
Hold on a second.

373
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,198
Diana, it's María.

374
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,399
Mary, how are you?

375
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,471
<i>Looking forward to seeing you.</i>

376
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:45,834
<i>When are you coming over?</i>

377
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,834
You promised you'd come after
your last shoot two months ago.

378
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:50,796
<i>I know.</i>

379
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,110
And next week I start a new film.

380
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,554
But, hey, are you okay?

381
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,711
<i>Yeah. I'm doing good.</i>

382
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,440
<i>I've decided
I'm going to leave David.</i>

383
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,589
He denies it,
but I know he's cheating on me.

384
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,239
It's for the best.

385
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,958
That guy's an asshole, Mary.

386
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,872
<i>I mean it this time.</i>

387
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:12,074
<i>I'm going to quit
and find another job.</i>

388
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,390
Great.
I can send you some money.

389
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,988
Thanks, Diana,
you're the greatest.

390
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:20,957
<i>But it's okay, I'll find a way.</i>

391
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,031
Hey, Mary, I love you.

392
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:24,714
<i>Me too.</i>

393
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,111
<i>- Call me if you need to, okay?
- All right.</i>

394
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,638
Who were you talking to?

395
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,913
- What do you care?
- I care.

396
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:42,031
What's got into you?

397
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:44,919
Come here, María.

398
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,673
Please.

399
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:51,868
María.

400
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:57,551
You're the one I like.

401
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,831
You're the only one.

402
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:02,795
You know?

403
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,598
<i>You're a pig.</i>

404
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,792
<i>You're the only one I love.</i>

405
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,951
You're such a pig.

406
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:48,438
<i>I'll tell you about it later.</i>

407
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,515
What are you doing here?

408
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:49,594
I came to see you.

409
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,468
They said I had to meet
Cosmo Harris.

410
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:57,037
<i>I'm Cosmo Harris.
It's my gringo name.</i>

411
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:01,110
I swear, since I changed it
I've got more work.

412
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:06,996
Look at you, you're beautiful,
you look great.

413
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:10,356
<i>I hear you're doing really well.</i>

414
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,990
Now it's you
that can help me out.

415
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:18,758
Have you seen the script?

416
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:24,071
I sent it to the agency
but I didn't hear anything.

417
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:25,799
I haven't read it yet.

418
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:30,071
A lot of the character,
I wrote thinking about you.

419
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:36,277
This is so weird.

420
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:39,754
<i>I've imagined this moment
so many times.</i>

421
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:42,953
What are you laughing at?

422
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:45,788
At how full of surprises life is.

423
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:47,552
Just look at yourself.

424
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:49,517
You look incredible.

425
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:53,670
<i>You've got it all.
Everything you wanted.</i>

426
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:59,399
As for me,
I got on with my life.

427
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,073
I got married.

428
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:05,958
And work is starting to go well.

429
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:09,355
And if you accept the script,

430
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,431
I'll be able to make my movie.

431
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:18,953
What is it?

432
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:22,354
Robert,

433
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:26,076
why did you come back?

434
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:31,233
Because I think you're
the best actress for my film.

435
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:41,709
Diana.

436
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:24,908
<i>I'm sick of this.</i>

437
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:32,316
I just want a normal, quiet life.

438
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:34,035
Diana.

439
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:42,758
How can you have a normal,
quiet life with all this?

440
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:46,635
Diana,

441
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:49,158
you have everything.

442
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:50,914
Everything.

443
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,600
Do you think eating sushi,

444
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:58,320
burning incense
and drinking green tea

445
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:01,472
will bring you peace and harmony?

446
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:05,791
That is not real life.

447
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:10,354
Diana,

448
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:13,398
where are you?

449
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:16,718
I can't reach you.

450
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:18,313
Nora,

451
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,353
not you too.

452
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:24,316
Don't fail me, please.

453
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:32,831
I won't fail you,

454
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:36,873
but someone has to tell you the truth.

455
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:41,558
<i>- Did the transfer come through?
- Yes.</i>

456
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,912
<i>Oh, my love, what's the matter?</i>

457
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:47,317
<i>I hate to see you like this.</i>

458
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:49,277
<i>It breaks my heart.</i>

459
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:50,714
I don't know.

460
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:54,638
I can't take any more.

461
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:57,395
<i>Come home, sweetheart.
Come.</i>

462
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:58,788
<i>Come home, my love.</i>

463
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,473
I can't, Mom.

464
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:06,872
I need to have you around.

465
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:09,031
<i>Shall I come over there?</i>

466
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:12,749
<i>I'll come whenever you say,
just say the word.</i>

467
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:14,114
Yes.

468
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:17,909
<i>Don't cry, my love.
I'II come as soon as possible.</i>

469
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,709
<i>Diana Díaz, DiDi, is becoming
uncomfortable with her fame.</i>

470
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:28,270
<i>Hounded by paparazzi and rumoured
to have an eating disorder.</i>

471
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:30,829
<i>But she doesn't fit
the usual profile.</i>

472
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,195
<i>DiDi is the first Latin actress</i>

473
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:36,033
<i>who appeals to both audiences
and make up companies.</i>

474
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:38,270
<i>Now she just has to prove
she can act.</i>

475
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:41,716
<i>Her latest film, "Pacific",
opens this week,</i>

476
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:44,599
<i>in it she plays
one of her best roles.</i>

477
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:52,995
- Mom, will you go in that car?
- Okay.

478
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:54,953
<i>I'll see you later.</i>

479
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:35,075
A kiss.

480
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:59,593
A lot of people say
you got where you are

481
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:02,228
because you go out with
Steve Richards.

482
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:06,673
People think they know me because
I'm in magazines and movies,

483
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:09,400
but they don't know anything
about my life.

484
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:13,394
Is it hard being away from home
and in a new country?

485
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:18,795
Diana has done well for herself.

486
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:21,755
Diana Díaz.

487
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:24,152
Yes, it is tough.

488
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:27,756
But I got my mom
to move out to Los Angeles.

489
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:30,195
María has arrived.
She's waiting.

490
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:35,636
As I was I saying,
my mom moved to L.A. And...

491
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:39,270
Diana can't wait to see you,
but her schedule is really full.

492
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,192
She's doing interviews.

493
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,794
But she asked me
to look after you.

494
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:45,473
So make yourselves at home.

495
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:49,428
There's a minibar in the lounge.
Help yourself.

496
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:52,035
Other actors and actresses say

497
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:54,555
that this profession
is very tough.

498
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:57,917
What has kept you fighting
to achieve your dreams?

499
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:08,753
You're at a fantastic time
in your life

500
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:10,717
where you can choose two paths,

501
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:13,474
you can be a star,

502
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:15,758
or you can be an actress.

503
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:17,952
Which path do you prefer?

504
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,869
Is it true that you fought
with the director

505
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:25,318
because you refused to do
certain hot scenes?

506
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:26,549
No, we didn't fight.

507
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:30,235
We just spoke about
how to film the sex scenes.

508
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:35,191
How much of the old Diana Díaz
is there in DiDi?

509
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:38,716
How do you see the old Diana now?

510
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:41,440
Have there been times
when you were alone

511
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:44,160
in your hotel or walking
around Hollywood

512
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:46,470
when you thought about
going back to Spain

513
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:48,392
and giving up
this whole adventure?

514
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:51,757
What about your image
as this ambitious woman?

515
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:56,072
I think you have to be ambitious
in life to get what you want.

516
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:59,437
But you know that being
a Spanish woman

517
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:02,797
who has succeeded in Hollywood
has made you enemies.

518
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:05,791
<i>María, don't be like this.</i>

519
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:08,278
I'll be however I want.

520
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:11,234
Have another drink.

521
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:14,392
Do you mind being well known
for your private life?

522
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:17,950
I just do my job,
but people only care about

523
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:20,793
what I wear or how I dress,

524
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,518
my hairstyle and who I date.

525
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:25,035
Does a European actress in America

526
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:27,350
use sex or intelligence to succeed?

527
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:30,796
What about the American obsession
with using actors initials?

528
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:34,794
<i>In your case it's "D.D.",
another actress is called "P"...</i>

529
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:42,114
She thinks she's a diva,

530
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,911
but do you know what?

531
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:47,477
I don't care anymore.

532
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:50,989
Because I don't need her anymore.

533
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:53,710
Not her or anybody.

534
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:02,075
Leave me alone.

535
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:03,275
María.

536
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:06,078
- María.
- Leave me alone.

537
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:15,995
David.

538
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:27,149
What were you expecting?

539
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,430
Didn't you want to fuck her too?

540
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:33,795
Yeah, she left,
so you fucked Susi!

541
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:37,270
<i>Why don't you fuck Nacho too?
Go on, fuck Nacho!</i>

542
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:40,193
<i>You're a bastard!
You're a piece of shit!</i>

543
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:43,319
<i>- And now you're going to be alone!
- María!</i>

544
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:06,796
Hello?

545
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:07,915
<i>Diana?</i>

546
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:35,396
They brought the Paco Rabanne.

547
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:37,512
<i>You're going to love it.</i>

548
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:38,874
Diana,

549
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:41,670
you have to get dressed
and made up.

550
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:43,478
Stein is on his way.

551
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:46,350
Look, sweetie, it's beautiful.

552
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:50,710
Oh, my love,
please don't be sad.

553
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:51,871
Mom.

554
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:54,635
Diana, Stein is in the lounge.

555
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:57,438
<i>I'll go talk to him.</i>

556
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,033
Wait here for me.

557
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:05,952
Let me be alone with him.

558
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:18,193
Is it true you went to hospital
for anorexia?

559
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:21,352
Are you and Steve Richards
going to break up?

560
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:23,078
DiDi, just one question,

561
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:26,277
is it true about you
and Steve Richards?

562
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,389
How do you feel about the film, DiDi?
