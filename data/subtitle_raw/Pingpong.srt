1
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:38,178
Take your top off.
Nobody can see you here.

2
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:41,066
You know I don't like that.

3
00:01:41,485 --> 00:01:45,096
Anna, the dog!
- Schumann! Schumann!

4
00:01:46,892 --> 00:01:47,972
Paul!

5
00:01:49,387 --> 00:01:51,591
You hitchhiked here?

6
00:01:52,075 --> 00:01:54,116
I couldn't afford the train.

7
00:02:00,139 --> 00:02:02,823
Does my sister know you're here?

8
00:02:03,052 --> 00:02:06,247
I got money from Mom,
but it wasn't enough.

9
00:02:07,212 --> 00:02:11,652
I don't understand how you decided
to spend your vacaion here.

10
00:02:13,547 --> 00:02:14,725
Why?

11
00:02:17,035 --> 00:02:18,660
At the funeral, you told me

12
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:21,697
I could come any time
when home got too much.

13
00:02:25,865 --> 00:02:27,491
Robert!

14
00:02:31,242 --> 00:02:35,333
Robert needs a break
and something to drink.

15
00:02:38,345 --> 00:02:40,680
He doesn't drink enough.

16
00:03:06,089 --> 00:03:07,649
Hi.

17
00:03:08,808 --> 00:03:12,802
How are you?
- What are you doing here?

18
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:16,638
Vacation. Here...
You're supposed to drink more.

19
00:03:23,528 --> 00:03:25,732
Tell me. What are you doing here?

20
00:03:26,793 --> 00:03:30,437
I didn't feel like hanging out
a home the whole summer.

21
00:03:32,904 --> 00:03:36,799
You could have called.

22
00:03:37,448 --> 00:03:42,750
How long you staying?
- Don't know. Till I get bored.

23
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:47,712
Robert, why not come outside
since you're taking a break?

24
00:03:47,848 --> 00:03:50,084
I didn't want a break.

25
00:03:57,256 --> 00:03:58,466
What?

26
00:04:00,103 --> 00:04:01,924
Sorry about Frank.

27
00:04:03,463 --> 00:04:07,139
Thanks.
- It must have been tough.

28
00:04:09,478 --> 00:04:12,129
You weren't at the funeral.

29
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,358
I couldn't.

30
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:25,660
You changed everything around.
- Not everything.

31
00:04:26,213 --> 00:04:27,872
But a lot.

32
00:04:33,158 --> 00:04:35,067
What's grandma say?

33
00:04:36,453 --> 00:04:40,544
What can she say?
She doesn't notice anymore.

34
00:04:42,788 --> 00:04:46,815
Frank planted that cherry tree.
We left it there...

35
00:04:49,381 --> 00:04:51,454
sort of a memorial.

36
00:04:51,652 --> 00:04:54,109
- Robert!
- What? It's true.

37
00:04:55,206 --> 00:04:58,107
Anna, where should Paul sleep?

38
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,618
The guest-room's no good.
It's too damp and dreary.

39
00:05:04,645 --> 00:05:07,263
Not with me. My room's too small.

40
00:05:13,956 --> 00:05:15,068
I...

41
00:05:15,588 --> 00:05:18,076
I can sleep in the kids' room.

42
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:22,847
It's mine now, but we can
put you in there for now.

43
00:05:23,715 --> 00:05:24,926
You smoke?

44
00:05:37,028 --> 00:05:40,345
This is a sleeper.
We can turn it into a bed.

45
00:05:44,482 --> 00:05:47,166
Make yourself comfortable.

46
00:05:50,914 --> 00:05:53,565
Paul, how long do you want to stay?

47
00:05:53,731 --> 00:05:55,072
Don't know.

48
00:05:57,634 --> 00:05:59,522
I'll call your mother.

49
00:06:02,147 --> 00:06:04,219
She won't be home.

50
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:17,178
Susanne, Stefan here, your brother.
Paul is at our house.

51
00:06:17,346 --> 00:06:20,379
Give me a call
when you're back. Bye. Ok.

52
00:06:22,785 --> 00:06:26,234
Paul, I'd appreciate it
if you wouldn't smoke in here.

53
00:06:27,746 --> 00:06:30,080
No problem.
- Fine.

54
00:07:10,528 --> 00:07:12,796
He takes after Frank, doesn't he?

55
00:07:15,264 --> 00:07:18,713
We should set a limit.
- We can't do that.

56
00:07:19,104 --> 00:07:23,741
Of course we can. Your sister could
have asked if it's alright with us.

57
00:07:25,503 --> 00:07:27,838
Maybe it's a peace offering.

58
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:30,902
You know she doesn't talk much.

59
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:35,381
You think she knows he's here?

60
00:07:36,575 --> 00:07:38,102
She'll call.

61
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,694
Don't you use it anymore?

62
00:07:52,223 --> 00:07:53,205
No.

63
00:08:02,206 --> 00:08:03,732
What's up?

64
00:08:08,671 --> 00:08:11,801
The Berg Sonata is giving me problems.

65
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,296
The middle section is really hard.

66
00:08:15,005 --> 00:08:18,202
Now idea how I'll have it ready
for Saturday.

67
00:08:19,134 --> 00:08:20,921
What's on Saturday?

68
00:08:21,373 --> 00:08:23,413
I have an audition.

69
00:08:26,142 --> 00:08:27,549
Exciting.

70
00:08:28,637 --> 00:08:32,379
The Leipzig Conservatory's
young students class.

71
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,085
Young students...

72
00:08:37,245 --> 00:08:39,099
Still play table tennis?

73
00:08:47,836 --> 00:08:49,844
Tha wasn't much, huh?

74
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:52,439
You won't get it.

75
00:08:57,308 --> 00:08:58,454
Robert!

76
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,268
Seen the grill tongs?

77
00:09:03,324 --> 00:09:08,058
Why didn't you say so?
Let me play! Give me the paddle.

78
00:09:14,267 --> 00:09:16,439
You think I'm not up to it.

79
00:09:20,091 --> 00:09:20,984
Hey!

80
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,768
Schumann! Come here!

81
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,444
Yes!

82
00:09:36,124 --> 00:09:37,072
Yes!

83
00:09:37,787 --> 00:09:38,715
Hey!

84
00:09:45,914 --> 00:09:48,597
Robert, turn the sausages.

85
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:52,531
You do it, Paul.
I don't have a free hand.

86
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:53,593
Robert.

87
00:10:00,602 --> 00:10:01,910
Alright. Fine.

88
00:10:12,698 --> 00:10:14,585
Well then...

89
00:10:15,417 --> 00:10:16,595
Cheers.

90
00:10:18,553 --> 00:10:19,861
Dear Paul,

91
00:10:19,992 --> 00:10:24,149
welcome to our house,
that is also your house.

92
00:10:24,313 --> 00:10:28,274
We are very happy
that you and your mother...

93
00:10:29,977 --> 00:10:34,101
That you have decided to set aside
the old conflicts,

94
00:10:34,777 --> 00:10:37,330
that were material in nature...

95
00:10:37,753 --> 00:10:41,550
and that you've come to see us.

96
00:10:42,168 --> 00:10:46,423
I know things haven't been
easy for you laely.

97
00:10:46,585 --> 00:10:51,286
The financial difficulties...
- You know what? Let's just toast.

98
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,431
Yes.

99
00:10:53,784 --> 00:10:56,402
To a nice couple of days.

100
00:10:59,863 --> 00:11:04,468
What do you think when you hear
"Aspirin?" - Why do you ask?

101
00:11:04,983 --> 00:11:08,279
Rendske wants to develop
a new slogan for Aspirin.

102
00:11:09,432 --> 00:11:12,977
He started a naional campaign...
- How did Frank kill himself?

103
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:26,455
His current favorite is,
"Aspirin - Wellness afterwards."

104
00:11:27,797 --> 00:11:30,002
I can't take anymore "Wellness."

105
00:11:30,134 --> 00:11:33,550
They even created a new position,
" Wellness Coach."

106
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:38,319
He wants to subject all managers
to a "wellness check-up."

107
00:11:39,478 --> 00:11:40,885
I've had enough.

108
00:11:41,015 --> 00:11:44,789
They waste money on that
while cutting the training department.

109
00:11:44,982 --> 00:11:49,260
A wellness check-up would do you good.
- Over my dead body.

110
00:11:49,527 --> 00:11:51,860
Paul, no! Not from the table.

111
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,982
Not from the table.

112
00:12:02,294 --> 00:12:03,406
Good night.

113
00:12:03,828 --> 00:12:04,844
Night.

114
00:12:33,523 --> 00:12:38,160
Why didn't you open it up?
- I like to sleep on the floor.

115
00:12:46,387 --> 00:12:47,060
Ready.

116
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:47,148
Ready.

117
00:12:53,556 --> 00:12:54,701
Good morning.

118
00:12:55,411 --> 00:12:56,339
Morning.

119
00:12:57,972 --> 00:13:02,227
Sleep well?
- I slept... okay

120
00:13:02,452 --> 00:13:07,088
- The room really stank.
- Paul, not at breakfast, I don't like it.

121
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:15,179
Robert, don't forget
we need to trim the cherry tree.

122
00:13:15,347 --> 00:13:18,445
I'd like you and your father
to take care of it.

123
00:13:19,442 --> 00:13:21,036
I can do that.

124
00:13:21,203 --> 00:13:26,767
Give me a bread roll? - That's nice
of you, but my men can handle it.

125
00:13:28,754 --> 00:13:30,991
I can take care of your pool.

126
00:13:33,171 --> 00:13:34,316
Aha.

127
00:13:35,891 --> 00:13:39,435
Somebody should fix it up.
Then we could swim here.

128
00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:42,991
We?

129
00:13:45,361 --> 00:13:48,810
It'd be nice in this weather.
- Somebody's sucking up.

130
00:13:56,945 --> 00:13:58,767
Can you do that?

131
00:14:00,114 --> 00:14:03,562
I learned a thing or two from my faher.

132
00:14:19,312 --> 00:14:22,695
Is it true that Frank was broke?
- What?

133
00:14:23,471 --> 00:14:26,767
Was he broke?
- Who told you that?

134
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:28,840
Mom.

135
00:14:29,457 --> 00:14:30,405
And?

136
00:14:31,664 --> 00:14:33,355
It's not your business.

137
00:14:36,303 --> 00:14:37,831
Just asking.

138
00:14:51,087 --> 00:14:52,101
What the...

139
00:14:59,758 --> 00:15:02,606
What are you doing?
- Measuring the pool.

140
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:05,833
Yes, boy...
What are you doing?

141
00:15:05,935 --> 00:15:09,579
I'm measuring the pool
to figure out how many tiles we need.

142
00:15:10,062 --> 00:15:14,089
Must be...
...about 15 square meters.

143
00:15:16,911 --> 00:15:18,732
You can really do this?

144
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,095
Sure.

145
00:15:23,886 --> 00:15:25,315
I have time.

146
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,185
Hi, Paul.
- Stefan? - Hi.

147
00:15:34,798 --> 00:15:39,076
I have to go to Madrid.
I have no choice. Tregomain is sick.

148
00:15:39,246 --> 00:15:40,195
Tomorrow?

149
00:15:40,334 --> 00:15:43,050
Tonight. My plane leaves at 1 0:1 5

150
00:15:43,405 --> 00:15:44,484
For how long?

151
00:15:44,621 --> 00:15:49,029
Awhole week. - Tregomain calls in
sickwhenever he wants. You never do!

152
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:52,393
Rubbish!
- But your family is coming to visit!

153
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,176
I didn't know and I can't change it!

154
00:15:59,628 --> 00:16:02,411
Paul offered to tile the pool.

155
00:16:03,181 --> 00:16:05,799
That's great. Very good.

156
00:16:06,252 --> 00:16:08,837
It might be asking too much of him.

157
00:16:10,412 --> 00:16:15,016
If he offered it himself...
- I can do it. No problem.

158
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:18,024
The time...

159
00:16:18,923 --> 00:16:21,380
Paul, how long would tha take?

160
00:16:22,988 --> 00:16:26,120
Aweek to do a good job.

161
00:16:29,004 --> 00:16:34,600
We could pay you. Wha do you think?
- Good idea.

162
00:16:34,923 --> 00:16:39,048
Then you won't have to hitchhike.
You can even go first class!

163
00:16:39,308 --> 00:16:41,861
Playing the good Samaritan today?

164
00:16:41,962 --> 00:16:43,206
Man...

165
00:16:44,395 --> 00:16:46,370
That's great.
- What?

166
00:16:47,115 --> 00:16:49,319
Paul's going to fix up the pool.

167
00:16:51,754 --> 00:16:54,024
I would also like to travel again.

168
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:58,594
Nobody's stopping you.
Take a trip.

169
00:16:59,883 --> 00:17:02,022
Wouldn't you like to see Vienna again?

170
00:17:02,634 --> 00:17:05,154
With Schumann in my suitcase or wha?

171
00:17:10,122 --> 00:17:12,512
The boy is totally uncomplicated.

172
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:16,266
And Robert's here, too.
They get along well.

173
00:17:16,426 --> 00:17:21,063
Robert has better things to do.
- I'll be back Monday.

174
00:17:22,602 --> 00:17:26,628
I promise I'll do something
with the boys when I'm back.

175
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:30,403
Smell.

176
00:17:30,857 --> 00:17:32,199
What is it?

177
00:17:32,746 --> 00:17:35,462
White rum. Want some?

178
00:17:35,977 --> 00:17:37,832
Maybe laer.

179
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,076
Don't they know?

180
00:17:49,449 --> 00:17:52,034
How? It looks like waer.

181
00:17:52,136 --> 00:17:55,235
Robert! Come say goodbye.

182
00:17:58,441 --> 00:18:00,164
Go say goodbye.

183
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:11,069
Please get changed.
- Paul!

184
00:18:11,496 --> 00:18:12,772
Ciao!

185
00:18:29,415 --> 00:18:31,171
You giving up already?

186
00:18:38,663 --> 00:18:41,510
What's up? Come on! Let's go!
Here's your leash. Come on.

187
00:18:55,111 --> 00:18:56,899
Paul! Are you crazy?

188
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:01,057
What? You don't want to swim?
- Yes, but not here.

189
00:19:02,022 --> 00:19:03,844
The pond is dead.

190
00:19:03,974 --> 00:19:06,112
Nitrate contamination.

191
00:19:08,229 --> 00:19:12,932
You're not going in there, no!
You're not going in there!

192
00:19:47,493 --> 00:19:49,467
That go any louder?

193
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,816
Where did you find that?

194
00:19:55,844 --> 00:19:57,666
Brought itwith me.

195
00:19:59,972 --> 00:20:02,427
Hold on, the cops are on my tail.

196
00:20:03,812 --> 00:20:05,372
Bloody helicopter...

197
00:20:07,747 --> 00:20:10,595
Feel like playing?
I have another controller here.

198
00:20:11,652 --> 00:20:14,685
No thanks, I don't like shooters.

199
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,574
This isn't a shooter!

200
00:20:17,188 --> 00:20:19,522
Turn it down. I'm going to sleep.

201
00:20:19,971 --> 00:20:21,695
Okay.

202
00:20:31,138 --> 00:20:33,374
Do you like that? Yeah?

203
00:20:33,604 --> 00:20:35,578
Do you really like that?

204
00:20:36,642 --> 00:20:40,123
Yes, you like it!
Yes, you like it!

205
00:20:41,026 --> 00:20:42,238
Nice!

206
00:20:43,266 --> 00:20:46,048
Oh yes, I like that, too!
- Good morning.

207
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:50,042
Morning.

208
00:20:52,995 --> 00:20:57,915
Would you like some fresh orange juice?
- Yes, please.

209
00:21:07,202 --> 00:21:11,097
Saturday is Schumann's birthday.
Guess how old he'll be.

210
00:21:11,489 --> 00:21:13,791
Ten?
- Ten!

211
00:21:14,561 --> 00:21:17,694
Four! Four years old. Come here.

212
00:21:17,826 --> 00:21:20,826
So... Yes, he likes that.

213
00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:22,816
Yes.

214
00:21:24,931 --> 00:21:26,753
Crisp-bread?

215
00:21:27,682 --> 00:21:30,943
Will you manage all the Berg today?
- I did yesterday.

216
00:21:31,074 --> 00:21:34,205
Play it like that and
we don't need to go to the audition.

217
00:21:34,657 --> 00:21:37,275
Come! Sit. Sit. Sit.

218
00:21:37,858 --> 00:21:39,264
I said sit!

219
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:47,675
I thought what he played yesterday
sounded really good.

220
00:21:49,664 --> 00:21:50,746
There you go.

221
00:21:51,554 --> 00:21:53,441
That's good.

222
00:22:00,994 --> 00:22:02,073
Jerk!

223
00:22:19,103 --> 00:22:21,885
Stop it now! Don't play with
your food, children!

224
00:22:22,368 --> 00:22:25,336
I was going to wash anyway.

225
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:33,566
Put that here, please.
I'll do the rest.

226
00:22:47,326 --> 00:22:48,439
Yes?

227
00:22:57,214 --> 00:23:01,241
Robert, way too much!

228
00:23:01,535 --> 00:23:03,323
First piano, then crescendo!

229
00:23:03,486 --> 00:23:05,558
But that's what I did!

230
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:17,877
Paul!

231
00:23:19,677 --> 00:23:21,106
Table tennis!

232
00:23:23,133 --> 00:23:24,246
Okay.

233
00:23:30,686 --> 00:23:34,777
What's wrong?
- Her and her authority-complex.

234
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,198
Robert!

235
00:23:44,349 --> 00:23:45,975
Robert, come inside!

236
00:23:50,845 --> 00:23:52,634
Paul, what about the pool?

237
00:23:53,596 --> 00:23:58,615
I suggest you get on with that
and we'll work on the Berg sonata.

238
00:23:58,844 --> 00:23:59,859
Serve!

239
00:24:02,812 --> 00:24:04,089
It's okay.

240
00:24:09,724 --> 00:24:11,131
Are you coming?

241
00:24:51,003 --> 00:24:55,029
I'm taking Schumann for a walk.
Are you coming?

242
00:25:11,994 --> 00:25:13,139
Hello?

243
00:25:16,858 --> 00:25:20,173
I'm taking Schumann for a walk.
Want to come?

244
00:25:23,098 --> 00:25:24,210
Okay.

245
00:25:26,329 --> 00:25:28,785
Do you get along with your mother?

246
00:25:30,649 --> 00:25:32,242
Well...

247
00:25:37,464 --> 00:25:39,853
Is she doing better now?

248
00:25:42,328 --> 00:25:44,466
Don't know. We don't talk much.

249
00:25:44,536 --> 00:25:47,285
Would you like her
to talk with you more?

250
00:25:48,409 --> 00:25:52,270
You know she talks a lot,
but she's always complaining.

251
00:25:52,376 --> 00:25:57,014
You have to understand her.
It's a difficult time. - Yes, I know.

252
00:25:57,272 --> 00:25:58,646
You do?
- Sure.

253
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:07,149
You must miss Frank a lot.

254
00:26:17,431 --> 00:26:18,675
Oh, shit!

255
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:21,524
What is it?

256
00:26:21,975 --> 00:26:25,323
Oh, it's red. Must have been a wasp.

257
00:26:28,311 --> 00:26:29,741
Are you crazy?

258
00:26:32,407 --> 00:26:35,124
Come home, I'll put an onion on it.

259
00:26:37,398 --> 00:26:40,366
What is it, boy?
We're going home now, yes! Come!

260
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:45,620
It stinks! - It's supposed to stink
so it can help. Let me through.

261
00:26:47,479 --> 00:26:52,300
Yes, sweetie! Now you get yum-yum.
Come on! Let me through.

262
00:26:52,534 --> 00:26:56,331
Come on! Let me through. Come! Yes!

263
00:26:58,773 --> 00:27:01,905
Yes, now it's time!

264
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:09,392
You're playing badminton!

265
00:28:10,867 --> 00:28:12,656
Nowwatch out! Watch out!

266
00:28:26,994 --> 00:28:28,139
Paul!

267
00:28:30,322 --> 00:28:32,460
Let's do the tree.

268
00:28:34,769 --> 00:28:35,883
Okay.

269
00:28:46,834 --> 00:28:49,703
Watch it, Schumann!
- Schumann, get away.

270
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:54,409
I'm going shopping. Be right back.
- Okay. Schumann, no!

271
00:28:54,738 --> 00:28:57,868
This one?
- No, not tha one. That one.

272
00:28:58,033 --> 00:29:01,927
And do the small one, too.
- Okay.

273
00:29:02,064 --> 00:29:06,572
Fire it up!
- You know. It's not so simple. Say...

274
00:29:06,705 --> 00:29:09,127
I'll be right back.
- Hey!

275
00:29:09,297 --> 00:29:10,410
Dad?

276
00:29:11,762 --> 00:29:13,222
No, everything's fine.

277
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:17,041
She went into town.

278
00:29:18,928 --> 00:29:21,799
He's okay.
Mom's gotten to like him.

279
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,852
Like him a lot, actually.

280
00:29:25,072 --> 00:29:27,657
A lot! Hello?

281
00:29:28,176 --> 00:29:30,085
Yes, I'll tell her.

282
00:29:31,247 --> 00:29:33,157
Yes, it's nice here, too.

283
00:29:34,383 --> 00:29:36,805
See you! Yes, bye.

284
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,342
Yes, bye.

285
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:44,360
Paul?

286
00:29:49,712 --> 00:29:51,173
Are you alright?

287
00:29:52,719 --> 00:29:56,068
Aren't you supposed to use iodine?
- Alcohol is better.

288
00:30:02,864 --> 00:30:04,457
Oh, man!

289
00:30:10,479 --> 00:30:11,592
Careful!

290
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,099
Jesus Maria!

291
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:28,526
What have you done? Are you crazy?

292
00:30:28,942 --> 00:30:30,852
What?
- Where's Paul?

293
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:36,615
What's going on?
- I hurt myself.

294
00:30:36,717 --> 00:30:39,783
Why didn't you call me?
- We were fine.

295
00:30:40,142 --> 00:30:41,963
Robert, get me the washing soap!

296
00:30:42,061 --> 00:30:45,574
You didn't bring me any chewing gum?
- Sorry, I forgot.

297
00:30:45,837 --> 00:30:48,357
I met Professor Kubler.
You'll be third.

298
00:30:51,245 --> 00:30:53,035
This is terrible.

299
00:31:02,189 --> 00:31:05,866
Look at that! Wha did you two do?

300
00:31:08,173 --> 00:31:09,449
Anna?
- Yes?

301
00:31:10,797 --> 00:31:13,033
You have sweat on your lip.

302
00:31:19,436 --> 00:31:20,614
Gone.

303
00:31:22,156 --> 00:31:26,050
Paul, don't forget
to write down your hours for the pool.

304
00:31:26,252 --> 00:31:28,521
The paints are in my car.

305
00:31:30,443 --> 00:31:31,459
Washing soap!

306
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:36,897
You have to pick up
the boss's wife at the brothel. Drive!

307
00:31:37,004 --> 00:31:41,281
Man, why won't it go straight?
- You have to drive in the middle.

308
00:31:42,475 --> 00:31:45,770
Oops, I ran someone over.
- Doesn't matter.

309
00:31:45,963 --> 00:31:49,225
What're you doing?
- Man, Mom! Now I'm dead.

310
00:31:49,738 --> 00:31:51,014
You have one more.

311
00:31:51,691 --> 00:31:54,474
I thought we could wach a movie.

312
00:31:56,458 --> 00:32:00,003
I'm explaining him the game, but...
- Do I go left or right here?

313
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:03,591
Um... Left and then right again.

314
00:32:03,786 --> 00:32:07,015
Do you want to play?
- No, you go ahead.

315
00:32:07,147 --> 00:32:08,773
Right here or the next one?

316
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,145
Straight ahead.

317
00:32:17,162 --> 00:32:19,463
Thank you, good-bye!

318
00:32:24,713 --> 00:32:26,569
Yes, sweetie!

319
00:32:28,266 --> 00:32:30,405
How are they?

320
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,474
Oh, wonderful colors!

321
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:35,810
Very nice.

322
00:32:37,193 --> 00:32:39,048
I hope they're enough.

323
00:32:40,009 --> 00:32:45,607
We have mortar and glue.
You can plan your own time.

324
00:33:33,734 --> 00:33:35,907
The sound needs time to develop.

325
00:33:36,008 --> 00:33:39,619
Accelerando does mean get faster,
but not take off like a greyhound.

326
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:41,725
You always exaggerate.

327
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:45,252
I've told you a million times. Stand up.

328
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,214
That's lame.

329
00:34:05,957 --> 00:34:07,004
Lame?

330
00:34:08,102 --> 00:34:11,168
Paul? Paul, come here. Come here.

331
00:34:13,062 --> 00:34:16,957
Robert will play you something
two different ways

332
00:34:17,126 --> 00:34:20,574
and you say
which version you like better, yes?

333
00:34:21,157 --> 00:34:23,427
First yours, then mine, okay?

334
00:35:14,627 --> 00:35:17,475
They both sounded good.
- And...

335
00:35:17,603 --> 00:35:21,280
what makes the two versions
different in your opinion?

336
00:35:26,403 --> 00:35:31,324
The first one had more power.
The second was...

337
00:35:32,899 --> 00:35:34,241
somehow...

338
00:35:34,852 --> 00:35:38,234
Don't be shy. Just your feeling.
Which did you like better?

339
00:35:38,627 --> 00:35:42,304
Maybe the first. But I don't
know how it's supposed to go.

340
00:35:42,627 --> 00:35:47,383
Forget him. There's no point.
- It's only a game. Keep playing!

341
00:35:50,018 --> 00:35:53,018
If I have to choose, the second.

342
00:35:57,442 --> 00:35:59,003
Bullshit!

343
00:36:17,121 --> 00:36:18,648
Something to drink?

344
00:36:20,448 --> 00:36:21,593
Yes, please.

345
00:36:22,081 --> 00:36:24,350
Come in.
- Coming.

346
00:36:35,361 --> 00:36:36,638
Smell.

347
00:36:38,336 --> 00:36:39,383
Good.

348
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:53,304
Didn't you put sugar in it?
- No, no. No sugar.

349
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:04,826
So...
- Thank you.

350
00:37:06,496 --> 00:37:07,575
Sorry...

351
00:37:13,535 --> 00:37:14,615
Cheers!

352
00:37:18,143 --> 00:37:20,118
Good.
- You have...

353
00:37:21,312 --> 00:37:22,872
You, too.
- Yes?

354
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:25,020
Gone?

355
00:37:25,471 --> 00:37:29,626
You want some? It's delicious!
- I can't drink milk.

356
00:37:30,046 --> 00:37:31,836
Lactose intolerant.

357
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:37,978
What do you think
about sleeping out tonight?

358
00:37:38,749 --> 00:37:41,620
Us three?
- No! Us two.

359
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:44,695
At the pond.

360
00:37:45,278 --> 00:37:48,125
Yes, you should, while the weather...

361
00:37:48,255 --> 00:37:50,742
I'm happy to have
you two out of my hair.

362
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:55,355
But you have to be here
at 9 tomorrow like we agreed.

363
00:37:56,701 --> 00:37:58,076
Yes. Sure.

364
00:37:59,229 --> 00:38:02,807
Wha's happening at 9?
- Dress rehearsal for the audition.

365
00:38:21,597 --> 00:38:22,677
No thanks.

366
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:26,034
You're going to have
a big alcoholic's nose.

367
00:38:34,621 --> 00:38:36,824
And you'll die of lung cancer.

368
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,267
Unless you kill yourself first.

369
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,448
How did he do it?

370
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:59,253
Who?
- Who do you think?

371
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,674
What did they tell you?

372
00:39:05,403 --> 00:39:07,475
They only said that...

373
00:39:08,603 --> 00:39:11,832
tha Frank killed himself
'cause he had problems.

374
00:39:15,931 --> 00:39:16,859
Aha.

375
00:39:23,324 --> 00:39:24,403
And?

376
00:39:25,114 --> 00:39:27,929
I think I'd rather sleep at home.

377
00:39:28,315 --> 00:39:33,017
What are you doing? - I don't
feel like answering stupid questions.

378
00:39:33,147 --> 00:39:34,488
Okay, Paul.

379
00:39:35,258 --> 00:39:37,429
I promise, no more questions.

380
00:39:39,162 --> 00:39:40,241
Promise!

381
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:42,224
Cross my heart.

382
00:39:57,337 --> 00:39:59,061
He hanged himself.

383
00:39:59,833 --> 00:40:01,240
In the garage.

384
00:40:05,017 --> 00:40:06,326
Damn.

385
00:40:07,769 --> 00:40:10,617
For real, with a noose?

386
00:40:11,673 --> 00:40:14,094
No questions!
- Sorry.

387
00:40:26,616 --> 00:40:28,143
With a cable.

388
00:40:30,936 --> 00:40:32,692
From the ceiling lights.

389
00:40:33,432 --> 00:40:37,655
I found him there.
Do you know what that looks like?

390
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,299
What it looks like...
His face all blue!

391
00:40:41,464 --> 00:40:44,333
His tongue hanging out!

392
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:47,631
His pants all stained!

393
00:40:49,463 --> 00:40:53,140
You know howthat looks?
He was so ugly!

394
00:40:54,231 --> 00:40:58,225
Yeah, I mean...
Why did he do it?

395
00:40:58,743 --> 00:41:00,270
Why did he...

396
00:41:03,126 --> 00:41:06,094
I don't know! I don't know!

397
00:41:06,904 --> 00:41:08,691
Let's call him!

398
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:13,105
Let's call him and ask.

399
00:41:14,551 --> 00:41:15,663
"Hello, Frank!"

400
00:41:16,215 --> 00:41:18,996
Hello, Frank,
why did you kill yourself?

401
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:24,852
Why did you kill yourself
and not leave us a note?

402
00:41:26,326 --> 00:41:28,365
Maybe he'll tell us.

403
00:42:01,684 --> 00:42:02,633
It's okay.

404
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:05,195
Forgive me. I'm sorry.

405
00:42:07,029 --> 00:42:08,655
It's okay.

406
00:42:30,356 --> 00:42:31,184
Hey!

407
00:42:32,788 --> 00:42:36,049
Ow! Watch out! My bandage!
Watch out!

408
00:42:43,123 --> 00:42:44,465
Something wrong?

409
00:42:45,268 --> 00:42:46,675
No, why?

410
00:42:57,556 --> 00:42:59,497
Are you crazy?
- What?

411
00:42:59,795 --> 00:43:01,224
The water!

412
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:03,883
Shit!

413
00:43:11,762 --> 00:43:12,908
Give me tha.

414
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:17,610
What time is it?

415
00:43:18,067 --> 00:43:19,561
Quarter to ten.

416
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:22,184
Wasn't dress rehearsal at nine?

417
00:43:24,114 --> 00:43:25,608
So what?

418
00:43:35,922 --> 00:43:38,026
Morning.
- Morning.

419
00:43:56,017 --> 00:43:57,642
C'mon, table tennis!

420
00:43:58,033 --> 00:43:59,081
Okay.

421
00:44:28,048 --> 00:44:29,225
Man!

422
00:45:23,853 --> 00:45:26,308
Well?
- No dinner today.

423
00:45:26,669 --> 00:45:30,052
Why?
- Just take what you want.

424
00:45:30,605 --> 00:45:32,775
Salami?
- No thanks.

425
00:45:32,876 --> 00:45:36,619
Paul, how are you getting on?
- Bit by bit.

426
00:45:36,749 --> 00:45:40,458
Where's the frozen pizza?
- When it's finished, it's finished.

427
00:45:48,332 --> 00:45:49,859
Do you have enough tiles?

428
00:45:50,509 --> 00:45:51,588
Yes.

429
00:45:54,572 --> 00:45:56,230
Who do we have here?

430
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,184
Good boy. Time for a walk!

431
00:45:58,572 --> 00:46:00,133
Can I come with you?

432
00:46:23,051 --> 00:46:25,669
Look wha yummy stuff you get!

433
00:46:26,251 --> 00:46:28,422
You like that, don't you?

434
00:46:29,547 --> 00:46:30,791
To Schumann!

435
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:33,766
To Paul!

436
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:40,159
To...

437
00:46:40,491 --> 00:46:42,148
To the audition.

438
00:46:47,914 --> 00:46:51,176
The Berg sonata. Robert,
it's turned out really well.

439
00:46:57,353 --> 00:46:59,906
Don't forget you have to drive me.

440
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:05,538
Paul, could you do us a favor
and look after Schumann?

441
00:47:18,025 --> 00:47:19,170
Robert!

442
00:47:24,777 --> 00:47:25,825
Good luck!

443
00:48:17,768 --> 00:48:19,044
Yes, hello?

444
00:48:21,895 --> 00:48:23,301
Yes, going fine.

445
00:48:24,296 --> 00:48:25,921
How's Madrid?

446
00:48:32,007 --> 00:48:33,317
No they're out.

447
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,326
No idea. They didn't say.

448
00:48:39,239 --> 00:48:41,061
She left it here, yes.

449
00:48:42,726 --> 00:48:44,832
I will. Bye.

450
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:20,829
Schumann!

451
00:49:23,076 --> 00:49:24,157
Schumann!

452
00:49:32,868 --> 00:49:33,915
Schumann!

453
00:49:36,708 --> 00:49:37,885
Shit!

454
00:49:41,189 --> 00:49:44,352
Hello.
- Hello. Where is my dog?

455
00:49:45,828 --> 00:49:47,519
He was here.

456
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:52,033
There's my good boy!

457
00:49:52,292 --> 00:49:53,753
Hello!

458
00:49:53,956 --> 00:49:58,080
Where's Robert?
- No idea. He sent me away.

459
00:49:58,275 --> 00:50:00,512
He didn't want me to come in.

460
00:50:00,739 --> 00:50:02,747
Let's change that.

461
00:50:04,579 --> 00:50:05,822
Almost there.

462
00:50:07,203 --> 00:50:08,131
So.

463
00:50:12,963 --> 00:50:16,641
Robert behaved so badly,
you can't imagine.

464
00:50:21,282 --> 00:50:22,591
Hold this?

465
00:50:26,018 --> 00:50:28,156
He's so aggressive sometimes.

466
00:50:30,433 --> 00:50:31,678
Hold it.

467
00:50:32,834 --> 00:50:35,288
I don't know where he gets it.

468
00:50:41,634 --> 00:50:45,311
He is at a difficult age.

469
00:50:47,074 --> 00:50:51,002
And his father's never there
when he needs him.

470
00:50:52,226 --> 00:50:53,852
Yes...
- Hold this?

471
00:50:56,385 --> 00:50:57,945
Yes, it's hard.

472
00:51:17,569 --> 00:51:19,030
I'm so sorry, Paul.

473
00:51:24,705 --> 00:51:26,265
I think...

474
00:51:26,465 --> 00:51:29,333
It's great how strong you're being.

475
00:51:31,425 --> 00:51:32,886
Why?

476
00:51:35,488 --> 00:51:37,821
You're so brave.

477
00:51:39,936 --> 00:51:45,686
But you don't always have to be.
No one's asking you to.

478
00:51:47,775 --> 00:51:50,012
Don't get it dirty.

479
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,411
I won't.

480
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:07,531
Howwas your audition?

481
00:57:08,947 --> 00:57:10,093
Good.

482
00:57:11,764 --> 00:57:13,007
Successful?

483
00:57:14,227 --> 00:57:17,042
Of course. What do you think?

484
00:57:20,947 --> 00:57:22,573
Where's Anna?

485
00:57:25,970 --> 00:57:30,444
Don't know. You should know.

486
00:57:34,578 --> 00:57:37,035
She went to pick you up.

487
00:57:39,348 --> 00:57:42,608
I don't know either.

488
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:47,495
Weird. I'm in my room.

489
00:58:44,337 --> 00:58:46,507
I looked everywhere for you!

490
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,294
I'm talking to you!

491
00:58:56,751 --> 00:58:58,857
Let me check on your breath!

492
00:58:59,663 --> 00:59:02,347
How stupid do you think I am?
Did you think I wouldn't notice?

493
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,523
Darling, I'm sorry!

494
00:59:04,911 --> 00:59:09,222
I'm sorry! Put cold
water on it. Robert, I'm sorry.

495
00:59:12,431 --> 00:59:14,569
Did your mother call?

496
00:59:15,822 --> 00:59:16,870
No.

497
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:20,909
I put some chicken in the oven.
- Anna...

498
00:59:50,733 --> 00:59:51,662
Come here.

499
00:59:58,157 --> 00:59:59,270
Shit.

500
01:00:08,461 --> 01:00:09,574
Yeah, yeah.

501
01:00:10,766 --> 01:00:11,627
Here.

502
01:00:13,358 --> 01:00:15,659
You don't want it?
Come here. Come. Come here.

503
01:00:17,453 --> 01:00:18,794
Come, come, come.

504
01:00:47,308 --> 01:00:48,453
Is Robert sleeping?

505
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:52,707
I think so.
- You should go to bed, too.

506
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,623
Where were you?

507
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:39,301
You smoke too much.

508
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:53,479
Occupied!

509
01:03:02,471 --> 01:03:04,958
I'll call you laer. Bye-bye.

510
01:03:24,613 --> 01:03:26,206
Does it hurt a lot?

511
01:03:30,342 --> 01:03:31,323
Yes.

512
01:03:35,718 --> 01:03:37,724
I'm so sorry.

513
01:03:41,447 --> 01:03:45,472
But I don't understand why
you drink alcohol before the audition.

514
01:03:47,078 --> 01:03:48,125
No?

515
01:03:50,247 --> 01:03:51,937
Explain it to me.

516
01:04:05,157 --> 01:04:08,157
Mom, take care of Paul
and leave me alone.

517
01:05:42,338 --> 01:05:45,752
Hey!
- Stefan! You're already here?

518
01:05:46,594 --> 01:05:48,765
I thought you were coming tomorrow!

519
01:05:49,761 --> 01:05:52,663
How long has it been
since I saw you at the piano?

520
01:05:53,313 --> 01:05:56,827
She was a real talent.
- Long time ago.

521
01:05:57,059 --> 01:06:00,319
Anna, are you going to tell him?

522
01:06:02,913 --> 01:06:04,540
Tell him what?

523
01:06:05,922 --> 01:06:07,448
Wha do you have to tell me?

524
01:06:10,017 --> 01:06:13,083
Oh, that! We've had so much fun!

525
01:06:13,217 --> 01:06:14,493
I knew you would.

526
01:06:14,945 --> 01:06:18,840
Paul is totally uncomplicaed,
not like your son, the diva.

527
01:06:19,136 --> 01:06:19,933
Anna...

528
01:06:20,097 --> 01:06:24,188
And he's very skillful...
in the pool. - What's that?

529
01:06:25,664 --> 01:06:29,526
Nothing. - Chic bandage.
- Anna did itfor me.

530
01:06:29,889 --> 01:06:33,434
Aha! Playing doctor! I see!
We like those games!

531
01:06:33,793 --> 01:06:37,436
I leave for a couple of days and...
Where is Robert?

532
01:06:40,289 --> 01:06:44,063
I don't knowwhat's wrong with him.
He is out of control.

533
01:06:44,161 --> 01:06:47,870
Played the audition stinking drunk.
Of course he didn't get in.

534
01:06:49,152 --> 01:06:53,342
Tha can't be true!
- It is! But I thought of something.

535
01:06:53,471 --> 01:06:56,505
I spoke with Mom
and she said I was right. It...

536
01:07:00,063 --> 01:07:01,918
The piano has to go.

537
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:12,639
How is it on the front?

538
01:07:13,183 --> 01:07:15,223
Front? What front?

539
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,645
I don't know.

540
01:07:18,751 --> 01:07:22,744
Bad weather front,
battlefront, marriage front...

541
01:07:29,311 --> 01:07:30,717
How is your hand?

542
01:07:38,942 --> 01:07:40,797
Stupid thing to happen.

543
01:07:41,213 --> 01:07:46,778
In the US, you could sue your mother
and you'd be pretty sure to win.

544
01:07:50,269 --> 01:07:54,164
Wouldn't I need witnesses?
- Yes, probably.

545
01:08:02,173 --> 01:08:03,996
I didn't see anything.

546
01:08:04,702 --> 01:08:08,050
Then case closed. There is no case.

547
01:08:10,556 --> 01:08:12,118
If you say so.

548
01:09:43,097 --> 01:09:44,920
What are you doing here?

549
01:10:03,865 --> 01:10:05,688
That doesn't look good.

550
01:10:06,809 --> 01:10:08,019
Good night.

551
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:20,688
Are you mental?

552
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:26,514
Could be...

553
01:12:30,899 --> 01:12:33,386
Have you been drinking again?

554
01:12:34,643 --> 01:12:36,301
Was it fun?

555
01:12:36,979 --> 01:12:38,059
What?

556
01:12:38,675 --> 01:12:40,682
You know what I mean.

557
01:12:42,099 --> 01:12:43,441
Shit!

558
01:12:52,436 --> 01:12:53,929
I saw you.

559
01:12:55,763 --> 01:12:57,737
What?
- I did!

560
01:13:00,178 --> 01:13:01,606
Don't yell!

561
01:13:03,602 --> 01:13:05,576
You fucking asshole!

562
01:13:13,585 --> 01:13:14,796
Shit.

563
01:13:32,337 --> 01:13:36,014
I love her.
- Wha? You gotta be crazy.

564
01:13:36,112 --> 01:13:39,211
I do. And she loves me.
- She loves you?

565
01:13:39,569 --> 01:13:41,575
Don't make me laugh.

566
01:14:02,993 --> 01:14:05,414
Careful, it can get infected.

567
01:14:32,623 --> 01:14:33,933
Here.

568
01:14:34,511 --> 01:14:36,932
No wholegrain left.

569
01:14:46,701 --> 01:14:48,360
Robert,

570
01:14:49,389 --> 01:14:51,114
some cheese?

571
01:14:53,902 --> 01:14:56,454
You?
- No, thanks.

572
01:15:11,053 --> 01:15:14,053
Paul, don't you want any breakfast?

573
01:15:14,190 --> 01:15:15,651
Let him be.

574
01:15:30,284 --> 01:15:31,877
Listen, Robert.

575
01:15:33,613 --> 01:15:38,052
Your mother and I spoke about
your stunt in the conservatory.

576
01:15:40,236 --> 01:15:44,426
You must understand
that it's not fair to her.

577
01:15:45,388 --> 01:15:49,927
You know how much she invested in you.
- That's not the point.

578
01:15:50,828 --> 01:15:52,486
What's not the point?

579
01:15:53,132 --> 01:15:55,498
That stupid audition.

580
01:15:55,595 --> 01:15:58,891
You see?
That's the totally wrong attitude.

581
01:15:59,372 --> 01:16:01,576
It wasn't a "stupid audition."

582
01:16:01,675 --> 01:16:04,806
It would have been
an important step forward for you.

583
01:16:06,283 --> 01:16:08,804
You lost a huge chance.

584
01:16:09,324 --> 01:16:12,519
Some never get that chance
even though they're talented.

585
01:16:12,747 --> 01:16:14,569
I hope you understand.

586
01:16:17,771 --> 01:16:22,659
Anna's reputaion at the conservatory!
This will spread like wildfire.

587
01:16:24,266 --> 01:16:28,390
I honestly thought tha you
were more mature and responsible.

588
01:16:36,490 --> 01:16:39,751
Why won't you tell me
what happened here when I was away?

589
01:16:42,634 --> 01:16:43,811
Well...

590
01:16:46,090 --> 01:16:48,162
Anna and Paul...

591
01:16:52,329 --> 01:16:55,625
Anna got on my nerves. That's all.

592
01:16:57,226 --> 01:16:59,397
He's not hungry.

593
01:17:06,922 --> 01:17:08,132
Alright.

594
01:17:08,361 --> 01:17:09,855
Never mind.

595
01:17:52,264 --> 01:17:53,725
Stop! Stop!

596
01:17:56,232 --> 01:17:57,378
Stop!

597
01:18:12,774 --> 01:18:13,985
Robert!

598
01:18:30,245 --> 01:18:33,824
Wow, great! It looks really great!

599
01:18:33,990 --> 01:18:38,529
If you fill it tonight,
we can all swim tomorrow

600
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:40,539
and christen it.

601
01:18:42,021 --> 01:18:47,356
Stefan and I are going into town.
Food's in the fridge.

602
01:18:47,557 --> 01:18:52,511
I think Robert will be back soon.
Have a nice evening.

603
01:18:52,710 --> 01:18:56,387
Do me a favor and take
Schumann for a walk? - Yes.

604
01:19:02,437 --> 01:19:03,451
Anna!

605
01:19:11,109 --> 01:19:12,516
Be right there!

606
01:19:18,244 --> 01:19:20,250
Tell me what I should do.

607
01:20:16,003 --> 01:20:17,529
I was just swimming.

608
01:20:18,721 --> 01:20:20,216
Congratulations.

609
01:20:21,249 --> 01:20:24,348
Now you have your fucking pool again.

610
01:20:24,898 --> 01:20:26,784
Then Anna will be happy.

611
01:20:52,193 --> 01:20:53,272
Come on.

612
01:23:22,972 --> 01:23:24,629
I gotta go.

613
01:23:28,124 --> 01:23:29,498
Bye, Robert.

614
01:23:29,660 --> 01:23:31,153
Bye?

615
01:23:32,635 --> 01:23:36,345
I'm outta here. My train's
in a half an hour. - So soon?

616
01:23:54,266 --> 01:23:58,127
Lie on the bed, it's more comfortable.

617
01:24:02,394 --> 01:24:04,979
I prefer to sleep on the floor.

618
01:24:52,376 --> 01:24:53,553
Paul?
