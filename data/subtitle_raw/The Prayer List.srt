1
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:31,047
- I know you are god.

2
00:01:31,134 --> 00:01:34,355
I can't believe I trusted you!

3
00:01:39,664 --> 00:01:43,277
I work so hard.

4
00:01:43,364 --> 00:01:46,497
And it all gets taken
away from me in an instant!

5
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:50,022
It's god!

6
00:01:57,682 --> 00:02:03,558
I don't want to go on...
If I'm gonna be alone!

7
00:02:03,645 --> 00:02:07,127
I don't wanna go on
if I can't trust anyone!

8
00:02:21,315 --> 00:02:24,231
- Whoa! Well, come on in,
why don't ya?

9
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:25,275
- Hey, Mark.

10
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,976
Well, well, well,
Mr. Sherwood.

11
00:02:31,063 --> 00:02:32,891
You know what they say about
a man dressed in a sharp suit,

12
00:02:32,978 --> 00:02:34,632
don't ya?
- Yeah, I know what they say:

13
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:36,025
Don't spill anything on the suit

14
00:02:36,112 --> 00:02:38,114
because it costs extra
to dry clean.

15
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:40,595
- No, silly, you look great.
- Ah.

16
00:02:40,682 --> 00:02:42,684
- Michele is going to be
so excited when she sees you

17
00:02:42,771 --> 00:02:44,468
waiting for her down the aisle.

18
00:02:44,555 --> 00:02:46,949
- Thank you so much.
Hey, what do you got there?

19
00:02:47,036 --> 00:02:50,605
- Not sure. But Michele said
that you need to open it

20
00:02:50,692 --> 00:02:52,781
before the ceremony.

21
00:02:52,868 --> 00:02:55,827
She also said that I'm not
allowed to stick around

22
00:02:55,914 --> 00:02:59,614
and be nosy, something about,
"for your eyes only."

23
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,749
- Well, do you wanna stay
around and see what it is?

24
00:03:04,836 --> 00:03:06,055
- Yeah, I do.

25
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:09,928
- Too bad, you heard my queen.

26
00:03:10,015 --> 00:03:11,495
You need to get back
in there anyway,

27
00:03:11,582 --> 00:03:14,890
because the maid of honor's
job is never done.

28
00:03:18,807 --> 00:03:19,851
Hmm.

29
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,402
"I want him
to be a spiritual man,

30
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:52,144
"who would treat me really good.

31
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,539
"I've never had anyone
in a relationship treat me

32
00:03:55,626 --> 00:04:00,762
gentle, loving and kind,
like a beautiful queen."

Man, I'm loving we opted out
of the karaoke part

38
00:04:17,474 --> 00:04:18,606
of this wedding.

39
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:19,911
- Cheers, man.
- Thanks, man.

40
00:04:19,998 --> 00:04:21,217
- What do you got there,
big guy?

41
00:04:21,304 --> 00:04:24,264
- Hmm, it's a gift
from Michele.

42
00:04:24,351 --> 00:04:27,615
- A honey do list already?
This girl wasted no time.

43
00:04:27,702 --> 00:04:29,356
- Oh, man, come on,
it's not like that at all.

44
00:04:29,443 --> 00:04:31,532
This is the list
she told me about.

45
00:04:31,619 --> 00:04:33,185
You know, I thought she was
just kidding,

46
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,014
but her and Jesse put this
together before we met.

47
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:37,929
It's got a list of these
qualities that she's looking for

48
00:04:38,016 --> 00:04:39,366
in a partner.
- Oh.

49
00:04:39,453 --> 00:04:41,455
And now she wishes
she had married me.

50
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:42,978
Better luck next time, guy.

51
00:04:43,065 --> 00:04:45,067
- Come on, man, don't you wish.

52
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:47,548
- What is on this list,
seriously, that makes you think

53
00:04:47,635 --> 00:04:49,201
you two are meant to be?

54
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,596
- Well, first,
we're both adopted.

55
00:04:52,683 --> 00:04:54,990
And man, her parents
were so young.

56
00:05:17,926 --> 00:05:22,060
- How in the hell could you
do this to me and your mother?!

57
00:05:22,147 --> 00:05:24,889
We're not helping you
with this kid!

58
00:05:24,976 --> 00:05:28,458
In fact,
you're just a kid yourself!

59
00:05:28,545 --> 00:05:31,069
And that boy.

60
00:05:31,156 --> 00:05:35,160
What in the hell kind of father
do you think he's gonna be?!

61
00:05:35,247 --> 00:05:36,814
- I know he loves me.

62
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,300
And he'll do all he can
to take care of US.

63
00:05:47,172 --> 00:05:48,652
- Loves you?!

64
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,917
- If he loved you, he wouldn't
put you in this position!

65
00:05:53,004 --> 00:05:55,964
Sixteen years old and pregnant!

66
00:06:01,186 --> 00:06:03,275
You're not keeping this baby!

67
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,278
And you sure as hell ain't
marrying some deadbeat

68
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,498
that doesn't even know
how to respect a woman

69
00:06:08,585 --> 00:06:11,501
than to knock her up!

70
00:06:11,588 --> 00:06:13,851
Especially when she's just
a kid herself!

71
00:06:24,775 --> 00:06:25,994
- But daddy...

72
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,956
I can't...I can't get
an abortion.

73
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,791
- No, ma'am.

74
00:06:40,878 --> 00:06:43,533
You're...you're not gonna get
an abortion.

75
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,718
You're gonna get away

76
00:06:54,805 --> 00:06:57,721
from that boy,
as far as possible.

77
00:06:57,808 --> 00:07:00,332
You're...you're gonna go live
with aunt Debbie

78
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,987
and you're gonna have
the baby there.

79
00:07:03,074 --> 00:07:05,381
And then she's gonna help
figure out

80
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:09,733
how you can give this baby
a chance, with another family.

81
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:14,172
And I don't wanna hear
another word about it!

will you still be my friend? ♪

83
00:07:42,157 --> 00:07:46,988

- Oh.
- Oh, dear god, Terry.

87
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:05,572
Oh, she's beautiful.
God has blessed US

88
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:10,751
with a gorgeous baby girl.
Oh.

89
00:08:10,838 --> 00:08:13,754
- God had a plan, alright.

90
00:08:13,841 --> 00:08:18,498
First with Jo,
and now this adorable angel.

91
00:08:18,585 --> 00:08:21,544
The heartache of being told
we couldn't have another child

92
00:08:21,631 --> 00:08:23,938
just flew out the door
the moment I laid eyes

93
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:25,766
on this perfect angel.

Ow!

96
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,693
- What a big baby.

97
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,043
- Hey, I'm losing a lot
of blood here, man.

98
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:47,614
These boutonniere pins are sharp.
Like samurai-sword sharp. Hmm.

99
00:08:47,701 --> 00:08:52,575
- What a drama queen.
- Wow, how compassionate of you.

100
00:08:52,662 --> 00:08:54,577
Hey, was that on Michele's
list too?

101
00:08:54,664 --> 00:08:57,188
Yeah, actually, it was.

102
00:08:57,275 --> 00:08:59,190
- I mean, family and helping
family has always been

103
00:08:59,277 --> 00:09:00,975
really important to her.

104
00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:02,977
She was just a teenager
when her family were faced

105
00:09:03,064 --> 00:09:05,066
with one of their greatest
challenges.

106
00:09:05,153 --> 00:09:06,154
- Hmm.

107
00:09:08,286 --> 00:09:09,636
Ow! Ah!

108
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:17,034
- Michele, grab your sister
and get in the car,

109
00:09:17,121 --> 00:09:18,949
your daddy's in the hospital.

110
00:09:19,036 --> 00:09:21,256
It was some sort of accident
at work.

111
00:09:56,378 --> 00:09:57,988
Hello,
Neil residence.

112
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:12,263
My god.

113
00:10:13,961 --> 00:10:15,353
How many times have I told
you girls to get me

114
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,790
some more water?

115
00:10:16,877 --> 00:10:18,661
Do I have to get it for myself?

116
00:10:21,403 --> 00:10:23,231
- I can't today, Brenda, sorry.

117
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:27,322
Here, dad, let me help you.

118
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:29,280
I was just about to fill up
your water glass.

119
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:32,544
- I can do it myself, dang it.

120
00:10:34,546 --> 00:10:38,246
I just need you and your sister
to keep my glass

121
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:41,336
filled with water,
is that so much to ask for?

122
00:10:41,423 --> 00:10:42,903
- No, sir, it's not.

123
00:10:51,607 --> 00:10:55,393
Oh, hey, come sit.

124
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,048
Is dad upset about
his water again?

125
00:10:58,135 --> 00:11:00,921
- Yeah.
You'd think that water glass

126
00:11:01,008 --> 00:11:02,879
was his life support system.

127
00:11:02,966 --> 00:11:04,707
- Oh, he's just venting
his feelings

128
00:11:04,794 --> 00:11:06,753
about everything
he's going through.

129
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,322
- Hmm.
- Um...Michele.

130
00:11:11,409 --> 00:11:16,850
How would you feel...About US
moving from Minnesota?

131
00:11:20,027 --> 00:11:23,378
- I...I don't understand.

132
00:11:23,465 --> 00:11:26,990
I'm about to graduate.
And I have my music.

133
00:11:27,077 --> 00:11:29,819
- I know, honey, but...
I've been offered a job

134
00:11:29,906 --> 00:11:33,693
in Tulsa, Oklahoma,
at a brand-new hospital.

135
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,565
- What about my martial arts?
Mom, Brenda and I are about

136
00:11:36,652 --> 00:11:38,698
to earn our blue belts together.

137
00:11:38,785 --> 00:11:41,091
I'm sure they have
martial arts in Tulsa.

138
00:11:41,178 --> 00:11:44,051
And...it's not just about
a bunch of oil Wells

139
00:11:44,138 --> 00:11:47,968
and cowboys.

140
00:11:48,055 --> 00:11:53,234
Besides, this job is
at the new, brand-new,

141
00:11:53,321 --> 00:11:57,412
city of faith hospital.

142
00:11:57,499 --> 00:12:00,197
I'll be making more money
than I've ever made,

143
00:12:00,284 --> 00:12:02,504
and with it and the money
you and your sister make

144
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:04,332
from working part-time,

145
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:08,640
I'm sure we'll be able to get
this family back on track.

146
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,425
In no time.

147
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:17,867
- Mom. You know we'll all do
what you need US to do.

148
00:12:17,954 --> 00:12:20,652
- Good! It's settled.

149
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:25,005
The Neils are moving
to Oklahoma.

150
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,997
- Where is everyone?

151
00:13:01,084 --> 00:13:04,305
Church.

152
00:13:04,392 --> 00:13:06,829
We're in the Bible belt now,
ladies.

153
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:10,006
Everyone goes to church
on Sundays.

154
00:13:10,093 --> 00:13:11,747
- Unless there's a tornado.

155
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:15,229
Then everyone runs
for their hidey hole.

156
00:13:15,316 --> 00:13:16,534
- Hidey hole?

157
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:18,667
No one said anything
about tornadoes.

158
00:13:20,887 --> 00:13:25,239
- Oh, they're big. Huge.
Scary, too.

159
00:13:25,326 --> 00:13:28,590
They'll rough right on the house
and take anyone in it.

160
00:13:28,677 --> 00:13:30,331
- Don't worry, Joanne.

161
00:13:30,418 --> 00:13:32,376
Mom says our place
has a storm shelter.

162
00:13:32,463 --> 00:13:35,118
- It sure does,
and we're very close to a park

163
00:13:35,205 --> 00:13:36,511
with a swimming pool.

164
00:14:34,003 --> 00:14:36,440
- Michele,
do you have lunch money?

165
00:14:36,527 --> 00:14:38,529
I saw a martial arts
place near my school

166
00:14:38,616 --> 00:14:41,054
that I wanna check into
after school today.

167
00:14:41,141 --> 00:14:43,621
- Oh, well,
I suppose that's fine,

168
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:47,016
but I need both of you
to look for part-time jobs.

169
00:14:47,103 --> 00:14:49,976
Starting in a new city
costs money.

170
00:14:50,063 --> 00:14:52,543
- Yeap, and we know dad's
not gonna find a job.

171
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,721
- No, not since the accident,

172
00:14:56,808 --> 00:14:58,898
his disability
really limits him.

173
00:15:00,812 --> 00:15:03,293
So it's our responsibility
to keep this family

174
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,730
housed and happy.

175
00:15:05,817 --> 00:15:07,907
- Well, see, that martial
arts place is looking

176
00:15:07,994 --> 00:15:10,387
for someone to sell memberships
and teach aerobics.

177
00:15:10,474 --> 00:15:13,825
- Good thinking! Oh, my,
you'll be killing two birds

178
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,002
with one stone.

179
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:18,265
- Don't count on me
to kill any birds.

180
00:15:18,352 --> 00:15:20,484
I'll just find a paper route
or something.

181
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:22,617
Okay.

182
00:15:28,884 --> 00:15:32,670
- Yes.
- I have Raymond down for 7:00 pm.

183
00:15:32,757 --> 00:15:34,498
Okay, great.

184
00:15:34,585 --> 00:15:36,239
We'll see you both
when you're done.

185
00:15:36,326 --> 00:15:37,501
Alright, bye.

186
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,988
Can I help you?

187
00:15:48,295 --> 00:15:51,646
I'm interested in the job.

188
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:54,866
- So you think you'd like
to work here.

189
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,868
- I'd love to work here.

190
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,524
I'm a big believer in
maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

191
00:16:00,611 --> 00:16:03,788
Careful what you wish for,

192
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,921
- Who do we have here?

193
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:08,837
- This...this is, uh,
she just walked in

194
00:16:08,924 --> 00:16:11,231
off the street
looking for a job.

195
00:16:13,581 --> 00:16:17,324
- I'm Michele.
I'd love to work here.

196
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:20,066
I took martial arts back home
and I'm a blue belt.

197
00:16:20,153 --> 00:16:22,111
Well, I was about to get
my blue belt

198
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:23,765
and then my family moved here.

199
00:16:27,551 --> 00:16:29,771
- Where are you from,
blue belt?

200
00:16:29,858 --> 00:16:32,513
- I'm from Minnesota.
Brainerd, Minnesota.

201
00:16:34,515 --> 00:16:36,908
- Brainerd, Minnesota?

202
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:41,783
Here in my dojo,
we train champions.

203
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,133
- Master is working with
the Olympic committee

204
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,614
to, uh, make taekwondo
an official sport.

205
00:16:48,181 --> 00:16:49,399
- Blue belt, do you think
you have what

206
00:16:49,486 --> 00:16:50,574
it takes to be a champion?

207
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,665
- Yes. I can do this.

208
00:16:56,145 --> 00:16:58,974
I know I can.

209
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:01,194
- Well, this is Mel.

210
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:03,196
Not only is she one
of my most loyal

211
00:17:03,283 --> 00:17:05,850
and trusted employees.

212
00:17:05,937 --> 00:17:09,376
She's also a three-time
middleweight state champion.

213
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:12,596
Ranked tenth in the nation.

214
00:17:12,683 --> 00:17:17,340
And...a student I take
great pleasure coaching.

215
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:22,345
This is more than a job,

216
00:17:22,432 --> 00:17:25,435
This is a way of life.

217
00:17:25,522 --> 00:17:28,351
- We can start you off
with selling memberships.

218
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:32,268
You have any other skills?
- Uh, I...I can teach aerobics

219
00:17:32,355 --> 00:17:35,489
and other exercise training.

220
00:17:35,576 --> 00:17:39,580
Good, come tomorrow
at 6:00am for training.

221
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:42,235
You get a discount
for working here.

222
00:17:42,322 --> 00:17:44,237
And after school,
Mel will set you up

223
00:17:44,324 --> 00:17:45,803
with training for sales

224
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,544
and other classes you
can help US with.

225
00:18:01,906 --> 00:18:03,560
Hiyah! Kick.

226
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,779
Hiyah!

227
00:18:04,866 --> 00:18:06,476
- Kick.
- Hiyah!

228
00:18:06,563 --> 00:18:08,304
- Kick.
- Hiyah!

229
00:18:08,391 --> 00:18:09,697
- Kick.
- Hiyah!

230
00:18:09,784 --> 00:18:11,960
- Kick.
- Hiyah!

231
00:18:12,047 --> 00:18:13,179
- Kick.
- Hiyah!

232
00:18:14,876 --> 00:18:17,531
- Good to see you finally
made it, blue belt.

233
00:18:17,618 --> 00:18:20,099
But you said 6:00am.

234
00:18:20,186 --> 00:18:22,927
- Time is but a measure of one's
willingness to win.

235
00:18:23,014 --> 00:18:24,842
A warrior does not know time,

236
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:26,931
but only being prepared
for battle.

237
00:18:30,674 --> 00:18:33,721
What about you, blue belt?

238
00:18:33,808 --> 00:18:36,027
Do you have what it takes
to be a champion?

239
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,595
- Yes, master, I do.

240
00:18:38,682 --> 00:18:42,817
- What did you say, blue belt?
- Yes, I do.

241
00:18:42,904 --> 00:18:45,080
Indestructible!

242
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:48,083
Alright,
let's get on with our day.

243
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,520
And be warriors.

244
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:54,655
Combo, get!

245
00:19:06,362 --> 00:19:09,757
Hiyah!

246
00:19:09,844 --> 00:19:12,238
- Kick.
- Hiyah!

247
00:19:12,325 --> 00:19:14,675
- Kick.
- Hiyah!

248
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:16,677
- Not bad, blue belt.

249
00:19:16,764 --> 00:19:18,809
You coming back this
afternoon for work?

250
00:19:18,896 --> 00:19:21,072
- Yes, master,
I wouldn't miss it.

251
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,031
- Good to hear.

252
00:19:23,118 --> 00:19:26,730
I see big things coming
your way, blue belt.

253
00:19:26,817 --> 00:19:28,210
Now get to school.

254
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:31,779
Knowledge is nourishment
for the mind,

255
00:19:31,866 --> 00:19:34,347
which runs the body
and the soul.

256
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,698
Everybody's dismissed.

257
00:19:39,526 --> 00:19:41,528
Mel!

258
00:19:41,615 --> 00:19:44,922
Meet me in my office.
- Yes, master.

259
00:19:48,796 --> 00:19:50,754
Won't be long now.

260
00:19:50,841 --> 00:19:53,104
Buddy, if you're thinking
about calling this thing off,

261
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,150
you'd better do it soon.

262
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:57,500
- Come on, man,
that would never happen.

263
00:19:57,587 --> 00:20:00,068
I have never felt so connected
in my entire life,

264
00:20:00,155 --> 00:20:01,678
I'm so much happier
because of it.

265
00:20:01,765 --> 00:20:04,333
- That's good, but you know,
Michele looks like she's

266
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,684
a sweet, tiny package, but I bet
she packs a punch, yeah?

267
00:20:07,771 --> 00:20:10,992
- Well, she was a national
taekwondo champion.

268
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:15,344
- What?! Oh,
that explains a lot.

269
00:20:15,431 --> 00:20:17,216
- Wait a minute, what do you
mean, it explains a lot?

270
00:20:17,303 --> 00:20:19,957
- Well, you know whenever
we play a game? She has to win.

271
00:20:20,044 --> 00:20:22,873
- Well, first, you're not any
good at any of the games

272
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,876
we play, and secondly,
she did earn her black belt

273
00:20:25,963 --> 00:20:29,140
in less than a year, so yeah,
of course, that competitor

274
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,231
spirit does run deep
in her soul.

275
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:33,406
- Fight!

276
00:20:36,931 --> 00:20:38,149
- Yes, good.

277
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,763
- Very good.

278
00:20:45,766 --> 00:20:47,115
- Good.

279
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,949
Very well done.

280
00:20:55,036 --> 00:20:57,734
Now, that is the spirit
of a champion.

281
00:21:02,173 --> 00:21:04,698
Okay, that's it for today.

282
00:21:04,785 --> 00:21:09,224
Everybody get your rest
and I'll see you tomorrow.

283
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:12,445
Michele, meet me in my office.

284
00:21:15,404 --> 00:21:18,799
Well, you've come a long way,
blue belt.

285
00:21:18,886 --> 00:21:21,149
- I'm not a blue belt,
I'm a black belt now.

286
00:21:21,236 --> 00:21:25,153
- Yes.
Yes, you are.

287
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,942
I'm sure you heard that
the summer Olympic games

288
00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:35,294
in Seoul, South Korea,
will be featuring taekwondo

289
00:21:35,381 --> 00:21:38,079
as a demonstration sport.

290
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:41,561
And our dojo,
under my direction,

291
00:21:41,648 --> 00:21:43,606
will be the national
training grounds

292
00:21:43,693 --> 00:21:45,826
for the chosen ones
representing our country.

293
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:53,355
- This is your opportunity
to show 'em what you're made of.

294
00:21:54,617 --> 00:21:58,186
And to prove that our dojo
creates world-class champions.

295
00:21:59,622 --> 00:22:01,494
- I really wanna make
the team, master.

296
00:22:03,626 --> 00:22:05,324
- I believe you have
what it takes

297
00:22:05,411 --> 00:22:07,717
to be a part of this team,

298
00:22:07,804 --> 00:22:10,459
but you're gonna have to work
way harder.

299
00:22:10,546 --> 00:22:12,243
- Oh, I will, master.

300
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,769
- You have to become stronger.
- I know I can, master.

301
00:22:15,856 --> 00:22:18,946
- And you have to do everything
I ask of you,

302
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:21,340
no questions asked.

303
00:22:21,427 --> 00:22:23,559
- This has always been
my dream.

304
00:22:23,646 --> 00:22:25,344
I will do everything
I need to do

305
00:22:25,431 --> 00:22:27,389
to make this team, master.

306
00:22:27,476 --> 00:22:30,305
- It will take everything
you've got.

307
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:32,916
- Making this team
would mean everything.

308
00:22:33,003 --> 00:22:36,006
- It is the only thing.
This team means so much

309
00:22:36,093 --> 00:22:39,923
to the dojo, to the sport,
and to every American team

310
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:42,317
that follows.

311
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:45,842
- Where do we start?
What do I need to do, master?

312
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:49,455
- First, we need to get you
in more competitions.

313
00:22:49,542 --> 00:22:52,153
We'll have you compete
in local tournaments,

314
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,590
regional, nationals...
- and finally,

315
00:22:54,677 --> 00:22:56,462
the Olympic team selection
tournament.

316
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:58,159
- Yes. Yes.

317
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:01,728
Oh.

318
00:23:01,815 --> 00:23:06,515
I got this...Knot
in the middle of my back.

319
00:23:06,602 --> 00:23:08,604
Goes all the way up
through my neck.

320
00:23:12,086 --> 00:23:14,871
So I hear you've been doing
some masseuse work.

321
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:18,222
Yes.

322
00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:20,877
- Would you mind working this
out a little bit for me?

323
00:23:26,927 --> 00:23:29,495
Yes. Yes, that's it.

324
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:33,455
That's the spot.

325
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:36,066
They taught you well

326
00:23:36,153 --> 00:23:40,114
at your massage parlor
second job.

327
00:23:40,201 --> 00:23:44,640
- Yes, master,
it's for my family.

328
00:23:44,727 --> 00:23:47,382
My mother is the soul
provider.

329
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:51,081
I have a little sister
who's still in school and I...

330
00:23:51,168 --> 00:23:54,824
I do whatever I can to help
mom make ends meet at home.

331
00:23:54,911 --> 00:23:58,567
- That's very admirable
of you, Michele.

332
00:23:58,654 --> 00:24:01,570
But working two jobs...
That can distract you

333
00:24:01,657 --> 00:24:04,878
from your training.
- Oh, no, master.

334
00:24:06,923 --> 00:24:09,012
I will make certain that I
will complete every training

335
00:24:09,099 --> 00:24:11,580
you expect of me and more.

336
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:16,280
I'll come in early, work later,
whatever I have to do.

337
00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:18,239
I know I can do this.

338
00:24:18,326 --> 00:24:22,025
This is the most important
thing to me.

339
00:24:22,112 --> 00:24:24,158
That's what I wanted to hear,

340
00:24:32,122 --> 00:24:36,387
Do you know that building
where you do massages at

341
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:39,869
used to be a place where men
would have special favors

342
00:24:39,956 --> 00:24:44,004
performed for them by women
of the evening?

343
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,139
Does that make you feel odd
at all?

344
00:24:49,226 --> 00:24:53,579
Knowing that you work in a place
where women was taken

345
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:57,365
advantage of by men?

346
00:24:57,452 --> 00:25:00,586
No, no.

347
00:25:00,673 --> 00:25:03,458
I didn't mean to make you
feel uncomfortable.

348
00:25:03,545 --> 00:25:05,895
You didn't have to stop.

349
00:25:05,982 --> 00:25:07,897
Hmm.

350
00:25:07,984 --> 00:25:10,813
Well, we need to stop
for now anyway.

351
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,076
You need to go teach your class.

352
00:25:16,384 --> 00:25:18,125
We'll talk about this later.

353
00:25:20,431 --> 00:25:23,260
The Olympics, that is.

354
00:25:35,403 --> 00:25:38,145
- Knock-knock!
Mark, it's almost time!

355
00:25:42,845 --> 00:25:45,369
Those are supposed to be for
the guests after the wedding.

356
00:25:45,456 --> 00:25:46,893
- There's plenty more.

357
00:25:50,505 --> 00:25:52,855
Mark, the guests are starting
to arrive

358
00:25:52,942 --> 00:25:55,728
and Michele is almost ready
and soon you'll be married

359
00:25:55,815 --> 00:25:57,164
to the love of your life.

360
00:25:57,251 --> 00:25:59,427
- Thank you, you did such
an amazing job,

361
00:25:59,514 --> 00:26:02,822
and I cannot wait to make
Michele my partner for life.

362
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:05,259
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
what's next on this list?

363
00:26:05,346 --> 00:26:07,870
- I wanna know more about
who Michele was praying for.

364
00:26:07,957 --> 00:26:10,090
- Well, it says here that
she wants to have someone

365
00:26:10,177 --> 00:26:12,571
who can understand her,
to know what she's thinking

366
00:26:12,658 --> 00:26:15,138
even before she does.

367
00:26:15,225 --> 00:26:17,532
And even to the point where
she needs some help

368
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:19,752
and is maybe afraid to ask.

369
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:22,232
- It doesn't make much sense.
She doesn't know what she wants,

370
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:24,104
and she's afraid to ask for it.

371
00:26:24,191 --> 00:26:25,758
- Well, yeah, think about
the time when her mom

372
00:26:25,845 --> 00:26:28,412
lost her job in Tulsa
and the family had to move

373
00:26:28,499 --> 00:26:31,502
all back to Minnesota so her
mom could find another job.

374
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,852
- Whoa, they moved away
while she was training

375
00:26:32,939 --> 00:26:34,505
for the Olympic team?

376
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:37,639
- Yeah, so they moved,
but Michele stayed behind,

377
00:26:37,726 --> 00:26:39,728
and she continued to work
and pay bills

378
00:26:39,815 --> 00:26:42,165
and help her mom and support
her dad and her sister.

379
00:26:42,252 --> 00:26:44,603
Hold on a second,
so she's training

380
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,822
for the Olympic team,
her parents are gone,

381
00:26:46,909 --> 00:26:50,565
she's sending them money while
working part-time at two jobs.

382
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:52,393
- Well, that's the thing, you
know, making the Olympic team

383
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,613
was so important to her,

384
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:59,705
that literally for over a year,
she was homeless while training.

385
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:03,099
She was living in the car,
barely making ends meet.

386
00:27:03,186 --> 00:27:05,972
I tell you what, her will to win
made her so strong,

387
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:08,235
that after those times
she became so brave

388
00:27:08,322 --> 00:27:10,629
that whatever came her way,
she could handle.

389
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:17,636
Michele,
you must get the victory.

390
00:27:17,723 --> 00:27:19,725
You must win this fight.

391
00:27:19,812 --> 00:27:22,118
Victory, Michele.

392
00:27:22,205 --> 00:27:23,772
We worked very hard
for this,

393
00:27:23,859 --> 00:27:26,122
represent our dojo,
get the victory,

394
00:27:26,209 --> 00:27:28,864
you're a warrior, be a warrior.

395
00:27:28,951 --> 00:27:31,606
You must win.
Win this, Michele.

396
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:33,042

- We're getting stronger,
master!

432
00:29:57,447 --> 00:29:59,580
You have to work
much harder!

433
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:01,451
Yes, master!

434
00:30:01,538 --> 00:30:03,932
- You must commit
to working hard.

435
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:05,194
Yes, master!

436
00:30:05,281 --> 00:30:07,370
- Harder than ever before!

437
00:30:12,506 --> 00:30:13,855
- You must commit
to be working hard!

438
00:30:13,942 --> 00:30:15,901
Indestructible, master!

439
00:30:22,037 --> 00:30:23,996
- Harder than ever before!

440
00:30:29,697 --> 00:30:31,394
- That's the way to work
like a champion.

441
00:31:00,249 --> 00:31:01,816
- Not so much anymore.

442
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:07,517
- You don't have
to put up with that, you know.

443
00:31:07,604 --> 00:31:09,911
- Really? Why do you?

444
00:31:12,218 --> 00:31:16,875
- I do because...
Because I have nothing else.

445
00:31:16,962 --> 00:31:19,312
You're a real champion.

446
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:21,096
You're very bit
as good as I am.

447
00:31:22,924 --> 00:31:25,884
I'm good, but I'm not
as good as you are.

448
00:31:25,971 --> 00:31:30,105
- Come on!
You're great out there.

449
00:31:30,192 --> 00:31:34,109
You win all your tournaments.
You destroy every competitor.

450
00:31:34,196 --> 00:31:35,850
- I can't turn my anger
into power.

451
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:40,550
- Well, we all have
to vent somewhere.

452
00:31:40,637 --> 00:31:43,379
I just prefer to do it
in the ring.

453
00:31:45,294 --> 00:31:49,646
- See? That's what I'm saying.
You have control.

454
00:31:49,733 --> 00:31:52,127
You can make it
on another team.

455
00:31:52,214 --> 00:31:54,129
- Another team?

456
00:31:54,216 --> 00:31:56,392
I wouldn't even know
where to start.

457
00:31:56,479 --> 00:31:59,874
I mean, I have...I have
to stay here to be successful.

458
00:31:59,961 --> 00:32:04,183
- That's what I'm saying.
No, you don't, Michele.

459
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,836
There are other masters
who can help you make it

460
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,664
to the Olympics.

461
00:32:09,666 --> 00:32:12,582
Well, there's nothing
that brings me more pleasure

462
00:32:12,669 --> 00:32:16,369
than to see my two best
champions getting along.

463
00:32:18,762 --> 00:32:20,373
- Of course, master.

464
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,201
You two ladies
bring me great joy

465
00:32:22,288 --> 00:32:24,333
as your trainer.

466
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,640
I see you two doing
many things.

467
00:32:28,772 --> 00:32:31,558
But it's not going to happen
just sitting here.

468
00:32:33,255 --> 00:32:34,430
Get going!

469
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,742
- So did she make
the Olympics?

470
00:32:41,829 --> 00:32:45,876
Is the medal part of her
wedding gown? Something old?

471
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,661
- Well, she did receive
her black belt

472
00:32:47,748 --> 00:32:49,924
in less than a year.

473
00:32:50,011 --> 00:32:51,752
Nobody worked harder
than Michele

474
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:53,449
to be part of the team.

475
00:32:53,536 --> 00:32:56,583
I mean, she went to 15
competitions, state, regional,

476
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:59,716
and then eventually she was
ranked eighth nationally.

477
00:32:59,803 --> 00:33:01,849
- And I found out online
that taekwondo used to be

478
00:33:01,936 --> 00:33:04,721
a demonstration sport
in 1988.

479
00:33:04,808 --> 00:33:06,419
- That's right.
Seoul, South Korea.

480
00:33:06,506 --> 00:33:07,507
Summer Olympics.

481
00:33:07,594 --> 00:33:08,987
- Can you imagine,

482
00:33:09,074 --> 00:33:10,901
walking into the Olympic
stadium,

483
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,295
where all the eyes,
your friends, the world,

484
00:33:13,382 --> 00:33:15,080
are on you?

485
00:33:17,647 --> 00:33:19,127
Hm.

486
00:33:19,214 --> 00:33:21,086
- Next part of the story
is my favorite part.

487
00:33:21,173 --> 00:33:24,132
I wonder why.

488
00:33:24,219 --> 00:33:28,006
But really, she worked so hard
to earn her spot on that team.

489
00:33:28,093 --> 00:33:30,486
- Yeah, not only do you have
to be a great athlete,

490
00:33:30,573 --> 00:33:32,706
but.

491
00:33:34,229 --> 00:33:36,231
Even when you're at your best,

492
00:33:36,318 --> 00:33:38,277
the world can come
upside down on you

493
00:34:36,378 --> 00:34:39,207
- "Dear mom.

494
00:34:39,294 --> 00:34:41,644
"All is going well
here in Tulsa.

495
00:34:52,351 --> 00:34:54,396
"I just won another
competition,

496
00:34:54,483 --> 00:34:57,573
"which makes me now ranked
eighth in the entire country.

497
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:01,273
"Not bad for a little girl
from brainerd, Minnesota.

498
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,057
"Master says that I have
a real shot

499
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:05,364
"of becoming a part
of the Olympic team,

500
00:35:05,451 --> 00:35:07,757
"but what he doesn't know
is that I'm gonna make

501
00:35:07,844 --> 00:35:11,718
"this Olympic team no matter
what I have to do.

502
00:35:11,805 --> 00:35:14,024
"Then I'm gonna show him who
and what a real champion

503
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,330
"is made of.

504
00:35:15,417 --> 00:35:16,766
"How's dad?

505
00:35:19,334 --> 00:35:21,162
"I hope he's doing well

506
00:35:21,249 --> 00:35:26,602
"and Joanne's making sure she
keeps his water glass filled.

507
00:35:26,689 --> 00:35:29,170
"I think of you guys often.

508
00:35:29,257 --> 00:35:32,130
"I just wanna make you
proud of me.

509
00:35:32,217 --> 00:35:34,697
"I'm making a little extra
money and doing both jobs

510
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,743
"is working out just fine.

511
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:41,487
"My roommates...Are great.

512
00:35:41,574 --> 00:35:44,272
I hardly even notice
that they're around."

513
00:35:46,361 --> 00:35:48,929
- Yeah, I've got one.

514
00:35:49,016 --> 00:35:51,105
Oh!

515
00:35:55,675 --> 00:35:58,068
Hey, massage girl!

516
00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:11,778
- Yeah, massage girl,
we're your next appointment.

517
00:36:21,266 --> 00:36:23,877
Hey, massage girl!

518
00:36:23,964 --> 00:36:26,140
- Is it too late
to make an appointment?

519
00:36:26,227 --> 00:36:28,577
- Or are you egg-specting
someone else?

520
00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:44,680
- The doors, check the doors.
- Get her out of this car!

521
00:36:44,767 --> 00:36:46,726
Come on,
come out and play!

522
00:36:46,813 --> 00:36:48,989
Come on, massage girl!

523
00:36:49,076 --> 00:36:53,472
- Get out of the car!
- Man 3:

524
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:56,953
- Come on, get out!

525
00:37:04,396 --> 00:37:08,356
Come on, massage girl,
get out of the car!

526
00:37:08,443 --> 00:37:09,575
Unlock the door!

527
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:20,281
- You just ruined what could've
been such a great time for ya.

528
00:37:37,603 --> 00:37:38,995
Are you kidding me?!

529
00:37:39,082 --> 00:37:40,736
That's the best time
I've had all month.

530
00:37:40,823 --> 00:37:42,782
Alright, everybody freeze.

531
00:37:51,007 --> 00:37:52,879
You ever seen these guys before?

532
00:37:52,966 --> 00:37:54,402
I've seen that one
around,

533
00:37:54,489 --> 00:37:57,100
but they've never tried
to bother me before.

534
00:37:57,187 --> 00:38:00,060
- What are you doing here
so late at night anyway?

535
00:38:00,147 --> 00:38:04,978
- Uh, it's...It's a temporary
situation.

536
00:38:05,065 --> 00:38:08,286
Just for a couple of nights,
it's not a big deal, really.

537
00:38:08,373 --> 00:38:10,940
- Only temporary.

538
00:38:11,027 --> 00:38:12,725
You know it's not safe.

539
00:38:12,812 --> 00:38:14,770
These aren't the only
three guys

540
00:38:14,857 --> 00:38:16,555
that are crazy in Tulsa.

541
00:38:16,642 --> 00:38:19,471
- I know.
- I just work right there.

542
00:38:19,558 --> 00:38:22,082
And I'm always
really careful.

543
00:38:22,169 --> 00:38:24,737
It...it...it's temporary.

544
00:38:24,824 --> 00:38:28,262
I'm just in-between
roommates right now.

545
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:30,830
- Only temporary?

546
00:38:30,917 --> 00:38:33,223
- I have a girlfriend that
I'm gonna be moving in with here

547
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,792
really soon and then
everything will be alright.

548
00:38:36,879 --> 00:38:39,447
- You have any other means
to protect yourself?

549
00:38:48,804 --> 00:38:50,806
Pretty big gun
for such a little lady.

550
00:38:52,852 --> 00:38:55,028
I guess you know how
to handle yourself.

551
00:38:55,115 --> 00:38:57,247
- Yes, sir, I do.

552
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,249
- Look, I'm gonna let you off
with a warning,

553
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,600
'cause I know the owner
of the shopping center.

554
00:39:01,687 --> 00:39:05,517
He doesn't like people
sleeping in or out of their cars

555
00:39:05,604 --> 00:39:08,128
on his property.
- I...I...I didn't know.

556
00:39:10,435 --> 00:39:13,699
There's plenty
of places to sleep.

557
00:39:13,786 --> 00:39:16,310
If you need help with something,
a friend, someone to talk to,

558
00:39:16,397 --> 00:39:18,660
you just give me a call.

559
00:39:18,747 --> 00:39:20,662
But after tonight,
I don't wanna see you

560
00:39:20,749 --> 00:39:22,577
sleeping here anymore.

561
00:39:24,405 --> 00:39:25,624
- Thank you.

562
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,679
So, the Michael J. Fox film.

563
00:39:37,766 --> 00:39:39,681
- Yeah, at the drive-in.
- Yeah, I think so too.

564
00:39:39,768 --> 00:39:41,466
That would be pretty cool.
- Yeah, that would be

565
00:39:41,553 --> 00:39:43,990
pretty cool.
- Hello, master Cho's?

566
00:39:45,295 --> 00:39:47,385
- You wanna speak with Michele?

567
00:39:47,472 --> 00:39:48,734
Alright,
give me just a moment.

568
00:39:48,821 --> 00:39:50,170
Michele!

569
00:39:56,785 --> 00:39:58,352
Come on.

570
00:39:58,439 --> 00:40:00,833
- Hello, this is Michele.

571
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,878
Michele,
this is your mom.

572
00:40:02,965 --> 00:40:06,055
I've been worried about you,
how you doing?

573
00:40:06,142 --> 00:40:10,364
- Mom, hi. Yeah, sorry,
I'm fine.

574
00:40:10,451 --> 00:40:14,673
Everything's good here.
Working out and training.

575
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,110
We just competed for regionals
and it won't be long

576
00:40:17,197 --> 00:40:18,894
before we compete
for the nationals.

577
00:40:18,981 --> 00:40:21,593
And then the Olympics.

578
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,683
- Oh, that's great news, honey.

579
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:28,121
I was just worried because
your letters all come

580
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:31,559
with a return address
from the dojo.

581
00:40:31,646 --> 00:40:34,823
- Don't you have a place to live?
- Of course!

582
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:37,217
I have a roommate
and everything.

583
00:40:37,304 --> 00:40:39,872
I'm just here at the dojo
training so much,

584
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:41,961
I just thought I'd have
my mail sent here.

585
00:40:42,048 --> 00:40:45,312
Oh, well,
I guess that makes sense.

586
00:40:45,399 --> 00:40:47,140
Thank you for continuing
to send money,

587
00:40:47,227 --> 00:40:50,926
that really helps US out a lot.

588
00:40:51,013 --> 00:40:54,887
Dad's better,
and Joanne's enjoying school

589
00:40:54,974 --> 00:40:58,499
and rekindling relationships
with old girlfriends.

590
00:40:58,586 --> 00:41:00,196
- That's so good to hear, mom.

591
00:41:02,329 --> 00:41:04,853
- She asks about you
almost every day.

592
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,073
Joanne really misses you, honey.

593
00:41:11,164 --> 00:41:15,211
- Oh, gosh, mom,
I miss you guys so much.

594
00:41:16,822 --> 00:41:18,432
Are we gonna get
started or what?

595
00:41:20,347 --> 00:41:22,349
- Tell Joanne hi from me, mom.
I gotta go.

596
00:41:22,436 --> 00:41:24,438
Master's about to start
our workout.

597
00:41:24,525 --> 00:41:27,180
So, I love you guys,
and I'll talk to you later?

598
00:41:27,267 --> 00:41:30,618
- Love you, sweetheart.
- Okay, bye.

599
00:41:47,896 --> 00:41:50,203
- Today is the beginning
of the end.

600
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,902
- Now, all of you
will be champions.

601
00:41:56,296 --> 00:41:58,472
- So today.

602
00:41:58,559 --> 00:41:59,734
I will push you.

603
00:42:02,345 --> 00:42:04,870
To the end.

604
00:42:04,957 --> 00:42:07,568
I don't want any babies here!

605
00:42:07,655 --> 00:42:08,961
Are you a baby?!

606
00:42:13,226 --> 00:42:14,532
Or a champion?!

607
00:42:14,619 --> 00:42:16,272
Champions, master!

608
00:42:30,896 --> 00:42:32,985
- Beaten by a girl?!

609
00:42:33,072 --> 00:42:35,814
You're gonna let a little girl
beat you?!

610
00:42:35,901 --> 00:42:37,946
You think the Olympics
is gonna let you fight a girl?!

611
00:42:47,826 --> 00:42:49,871
- Is this what you wanted
to show me?!

612
00:42:49,958 --> 00:42:52,221
You lying here
crying like a baby?

613
00:42:52,308 --> 00:42:54,833
Be a man! Get up!

614
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,617
You're interrupting my work.

615
00:42:59,054 --> 00:43:00,969
How many more babies
will cry tonight?

616
00:43:06,018 --> 00:43:08,281
- Why am I seeing this?

617
00:43:08,368 --> 00:43:10,283
You should be so much
better by now!

618
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:11,676
- Indestructible, master!

619
00:43:13,373 --> 00:43:16,028
You all look
like glass flowers!

620
00:43:16,115 --> 00:43:17,943
So easy to break!

621
00:43:19,205 --> 00:43:21,686
- Are you breakable?!
- No, master!

622
00:43:21,773 --> 00:43:24,863
- Then show me!
- Indestructible, master!

623
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:35,874
- I know you all hate me.

624
00:43:35,961 --> 00:43:38,790
I know you all feel like
I am pushing you too hard.

625
00:43:38,877 --> 00:43:41,749
You must be at your best
for this next tournament.

626
00:43:41,836 --> 00:43:46,058
For some of you,
there will be no tomorrow.

627
00:43:46,145 --> 00:43:49,235
You must show your strength.

628
00:43:49,322 --> 00:43:53,543
You must be ready.
You must show your power.

629
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,067
Or you will not be.

630
00:43:56,764 --> 00:43:59,027
I'm tired of looking at you.

631
00:43:59,114 --> 00:44:00,376
Get out of here!

632
00:44:02,509 --> 00:44:06,556
Neil, after you shower,
meet me in my office.

633
00:44:10,778 --> 00:44:14,216

- Yes.
- Hey, kiddo.

646
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:34,079
What's, uh,
what's going on?

647
00:45:34,166 --> 00:45:37,691
Did you find that...you find
that place to...Stay?

648
00:45:40,694 --> 00:45:42,261
Really need to work on that.

649
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,920
I'm guessing that's not why
you're...

650
00:45:49,007 --> 00:45:50,486
You're at the police station.

651
00:45:53,315 --> 00:45:56,231
Did somebody try
to hurt you again?

652
00:45:56,318 --> 00:45:58,016
Yes.

653
00:45:59,626 --> 00:46:04,022
But I don't think anyone
will ever believe me.

654
00:46:04,109 --> 00:46:06,415
- Look, it's...it's hard
to be alone.

655
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,768
But you gotta find
somebody to talk to.

656
00:46:14,728 --> 00:46:17,905
But you have to open up
to somebody. Let me help you.

657
00:46:17,992 --> 00:46:21,213
- You can't!
Nobody can help me.

658
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,910
- That's not true.

659
00:46:24,216 --> 00:46:29,830
My wife...She's a nurse,
you could talk to her.

660
00:46:29,917 --> 00:46:32,485
How about if you let me
arrange for you two to meet?

661
00:46:37,533 --> 00:46:38,752
You could talk to her,
maybe it'll be easier

662
00:46:38,839 --> 00:46:40,188
for you to talk to her.

663
00:46:41,886 --> 00:46:44,366
- Nobody can help me.

664
00:46:44,453 --> 00:46:46,673
Nobody actually wants
to help anyone.

665
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:50,677
All they wanna do is to take
and to hurt.

666
00:46:50,764 --> 00:46:54,072
- No, that's...no,
that's not true, no.

667
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:59,425
Look. You have my card.
My wife's name is Julie.

668
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:06,084
I'm confident she can help you
find someone who can.

669
00:47:06,171 --> 00:47:08,521
Let's go inside
and set something up.

670
00:47:08,608 --> 00:47:10,001
Come on.

671
00:47:17,443 --> 00:47:20,968
- Hmm.
- Oh, this is my favorite.

672
00:47:21,055 --> 00:47:25,146
"Compassionate listener."
- What?

673
00:47:25,233 --> 00:47:26,887
- Compassionate listener.

674
00:47:26,974 --> 00:47:28,628
- What? What...what does she
mean by that?

675
00:47:28,715 --> 00:47:30,760
- Well, you know,
compassionate listener,

676
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:34,982
so, someone that's gonna really
listen to her.

677
00:47:35,069 --> 00:47:37,637
Not that they have to have
these great words of wisdom,

678
00:47:37,724 --> 00:47:41,641
or a plan to save the day,
but you know that together,

679
00:47:41,728 --> 00:47:44,035
they can handle anything
that comes their way.

680
00:47:44,122 --> 00:47:46,080
- Yeah, I so wish I had
a partner like that.

681
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:51,477
- Compassionate listening.
- Yeah, right, you know,

682
00:47:51,564 --> 00:47:56,047
like, hers, mine, ours,
anybody's?

683
00:47:56,134 --> 00:47:58,440
That's what makes her
a wonderful physician.

684
00:47:58,527 --> 00:48:01,008
- Compassionate listening.
- Right.

685
00:48:01,095 --> 00:48:04,838
Not just what someone's been
feeling, but what's in the soul.

686
00:48:04,925 --> 00:48:07,406
'Cause that's truly what
drives the heart and body.

687
00:48:07,493 --> 00:48:08,537
- She takes this into
consideration

688
00:48:08,624 --> 00:48:10,191
with each and every patient?

689
00:48:10,278 --> 00:48:13,020
- Yeah, man. It's not just
about winning or losing

690
00:48:13,107 --> 00:48:15,805
and how you play the game,
but it's how you touch

691
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:18,547
the heart and soul of a person.

692
00:48:18,634 --> 00:48:20,985
And that's how Michele
treats all of her patients.

693
00:48:21,072 --> 00:48:23,074
And that is what made her
a mayor player

694
00:48:23,161 --> 00:48:24,510
in the taekwondo community.

695
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:42,920
- Hmm, that looks
really good right there.

696
00:48:45,487 --> 00:48:48,403
I am so proud of you.

697
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:49,839
This is amazing.

698
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:53,104
When you first walked in,

699
00:48:53,191 --> 00:48:55,410
I thought you'd never be
anything more than a blue belt.

700
00:48:56,846 --> 00:49:00,198
And a girl just picking up
everybody's towels.

701
00:49:00,285 --> 00:49:03,853
But now, now you're on the edge
of becoming one

702
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:06,639
of my greatest champions.

703
00:49:08,641 --> 00:49:11,252
After training,

704
00:49:11,339 --> 00:49:14,516
we should go celebrate,
just you and I.

705
00:49:14,603 --> 00:49:19,521
- I can't. Uh, I have to work
at the massage parlor tonight.

706
00:49:19,608 --> 00:49:21,480
We have several clients
coming in late.

707
00:49:22,916 --> 00:49:25,092
Well, I'm sure
you can squeeze some time

708
00:49:25,179 --> 00:49:27,486
- in it for me.
- Uh, no, no.

709
00:49:27,573 --> 00:49:32,317
Sorry, uh, I just can't. Sorry.

710
00:49:32,404 --> 00:49:35,537
- Can't...or won't?

711
00:49:37,931 --> 00:49:40,455
- Won't.

712
00:49:40,542 --> 00:49:41,935
- Won't?

713
00:49:43,328 --> 00:49:46,461
Won't?! Won't?!

714
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:50,378
We'll see about that.

715
00:49:50,465 --> 00:49:51,945
You win a few titles,
you think you're too good

716
00:49:52,032 --> 00:49:53,512
for master now?

717
00:49:55,731 --> 00:49:57,646
We'll see who needs who.

718
00:50:07,265 --> 00:50:10,094
Follow your match,
as you push the boundaries!

719
00:50:10,181 --> 00:50:14,185

have her respect

You disappoint me,.

778
00:54:27,002 --> 00:54:28,526
Get out of my sight!

779
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:40,668
Ah!

780
00:54:40,755 --> 00:54:42,801
What? My foot fell asleep.

781
00:54:42,888 --> 00:54:43,889
- Really?

782
00:54:46,457 --> 00:54:49,242
So Mark, Michele never
made it to the Olympics?

783
00:54:49,329 --> 00:54:52,811
- No, she tore her acl,
mcl, and pcl.

784
00:54:52,898 --> 00:54:54,378
And get this.

785
00:54:54,465 --> 00:54:56,423
She couldn't afford a doctor,
so she worked out

786
00:54:56,510 --> 00:54:59,121
the damage on her own.

787
00:54:59,208 --> 00:55:01,733
Using duct tape.

788
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:04,213
- And learning what she could
on her own with rehab.

789
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:06,694
Man,
after all that sacrifice, too,

790
00:55:06,781 --> 00:55:08,870
all the training,
living out of her car,

791
00:55:08,957 --> 00:55:13,135
being alone...The abuse,
the unwanted advances

792
00:55:13,222 --> 00:55:15,399
she took from that master.

793
00:55:15,486 --> 00:55:18,445
No, she never competed
again after the injury.

794
00:55:18,532 --> 00:55:21,622
Instead, she turned all of her
attention to massage therapy.

795
00:55:21,709 --> 00:55:24,321
All alone,
seeking a new direction.

796
00:55:24,408 --> 00:55:26,801
- And why didn't she move
back to Minnesota then?

797
00:55:26,888 --> 00:55:28,150
It would've had to have been
easier than living

798
00:55:28,237 --> 00:55:30,065
out of her car at that point.

799
00:55:30,152 --> 00:55:31,632
- Well, yeah, and eventually,

800
00:55:31,719 --> 00:55:33,634
she did get herself
an apartment,

801
00:55:33,721 --> 00:55:35,767
but that was only after
her massage clientele

802
00:55:35,854 --> 00:55:38,030
became more regular.

803
00:55:38,117 --> 00:55:40,946
- And that's when she became
a master of massage therapy.

804
00:55:41,033 --> 00:55:43,557
- She was.
She spent every moment reading

805
00:55:43,644 --> 00:55:46,038
everything she could
about anatomy.

806
00:55:46,125 --> 00:55:48,519
And that champion mentality
kicked in again,

807
00:55:48,606 --> 00:55:50,477
and she read every book
she could get her hands on.

808
00:55:55,787 --> 00:55:57,179
- Hi.
- Hey.

809
00:56:04,099 --> 00:56:06,711
So how you been?

810
00:56:06,798 --> 00:56:09,931
Really...pretty good.

811
00:56:13,065 --> 00:56:16,329
Oh. Oh, my gosh,
you always know

812
00:56:16,416 --> 00:56:18,244
right where to start.

813
00:56:18,331 --> 00:56:20,377
- The more I learn about
how the body works,

814
00:56:20,464 --> 00:56:23,162
the easier it is to zero in
on how best to help my clients.

815
00:56:23,249 --> 00:56:24,424
- Hmm.

816
00:56:26,557 --> 00:56:27,732
Mm.

817
00:56:30,604 --> 00:56:33,520
You know, Michele,
it's been a little over a year

818
00:56:33,607 --> 00:56:35,174
since you let Brian
introduce US,

819
00:56:35,261 --> 00:56:37,872
and we finally started
getting to know each other.

820
00:56:37,959 --> 00:56:40,135
Yeah, it's been great
knowing that I have friends

821
00:56:40,222 --> 00:56:42,050
like the two of you.

822
00:56:42,137 --> 00:56:44,139
And that there are even
people in the world like you

823
00:56:44,226 --> 00:56:47,752
who care so much about others.

824
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:50,581
- And I see you so many times
take so much joy

825
00:56:50,668 --> 00:56:53,279
in studying those
anatomy books.

826
00:56:53,366 --> 00:56:56,195
- Well, you know my mom
is a nurse,

827
00:56:56,282 --> 00:56:58,763
and I guess it was just me
watching her study all the time,

828
00:56:58,850 --> 00:57:03,245
and...seeing my dad become
more disabled every year,

829
00:57:03,332 --> 00:57:06,858
I mean, that all made me wanna
learn more about health.

830
00:57:06,945 --> 00:57:08,686
- I see that.

831
00:57:08,773 --> 00:57:12,951
But there's
also this determination.

832
00:57:13,038 --> 00:57:18,435
- Well, I just, I don't wanna
be like them. Sick.

833
00:57:18,522 --> 00:57:21,525
I mean, the more I understand
how the body works,

834
00:57:21,612 --> 00:57:23,788
the more I...Feel like
I understand what it takes

835
00:57:23,875 --> 00:57:25,398
to be healthy.

836
00:57:25,485 --> 00:57:27,139
And the more I wish I could
find a way to help

837
00:57:27,226 --> 00:57:28,270
others live better too.

838
00:57:28,357 --> 00:57:31,665
Okay.

839
00:57:31,752 --> 00:57:35,582
What I'm getting at, Michele,
is...

840
00:57:35,669 --> 00:57:37,541
I mean, you're a great masseuse,

841
00:57:37,628 --> 00:57:40,413
I've never experienced anyone
better.

842
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,633
And don't get me wrong,
I'm sure it's a great way

843
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,025
to make a living.

844
00:57:44,112 --> 00:57:45,157
- Soon, I'll have enough
clients

845
00:57:45,244 --> 00:57:47,464
to invest in a newer car.

846
00:57:47,551 --> 00:57:49,596
- I'm really happy
for you, Michele,

847
00:57:49,683 --> 00:57:52,294
but Brian and I have been
talking for a while,

848
00:57:52,381 --> 00:57:55,863
and we believe you need a break.

849
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:57,604
- Well, to tell you
the truth, Julie,

850
00:57:57,691 --> 00:58:00,346
I am so blessed to have
this job,

851
00:58:00,433 --> 00:58:03,654
and to have you two
as friends and clients.

852
00:58:03,741 --> 00:58:06,395
Plus, my list of clients
almost grows every week.

853
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,833
- Ah, I'm sure it does,
but you work so hard,

854
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:10,704
and with everything
you went through

855
00:58:10,791 --> 00:58:12,619
training for the Olympics...

856
00:58:12,706 --> 00:58:15,579
- Yeah, I definitely learned
a lot then,

857
00:58:15,666 --> 00:58:19,321
about hard work and...
Especially about people.

858
00:58:19,408 --> 00:58:22,455
Who to trust and who not to.

859
00:58:22,542 --> 00:58:26,111
I learned what it was like
to want something so bad

860
00:58:26,198 --> 00:58:28,417
and to be so close.

861
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:31,769
- Yeah, you've definitely
had a lot of obstacles

862
00:58:31,856 --> 00:58:33,205
to overcome.

863
00:58:33,292 --> 00:58:35,294
- And people who made it
seem like my goals

864
00:58:35,381 --> 00:58:37,644
were so far out of reach.

865
00:58:37,731 --> 00:58:39,385
- Okay, look.

866
00:58:39,472 --> 00:58:41,430
You trust Brian and I,
don't you?

867
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:43,607
- Yes.
- And you know

868
00:58:43,694 --> 00:58:47,088
we both want you to succeed.
- Yeah?

869
00:58:47,175 --> 00:58:49,787
- So let US do something
for you, Michele.

870
00:58:49,874 --> 00:58:51,658
I mean, we both think
it's yet to be seen

871
00:58:51,745 --> 00:58:54,095
what your greatest
victory involves.

872
00:58:55,575 --> 00:58:58,404
- I don't think I understand
what you're getting at.

873
00:58:58,491 --> 00:59:01,450
- There's always been something
greater for you out there.

874
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:03,496
There always was,
there always will be,

875
00:59:03,583 --> 00:59:07,413
but you have to set your mind
to it and make it happen.

876
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:10,590
Michele, do you understand?

877
00:59:10,677 --> 00:59:14,899
- I don't. Taekwondo
is all I knew.

878
00:59:14,986 --> 00:59:17,597
I mean, even if I had made it
to the Olympics,

879
00:59:17,684 --> 00:59:19,599
I have no idea what
I would've done after.

880
00:59:19,686 --> 00:59:21,775
- Okay, maybe it's time to start
giving some serious thought

881
00:59:21,862 --> 00:59:24,778
to that, maybe it's time
to make a decision,

882
00:59:24,865 --> 00:59:29,174
take a chance, and Brian and I
will take it with you.

883
00:59:29,261 --> 00:59:31,480
- I still don't know
what you mean.

884
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:35,180
I can't compete anymore,
my leg.

885
00:59:35,267 --> 00:59:37,965
And I just can't do anything
like that ever again.

886
00:59:38,052 --> 00:59:40,359
- No, Michele.

887
00:59:40,446 --> 00:59:42,709
But there are other things
you could be great at,

888
00:59:42,796 --> 00:59:45,233
maybe even the best at.

889
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:48,193
But you have to decide
what that's gonna be.

890
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:51,065
Look, here's what we
have decided:

891
00:59:51,152 --> 00:59:53,894
If you can decide what it is
you wanna be,

892
00:59:53,981 --> 00:59:57,071
we wanna pay for your first
semester of college.

893
00:59:57,158 --> 00:59:59,334
'Cause we wanna get you started,

894
00:59:59,421 --> 01:00:01,728
'cause we know once you're
on your way,

895
01:00:01,815 --> 01:00:03,991
there's no stopping you.

896
01:00:07,386 --> 01:00:08,735
- Okay?

897
01:00:13,697 --> 01:00:16,438
- Hello?
- Mom?

898
01:00:16,525 --> 01:00:19,746
- Michele, my word!
How are you?

899
01:00:19,833 --> 01:00:22,836
- I'm good, how are you guys?

900
01:00:22,923 --> 01:00:25,317
- Your dad's the same,
and Joanne's busy

901
01:00:25,404 --> 01:00:28,363
with who knows what-all
and who with.

902
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:31,540
And, uh, I’m...I'm good.

903
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:32,759
- That's nice, mom.

904
01:00:35,414 --> 01:00:37,068
Can I ask you a question?

905
01:00:37,155 --> 01:00:39,897
- Of course, honey,
what's on your mind?

906
01:00:39,984 --> 01:00:43,422
- Why did you decide
to become a nurse?

907
01:00:43,509 --> 01:00:46,338
- Ooh, lots of reasons,
I suppose.

908
01:00:46,425 --> 01:00:51,473
Uh...geez, I...that was
a long time ago.

909
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:56,130
- Well, do you remember any,
or even just one of the reasons?

910
01:00:56,217 --> 01:00:59,351
- Well, as a family, I...I knew
we needed the money,

911
01:00:59,438 --> 01:01:01,832
even before your dad's
accident.

912
01:01:01,919 --> 01:01:05,009
- So...was money
the only reason?

913
01:01:06,967 --> 01:01:11,232
- Well, never really told
anybody this, but,

914
01:01:11,319 --> 01:01:15,193
when your grandmother
was sick and in the hospital,

915
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:20,807
I noticed...Well, I noticed
the nurses were so attentive

916
01:01:20,894 --> 01:01:23,592
with all the patients.

917
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:29,120
Her doctors were good,
but they all seemed so busy,

918
01:01:29,207 --> 01:01:32,253
had very little time
to spend with US.

919
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:35,213
Or on the floor either,
for that matter.

920
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:40,827
But the nurses, well,
they made US feel like family.

921
01:01:40,914 --> 01:01:44,135
They seemed to care as much
for the family

922
01:01:44,222 --> 01:01:47,268
as they did about grandma.

923
01:01:47,355 --> 01:01:51,838
And their compassion...Really
struck me,

924
01:01:51,925 --> 01:01:55,102
and it made me realize
that I wanna do something

925
01:01:55,189 --> 01:01:57,975
to help people.

926
01:01:58,062 --> 01:02:01,195
In...in a very special way.

927
01:02:01,282 --> 01:02:03,328
- I had no idea.

928
01:02:03,415 --> 01:02:06,331
Why are you
so full of questions.

929
01:02:06,418 --> 01:02:12,076
- I just...I think it's time to
start thinking about a future.

930
01:02:12,163 --> 01:02:13,817
I mean, all I've thought about
the past few years

931
01:02:13,904 --> 01:02:16,776
is taekwondo and...There hasn't
really been much room

932
01:02:16,863 --> 01:02:21,346
for anything else, but now...

933
01:02:21,433 --> 01:02:25,480
Now I think it's time to start
making room for a future.

934
01:02:25,567 --> 01:02:27,744
- Well, first you need
to figure out

935
01:02:27,831 --> 01:02:30,398
what you enjoy doing,

936
01:02:30,485 --> 01:02:33,271
because you might be doing it
for a very long time.

937
01:02:35,012 --> 01:02:39,494
And then...Let your heart,

938
01:02:39,581 --> 01:02:43,107
your passion,
do the heavy lifting.

939
01:02:52,986 --> 01:02:56,424
- Michele?
- I know what I wanna be!

940
01:02:56,511 --> 01:03:00,820
- That's great, what is it?
- I'm gonna become a doctor.

941
01:03:00,907 --> 01:03:02,779
- Well, let's go inside and you
can tell me all about it.

942
01:03:04,868 --> 01:03:06,739
Come on, don't you
think this story

943
01:03:06,826 --> 01:03:09,263
is getting a little
hard to believe?

944
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:11,135
I mean, she's...she's working
on being

945
01:03:11,222 --> 01:03:13,790
a homeless Olympic champion,

946
01:03:13,877 --> 01:03:15,879
and now she has somebody
footing the bill for college

947
01:03:15,966 --> 01:03:17,532
so she can become a doctor?

948
01:03:17,619 --> 01:03:19,491
- She became a doctor, dude.
- And a woman can be

949
01:03:19,578 --> 01:03:20,797
anything she wants to be...
- that's right, yes.

950
01:03:20,884 --> 01:03:22,537
- ...When she puts her mind
to it.

951
01:03:22,624 --> 01:03:25,062
- Yes, but what I'm saying is,
maybe Mark is telling the story

952
01:03:25,149 --> 01:03:28,761
with a little bit of bias
because he's so in love.

953
01:03:28,848 --> 01:03:30,545
- I can vouch for Mark.
- Me too.

954
01:03:30,632 --> 01:03:32,765
Or should we say,
we can vouch for Michele.

955
01:03:32,852 --> 01:03:36,595
- Oh, yeah, Mark hasn't
told you this part, Jim,

956
01:03:36,682 --> 01:03:38,902
but you're gonna find this
even harder to believe.

957
01:03:38,989 --> 01:03:40,817
- Yeah, remember we set her up
with her first semester

958
01:03:40,904 --> 01:03:43,776
of college, and then she didn't
need another dime.

959
01:03:43,863 --> 01:03:47,040
- No. She did so well in school
that every semester,

960
01:03:47,127 --> 01:03:49,173
she won scholarship
after scholarship

961
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:51,131
and put herself through
medical school.

962
01:03:51,218 --> 01:03:53,873
- She sure did,
it was that champion mentality.

963
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:56,093
That will to survive,
and of course,

964
01:03:56,180 --> 01:03:58,356
the encouragement of a few
great friends

965
01:03:58,443 --> 01:04:00,227
that got her all
the way through.

966
01:04:00,314 --> 01:04:01,707
- Oh, and let's not forget,

967
01:04:01,794 --> 01:04:03,622
she went into medicine
to help people.

968
01:04:03,709 --> 01:04:06,233
- And then she became a doctor,
and she met Mark,

969
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:08,670
and we all lived happily
ever after.

970
01:04:08,757 --> 01:04:14,024
- Well, she...she did become
a doctor, but happy?

971
01:04:14,111 --> 01:04:16,417
Well, that was still
a heartache away.

972
01:04:34,131 --> 01:04:36,263
- Alright, Dr. Neil,
come on in,

973
01:04:36,350 --> 01:04:37,525
I'd like you to meet
Dr. Connors.

974
01:04:37,612 --> 01:04:38,962
- Hi.
- Hello.

975
01:04:39,049 --> 01:04:40,659
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

976
01:04:40,746 --> 01:04:44,576
- I was telling Dr. Connors
you come to US as, uh,

977
01:04:44,663 --> 01:04:48,275
sort of a first-round draft pick
so to speak.

978
01:04:48,362 --> 01:04:52,279
With your, uh, impressive
scholastic resume

979
01:04:52,366 --> 01:04:57,719
and your eagerness to put
your education into practice.

980
01:04:57,806 --> 01:05:02,072
- Well, I really appreciate
that, but I'm just so excited

981
01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:06,163
to learn from each one
of you at the clinic as well.

982
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:07,077
- Good to know.

983
01:05:08,556 --> 01:05:10,341
And, uh, to get you off
to a good start,

984
01:05:10,428 --> 01:05:12,604
I'm gonna have you spend
some time with Dr. Connors

985
01:05:12,691 --> 01:05:15,346
for a few days,
to get acclimated

986
01:05:15,433 --> 01:05:18,915
to how our practice
works around here.

987
01:05:19,002 --> 01:05:20,655
- Absolutely,
look forward to it.

988
01:05:24,877 --> 01:05:25,922
- Daniels.

989
01:05:31,188 --> 01:05:33,451
- You can call me Kim.
- Alright.

990
01:05:33,538 --> 01:05:35,409
- It's nice to finally have
another female doctor

991
01:05:35,496 --> 01:05:38,673
around this place full of
antediluvian-thinking

992
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:41,285
- testosterone.
- Both:

993
01:05:43,548 --> 01:05:46,943
- Usually, the first few days,
a new doctor will shadow

994
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:49,989
a couple of US,
just to see how the clinic works

995
01:05:50,076 --> 01:05:53,514
and how we work with patients,
and how best to keep up

996
01:05:53,601 --> 01:05:55,821
with the pace.
- Alright? Bye.

997
01:05:58,606 --> 01:05:59,607
Well, you doctors have
plenty of time

998
01:05:59,694 --> 01:06:02,001
to get acquainted.

999
01:06:02,088 --> 01:06:04,351
Let's get out there and help
a lot of people feel better.

1000
01:06:04,438 --> 01:06:06,397
- Thank you.

1001
01:06:06,484 --> 01:06:09,139
"Get used to the pace"?

1002
01:06:09,226 --> 01:06:12,446
- Yeah, girl, there are a lot
of people around this place

1003
01:06:12,533 --> 01:06:14,144
who need our attention.

1004
01:06:14,231 --> 01:06:16,798
Bandaged up and set up
with the right medications

1005
01:06:16,885 --> 01:06:20,672
to help keep them going
each and every day.

1006
01:06:20,759 --> 01:06:24,284
- So how many patients
do we see in a day?

1007
01:06:24,371 --> 01:06:27,722
- Uh, you'll probably start
by seeing about ten.

1008
01:06:27,809 --> 01:06:31,813
- Really? Ten patients a day?

1009
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:36,949
- Yes, but six months from now,
you'll be clocking in around 20.

1010
01:06:37,036 --> 01:06:38,690
- If you say so.

1011
01:06:40,692 --> 01:06:44,652
- You know, make sure you have
plenty of pens and script pads,

1012
01:06:44,739 --> 01:06:46,176
'cause you're gonna need 'em.

1013
01:06:47,568 --> 01:06:50,658
And the first couple of days,
you're gonna be with me,

1014
01:06:50,745 --> 01:06:53,183
then I'm gonna hand you over
to one of these

1015
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:54,880
- Okay.

1016
01:06:54,967 --> 01:06:57,535
- By the way, if I were you,

1017
01:06:57,622 --> 01:07:00,799
I'd make sure I get myself
a comfortable pair of shoes,

1018
01:07:00,886 --> 01:07:03,106
that's the only way you're gonna
be able to keep up. Alright?

1019
01:07:07,588 --> 01:07:10,983
Mrs. Sanders, how are you doing
this morning?

1020
01:07:11,070 --> 01:07:14,378
- Well, I tell you, Dr. Connors,
my indigestion is back.

1021
01:07:14,465 --> 01:07:16,554
And my back, I can't seem
to get a good night's rest

1022
01:07:16,641 --> 01:07:18,295
from all the aching.

1023
01:07:18,382 --> 01:07:21,733
And of course, that just keeps
me so tired all the time.

1024
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:23,517
- Hmm, I see.
- Do you think I should see

1025
01:07:23,604 --> 01:07:26,129
a chiropractor for my back
pain?

1026
01:07:26,216 --> 01:07:30,176
- Uh, hm, I don't think
that'll be necessary.

1027
01:07:30,263 --> 01:07:32,874
Did you use all the prescription
that I gave you last month?

1028
01:07:32,961 --> 01:07:35,486
- I did. But it just didn't...
- that should've helped you

1029
01:07:35,573 --> 01:07:37,749
soothe your issues.

1030
01:07:37,836 --> 01:07:39,751
- Well, I was certainly
hoping it would.

1031
01:07:39,838 --> 01:07:43,929
- I tell you what, let's try
something a little different.

1032
01:07:44,016 --> 01:07:46,671
This will help you
with your indigestion,

1033
01:07:46,758 --> 01:07:50,066
and I'll give you a little
something to help you sleep.

1034
01:07:53,286 --> 01:07:54,766
- What are you eating over
there?

1035
01:07:54,853 --> 01:07:55,854
- Oh this?
- Mm-hmm.

1036
01:07:55,941 --> 01:07:57,160
- Just a little hard candy.

1037
01:07:57,247 --> 01:07:58,726
I suck on them
throughout the day,

1038
01:07:58,813 --> 01:08:01,338
it seems to give me some relief.

1039
01:08:01,425 --> 01:08:03,514
- How many would you say
you have in a day?

1040
01:08:03,601 --> 01:08:05,429
- Hmm, never really
thought about it,

1041
01:08:05,516 --> 01:08:08,649
just eat one anytime the urge
strikes me.

1042
01:08:08,736 --> 01:08:12,436
- Okay, I'll have the ladies
at the front desk

1043
01:08:12,523 --> 01:08:15,787
call this in for you,
and...Make sure you take

1044
01:08:15,874 --> 01:08:18,311
each and every one of them.

1045
01:08:18,398 --> 01:08:21,880
That's gonna help US determine
specs on your issues.

1046
01:08:21,967 --> 01:08:24,839
- Well, I guess you know best.
After all, you're the doctor.

1047
01:08:36,329 --> 01:08:39,071
- Okay, now, if we were
to stay in there another second

1048
01:08:39,158 --> 01:08:41,639
with that woman, she would have
talked to you

1049
01:08:41,726 --> 01:08:44,903
to the end of most of the day
about everything that goes on

1050
01:08:44,990 --> 01:08:47,732
with her all week long.

1051
01:08:47,819 --> 01:08:51,562
- Couldn't that help US learn
more about why she's sick

1052
01:08:51,649 --> 01:08:54,260
in the first place?

1053
01:08:54,347 --> 01:08:56,871
- Maybe, but I doubt it,
and besides,

1054
01:08:56,958 --> 01:08:59,874
we have 20 other patients
to see today,

1055
01:08:59,961 --> 01:09:02,616
and if we talk to all of them
the way you tried to talk

1056
01:09:02,703 --> 01:09:06,403
to Mrs. Sanders, we'd only see
about four or five a day,

1057
01:09:06,490 --> 01:09:08,927
and that's no way
to keep your job.

1058
01:09:09,014 --> 01:09:13,410
- I get that, but couldn't there
be something else going on

1059
01:09:13,497 --> 01:09:16,717
that's causing her
all these symptoms?

1060
01:09:16,804 --> 01:09:19,285
- Are you questioning
my diagnosis?

1061
01:09:19,372 --> 01:09:21,896
I'll Chuck this down
as inexperience.

1062
01:09:21,983 --> 01:09:23,681
Mrs. Sanders has been
a patient of mine

1063
01:09:23,768 --> 01:09:26,858
for the past five years,
and each of those five years,

1064
01:09:26,945 --> 01:09:29,730
she comes with...in with
the same problems.

1065
01:09:29,817 --> 01:09:32,559
Now, it would be my guess
that she's not taking

1066
01:09:32,646 --> 01:09:36,041
her medication properly,
and her family history

1067
01:09:36,128 --> 01:09:38,609
dictates her medical issues.

1068
01:09:38,696 --> 01:09:42,787
- She's been coming in here
regularly for five years

1069
01:09:42,874 --> 01:09:44,789
with the same problems?

1070
01:09:44,876 --> 01:09:48,880
- Yes, she has. Now look,
we're doctors,

1071
01:09:48,967 --> 01:09:50,447
we’re not babysitters.

1072
01:09:50,534 --> 01:09:52,057
And what they do
when they leave here

1073
01:09:52,144 --> 01:09:54,668
is of their own, free will,

1074
01:09:54,755 --> 01:09:59,282
our job is to provide treatment
and the medication needed

1075
01:09:59,369 --> 01:10:03,024
to help relieve and hopefully
ease or get rid of the symptoms

1076
01:10:03,111 --> 01:10:05,505
that they come in to begin with.

1077
01:10:05,592 --> 01:10:08,682
- I'm sorry, ah...I didn't need
to step in any toes,

1078
01:10:08,769 --> 01:10:13,383
I'm just interested to learn
and help people.

1079
01:10:13,470 --> 01:10:15,515
- No harm done.

1080
01:10:15,602 --> 01:10:18,562
But you need to realize
that this is a job too,

1081
01:10:18,649 --> 01:10:20,303
and if you carry the whole thing

1082
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:22,305
on your shoulders...
- Yes, doctor.

1083
01:10:22,392 --> 01:10:24,002
- ...it's just gonna be
way too much.

1084
01:10:24,089 --> 01:10:25,221
- Okay.

1085
01:10:26,787 --> 01:10:27,832
Hello, Mr. Leonard,

1086
01:10:27,919 --> 01:10:29,268
what brings you in today?

1087
01:10:36,101 --> 01:10:39,147
- Oh, my dear, your advice
made such a difference.

1088
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:40,540
I've seen so many doctors
but none of them

1089
01:10:40,627 --> 01:10:42,194
has helped me as much as you.

1090
01:10:42,281 --> 01:10:45,110
- Well, keep doing
what we talked about,

1091
01:10:45,197 --> 01:10:49,114
and keep me up to date
on all your progress.

1092
01:10:49,201 --> 01:10:50,724
- Thank you.
- Yes.

1093
01:10:50,811 --> 01:10:53,249
So how's your family doing?
- Doing wonderful.

1094
01:10:57,122 --> 01:10:59,994
- She is this way with all
of the patients she sees.

1095
01:11:00,081 --> 01:11:02,040
Dr. Michele has been here
for six months

1096
01:11:02,127 --> 01:11:04,390
and she should be seeing
at least 12 to 15 patients

1097
01:11:04,477 --> 01:11:07,306
a day, and she is lucky
if she even gets ten in.

1098
01:11:07,393 --> 01:11:09,308
- Hmm.

1099
01:11:09,395 --> 01:11:11,092
I guess I have to have
a talk with her.

1100
01:11:13,051 --> 01:11:14,618
- I think so.

1101
01:11:17,708 --> 01:11:20,624
- Dr. Neil. Walk with me?

1102
01:11:20,711 --> 01:11:22,365
- Yes, sir,
but I've got appointments.

1103
01:11:22,452 --> 01:11:25,281
- They'll wait,
let's take some time.

1104
01:11:25,368 --> 01:11:27,718
So, uh, how's it going for you?

1105
01:11:27,805 --> 01:11:29,197
You getting used to how
things go around here.

1106
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:30,895
- I think so, yes.

1107
01:11:30,982 --> 01:11:33,724
I'm still trying to work up
to 20 patients a day.

1108
01:11:33,811 --> 01:11:37,858
But...I don't know how that's
really possible

1109
01:11:37,945 --> 01:11:41,340
and truly find out what's
wrong with each one of them.

1110
01:11:41,427 --> 01:11:44,778
- Well, experience will make
you quicker with your diagnosis,

1111
01:11:44,865 --> 01:11:47,694
but, uh, I think by now you
should start to see

1112
01:11:47,781 --> 01:11:49,130
that you don't have to listen
to everything

1113
01:11:49,217 --> 01:11:51,219
that each of them says.

1114
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:53,613
- Well, take Jane, for example.

1115
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:56,050
She came in a few months ago
showing some signs

1116
01:11:56,137 --> 01:11:57,878
of an onset of arthritis.

1117
01:11:57,965 --> 01:12:00,620
- Okay, so you prescribed
a corticosteroid, right?

1118
01:12:00,707 --> 01:12:03,449
- No, I talked to her a little
bit more about

1119
01:12:03,536 --> 01:12:06,278
her family history.
- Oh, good idea.

1120
01:12:06,365 --> 01:12:08,019
And I'm guessing you found
a history

1121
01:12:08,106 --> 01:12:10,413
of rheumatoid arthritis?
- There were some.

1122
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:12,676
- So you considered
more advanced treatments,

1123
01:12:12,763 --> 01:12:15,113
maybe a test or two?

1124
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,463
- No, I asked about her diet

1125
01:12:17,550 --> 01:12:20,205
and her exercise
routine, if any.

1126
01:12:20,292 --> 01:12:23,339
- See, that's why your patient
count is so low, you see,

1127
01:12:23,426 --> 01:12:27,778
now this, uh...Jane woman,
she gave you a symptom.

1128
01:12:27,865 --> 01:12:29,432
You treat that symptom.

1129
01:12:29,519 --> 01:12:31,521
Then if she comes back in
because that treatment

1130
01:12:31,608 --> 01:12:35,699
didn't work, we have a test,
and you find further treatments.

1131
01:12:35,786 --> 01:12:38,441
- But she's doing so much
better just by doing

1132
01:12:38,528 --> 01:12:40,268
little things different.

1133
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:43,837
Michele, I run this
clinic,

1134
01:12:43,924 --> 01:12:46,187
and I have for a very long time.

1135
01:12:46,274 --> 01:12:49,277
So I suggest you fall
into line.

1136
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:52,019
- Yes, but...
- no, no, no buts.

1137
01:12:52,106 --> 01:12:55,153
When you're here at the clinic,
you get your patients' symptoms,

1138
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:57,982
you offer the proper treatment
and prescriptions

1139
01:12:58,069 --> 01:13:01,464
dictated by this clinic's
standards, and then you move on

1140
01:13:01,551 --> 01:13:04,380
to the next patients
as quickly and efficiently

1141
01:13:04,467 --> 01:13:08,166
as you can and that's it.
You hear what I'm saying?

1142
01:13:08,253 --> 01:13:10,734
- Yes, I do.

1143
01:13:10,821 --> 01:13:12,475
- You can make your huggy
feel-good friends

1144
01:13:12,562 --> 01:13:14,694
on your own time,
but when you're here,

1145
01:13:14,781 --> 01:13:18,785
you're on the clinic's time,
and all these patients'.

1146
01:13:18,872 --> 01:13:22,876
- I got it, sir, I hear you.
Crystal clear.

1147
01:13:25,183 --> 01:13:26,314
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1148
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:29,840
- Hey!
- Hi!

1149
01:13:29,927 --> 01:13:32,538
- I thought they'd send
some other quack in here.

1150
01:13:32,625 --> 01:13:35,106
- So, I'm so sorry to hear
about Liz.

1151
01:13:35,193 --> 01:13:37,978
- Yeah, she was definitely
the spark

1152
01:13:38,065 --> 01:13:39,937
that kept my flame burning.

1153
01:13:41,765 --> 01:13:44,724
I miss her so much,
but I don't miss

1154
01:13:44,811 --> 01:13:47,379
that list of chores she had
me do each and every week.

1155
01:13:47,466 --> 01:13:50,991
So,
what brings you in today?

1156
01:13:51,078 --> 01:13:54,604
- Well, I'd say, I've got...

1157
01:13:54,691 --> 01:13:56,997
Where,
I'm tired all the time.

1158
01:13:58,259 --> 01:14:01,437
And I have a dickens of time
getting much sleep at all.

1159
01:14:01,524 --> 01:14:05,136
And then it's just,
I have pains all over.

1160
01:14:05,223 --> 01:14:08,008
- Hmm, I tell you what,
I'm gonna go ahead

1161
01:14:08,095 --> 01:14:11,229
and write you a prescription,
but...What are you doing

1162
01:14:11,316 --> 01:14:13,013
for dinner tonight?

1163
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:17,757
- Well, my usual chicken
dishes and a few sides.

1164
01:14:17,844 --> 01:14:20,064
- You think you got enough
for two?

1165
01:14:20,151 --> 01:14:22,283
- I'm not promising
anything fancy,

1166
01:14:22,370 --> 01:14:24,547
but I'm pretty sure I could
whip up a little something

1167
01:14:24,634 --> 01:14:26,940
to feed the likes of you.
- Good, then, it's a date.

1168
01:14:27,027 --> 01:14:28,507
I'll be around at 6:30.

1169
01:14:38,909 --> 01:14:40,606
- That's up in Branson.

1170
01:14:40,693 --> 01:14:42,869
Liz loved Branson.

1171
01:14:42,956 --> 01:14:46,612
I can't tell you how many
times we'd go to those shows

1172
01:14:46,699 --> 01:14:51,095
year after year, but she still
loved them all just the same.

1173
01:14:51,182 --> 01:14:53,401
- She told me.

1174
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:55,621
She was pretty sure
you had a crush

1175
01:14:55,708 --> 01:14:58,842
on that cute actress.

1176
01:14:58,929 --> 01:15:03,020
- She was no Liz,
but she could put on a show.

1177
01:15:03,107 --> 01:15:08,242
Hope you like your fried chicken
a little medium brown.

1178
01:15:18,818 --> 01:15:21,429
- Have you always fried
your foods?

1179
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:25,129
Well, to be honest,
Liz did most of the cooking.

1180
01:15:25,216 --> 01:15:28,088
- Do you mind if I look
in your cupboard?

1181
01:15:28,175 --> 01:15:29,437
- Help yourself?
- Okay.

1182
01:15:35,356 --> 01:15:37,924
Okay, let's see
what we have here.

1183
01:15:43,974 --> 01:15:45,018
- Okay.

1184
01:15:50,154 --> 01:15:51,764
- Oh, wow.

1185
01:16:05,082 --> 01:16:09,042
- Now these make
a good go-to snack.

1186
01:16:09,129 --> 01:16:11,349
The rest of this stuff?
Mm-mm.

1187
01:16:11,436 --> 01:16:13,786
- Hmm.
- Let me ask you a question.

1188
01:16:13,873 --> 01:16:17,094
So if you had to choose,
eat differently

1189
01:16:17,181 --> 01:16:20,271
or spend the rest of your life
taking one pill or another,

1190
01:16:20,358 --> 01:16:23,448
what would you choose?

1191
01:16:23,535 --> 01:16:26,451
- I guess I'd choose
eat differently.

1192
01:16:26,538 --> 01:16:31,325
- Good, then there's no better
time than now to get started.

1193
01:16:31,412 --> 01:16:33,458
- Right...right now?
- Yes, right now!

1194
01:16:33,545 --> 01:16:35,721
Let's go to the grocery store
now!

1195
01:16:35,808 --> 01:16:38,506
- What...I just stocked up
on groceries yesterday.

1196
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:40,813
- Don't worry, it'll be
my treat this time.

1197
01:17:29,514 --> 01:17:31,734
It's definitely
like that,

1198
01:17:31,821 --> 01:17:35,041
you know, it's just...
- That's right.

1199
01:17:35,128 --> 01:17:37,217
- If I eat right.
- Mm-hmm.

1200
01:17:37,304 --> 01:17:40,090
- Take those vitamins...
- Yes.

1201
01:17:40,177 --> 01:17:41,352
- Keep going after that.

1202
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:47,097
- I have no idea
what's going on.

1203
01:17:47,184 --> 01:17:48,968
- She does have the daily
patient count up

1204
01:17:49,055 --> 01:17:52,145
to where it should be by now,
but...You know,

1205
01:17:52,232 --> 01:17:54,974
a lot of her former
massage clients are stopping by,

1206
01:17:55,061 --> 01:17:57,368
maybe that's what this is?
- Yeah, but...

1207
01:17:57,455 --> 01:17:58,935
I think there's something else
going on.

1208
01:17:59,022 --> 01:18:00,893
- I agree.

1209
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:03,243
- I'll see what I can do
to find out.

1210
01:18:03,330 --> 01:18:05,419
- Okay, I appreciate that.

1211
01:18:17,431 --> 01:18:18,824
- Hi.
- Hi!

1212
01:18:18,911 --> 01:18:22,915
- Michele, how are you? Come in.
- Good!

1213
01:18:23,002 --> 01:18:25,004
- It's nice to get together and
not just bump into each other

1214
01:18:25,091 --> 01:18:26,876
between patients.

1215
01:18:26,963 --> 01:18:29,313
- Oh, yeah.
I know what you mean,

1216
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:31,010
sometimes I feel like
I'm running laps

1217
01:18:31,097 --> 01:18:32,882
all over that place.

1218
01:18:32,969 --> 01:18:35,841
It can definitely
feel that way, for sure.

1219
01:18:35,928 --> 01:18:37,887
But you know, there are a lot
of people who are impressed

1220
01:18:37,974 --> 01:18:40,498
by the way you've been able
to get your patient count up

1221
01:18:40,585 --> 01:18:43,022
and start to fall along
with the program.

1222
01:18:43,109 --> 01:18:46,112
- Yeah? Well, when I was
a massage therapist,

1223
01:18:46,199 --> 01:18:48,462
I would spend anywhere
from 30 minutes

1224
01:18:48,549 --> 01:18:51,291
to an hour and a half
with each patient...thank you.

1225
01:18:51,378 --> 01:18:54,425
- I bet you're glad you don't
have to do that anymore.

1226
01:18:54,512 --> 01:18:57,428
I can't imagine spending that
much time with Mrs. Sanders.

1227
01:18:57,515 --> 01:19:00,039
After about ten minutes,

1228
01:19:00,126 --> 01:19:01,998
that woman would talk
my ear off,

1229
01:19:02,085 --> 01:19:04,217
and I would probably wanna find
a way to sedate her

1230
01:19:04,304 --> 01:19:06,654
in one way or another.

1231
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:11,137
Yeah, you would think so,
but when I asked

1232
01:19:11,224 --> 01:19:16,142
all the right questions
of my massage clients,

1233
01:19:16,229 --> 01:19:19,363
they and their bodies
would tell me exactly

1234
01:19:19,450 --> 01:19:23,802
what they needed most
and how best to help them.

1235
01:19:23,889 --> 01:19:27,153
- So...you didn't give
just the same massage

1236
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:29,460
to each one of your clients?

1237
01:19:29,547 --> 01:19:32,419
My masseuse just asks me how
many minutes do I want it for

1238
01:19:32,506 --> 01:19:36,249
and if I want a deep tissue
or a Swedish massage.

1239
01:19:36,336 --> 01:19:41,080
- That's the thing,
your masseuse should ask

1240
01:19:41,167 --> 01:19:44,692
what's going on in your life.

1241
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:47,739
Have you changed
your exercise routine?

1242
01:19:47,826 --> 01:19:51,177
Or did you finish training
for a big run?

1243
01:19:51,264 --> 01:19:54,006
Or has life just got you
stressed out a bit?

1244
01:19:54,093 --> 01:19:56,226
And you're in for a good
massage.

1245
01:19:58,881 --> 01:20:01,753
- The stressing,
that's why I usually go in.

1246
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:04,495
Definitely the stress.

1247
01:20:04,582 --> 01:20:09,195
- A lot of people do,
but what's causing the stress?

1248
01:20:09,282 --> 01:20:15,158
Is it work? Stuff at home?
Or whatever it is.

1249
01:20:15,245 --> 01:20:19,075
Knowing this has always helped
me find the pressure points

1250
01:20:19,162 --> 01:20:22,469
I need to focus on
with each of my clients.

1251
01:20:22,556 --> 01:20:26,125
- In theory, what you're saying
does make sense.

1252
01:20:26,212 --> 01:20:30,173
But in practice, I just don't
see how it's ever gonna work.

1253
01:20:30,260 --> 01:20:34,612
- But it is working.
For over a year now,

1254
01:20:34,699 --> 01:20:37,484
I have been consulting with
my patients more

1255
01:20:37,571 --> 01:20:41,880
than a typical visit,
many on my own time,

1256
01:20:41,967 --> 01:20:45,144
to help guide them
to becoming well.

1257
01:20:47,451 --> 01:20:49,235
- Does Dr. Daniels know
you're doing this?

1258
01:20:50,671 --> 01:20:54,197
- No. But the results
are amazing.

1259
01:20:54,284 --> 01:20:58,766
85% of those that I have
worked with show significant

1260
01:20:58,854 --> 01:21:02,814
signs of improvement,
faster and more significant

1261
01:21:02,901 --> 01:21:04,860
than traditional methods.

1262
01:21:06,992 --> 01:21:10,213
- And the other 15%?
- They flip-flop.

1263
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:12,650
They fall off the wagon
when it comes to their diet

1264
01:21:12,737 --> 01:21:14,043
or exercise.

1265
01:21:16,262 --> 01:21:18,830
- You're a brave woman, Michele.

1266
01:21:18,917 --> 01:21:21,833
As I feel pretty strongly
that if Dr. Daniels knew

1267
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,791
what you were doing,
he wouldn't like it,

1268
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:25,837
not one little bit.

1269
01:21:25,924 --> 01:21:28,666
- But it was his idea!

1270
01:21:28,753 --> 01:21:33,323
- Sorry, but I find that
very hard to believe.

1271
01:21:33,410 --> 01:21:38,023
- He told me to practice
like all the other doctors

1272
01:21:38,110 --> 01:21:41,461
are expected to in the clinic.

1273
01:21:41,548 --> 01:21:47,032
But he didn't care how I spent
my own time.

1274
01:21:47,119 --> 01:21:49,426
- I don't think he's gonna
see it that way.

1275
01:21:49,513 --> 01:21:53,473
And besides, I am positive
that he didn't mean for you

1276
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:56,041
to go to your patients' homes
and cook them dinner.

1277
01:21:58,957 --> 01:22:03,570
Oh. Darn. This is the hospital,
and, uh,

1278
01:22:03,657 --> 01:22:06,051
I'm gonna have to cut
our visit a little bit short.

1279
01:22:07,792 --> 01:22:11,100
Look, all I'm saying is,
if you enjoy being a doctor

1280
01:22:11,187 --> 01:22:14,407
so much, you better talk
to Dr. Daniels right away

1281
01:22:14,494 --> 01:22:16,453
and get this all straightened
out.

1282
01:22:20,674 --> 01:22:22,720
Right now, though, I gotta go.

1283
01:22:31,381 --> 01:22:34,036
- Oh, Michele,
see you in my office, please.

1284
01:22:34,123 --> 01:22:35,124
- Yes, sir.

1285
01:22:43,219 --> 01:22:46,657
- Uh, Michele, you've, uh,
been practicing here

1286
01:22:46,744 --> 01:22:48,354
at the clinic for a little
bit over a year?

1287
01:22:48,441 --> 01:22:50,748
- Yes, 17 months.

1288
01:22:50,835 --> 01:22:52,706
- And in that time you feel
you've gotten a pretty good

1289
01:22:52,793 --> 01:22:56,101
grasp on how we operate here
at the clinic?

1290
01:22:56,188 --> 01:22:59,539
- I think so, uh, yes.

1291
01:22:59,626 --> 01:23:01,324
- And it's true, you have, uh,

1292
01:23:01,411 --> 01:23:03,543
gotten your daily patient count
up,

1293
01:23:03,630 --> 01:23:06,938
but your return-visit patient
ratio is much lower

1294
01:23:07,025 --> 01:23:10,507
than the rest of the staff,
now one might think

1295
01:23:10,594 --> 01:23:13,423
that that's because your
patients weren't happy

1296
01:23:13,510 --> 01:23:15,729
with the treatment and
were going elsewhere

1297
01:23:15,816 --> 01:23:17,731
to seek medical attention.

1298
01:23:17,818 --> 01:23:21,648
- What?
No, that's not it at all.

1299
01:23:21,735 --> 01:23:23,476
- No? Well, what do you think
it is, Michele?

1300
01:23:23,563 --> 01:23:26,523
I mean, do you imagine yourself
to be ,

1301
01:23:26,610 --> 01:23:29,265
miraculously curing all
your patients to the point

1302
01:23:29,352 --> 01:23:31,658
they no longer need
medical treatment?

1303
01:23:31,745 --> 01:23:35,445
- No, but I've been spending
some of my own personal time

1304
01:23:35,532 --> 01:23:37,882
reaching out to my clients
in order to figure out

1305
01:23:37,969 --> 01:23:40,276
what's wrong with them
and what got them sick

1306
01:23:40,363 --> 01:23:41,538
in the first place.

1307
01:23:43,583 --> 01:23:46,195
- You...what?

1308
01:23:46,282 --> 01:23:49,502
- I've been learning a lot
more about my patients

1309
01:23:49,589 --> 01:23:52,157
outside of this clinic
than I have been able to learn

1310
01:23:52,244 --> 01:23:54,507
while they are here.

1311
01:23:54,594 --> 01:23:57,162
- Patients come to this clinic
for our expertise,

1312
01:23:57,249 --> 01:23:59,947
and our ability to quickly
diagnose their symptoms,

1313
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:02,080
not to become our friends
and certainly not to become

1314
01:24:02,167 --> 01:24:04,126
part of your own clinic
project.

1315
01:24:04,213 --> 01:24:06,954
- But they are our clients
and we have a moral

1316
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:12,221
and ethical code that dictates,
that demands

1317
01:24:12,308 --> 01:24:15,659
we find out what made our
patients sick to begin with.

1318
01:24:15,746 --> 01:24:17,835
- They also all work for
this clinic,

1319
01:24:17,922 --> 01:24:21,317
a professional environment
with processes and procedures

1320
01:24:21,404 --> 01:24:23,797
in place set by doctors
with far more experience

1321
01:24:23,884 --> 01:24:26,061
and clinical expertise
than you.

1322
01:24:26,148 --> 01:24:28,106
It's the same policies
and procedures you'll find

1323
01:24:28,193 --> 01:24:30,413
in clinics across America.

1324
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:32,763
- But I could show you results.

1325
01:24:32,850 --> 01:24:36,810
The difference in results,
practices all over are using

1326
01:24:36,897 --> 01:24:41,380
a more functional medical
way of thinking.

1327
01:24:41,467 --> 01:24:43,208
- I don't wanna see that,
nor does this clinic have

1328
01:24:43,295 --> 01:24:47,082
any interest in your...
Voodoo medicine.

1329
01:24:47,169 --> 01:24:50,607
My god, what were you thinking?
- I...I just wanna help people

1330
01:24:50,694 --> 01:24:54,176
be and think healthier.

1331
01:24:54,263 --> 01:24:56,352
- It's a shame, really,
since you showed...

1332
01:24:56,439 --> 01:24:59,442
So much promise.

1333
01:24:59,529 --> 01:25:01,096
With an attitude like that,
you're not gonna find

1334
01:25:01,183 --> 01:25:03,663
any clinic to take you.

1335
01:25:05,448 --> 01:25:08,233
And I have no choice but
to relieve you of your contract.

1336
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:09,582
You're done here.

1337
01:25:14,021 --> 01:25:16,937
What am I gonna do?

1338
01:25:18,548 --> 01:25:22,073
Maybe Dr. Daniels is right.

1339
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:26,556
I'm not fit to practice
anywhere.

1340
01:25:26,643 --> 01:25:30,560
God, why won't you give me
an answer?!

1341
01:25:30,647 --> 01:25:32,779
How am I supposed
to believe in you,

1342
01:25:32,866 --> 01:25:35,086
if you can't seem
to believe in me?!

1343
01:25:35,173 --> 01:25:38,742
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You don't want this anymore,

1344
01:25:38,829 --> 01:25:40,874
it'll look good on my place,
a little bit of white-out

1345
01:25:40,961 --> 01:25:43,225
and I can change the name.

1346
01:25:43,312 --> 01:25:45,618
No.

1347
01:25:45,705 --> 01:25:47,533
- Girl, what's going on?

1348
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:54,714
- You're acting like
you lost your best friend,

1349
01:25:54,801 --> 01:25:58,065
but I know you didn't,
'cause I'm right here.

1350
01:25:58,153 --> 01:26:00,677
- I lost my job.

1351
01:26:00,764 --> 01:26:04,463
Dr. Daniels fired me and said
that I'm a voodoo doctor.

1352
01:26:09,033 --> 01:26:11,905
Girl, come on.

1353
01:26:11,992 --> 01:26:14,821
You hated that place.

1354
01:26:14,908 --> 01:26:18,912
I just can't seem
to get anything to go my way.

1355
01:26:18,999 --> 01:26:21,872
I failed at
the Olympics,

1356
01:26:21,959 --> 01:26:25,005
now I'm failing as a doctor.

1357
01:26:25,092 --> 01:26:28,400
What am I suppose to do?

1358
01:26:28,487 --> 01:26:31,708
- This piece of paper still
says you're a doctor, right?

1359
01:26:31,795 --> 01:26:34,841
- Technically, yes,
I still have the license

1360
01:26:34,928 --> 01:26:38,149
to practice medicine.

1361
01:26:38,236 --> 01:26:40,064
- Then do it.

1362
01:26:40,151 --> 01:26:42,632
There has to be a clinic
in the area

1363
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:46,375
that will recognize the genius
of a doctor that is you.

1364
01:26:46,462 --> 01:26:49,726
- Not according to Dr. Daniels.

1365
01:26:49,813 --> 01:26:52,859
He said no one would take me,
and if I can't practice

1366
01:26:52,946 --> 01:26:56,167
at his clinic, what makes me
think I could practice

1367
01:26:56,254 --> 01:26:59,997
anywhere else?
- You're gonna believe all that?

1368
01:27:00,084 --> 01:27:03,696
Not today, sister.
Not on my watch.

1369
01:27:03,783 --> 01:27:05,045
You know what we need?

1370
01:27:08,788 --> 01:27:10,834
- No, what are you looking for?

1371
01:27:10,921 --> 01:27:14,707
- Something to write on.

1372
01:27:14,794 --> 01:27:18,102
- What on earth for?

1373
01:27:18,189 --> 01:27:21,758
I'm a little bummed out here.

1374
01:27:21,845 --> 01:27:27,372
- All the more reason why
we need to make...A list.

1375
01:27:30,375 --> 01:27:32,551
Alright, so.

1376
01:27:32,638 --> 01:27:37,426
If you could find the perfect
place to work as a doctor,

1377
01:27:37,513 --> 01:27:40,559
what would it be like?

1378
01:27:40,646 --> 01:27:44,824
- First, there wouldn't be
any Dr. Meanie-pants.

1379
01:27:44,911 --> 01:27:48,088
That's a given.

1380
01:27:48,175 --> 01:27:52,571
- I wanna work in a clinic
that puts patients first.

1381
01:27:52,658 --> 01:27:55,879
Even above making money.

1382
01:27:55,966 --> 01:27:58,142
- Okay, that's a good start.

1383
01:27:59,796 --> 01:28:02,799
- And we wouldn't just prescribe
medicine,

1384
01:28:02,886 --> 01:28:07,282
we'll prescribe...
Prescribe life.

1385
01:28:07,369 --> 01:28:11,764
- "Prescribe...life." explain.

1386
01:28:11,851 --> 01:28:16,508
- Yes, we would get to know
more about our patients,

1387
01:28:16,595 --> 01:28:20,991
things, of course, such as
medical past,

1388
01:28:21,078 --> 01:28:23,428
family history,

1389
01:28:23,515 --> 01:28:27,911
vitals and such, but also,
their life.

1390
01:28:27,998 --> 01:28:30,783
What they eat, how do they
sleep,

1391
01:28:30,870 --> 01:28:34,047
exercise, relax,

1392
01:28:34,134 --> 01:28:37,268
all of those things that
make a complete person.

1393
01:28:37,355 --> 01:28:41,533
We won't just have a regular
office visit,

1394
01:28:41,620 --> 01:28:45,102
we'll have get-together,
study groups,

1395
01:28:45,189 --> 01:28:50,020
bring families together,
make being healthy

1396
01:28:50,107 --> 01:28:53,545
fun as it is important.

1397
01:28:53,632 --> 01:28:57,854
A place like that just
doesn't exist.

1398
01:28:57,941 --> 01:29:00,552
- Wait a minute.
What was I thinking?!

1399
01:29:03,381 --> 01:29:06,863
- What? You know somebody
that has a clinic like this?

1400
01:29:06,950 --> 01:29:08,908
- I sure do!
- Is it somebody

1401
01:29:08,995 --> 01:29:13,391
you work out with?
- As a matter of fact, I do!

1402
01:29:13,478 --> 01:29:17,134
This list. This list
is your clinic!

1403
01:29:17,221 --> 01:29:20,311
- What do you mean
by my clinic?

1404
01:29:20,398 --> 01:29:23,140
- Just like it sounds!

1405
01:29:23,227 --> 01:29:28,058
You find a place, rent space,
and start your own clinic.

1406
01:29:28,145 --> 01:29:32,454
- I don't know the first thing
about having my own clinic.

1407
01:29:32,541 --> 01:29:36,458
- Sure you do.
It's all right here on the list.

1408
01:29:36,545 --> 01:29:39,548
Together, we'll pray on the list
and you'll see.

1409
01:29:39,635 --> 01:29:42,159
It makes perfect sense.

1410
01:29:42,246 --> 01:29:45,075
At the other place
with Dr. Doom and gloom,

1411
01:29:45,162 --> 01:29:47,469
many of your patients came
from when you were

1412
01:29:47,556 --> 01:29:51,951
being a masseuse, right?
- Yes, and?

1413
01:29:52,038 --> 01:29:53,475
- And when they find out
that you're not

1414
01:29:53,562 --> 01:29:55,738
at yesterday's news,
they're all gonna be out

1415
01:29:55,825 --> 01:29:59,176
looking for you,
unless you decide

1416
01:29:59,263 --> 01:30:01,526
to make it easy for them
and let them know

1417
01:30:01,613 --> 01:30:05,661
that you're at the all-new
Michele functional medical

1418
01:30:05,748 --> 01:30:08,185
and good times clinic.

1419
01:30:08,272 --> 01:30:11,144
- We may need to work more
on the name later.

1420
01:30:11,231 --> 01:30:12,755
- Well, now that we're
in a groove

1421
01:30:12,842 --> 01:30:14,887
and making all your dreams
come true,

1422
01:30:14,974 --> 01:30:17,107
shouldn't we start on the list
for that man, too?

1423
01:30:17,194 --> 01:30:19,979
- Oh, please,
one miracle at a time.

1424
01:30:25,768 --> 01:30:28,684
We have to pray on the list,

1425
01:30:28,771 --> 01:30:32,514
so that in all of god's glory,
each item on the list

1426
01:30:32,601 --> 01:30:35,995
will come to a fruitful
and gratifying beginning.

1427
01:30:36,082 --> 01:30:38,389
Let's pray.

1428
01:30:38,476 --> 01:30:40,652
God, I thank you for Michele's
heart, I thank you

1429
01:30:40,739 --> 01:30:43,220
for her desire to prescribe
life,

1430
01:30:43,307 --> 01:30:45,396
and not to just
give people pills,

1431
01:30:45,483 --> 01:30:47,485
I thank you that she really
wants to hear their heart...

1432
01:30:47,572 --> 01:30:50,096
- and cut to the wedding
and they all lived

1433
01:30:50,183 --> 01:30:54,318
happily ever after.

1434
01:30:54,405 --> 01:30:55,928
- How did you get invited
here anyway?

1435
01:30:56,015 --> 01:30:59,497
- I am the best man.
- Well, he was the only guy

1436
01:30:59,584 --> 01:31:01,151
who fit in the free suit
that was offered

1437
01:31:01,238 --> 01:31:02,631
- in the wedding package.
- All:

1438
01:31:02,718 --> 01:31:04,633
- That's right.

1439
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:06,330
- So I'm guessing that's when
the functional medical institute

1440
01:31:06,417 --> 01:31:08,506
just took off like gangbusters.

1441
01:31:08,593 --> 01:31:11,291
- Yeah, and tell US the story
about how you guys met.

1442
01:31:11,378 --> 01:31:12,989
- The functional medical
institute

1443
01:31:13,076 --> 01:31:17,602
did start off pretty good,
but it started off so good

1444
01:31:17,689 --> 01:31:19,386
that it began to take
its toll on Michele

1445
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:21,432
and all she could handle
on her own.

1446
01:31:21,519 --> 01:31:23,826
- And that's when you came in
as her knight in shining armor

1447
01:31:23,913 --> 01:31:25,480
to save the day.

1448
01:31:25,567 --> 01:31:29,266
- Michele's not one
to have anyone save the day,

1449
01:31:29,353 --> 01:31:33,618
but actually, it was you
who did the day-saving,

1450
01:31:33,705 --> 01:31:35,751
by putting another list
into play.

1451
01:32:01,907 --> 01:32:05,998
- Really? That's how you choose
to remind me?

1452
01:32:06,085 --> 01:32:11,134
Stuff all over the floor?
Just more for me to have to do?

1453
01:32:12,657 --> 01:32:16,835
More mess to pick up
all on my own?

1454
01:32:16,922 --> 01:32:19,403
I can't!

1455
01:32:19,490 --> 01:32:23,929
I can't do this
by myself alone!

1456
01:32:24,016 --> 01:32:25,409
Honestly.

1457
01:32:26,758 --> 01:32:30,240
Why can't I find love?

1458
01:32:30,327 --> 01:32:34,026
Am I not worthy of love
in my life?

1459
01:32:36,768 --> 01:32:40,076
I've endured sacrifice.

1460
01:32:40,163 --> 01:32:43,427
I've experienced pain.

1461
01:32:43,514 --> 01:32:46,386
I've done all I can do
for others.

1462
01:32:48,214 --> 01:32:53,002
Yet, my heart still feels
such an emptiness.

1463
01:32:54,656 --> 01:33:00,009
Lord, if alone is all
you have left for me,

1464
01:33:00,096 --> 01:33:05,318
then you might as well
just take me home now!

1465
01:33:17,374 --> 01:33:19,942
- I believe I saved your mango.

1466
01:33:20,029 --> 01:33:23,772
- How long have you been Stan...
slumped over my doorstep?

1467
01:33:23,859 --> 01:33:25,687
- Oh, long enough to know
that we probably

1468
01:33:25,774 --> 01:33:29,342
need to make a new list.
- Thank you.

1469
01:33:29,429 --> 01:33:31,910
Every time I turn a corner,
you're right there,

1470
01:33:31,997 --> 01:33:33,956
picking up one mess or another.

1471
01:33:35,392 --> 01:33:37,655
As they say,
that's what friends are for.

1472
01:33:37,742 --> 01:33:40,223
Besides, you'd do the same
for me.

1473
01:33:41,877 --> 01:33:43,835
Okay. So.

1474
01:33:45,576 --> 01:33:49,232
What's Michele's perfect
partner like?

1475
01:33:49,319 --> 01:33:52,801
- Well, it would be great
if he believed and worked

1476
01:33:52,888 --> 01:33:58,328
in functional medicine too,
so I can get some help.

1477
01:33:58,415 --> 01:34:00,896
The clinic's been growing
really quick.

1478
01:34:00,983 --> 01:34:03,855
- Alright. I got it.

1479
01:34:03,942 --> 01:34:06,249
Someone who's okay with you
bossing him around.

1480
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:09,382
- No! Of course not.

1481
01:34:09,469 --> 01:34:13,082
But I would like a partner,
where our personalities

1482
01:34:13,169 --> 01:34:15,998
and our abilities complement
each other.

1483
01:34:18,653 --> 01:34:22,047
And alright, just at least,
in the beginning,

1484
01:34:22,134 --> 01:34:25,964
- I'll be his boss.
- Good.

1485
01:34:26,051 --> 01:34:28,184
What else is on the wish list?

1486
01:34:28,271 --> 01:34:30,926
- I want him to be
a spiritual man,

1487
01:34:31,013 --> 01:34:35,321
not just a churchgoer,
but someone who practices

1488
01:34:35,408 --> 01:34:40,239
what he preaches by respecting
and doing right by others

1489
01:34:40,326 --> 01:34:42,241
that come in contact with him.

1490
01:34:42,328 --> 01:34:44,461
- Yeah, that's a good one.

1491
01:34:44,548 --> 01:34:49,335
- Oh and it would be really
nice if he was

1492
01:34:49,422 --> 01:34:52,512
extremely good looking.

1493
01:34:52,599 --> 01:34:55,646
- Okay, yes, I got it down,
he's gotta be a real hunk.

1494
01:34:58,736 --> 01:35:03,480
- That's all nice,
but I'll trade any of that

1495
01:35:03,567 --> 01:35:08,485
for a guy who would treat me
really good.

1496
01:35:08,572 --> 01:35:11,662
I've never had anyone
in a relationship treat me

1497
01:35:11,749 --> 01:35:15,231
gentle, loving and kind.

1498
01:35:15,318 --> 01:35:17,276
Like a beautiful queen.

1499
01:35:19,888 --> 01:35:21,628
- I'm sorry.

1500
01:35:21,716 --> 01:35:23,413
You've always handled life
so well,

1501
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:27,765
I never imagined that you'd
never experienced true love.

1502
01:35:27,852 --> 01:35:29,636
I always thought
you were single by choice.

1503
01:35:29,724 --> 01:35:31,900
- Nope, by fear.

1504
01:35:31,987 --> 01:35:35,338
Fear of being damaged
beyond recovery.

1505
01:35:35,425 --> 01:35:39,908
I finally reached this stage
in my life where I'm ready

1506
01:35:39,995 --> 01:35:43,955
to let go of all the bitterness
and resentment of my past.

1507
01:35:46,305 --> 01:35:48,481
- Now let's get to praying
for this man of yours.

1508
01:35:48,568 --> 01:35:50,440
All you have to do is believe
in god's guidance

1509
01:35:50,527 --> 01:35:52,834
and this, too,
will come true.

1510
01:35:52,921 --> 01:35:54,487
It works every time.

1511
01:35:57,403 --> 01:36:00,058
Dear god, we pray for every
item on this list,

1512
01:36:00,145 --> 01:36:03,192
we pray for a man that will be
gentle and loving and caring,

1513
01:36:03,279 --> 01:36:05,977
who will love functional
medicine and be a real hunk.

1514
01:36:06,064 --> 01:36:07,762
I ask that you would bring him

1515
01:36:07,849 --> 01:36:10,503
swiftly across her path...

1516
01:36:10,590 --> 01:36:12,244
I appreciate
all of you coming out

1517
01:36:12,331 --> 01:36:15,030
to the gut dysfunction
seminar.

1518
01:36:15,117 --> 01:36:19,208
Remember, we are all
in this wellness life together.

1519
01:36:23,342 --> 01:36:26,737
- If you need anything at all,
please don't hesitate to call.

1520
01:36:26,824 --> 01:36:27,956
Thank you.

1521
01:36:30,045 --> 01:36:31,307
Incredible.

1522
01:36:31,394 --> 01:36:32,699
And Michele is pretty
awesome.

1523
01:36:32,787 --> 01:36:35,006
- She is, absolutely.

1524
01:36:35,093 --> 01:36:39,489
She's awesome, seriously, wow.
Amazing.

1525
01:36:43,493 --> 01:36:45,756
- I can't thank you enough,
Michele, working with you

1526
01:36:45,843 --> 01:36:48,324
has made such a big
difference in the way I feel.

1527
01:36:48,411 --> 01:36:50,892
- Well, the proof is
in the results,

1528
01:36:50,979 --> 01:36:53,851
and the results are looking
better every week.

1529
01:36:55,070 --> 01:36:56,462
- Thank you.
- Yes.

1530
01:36:56,549 --> 01:36:57,899
- Thank you.
- Bye.

1531
01:37:01,554 --> 01:37:05,036
- Hello, I'm Mark Sherwood.
- Hi, I'm Dr. Michele Neil.

1532
01:37:05,123 --> 01:37:07,169
I really enjoy
your presentations,

1533
01:37:07,256 --> 01:37:08,648
I was actually here
a couple of months ago

1534
01:37:08,735 --> 01:37:10,955
for your class on motion.

1535
01:37:11,042 --> 01:37:14,132
- Oh! Yeah.
I think I remember

1536
01:37:14,219 --> 01:37:18,310
seeing you there, then,
you were on the right,

1537
01:37:18,397 --> 01:37:21,009
- three rows back?
- Yeah.

1538
01:37:21,096 --> 01:37:26,014
- You had a girl with you.
A brunette, if my memory serves.

1539
01:37:26,101 --> 01:37:28,320
Your girlfriend?
- No, no, no.

1540
01:37:28,407 --> 01:37:31,019
Just an acquaintance.
- Oh, that's too bad.

1541
01:37:31,106 --> 01:37:33,412
She's really pretty.

1542
01:37:33,499 --> 01:37:37,242
I thought my movement class
is kind of an odd place

1543
01:37:37,329 --> 01:37:40,550
to bring your date,
unless you two thought

1544
01:37:40,637 --> 01:37:43,161
movement means something
completely different.

1545
01:37:43,248 --> 01:37:45,424
Actually, I was wondering

1546
01:37:45,511 --> 01:37:48,645
if you'd accept my invitation
to spend a little time together.

1547
01:37:48,732 --> 01:37:51,648
- You're not gonna ask me
to go to another doctor's

1548
01:37:51,735 --> 01:37:55,086
- conference, are you?
- No, of course not.

1549
01:37:55,173 --> 01:37:57,219
I was thinking more along
the lines of dinner,

1550
01:37:57,306 --> 01:37:59,134
so we could get the opportunity
to get to know each other

1551
01:37:59,221 --> 01:38:01,136
a little bit better?

1552
01:38:01,223 --> 01:38:05,357
- If I say yes,
can I have my hand back?

1553
01:38:05,444 --> 01:38:10,449
- Oh, I'm sorry, I...I...I just...

1554
01:38:10,536 --> 01:38:15,672
- Me, too, completely...
- Forgot!

1555
01:38:15,759 --> 01:38:18,457
- Dr. Neil.

1556
01:38:18,544 --> 01:38:21,286
- I better tend to the rest
of my patients, until Saturday?

1557
01:38:21,373 --> 01:38:22,809
- Until Saturday.

to Michael B’s.

1567
01:38:54,798 --> 01:38:56,495
- Hi, chef Michael,
nice to see you.

1568
01:38:56,582 --> 01:38:58,628
- Well,
I see you're here for a date.

1569
01:38:58,715 --> 01:39:01,065
- Yeah, I think this may be
"the" date.

1570
01:39:01,152 --> 01:39:02,675
Well, then
I bet you're here to see

1571
01:39:02,762 --> 01:39:04,764

on table 3.

01:39:13,599 --> 01:39:17,429
- Well, good evening.
- Good evening, aw, thank you.

1575
01:39:20,258 --> 01:39:23,522
- As I was walking in,
I saw how beautiful you looked,

1576
01:39:23,609 --> 01:39:26,047
and I felt as if I were
in the presence of royalty.

1577
01:39:26,134 --> 01:39:27,787
Would you mind

1578
01:39:27,874 --> 01:39:31,095
if I address you as
"my queen," your royal highness?

1579
01:39:31,182 --> 01:39:33,054
Okay.

1580
01:39:33,141 --> 01:39:35,012
- You look spectacular, Michele.
- Thank you.

1581
01:39:35,099 --> 01:39:37,406
- I'm so glad you agreed
to meet me here tonight.

1582
01:39:37,493 --> 01:39:38,798
- Of course.

1583
01:39:38,885 --> 01:39:40,713
- Hello.
- Hello.

1584
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:43,455
Could we get a couple of waters
to start with, please?

1585
01:39:43,542 --> 01:39:45,631
- I don't see why that
should be a problem

1586
01:39:45,718 --> 01:39:47,720
as soon as
the waitperson arrives.

1587
01:39:47,807 --> 01:39:48,852
Thanks.

1588
01:39:51,159 --> 01:39:54,336
- Allow me to introduce myself.
I'm Jesse.

1589
01:39:54,423 --> 01:39:57,948
One of Michele's most trusted
and dearest friends.

1590
01:39:58,035 --> 01:40:00,298
- That's right.
- And we thought

1591
01:40:00,385 --> 01:40:02,300
that if you turn out to be
the man that we've all

1592
01:40:02,387 --> 01:40:06,609
prayed for Michele to meet,
you wouldn't mind if I...

1593
01:40:06,696 --> 01:40:10,221
Came along and chaperoned
Michele tonight?

1594
01:40:12,745 --> 01:40:15,618
- Well, good,
'cause I'm starving.

1595
01:40:19,317 --> 01:40:23,539
- Michele, what do you think
is a healthy choice tonight?

1596
01:40:25,671 --> 01:40:27,586
Um...

1597
01:40:27,673 --> 01:40:29,980
And it was love
at first sight.

1598
01:40:32,113 --> 01:40:35,072
- It most certainly was,
I witnessed the whole thing.

1599
01:40:35,159 --> 01:40:37,161
- If I had seen you
at that dinner,

1600
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:38,858
I'd for sure
have dined and dashed.

1601
01:40:40,686 --> 01:40:42,471
And that's why
we're at a beautiful celebration

1602
01:40:42,558 --> 01:40:45,039
of cherished love between
Michele and Mark,

1603
01:40:45,126 --> 01:40:47,215
and not a neanderthal like you.

1604
01:40:47,302 --> 01:40:50,348
Hmm. Yeah.

1605
01:40:52,002 --> 01:40:54,961
Silly me,
it was my understanding

1606
01:40:55,049 --> 01:40:57,138
the wedding is out
on the terrace,

1607
01:40:57,225 --> 01:41:01,229
not inside the groom's
dressing room.

1608
01:41:01,316 --> 01:41:02,578
Hmm.

1609
01:41:11,152 --> 01:41:13,676
What in the world
are you doing?

1610
01:41:13,763 --> 01:41:16,026
- Well, sweetheart, I was told
I wasn't supposed to see

1611
01:41:16,113 --> 01:41:19,203
my queen in her gown
before the ceremony.

1612
01:41:19,290 --> 01:41:22,250
- I'm not sure he's supposed
to tell everyone

1613
01:41:22,337 --> 01:41:25,818
her entire life's story before
the ceremony starts, either.

1614
01:41:25,905 --> 01:41:28,473
But here we are.

1615
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:32,303
- But sweetheart,
it's that story

1616
01:41:32,390 --> 01:41:35,785
that makes you the most amazing
woman that I get to Cherish

1617
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:37,569
my entire life.

1618
01:41:39,745 --> 01:41:44,968
