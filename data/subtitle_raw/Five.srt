1
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:07,442
I REMEMBER...

2
00:04:14,876 --> 00:04:18,342
SOMEBODY.

3
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:45,843
SOMEBODY! PLEASE!

4
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:03,442
SOMEBODY! PLEASE!

5
00:05:06,309 --> 00:05:10,376
HELP ME!
SOMEBODY, HELP ME!

6
00:05:10,442 --> 00:05:13,376
PLEASE, SOMEBODY!

7
00:05:13,442 --> 00:05:18,110
I'M ALIVE!
SOMEBODY, HELP ME!

8
00:05:18,177 --> 00:05:19,776
SOMEBODY!

9
00:05:19,843 --> 00:05:24,743
HELP ME! PLEASE!

10
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:29,043
SOME... BODY.

11
00:05:30,743 --> 00:05:32,342
HELP ME!

12
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:36,177
I'M ALIVE! SOMEBODY.

13
00:05:36,243 --> 00:05:40,043
HELP ME, PLEASE!

14
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,143
Man: I'M MICHAEL.

15
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:51,110
MICHAEL ROGAN.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

16
00:08:20,476 --> 00:08:22,776
IT IS YOU.

17
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:00,810
ALL THESE WEEKS,

18
00:09:00,876 --> 00:09:03,576
I WAS BEGINNING TO THINK
I WAS THE ONLY ONE LEFT.

19
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:06,442
NOW I DON'T KNOW.

20
00:09:21,976 --> 00:09:24,277
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

21
00:09:29,476 --> 00:09:32,277
I WAS BORN
IN RHODE ISLAND.

22
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,409
SCHOOL - DARTMOUTH...

23
00:09:38,476 --> 00:09:40,910
A MASTER OF ARTS
IN ENGLISH LITERATURE.

24
00:09:40,976 --> 00:09:42,543
GAVE ME DICTION

25
00:09:42,609 --> 00:09:47,110
AND A JOB AS A BARKER ON
THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING.

26
00:09:47,177 --> 00:09:50,143
EMPIRE STATE BUILDING.

27
00:09:58,177 --> 00:10:00,609
WE ARE NOW SITUATED

28
00:10:00,676 --> 00:10:04,110
ON A POINT
102 STORIES IN THE AIR

29
00:10:04,177 --> 00:10:07,277
ON THE HIGHEST, LOFTIEST
MAN-MADE EDIFICE

30
00:10:07,342 --> 00:10:09,110
IN ALL THE WORLD.

31
00:10:09,177 --> 00:10:13,976
BOROUGH OF THE BRONX, BROOKLYN,
QUEENS, STATEN ISLAND...

32
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:33,143
YEAH, THAT'S WHERE I WAS
WHEN IT ALL BEGAN.

33
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:36,976
I RAN FOR THE ELEVATORS,
SOMETHING HIT ME,

34
00:10:37,043 --> 00:10:41,309
AND I WOKE UP -
IT WAS ALL OVER.

35
00:10:41,376 --> 00:10:44,309
I WAS
THE ONLY ONE ALIVE -

36
00:10:44,376 --> 00:10:47,810
IN ALL NEW YORK,
THE ONLY ONE ALIVE.

37
00:10:47,876 --> 00:10:50,342
I BEGAN TO RUN.
IT WAS A NIGHTMARE.

38
00:10:50,409 --> 00:10:53,010
WHOLE UNITED STATES, WHEREVER
THERE HAD BEEN PEOPLE,

39
00:10:53,076 --> 00:10:54,676
THAT INFERNAL
RADIOACTIVE DUST -

40
00:10:54,743 --> 00:10:57,376
IT CHOKED AND IT KILLED
AND IT -

41
00:11:08,342 --> 00:11:11,143
BUT THERE COMES AN END
TO RUNNING.

42
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:17,309
WHERE WERE YOU?

43
00:11:30,043 --> 00:11:32,076
WHERE...

44
00:11:32,143 --> 00:11:34,143
I'M GOING HUNTING.

45
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,309
I GO EVERY DAY.

46
00:11:36,376 --> 00:11:40,309
THERE'S NOTHING TO HUNT,
BUT I GO ANYWAY.

47
00:11:40,376 --> 00:11:42,476
I NEVER HAD IT SO GOOD -

48
00:11:42,543 --> 00:11:45,843
A HOUSE,
FOOD, NO PROBLEMS.

49
00:12:21,342 --> 00:12:23,776
HAVE YOU BEEN SITTING HERE
ALL DAY?

50
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:26,810
COME ON INSIDE.
DO YOU WANT TO GET SICKER?

51
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:35,010
YOU SURE
YOU DON'T WANT MORE?

52
00:12:43,876 --> 00:12:46,676
I WANT TO TELL YOU.

53
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:02,943
I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL.

54
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:06,309
THEY TOOK ME
INTO THE X-RAY ROOM.

55
00:13:09,676 --> 00:13:12,177
ALL OF A SUDDEN, THERE -

56
00:13:12,243 --> 00:13:15,876
THERE WAS A STRANGE NOISE.

57
00:13:15,943 --> 00:13:19,876
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT.

58
00:13:19,943 --> 00:13:23,376
WHEN I WOKE UP,

59
00:13:23,442 --> 00:13:26,576
I WAS LYING ON THE BED.

60
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:31,076
DRINK.

61
00:13:44,943 --> 00:13:48,676
I STILL DON'T KNOW
YOUR NAME.

62
00:13:50,543 --> 00:13:52,476
ROSEANNE.

63
00:13:52,543 --> 00:13:56,576
THE LEAD SHIELD
AROUND THE X-RAY ROOM -

64
00:13:56,643 --> 00:13:58,910
THAT'S WHAT SAVED YOU.

65
00:13:58,976 --> 00:14:02,076
WHY DID YOU COME HERE?

66
00:14:04,609 --> 00:14:08,543
MY MOTHER'S SISTER LIVES -

67
00:14:08,609 --> 00:14:11,910
LIVED HERE.

68
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:15,910
SHE WAS AN ARTIST,

69
00:14:15,976 --> 00:14:18,910
AND I CAME HERE
ONE SUMMER.

70
00:14:18,976 --> 00:14:22,210
I WAS SO HAPPY,
I NEVER FORGOT.

71
00:14:25,576 --> 00:14:30,409
WHO WAS...
THE MAN IN THE PICTURE?

72
00:14:33,676 --> 00:14:35,943
STEVEN.

73
00:14:38,476 --> 00:14:41,910
HUSBAND?

74
00:14:41,976 --> 00:14:44,110
YES.

75
00:14:44,177 --> 00:14:49,210
DO YOU MIND IF I STAY HERE
A LITTLE LONGER?

76
00:14:52,442 --> 00:14:55,409
I THOUGHT MAYBE
I'D NEVER SEE ANYONE AGAIN.

77
00:15:05,776 --> 00:15:10,409
GOOD MORNING.

78
00:15:14,277 --> 00:15:16,743
I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR YOU TO GET UP.

79
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,910
I'VE GOT TO GO GET FOOD.

80
00:15:18,976 --> 00:15:21,076
THERE'S A COUNTRY STORE
DOWN THE ROAD.

81
00:15:21,143 --> 00:15:23,743
IT'S ABOUT A MILE,
SO I'LL BE GONE FOR A WHILE.

82
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:27,243
NO, TAKE ME WITH YOU.

83
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:29,277
ALL RIGHT.

84
00:15:37,243 --> 00:15:38,843
PEOPLE -

85
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:41,076
WHERE ARE THE PEOPLE?
THERE SHOULD BE PEOPLE!

86
00:15:41,143 --> 00:15:42,409
STOP THINKING ABOUT IT!

87
00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:44,409
STOP THINKING ABOUT IT.
DO YOU HEAR ME? STOP IT.

88
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:45,743
NEW YORK, CLEVELAND,
CHICAGO -

89
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,743
WHAT I SAW THERE WAS ENOUGH
TO CRACK MY HEAD OPEN,

90
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,442
BUT I STOPPED THINKING
ABOUT IT.

91
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:51,442
I'D LOOK AT IT
AND I WOULDN'T SEE IT.

92
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:54,476
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
OF THE WORLD THAT NEVER WAS.

93
00:16:31,976 --> 00:16:34,442
NOT EVEN A MOUSE.

94
00:16:37,342 --> 00:16:40,943
THESE COUNTRY STORES -
YOU GOT ANYTHING.

95
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:43,143
TAKE WHAT YOU WANT.

96
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:59,076
REMEMBER HOW IMPORTANT
BOX TOPS USED TO BE?

97
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,409
MY MA -
THAT WAS HER BIG DREAM.

98
00:17:01,476 --> 00:17:03,910
TEAR OFF A BOX TOP,
WRITE 20 WITTY WORDS,

99
00:17:03,976 --> 00:17:05,243
AND OWN THE WORLD.

100
00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:07,243
MAIL IT IN
WITH 10 CENTS IN STAMPS

101
00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:09,243
AND YOU'LL GET RICH,
FAT, AND FAMOUS.

102
00:17:09,309 --> 00:17:12,943
HERE, MADAM,
TEAR OFF A BOX TOP.

103
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:24,810
COME ON.

104
00:17:24,876 --> 00:17:27,843
LET'S GET WHAT WE NEED
AND GET OUT OF HERE.

105
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,043
IT'S GETTING COLD OUT.

106
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,243
I GOT ENOUGH
FOR ALL NIGHT.

107
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:14,810
ALL THOSE YEARS IN NEW YORK
AND I NEVER SAW THE MOONLIGHT.

108
00:18:20,076 --> 00:18:21,676
I HATED NEW YORK.

109
00:18:21,743 --> 00:18:25,409
IT WAS LIKE
A TRAP HOLDING ME.

110
00:18:25,476 --> 00:18:29,409
WHEN I WAS A KID, WE WERE
SO POOR - HUNGRY POOR.

111
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:32,743
UP IN THE COUNTRY,
HUNGER IS DIFFERENT.

112
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:36,609
IN THE CITY,
EVERYTHING THERE,

113
00:18:36,676 --> 00:18:39,609
ONLY A PIECE OF GLASS

114
00:18:39,676 --> 00:18:42,810
BETWEEN YOU
AND WHAT YOU NEED.

115
00:18:47,342 --> 00:18:49,676
IT'S DONE WITH.

116
00:18:54,709 --> 00:18:58,943
ROSEANNE...

117
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,810
WHAT ABOUT US?

118
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:09,576
NO, NO! UHH!

119
00:19:09,643 --> 00:19:12,277
YOU LITTLE FOOL,
THERE'S ONLY US.

120
00:19:12,342 --> 00:19:15,910
STEVEN!

121
00:19:15,976 --> 00:19:17,910
HE'S DEAD. I'M HERE.

122
00:19:17,976 --> 00:19:19,876
AAH!

123
00:19:19,943 --> 00:19:22,876
STEVEN, SAVE ME!

124
00:19:22,943 --> 00:19:26,943
OH! SAVE ME!

125
00:20:30,442 --> 00:20:33,243
I'M ALMOST OUT OF EVERYTHING.

126
00:20:36,876 --> 00:20:39,776
GET YOU SOME STUFF
TOMORROW.

127
00:20:39,843 --> 00:20:42,243
TAKE ME WITH YOU.

128
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:45,043
LET'S GO TO THE CITY.

129
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,376
MAYBE STEVEN'S ALIVE.

130
00:20:47,442 --> 00:20:49,843
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I'VE GOT TO KNOW.

131
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:52,643
PRETTY SOON I WON'T BE ABLE
TO WALK SO FAR,

132
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,943
BUT I'M ALL RIGHT NOW.

133
00:20:57,277 --> 00:21:01,476
PLEASE LET'S GO THERE
TOMORROW.

134
00:21:01,543 --> 00:21:03,609
WHY DON'T YOU ANSWER ME?

135
00:21:03,676 --> 00:21:06,143
DO YOU WANT
TO KILL YOURSELF AND IT?

136
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:08,576
THROUGH SOME MIRACLE,
WE'RE SAFE HERE,

137
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:10,076
BUT IN THE CITY,

138
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,110
HOW DO YOU KNOW
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

139
00:21:12,177 --> 00:21:13,643
TO YOU AND -

140
00:21:13,709 --> 00:21:16,177
BUT I'VE GOT TO KNOW
ABOUT STEVEN!

141
00:21:16,243 --> 00:21:18,210
ALL RIGHT, I'LL TELL YOU.

142
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,609
HE'S DEAD.
THEY'RE ALL DEAD - EVERYONE.

143
00:21:20,676 --> 00:21:22,810
YOU AND I ARE
IN A DEAD WORLD,

144
00:21:22,876 --> 00:21:26,376
AND I'M GLAD IT'S DEAD -
CHEAP HONKY-TONK OF A WORLD.

145
00:21:46,143 --> 00:21:48,177
WAIT!

146
00:21:48,243 --> 00:21:50,976
STOP! HEY!

147
00:21:53,876 --> 00:21:55,810
I NEVER EXPECTED
TO SEE ANYONE.

148
00:21:55,876 --> 00:21:57,342
BOY, NEITHER DID I.

149
00:21:57,409 --> 00:21:59,576
OH, A YOUNG LADY.

150
00:22:07,342 --> 00:22:09,010
I AM OLIVER P. BARNSTAPLE.

151
00:22:09,076 --> 00:22:12,476
I AM ASSISTANT CASHIER
AT THE SANTA BARBARA BANK.

152
00:22:12,543 --> 00:22:17,076
HOW DO YOU DO?

153
00:22:17,143 --> 00:22:18,509
A MIRACLE -

154
00:22:18,576 --> 00:22:21,609
WHEN WE SAW THAT SMOKE
IN THE SKY

155
00:22:21,676 --> 00:22:23,110
FROM YOUR CHIMNEY.

156
00:22:23,177 --> 00:22:27,177
ANOTHER HOUR, AND IT WOULD
HAVE BEEN TOO DARK.

157
00:22:27,243 --> 00:22:29,277
WAS IT PRETTY ROUGH?

158
00:22:29,342 --> 00:22:33,177
FIRE FEELS GOOD.

159
00:22:33,243 --> 00:22:35,709
YES, IT WAS PRETTY ROUGH.

160
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:39,376
FIRST GETTING LOCKED
IN THE VAULT.

161
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:41,743
THE AIR GOT PRETTY BAD.

162
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:44,776
HE'S A PRETTY OLD MAN.

163
00:22:44,843 --> 00:22:47,409
THEN WHEN I FOUND
THE INSIDE RELEASE

164
00:22:47,476 --> 00:22:49,643
FOR THE TIME LOCK MECHANISM,

165
00:22:49,709 --> 00:22:51,442
WHEN WE GOT OUT,

166
00:22:51,509 --> 00:22:53,509
THEN WE FOUND EVERYBODY,

167
00:22:53,576 --> 00:22:56,943
EVERYBODY HE'D WORKED WITH
ALL THOSE YEARS.

168
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:03,143
IT WASN'T EASY ON HIM,
EITHER.

169
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:06,843
USED TO DRIVE ONE
IN THE ARMY -

170
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:09,409
AND WE JUST WENT OFF,

171
00:23:09,476 --> 00:23:11,943
WENT AROUND IN CIRCLES,
I GUESS.

172
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:15,277
I WASN'T EXACTLY WHAT
YOU'D CALL NORMAL, EITHER,

173
00:23:15,342 --> 00:23:17,910
FOR A WHILE.

174
00:23:17,976 --> 00:23:21,076
I'D ALWAYS SEEN THE DEAD
IN THEIR COFFINS.

175
00:23:23,143 --> 00:23:25,576
ANYONE WANT SOME MORE?

176
00:23:25,643 --> 00:23:27,409
I AM MOST CONTENT.

177
00:23:27,476 --> 00:23:29,576
I'M FULL UP.

178
00:23:31,342 --> 00:23:32,910
AH.

179
00:23:32,976 --> 00:23:35,376
DELICIOUS
AND DELIGHTFUL,

180
00:23:35,442 --> 00:23:39,509
BUT TOMORROW WE MUST BE
ON OUR WAY, EH, CHARLES?

181
00:23:39,576 --> 00:23:43,177
OH, YES, INDEED,
VACATIONS ARE DELIGHTFUL,

182
00:23:43,243 --> 00:23:46,609
BUT ONE HAS OBLIGATIONS
TO ONE'S WORK.

183
00:23:49,943 --> 00:23:53,010
SIRIUS.

184
00:23:53,076 --> 00:23:55,442
JUPITER.

185
00:23:55,509 --> 00:24:00,143
I ONCE BOUGHT A BOOK
ON THE CONSTELLATIONS.

186
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:03,043
IMPRACTICAL INVESTMENT.

187
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:06,177
I NEVER GOT A CHANCE
TO LOOK AT IT.

188
00:24:06,243 --> 00:24:08,976
WE'RE QUITE AN INSTITUTION,
YOU KNOW.

189
00:24:09,043 --> 00:24:12,143
THREE-QUARTERS OF A MILLION
CAPITALIZATION.

190
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:14,976
DO YOU MIND IF I STROLL OUT
ON THE POINT

191
00:24:15,043 --> 00:24:17,743
AND LOOK AT THE GLORIES
OF NATURE?

192
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:20,743
ONE MUST ENJOY ONE'S VACATION
WHILE ONE CAN, YOU KNOW.

193
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:22,843
OF COURSE.

194
00:24:25,043 --> 00:24:27,342
BE CAREFUL, SIR.

195
00:24:27,409 --> 00:24:29,709
OOH, I'LL BE
QUITE ALL RIGHT.

196
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:39,910
I...

197
00:24:39,976 --> 00:24:44,076
WANT TO SAY SOMETHING.

198
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:49,776
WHAT I SAID BEFORE,

199
00:24:49,843 --> 00:24:53,376
I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S TRUE ANYMORE.

200
00:24:53,442 --> 00:24:57,543
WE'RE ALIVE
AND NOW THOSE TWO.

201
00:24:57,609 --> 00:24:59,910
I DON'T KNOW.

202
00:25:06,043 --> 00:25:08,843
Michael: I'VE GOT A PLACE
FIXED UP DOWN THERE.

203
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,943
I THINK PERHAPS
MR. BARNSTAPLE

204
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,910
HAD BETTER STAY HERE
TONIGHT.

205
00:25:12,976 --> 00:25:14,976
OH, NO,
MY DEAR YOUNG LADY.

206
00:25:15,043 --> 00:25:16,576
NO, INDEED.

207
00:25:16,643 --> 00:25:19,609
FOR 40 YEARS I HAVE WANTED
TO SLEEP UNDER THE STARS.

208
00:25:19,676 --> 00:25:21,643
I NEVER DID, YOU KNOW.

209
00:25:21,709 --> 00:25:24,342
IT GETS QUITE COLD
HERE.

210
00:25:24,409 --> 00:25:26,676
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
THERE'S A COUCH.

211
00:25:26,743 --> 00:25:28,043
COME ALONG.

212
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,643
I AM TIRED.

213
00:25:30,709 --> 00:25:32,543
IT WON'T EMBARRASS YOU?

214
00:25:32,609 --> 00:25:34,476
NO.

215
00:25:45,442 --> 00:25:48,342
ON THE WAY,

216
00:25:48,409 --> 00:25:51,843
DID YOU SEE ANYTHING
ALIVE?

217
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:54,342
JUST A FEW BIRDS.

218
00:26:00,943 --> 00:26:04,143
HE KEEPS TALKING
ABOUT BANK STATEMENTS.

219
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:05,910
YES, MA'AM.

220
00:26:05,976 --> 00:26:07,743
BEFORE HE GOT SICK,

221
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:10,243
HE WAS A PRETTY BRIGHT MAN
IN HIS CAGE,

222
00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:12,177
MR. BARNSTAPLE WAS,

223
00:26:12,243 --> 00:26:13,876
BUT WHEN HE GOT OUT,

224
00:26:13,943 --> 00:26:15,943
FOUND ALL THE PEOPLE
HE'D BEEN WORKING WITH

225
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:17,342
JUST LYING THERE,

226
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,943
WELL, YOU MIGHT SAY HE WAS
SORT OF LIKE A MACHINE

227
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:23,543
WITH NO ONE LEFT
TO PRESS THE BUTTONS.

228
00:26:23,609 --> 00:26:26,076
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM.

229
00:26:26,143 --> 00:26:27,810
YES, MA'AM.

230
00:26:30,976 --> 00:26:32,342
CHARLES?

231
00:26:32,409 --> 00:26:33,709
YES, MA'AM?

232
00:26:33,776 --> 00:26:36,010
DID YOU HAVE
A FAMILY?

233
00:26:38,409 --> 00:26:40,876
YES, MA'AM.

234
00:27:01,342 --> 00:27:06,177
EXCELLENT INVESTMENT,
A HOUSE.

235
00:27:13,676 --> 00:27:16,010
WHAT'S YOUR HUSBAND'S
BUSINESS?

236
00:27:18,576 --> 00:27:20,543
HE'S AN ARCHITECT.

237
00:27:20,609 --> 00:27:22,676
OH, EXCELLENT.

238
00:27:22,743 --> 00:27:24,210
EXCELLENT.

239
00:27:24,277 --> 00:27:26,476
WE DO A GREAT DEAL
OF BUSINESS

240
00:27:26,543 --> 00:27:28,376
WITH ARCHITECTS
AND BUILDERS.

241
00:27:28,442 --> 00:27:30,943
OUR ESCROW DEPARTMENT
IS MOST EFFICIENT.

242
00:27:33,376 --> 00:27:35,643
DID I FALL DOWN?

243
00:27:35,709 --> 00:27:38,076
I DON'T REMEMBER.

244
00:27:38,143 --> 00:27:41,776
OH, I MUST HAVE
BRUISED MYSELF.

245
00:27:41,843 --> 00:27:47,043
I SEEM TO BE BLEEDING
UNDER MY SKIN MANY PLACES.

246
00:28:12,743 --> 00:28:14,843
I THINK IT'S
RADIATION POISONING.

247
00:28:18,342 --> 00:28:20,342
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

248
00:28:20,409 --> 00:28:22,476
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M GUESSING.

249
00:28:22,543 --> 00:28:25,277
BUT AFTER HIROSHIMA,
THE MAGAZINES RAN PICTURES.

250
00:28:25,342 --> 00:28:28,110
IT LOOKS THE SAME.

251
00:28:28,177 --> 00:28:30,442
BUT YOU'RE NOT SURE.

252
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:32,876
NO, I'M NOT SURE.

253
00:28:57,976 --> 00:29:01,376
GOOD MORNING.

254
00:29:01,442 --> 00:29:03,910
HOW'S THE LAUNDRY
BUSINESS?

255
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:06,509
I CAN'T TURN OFF
THE FAUCET.

256
00:29:06,576 --> 00:29:09,076
HOW IS HE?

257
00:29:11,243 --> 00:29:13,110
SLEEPING.

258
00:29:13,177 --> 00:29:15,876
THREE DAYS, SLEEPING.

259
00:29:15,943 --> 00:29:20,876
Michael: CHARLES,
CAN YOU GIVE ME A HAND?

260
00:29:20,943 --> 00:29:24,609
OKAY!

261
00:29:24,676 --> 00:29:28,010
MADAM, I HEREBY TENDER
MY RESIGNATION.

262
00:29:28,076 --> 00:29:32,543
I AM ENTERING THE BROADER FIELD
OF THE BUILDING TRADE.

263
00:29:32,609 --> 00:29:36,210
Oliver: MISS? MISS ROSEANNE?

264
00:29:44,143 --> 00:29:46,376
WHERE DID YOU GET
ALL THIS WOOD?

265
00:29:46,442 --> 00:29:48,976
FORESTRY STATION
TWO VALLEYS OVER.

266
00:29:49,043 --> 00:29:51,509
HEY, THERE'S AN ELECTRIC
GENERATOR OVER THERE.

267
00:29:51,576 --> 00:29:53,010
IS THAT A FACT?

268
00:29:53,076 --> 00:29:58,442
YEAH.

269
00:29:58,509 --> 00:30:00,476
ELECTRIC LIGHT.

270
00:30:00,543 --> 00:30:02,376
NOW, THAT WOULD BE
SOMETHING.

271
00:30:02,442 --> 00:30:05,376
AND THEN MAYBE WE COULD
FIND ME A WASHING MACHINE.

272
00:30:05,442 --> 00:30:07,943
THEN I COULD FIX ME UP
A METER,

273
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:09,943
SEND ME A BILL EVERY MONTH.

274
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,776
COURSE, I WOULDN'T PAY IT,

275
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:14,376
SO THAT WOULD FORCE ME
TO DISCONNECT MYSELF.

276
00:30:14,442 --> 00:30:16,476
DID YOU EVER STOP
TO THINK -

277
00:30:16,543 --> 00:30:18,376
A WORLD WITHOUT ANY BILLS.

278
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:21,210
Roseanne: CHARLES?
CHARLES!

279
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:24,643
HI.

280
00:30:24,709 --> 00:30:26,943
MICHAEL, CHARLES...

281
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:29,442
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

282
00:30:29,509 --> 00:30:31,509
HE'S AWAKE,

283
00:30:31,576 --> 00:30:34,442
AND HE WANTS TO GO DOWN
TO THE OCEAN.

284
00:30:34,509 --> 00:30:36,509
OCEAN? WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

285
00:30:36,576 --> 00:30:38,309
HE SEEMS PERFECTLY RATIONAL,

286
00:30:38,376 --> 00:30:42,709
BUT HE SAYS HE WANTS TO GO
DOWN TO THE OCEAN RIGHT AWAY.

287
00:31:10,342 --> 00:31:12,943
OH, YES.

288
00:31:19,409 --> 00:31:21,810
I THINK HE'S BETTER.

289
00:31:21,876 --> 00:31:24,509
YES.

290
00:31:24,576 --> 00:31:26,843
HOW ABOUT YOU?

291
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:29,876
I'M FINE.

292
00:31:29,943 --> 00:31:32,309
I'VE NEVER ASKED YOU BEFORE,
BUT I'VE GOT TO,

293
00:31:32,376 --> 00:31:33,910
SO HERE GOES.

294
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:36,943
WHEN DOES...

295
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:39,976
I'M NOT SURE.

296
00:31:40,043 --> 00:31:42,210
THREE MONTHS, MAYBE.

297
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:55,976
DID I EVER TELL YOU
WHEN I WAS A VERY YOUNG MAN,

298
00:31:56,043 --> 00:32:00,442
I ALWAYS WANTED
TO GO TO SEA?

299
00:32:00,509 --> 00:32:04,409
I DON'T REMEMBER
WHY I DIDN'T.

300
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,776
HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

301
00:32:45,476 --> 00:32:47,210
CONEY ISLAND.

302
00:32:48,543 --> 00:32:50,910
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

303
00:32:50,976 --> 00:32:53,243
I WAS THINKING
OF CONEY ISLAND

304
00:32:53,309 --> 00:32:55,676
ON A DAY LIKE THIS.

305
00:32:55,743 --> 00:32:59,143
DO YOU KNOW CONEY ISLAND?

306
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:02,943
THERE WAS PEOPLE,

307
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:07,609
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF THEM JAMMED TOGETHER,

308
00:33:07,676 --> 00:33:11,743
BODY TO BODY...

309
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:15,376
TRYING TO GET
A LITTLE SUMMER,

310
00:33:15,442 --> 00:33:18,277
A LITTLE FRESH AIR,

311
00:33:18,342 --> 00:33:19,910
AND I WITH THEM.

312
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:29,043
I STILL SEE A -

313
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:31,409
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ME?

314
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:33,476
MICHAEL.

315
00:33:33,543 --> 00:33:36,309
MICHAEL!

316
00:33:43,043 --> 00:33:45,442
CHARLES!

317
00:33:54,177 --> 00:33:56,043
CHARLES!

318
00:34:38,177 --> 00:34:40,309
LAST DRIFTWOOD
ON THE BEACH.

319
00:34:40,376 --> 00:34:42,576
HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW,
MISTER?

320
00:34:48,976 --> 00:34:51,743
THE LAST SURVIVORS.

321
00:34:56,776 --> 00:34:59,309
I HAVE LISTENED
TO THESE STORIES

322
00:34:59,376 --> 00:35:02,609
OF YOUR INDIVIDUAL MIRACLES.

323
00:35:02,676 --> 00:35:06,609
NOW I'LL TELL YOU
OF MINE.

324
00:35:09,076 --> 00:35:12,442
I WAS ON THE MOUNTAIN
WHEN IT HAPPENED.

325
00:35:12,509 --> 00:35:15,943
<i>THE MOUNTAIN.</i>

326
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,810
EVEREST.

327
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:24,043
SURELY YOU HEARD
OF OUR EXPLORATION.

328
00:35:29,143 --> 00:35:32,342
NO MATTER.

329
00:35:32,409 --> 00:35:34,309
I ALONE.

330
00:35:36,043 --> 00:35:38,376
THERE WAS A GREAT BLIZZARD.

331
00:35:38,442 --> 00:35:43,110
FOR FIVE DAYS I WAS MAROONED
ON THE FINAL RIDGE.

332
00:35:43,177 --> 00:35:45,910
WHEN I RETURNED
TO THE BASE CAMP

333
00:35:45,976 --> 00:35:48,743
5,000 FEET BELOW,

334
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:50,476
THEY WERE ALL DEAD.

335
00:35:50,543 --> 00:35:56,509
I MADE MY WAY ACROSS ASIA
TO THE COAST.

336
00:35:56,576 --> 00:36:00,910
AGAIN I WAS THE ONLY
LIVING THING.

337
00:36:03,342 --> 00:36:06,609
I FOUND A BOAT.

338
00:36:06,676 --> 00:36:10,243
I WENT TO HAWAII.

339
00:36:10,309 --> 00:36:14,676
AGAIN A MOUNTAIN OF DEAD.

340
00:36:18,076 --> 00:36:21,776
I FOUND A PLANE.

341
00:36:21,843 --> 00:36:24,810
I DECIDED TO TRY AMERICA.

342
00:36:28,143 --> 00:36:33,876
I RAN OUT OF PETROL
A FEW HOURS AGO.

343
00:36:35,309 --> 00:36:39,776
I CLIMBED MT. EVEREST.

344
00:36:41,776 --> 00:36:43,576
I ALONE.

345
00:36:45,543 --> 00:36:47,376
ALWAYS ALONE.

346
00:36:53,442 --> 00:36:56,509
NOW THERE ARE YOU.

347
00:36:59,309 --> 00:37:01,676
WE ARE QUITE THE COMMUNITY.

348
00:37:07,177 --> 00:37:09,342
Charles: MIKE, ROSEANNE,
COME HERE.

349
00:37:40,876 --> 00:37:44,243
WHAT WENT WRONG?

350
00:37:44,309 --> 00:37:48,342
HE JUST... DIED.

351
00:37:48,409 --> 00:37:53,476
I'LL STAY.
YOU COME BACK FOR US.

352
00:37:53,543 --> 00:37:56,609
NO, I'LL BURY HIM HERE.
YOU TAKE ROSEANNE HOME.

353
00:37:56,676 --> 00:37:59,210
NO, I'LL STAY.

354
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,309
DON'T YOU THINK
YOU'D BETTER COME ALONG?

355
00:38:01,376 --> 00:38:02,509
NO.

356
00:38:06,709 --> 00:38:08,843
CHARLES,

357
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:12,210
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

358
00:38:12,277 --> 00:38:14,743
HE LOVED THE SEA.

359
00:38:38,309 --> 00:38:40,709
SHE SHOULDN'T BE CLIMBING
UP AND DOWN THAT HILL.

360
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:44,277
SHE WANTS TO FEED THE MAN.

361
00:38:44,342 --> 00:38:47,643
HE'S NOT THAT SICK.

362
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:54,509
WHAT'S GONNA BE WITH
ROSEANNE WHEN HER TIME COMES?

363
00:38:54,576 --> 00:38:56,210
I DON'T KNOW.

364
00:39:02,843 --> 00:39:06,509
IF MY OLD FATHER
COULD SEE ME NOW.

365
00:39:06,576 --> 00:39:09,376
WHY?

366
00:39:09,442 --> 00:39:12,509
HE USED TO WAVE THE BIBLE
AT ME AND SAY,

367
00:39:12,576 --> 00:39:16,843
"IN THE SWEAT OF THY FACE
SHALL THOU EAT BREAD."

368
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:18,643
HOW ABOUT THE BANK?

369
00:39:18,709 --> 00:39:23,643
NO SWEAT OF YOUR FACE?

370
00:39:23,709 --> 00:39:26,110
GOOD MORNING, MR. HARRISON.

371
00:39:26,177 --> 00:39:29,210
GOOD MORNING, MR. ADAMS.
GOOD MORNING, MR. PALMER.

372
00:39:29,277 --> 00:39:31,342
WHAT DID YOU WANT TO DO,
CHARLES?

373
00:39:36,476 --> 00:39:38,643
I WANTED TO BE A TEACHER.

374
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:41,476
WHY DIDN'T YOU?

375
00:39:43,509 --> 00:39:46,277
LOST MY WAY SOMEWHERE,
I GUESS.

376
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:48,910
FIRST A GIRL,
A DECENT SUIT,

377
00:39:48,976 --> 00:39:52,342
THEN AFTER A WHILE
I GUESS WHAT I WANTED

378
00:39:52,409 --> 00:39:54,409
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE

379
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:56,976
WAS A LITTLE PIECE
OF SECURITY,

380
00:39:57,043 --> 00:39:58,643
9:30 TO 4:00,

381
00:39:58,709 --> 00:40:03,709
$38.50 A WEEK,
EVERY WEEK.

382
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,543
SECURITY.

383
00:40:12,177 --> 00:40:15,709
WELL, HOW IS
THE AGRICULTURAL PROJECT GOING?

384
00:40:15,776 --> 00:40:18,210
WE DON'T KNOW
IF THE SEED WILL GROW.

385
00:40:18,277 --> 00:40:20,409
WHY NOT?

386
00:40:20,476 --> 00:40:24,876
THINGS ARE SO STRANGE -

387
00:40:24,943 --> 00:40:29,743
NO BIRDS, NO ANIMALS,

388
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:33,342
SO MANY THINGS
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

389
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:38,442
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

390
00:40:38,509 --> 00:40:39,676
FINE.

391
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:46,043
I THINK I'D BETTER SEE
HOW THE FARMERS ARE DOING.

392
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,376
ISN'T THAT A MISDIRECTION
OF ENERGY?

393
00:40:48,442 --> 00:40:51,376
WHY THIS RETURN
TO PRIMITIVENESS?

394
00:40:51,442 --> 00:40:55,509
THE SHELVES OF THE CITIES
ARE BURSTING WITH FOOD,

395
00:40:55,576 --> 00:40:59,143
A LIFETIME OF FOOD.

396
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:02,277
MICHAEL DOESN'T WANT
TO GO NEAR THE CITIES.

397
00:41:02,342 --> 00:41:04,309
DO YOU WANT
TO STAY HERE?

398
00:41:07,043 --> 00:41:09,010
I HAVE TO NOW.

399
00:41:09,076 --> 00:41:12,476
I MEAN AFTER YOUR CHILD
IS BORN.

400
00:41:15,243 --> 00:41:18,543
I THINK I WILL TRY
TO GET UP TOMORROW.

401
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:20,810
OH, THAT'S WONDERFUL, ERIC.

402
00:41:20,876 --> 00:41:22,442
YOU'RE VERY SWEET.

403
00:41:44,709 --> 00:41:47,010
EVERYBODY COME ON!
HURRY.

404
00:41:47,076 --> 00:41:49,342
COME ON!

405
00:41:49,409 --> 00:41:50,709
TAKE IT EASY.

406
00:41:50,776 --> 00:41:52,409
WHAT COULD IT BE?

407
00:42:13,476 --> 00:42:16,043
IT'S GROWING AT LAST.

408
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:19,043
SO?

409
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:21,509
PRETTY GOOD
FOR CITY FOLKS, HUH?

410
00:42:21,576 --> 00:42:23,309
CORN ON THE COB.

411
00:42:45,609 --> 00:42:47,976
I WAS A FOOL.

412
00:42:50,843 --> 00:42:55,143
A LONG, TERRIBLE TRIP
TO REACH HERE,

413
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:58,476
ENDLESS DAYS AT SEA,

414
00:42:58,543 --> 00:43:03,177
ALONE, ALWAYS ALONE.

415
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:10,576
NOW I HAVE FOUND
MY CIVILIZATION.

416
00:43:19,943 --> 00:43:22,876
AS LONG AS THINGS
KEEP GROWING,

417
00:43:22,943 --> 00:43:25,376
EVERYTHING WILL BE
ALL RIGHT.

418
00:43:25,442 --> 00:43:27,076
YES, I KNOW.

419
00:43:27,143 --> 00:43:29,010
NATURE SO ARRANGES IT

420
00:43:29,076 --> 00:43:32,576
THAT WHEN A WOMAN
IS IN YOUR CONDITION,

421
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:34,743
CLOUDS ARE LIKE RAINBOWS

422
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:37,910
AND ALL THE WORLD
IS LIKE A CRADLE.

423
00:43:51,076 --> 00:43:54,876
HEY, THEY'RE ON!
THEY'RE ON!

424
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:17,409
HOW WONDERFUL...

425
00:44:17,476 --> 00:44:19,409
MUSIC.

426
00:44:19,476 --> 00:44:22,409
I'VE WANTED IT SO MUCH.

427
00:44:22,476 --> 00:44:25,442
WE FOUND 100 RECORDS.

428
00:44:30,476 --> 00:44:32,910
I WISH I COULD DANCE.

429
00:44:32,976 --> 00:44:36,442
ME. YOU SIT.
I'LL DO IT FOR YOU.

430
00:45:13,442 --> 00:45:14,910
IT'LL KEEP BURNING.

431
00:45:14,976 --> 00:45:18,010
THERE'S PLENTY OF GAS
IN THE GENERATOR.

432
00:45:18,076 --> 00:45:21,376
I KEEP THINKING
HOW I NEVER SAW THE LIGHTS.

433
00:45:21,442 --> 00:45:24,943
ALL MY LIFE IN THE CITY,
AND I NEVER SAW THEM.

434
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:31,442
Michael: VERY NICE.

435
00:45:33,976 --> 00:45:36,943
Charles: AND HERE I THOUGHT
YOU WERE SEWING BOOTIES.

436
00:45:44,476 --> 00:45:45,910
IT IS VERY NICE.

437
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:47,409
THANK YOU.

438
00:45:47,476 --> 00:45:51,442
YOU HAVE DONE ENOUGH WORK
FOR ONE DAY.

439
00:45:51,509 --> 00:45:54,442
COME OUTSIDE AND TALK TO ME.

440
00:45:54,509 --> 00:45:57,476
I'D LIKE TO FINISH
THIS SEWING.

441
00:46:05,643 --> 00:46:09,243
THAT CORN OUT OF THE CAN
WAS MIGHTY TASTY TONIGHT.

442
00:46:09,309 --> 00:46:11,309
THE BLESSING
OF OUR AGE -

443
00:46:11,376 --> 00:46:13,609
THE AMERICAN
CANNING INDUSTRY,

444
00:46:13,676 --> 00:46:16,143
AND YET IT DEBASED
YOUR TASTE DOWN

445
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:18,843
TO THE LEVEL
OF BAKED BEANS AND HASH.

446
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:22,309
I DIDN'T NOTICE
ANY LEFTOVER BEANS

447
00:46:22,376 --> 00:46:24,509
ON YOUR PLATE TONIGHT.

448
00:46:24,576 --> 00:46:29,342
WHEN IN ROME, EAT SWILL
LIKE THE ROMANS.

449
00:46:37,943 --> 00:46:40,309
I'D LIKE
TO GO PLACES TONIGHT

450
00:46:40,376 --> 00:46:42,076
AND HAVE A BIG TIME -

451
00:46:42,143 --> 00:46:45,409
ORDER A DOUBLE-DECKER
HAMBURGER WITH ONIONS

452
00:46:45,476 --> 00:46:47,910
AND A SIDE ORDER
OF FRENCH FRIES

453
00:46:47,976 --> 00:46:49,743
AND A DOUBLE CHOCOLATE MALT.

454
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:51,277
SPARE RIBS...

455
00:46:51,342 --> 00:46:54,409
BARBECUED SPARE RIBS -

456
00:46:54,476 --> 00:46:57,576
I CAN SMELL THEM.

457
00:46:59,943 --> 00:47:04,976
I LIKE STRAWBERRIES,
STRAWBERRIES AND CREAM.

458
00:47:05,043 --> 00:47:07,342
WHERE I LIVED,
THE SMELL OF TRAFFIC -

459
00:47:07,409 --> 00:47:08,776
FROM MORNING TO NIGHT,

460
00:47:08,843 --> 00:47:10,709
YOU COULD SMELL
THE TRAFFIC.

461
00:47:10,776 --> 00:47:13,910
TELEPHONE - I COULD HEAR
A TELEPHONE RINGING.

462
00:47:16,309 --> 00:47:17,609
A NEW YORK COP,

463
00:47:17,676 --> 00:47:20,643
EVEN A NEW YORK COP
BAWLING OUT A HACK DRIVER.

464
00:47:20,709 --> 00:47:23,876
WHERE I LIVED, THE FAUCET
WAS ALWAYS DRIPPING.

465
00:47:23,943 --> 00:47:26,376
IF I COULD JUST
HEAR THAT DRIPPING...

466
00:47:27,943 --> 00:47:29,376
OF ALL THOSE THINGS,

467
00:47:29,442 --> 00:47:31,810
WHICH WOULD YOU LIKE
THE MOST?

468
00:47:35,476 --> 00:47:37,543
I DON'T KNOW.

469
00:47:39,442 --> 00:47:44,442
KIDS RAISING THE DEVIL
AROUND THE SUPPER TABLE.

470
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:49,943
I HARDLY THINK
THIS IS THE TIME

471
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:51,943
FOR NOSTALGIC SENTIMENTALITY.

472
00:47:53,243 --> 00:47:55,676
I'VE BEEN GIVING
A GREAT DEAL OF THOUGHT

473
00:47:55,743 --> 00:47:57,177
TO WHY WE ARE ALIVE.

474
00:47:57,243 --> 00:47:58,643
OF COURSE,

475
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,676
THERE'S A DEFINITE
PRIMARY REASON

476
00:48:00,743 --> 00:48:03,810
WHY HE AND YOU AND I
ESCAPED THE RADIATION.

477
00:48:03,876 --> 00:48:05,709
I WAS AT A TREMENDOUS HEIGHT

478
00:48:05,776 --> 00:48:07,476
AND YOU TWO BEHIND METAL -

479
00:48:07,543 --> 00:48:09,810
THE BANK VAULT,
THE X-RAY ROOM.

480
00:48:09,876 --> 00:48:11,342
AND YET WHAT ABOUT YOU?

481
00:48:11,409 --> 00:48:15,177
YOU HAD NO SUCH PROTECTION.

482
00:48:15,243 --> 00:48:17,709
AND WHAT ABOUT
THE OLD MAN WHO DIED

483
00:48:17,776 --> 00:48:20,143
IN SPITE OF HAVING
THE SAME PROTECTION

484
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:21,643
AS THIS ONE HAD?

485
00:48:21,709 --> 00:48:24,409
THE ANSWER TO ME
IS OBVIOUS - IMMUNITY,

486
00:48:24,476 --> 00:48:27,509
SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE IS
SOMETHING WITHIN OUR BODIES,

487
00:48:27,576 --> 00:48:30,376
A CHEMISTRY WHICH GIVES US
SPECIAL IMMUNITY

488
00:48:30,476 --> 00:48:32,676
TO THAT WHICH KILLED
THE OTHERS.

489
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,277
I SEE THE DOUBTFUL LOOK
ON YOUR FACES.

490
00:48:35,342 --> 00:48:37,177
THEN MARK THIS.
DURING THE MIDDLE AGES

491
00:48:37,243 --> 00:48:39,709
WHEN THE BLACK PLAGUE
SWEPT ALL EUROPE,

492
00:48:39,776 --> 00:48:42,210
WHEN MEN DIED
BY THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS,

493
00:48:42,277 --> 00:48:43,709
WHY DIDN'T ALL MANKIND DIE?

494
00:48:43,776 --> 00:48:45,210
THE DEADLY ORGANISMS
WERE THERE.

495
00:48:45,277 --> 00:48:47,709
THERE WAS NO PROTECTION
AGAINST THEM,

496
00:48:47,776 --> 00:48:50,210
AND YET A SMALL PERCENTAGE
OF PEOPLE LIVED ON

497
00:48:50,277 --> 00:48:51,709
AS WE HAVE LIVED

498
00:48:51,776 --> 00:48:53,810
WITH THE REST
OF THE WORLD OF MEN

499
00:48:53,876 --> 00:48:55,309
DROPPING DEAD AROUND THEM.

500
00:48:55,376 --> 00:48:59,043
THE ANSWER THEN IS IMMUNITY
TO THE ORGANISMS,

501
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:02,210
AND THE ANSWER HERE TODAY
IS IMMUNITY

502
00:49:02,277 --> 00:49:04,076
AGAINST THE RADIATIONS.

503
00:49:04,143 --> 00:49:07,643
IF WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE,
THEN THERE ARE OTHERS.

504
00:49:07,709 --> 00:49:08,676
OF COURSE.

505
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:14,243
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD,
THERE WOULD BE OTHERS

506
00:49:14,309 --> 00:49:16,810
WHO'D HAVE OUR SORT
OF IMMUNITY.

507
00:49:16,876 --> 00:49:19,177
NOT MANY,
ONLY A FEW PERHAPS,

508
00:49:19,243 --> 00:49:22,509
BUT VERY DEFINITELY EXISTING
AS WE ARE HERE.

509
00:49:22,576 --> 00:49:25,743
SOME WILL DIE FROM
THE LINGERING RADIATIONS,

510
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:29,177
BUT A SMALL NUMBER WILL LIVE
AS WE HAVE LIVED.

511
00:49:29,243 --> 00:49:31,010
THAT GIVES YOU HOPE,
DOESN'T IT?

512
00:49:31,076 --> 00:49:32,309
YES.

513
00:49:32,376 --> 00:49:34,876
LOOK, THAT'S JUST A THEORY,
AND A THEORY'S

514
00:49:34,943 --> 00:49:37,277
JUST A BUNCH OF WORDS
SET FRONT TO BACK.

515
00:49:37,342 --> 00:49:39,976
BUT A THEORY BECOMES A FACT
WITH PROOF,

516
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:43,609
AND THAT IS THE VERY REASON
WE SHOULD GO INTO THE CITIES

517
00:49:43,676 --> 00:49:46,676
AND LOOK FOR THESE PEOPLE
WHO MIGHT BE ALIVE.

518
00:49:46,743 --> 00:49:48,709
WE WILL NEVER KNOW
WAITING HERE.

519
00:49:48,776 --> 00:49:50,376
SHE WILL NEVER KNOW

520
00:49:50,442 --> 00:49:52,609
IF HER HUSBAND
IS DEAD OR ALIVE.

521
00:49:52,676 --> 00:49:55,210
TOMORROW WOULD BE
A GOOD DAY TO START,

522
00:49:55,277 --> 00:49:56,709
DON'T YOU AGREE?

523
00:49:56,776 --> 00:49:58,543
SHE'S NOT WELL ENOUGH
TO TRAVEL.

524
00:49:58,609 --> 00:50:00,043
ANYWAY, WE'RE SAFE HERE.

525
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:02,210
WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO US

526
00:50:02,277 --> 00:50:03,676
IN THE CITIES.

527
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:08,943
MICHAEL, I WAS THINKING,

528
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:11,976
WITH YOUR PRIMITIVE MIND
AND TIMIDITY,

529
00:50:12,043 --> 00:50:14,709
IN A FEW YEARS
YOU'LL BE SWINGING

530
00:50:14,776 --> 00:50:18,043
FROM THE BRANCHES
OF THE TREES.

531
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:19,243
FORTUNATELY, I -

532
00:50:19,309 --> 00:50:22,076
AND I BELIEVE I SPEAK
FOR ROSEANNE AS WELL -

533
00:50:22,143 --> 00:50:23,543
I'M NOT QUITE SATISFIED

534
00:50:23,609 --> 00:50:25,910
WITH THIS RETURN TO NATURE
OF YOURS,

535
00:50:25,976 --> 00:50:29,210
NOT WHEN THE CITIES ARE OPEN,
WAITING TREASURE CHESTS.

536
00:50:29,277 --> 00:50:30,910
EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD
IS THERE FOR US,

537
00:50:30,976 --> 00:50:32,376
EVERYTHING FOR THE TAKING.

538
00:50:32,442 --> 00:50:33,843
AND BEYOND THAT,

539
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:37,509
WHAT OF THE OTHERS
WHO ARE ALIVE?

540
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:42,409
I WANT TO GET THEM TOGETHER
IN ONE PLACE.

541
00:50:42,476 --> 00:50:45,243
WHY, SO THEY CAN BEAT
THEIR HEADS ON THE GROUND

542
00:50:45,309 --> 00:50:46,743
FOR KING ERIC I,

543
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:49,309
THE MAN WHO CLIMBED
MOUNT EVEREST?

544
00:50:49,376 --> 00:50:51,509
MICHAEL, I DO WANT TO GO
TO THE CITY.

545
00:50:51,576 --> 00:50:53,976
IF WE DRIVE CAREFULLY,
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

546
00:50:54,043 --> 00:50:56,743
BUT YOU WON'T BE ALL RIGHT.
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

547
00:50:56,810 --> 00:50:58,309
IT'S THE CITIES THEMSELVES,

548
00:50:58,376 --> 00:51:02,676
WHERE THE BOMBS FELL, THE
RADIATIONS ARE THICKEST.

549
00:51:02,743 --> 00:51:04,076
HE TALKS ABOUT IMMUNITY.

550
00:51:04,143 --> 00:51:05,876
HAVE YOU GOT IMMUNITY

551
00:51:05,943 --> 00:51:08,543
TO DEAD PILED UP
LIKE CORDWOOD

552
00:51:08,609 --> 00:51:10,843
WITH THE FLESH
OFF THEIR BONES?

553
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:41,576
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED
OUT THERE, TOO,

554
00:51:41,643 --> 00:51:43,076
BUT MIKE'S RIGHT.

555
00:51:43,143 --> 00:51:45,143
WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN THERE.

556
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:47,709
WE KNOW WE'RE ALL RIGHT HERE.

557
00:51:47,776 --> 00:51:51,476
WHO IN GOD'S NAME
ASKED YOU YOUR OPINION?

558
00:51:51,543 --> 00:51:53,709
BUT I'M TALKING TO HER.

559
00:51:53,776 --> 00:51:56,243
AND I'M TELLING YOU
TO SHUT UP.

560
00:51:56,309 --> 00:51:59,243
I HAVE HAD ENOUGH
OF THIS INTERFERENCE.

561
00:51:59,309 --> 00:52:01,976
WHERE HAVE I INTERFERED
WITH YOU?

562
00:52:02,043 --> 00:52:03,643
THAT IS THE QUESTION.

563
00:52:03,709 --> 00:52:06,342
YOUR VERY PRESENCE
IS DISTASTEFUL TO ME -

564
00:52:06,409 --> 00:52:07,976
THAT I MUST EAT WITH YOU,

565
00:52:08,043 --> 00:52:10,409
SLEEP UNDER THE SAME ROOF
WITH YOU.

566
00:52:10,476 --> 00:52:14,243
NOW IT'S OUT.

567
00:52:14,309 --> 00:52:16,976
NO, IN THIS WORLD,
YOU MUST FACE REALITY.

568
00:52:17,043 --> 00:52:18,810
IT IS A MISTAKE HE IS ALIVE.

569
00:52:18,876 --> 00:52:21,609
ALL RIGHT, LET HIM
GO LIVE SOMEWHERE ELSE -

570
00:52:21,676 --> 00:52:23,309
NOT WITH YOU, NOT WITH ME.

571
00:52:23,376 --> 00:52:26,177
DO YOU HEAR ME?
I WANT YOU OUT OF HERE NOW!

572
00:52:26,243 --> 00:52:28,609
DON'T, ERIC!

573
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:39,143
AAH!

574
00:53:57,810 --> 00:54:02,010
IT'S LIKE IT NEVER WAS BEFORE.

575
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:09,076
AND GOD STEPPED OUT ON SPACE,

576
00:54:09,143 --> 00:54:12,609
AND HE LOOKED AROUND
AND SAID,

577
00:54:12,676 --> 00:54:16,543
"I'M LONELY.
I'LL MAKE ME A WORLD."

578
00:54:16,609 --> 00:54:19,409
AND GOD SMILED,
AND THE LIGHT BROKE

579
00:54:19,476 --> 00:54:22,509
AND THE DARKNESS ROLLED UP
ON ONE SIDE,

580
00:54:22,576 --> 00:54:25,743
AND THE LIGHT STOOD SHINING
ON THE OTHER.

581
00:54:25,810 --> 00:54:28,010
AND GOD SAID, "THAT'S GOOD."

582
00:54:28,076 --> 00:54:29,709
THEN GOD REACHED OUT

583
00:54:29,776 --> 00:54:32,509
AND TOOK THE LIGHT
IN HIS HANDS,

584
00:54:32,576 --> 00:54:36,143
AND GOD ROLLED THE LIGHT
AROUND IN HIS HANDS

585
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:38,143
UNTIL HE'D MADE THE SUN,

586
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:41,376
AND HE SET THAT SUN ABLAZING
IN THE HEAVENS,

587
00:54:41,442 --> 00:54:44,876
AND THE LIGHT THAT WAS LEFT
FROM MAKING THE SUN,

588
00:54:44,943 --> 00:54:47,709
GOD GATHERED IT
IN A SHINING BALL

589
00:54:47,776 --> 00:54:50,543
AND FLUNG IT
AGAINST THE DARKNESS,

590
00:54:50,609 --> 00:54:54,309
SPANGLING THE NIGHT
WITH THE MOON AND THE STARS,

591
00:54:54,376 --> 00:54:57,743
THEN DOWN BETWEEN THE DARKNESS
AND THE LIGHT,

592
00:54:57,810 --> 00:54:59,543
HE HURLED THE WORLD,

593
00:54:59,609 --> 00:55:01,810
AND GOD SAID, "THAT'S GOOD."

594
00:55:01,876 --> 00:55:03,810
THEN THE GREEN GRASS SPROUTED,

595
00:55:03,876 --> 00:55:07,076
AND THE PINE TREE POINTED
HIS FINGER TO THE SKY.

596
00:55:07,143 --> 00:55:10,509
THE LAKES CUDDLED DOWN
TO THE HOLLOWS OF THE GROUND,

597
00:55:10,576 --> 00:55:13,776
AND THE RIVERS RAN DOWN
TO THE SEA.

598
00:55:13,843 --> 00:55:16,010
THEN UP
FROM THE BED OF THE RIVER

599
00:55:16,076 --> 00:55:17,676
GOD SCOOPED THE CLAY,

600
00:55:17,743 --> 00:55:20,210
AND BY THE BANK OF THE RIVER,
HE KNEELED HIM DOWN,

601
00:55:20,277 --> 00:55:23,576
AND THERE
THE GREAT GOD ALMIGHTY,

602
00:55:23,643 --> 00:55:26,810
WHO LIT THE SUN
AND FIXED IT IN THE SKY,

603
00:55:26,876 --> 00:55:30,976
WHO FLUNG THE STARS TO THE MOST
FAR CORNER OF THE NIGHT,

604
00:55:31,043 --> 00:55:34,543
WHO ROUNDED THE EARTH
IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS HAND -

605
00:55:34,609 --> 00:55:36,476
THIS GREAT GOD,

606
00:55:36,543 --> 00:55:39,810
LIKE A MOTHER
BENDING OVER HER BABY,

607
00:55:39,876 --> 00:55:42,676
KNEELED DOWN IN THE DUST,

608
00:55:42,743 --> 00:55:45,576
TOILING OVER A LUMP OF CLAY

609
00:55:45,643 --> 00:55:48,876
TILL HE HAD SHAPED IT
IN HIS OWN IMAGE.

610
00:55:48,943 --> 00:55:52,810
THEN INTO IT HE BLEW
THE BREATH OF LIFE,

611
00:55:52,876 --> 00:55:57,743
AND MAN BECAME A LIVING SOUL.

612
00:55:57,810 --> 00:56:01,277
AMEN.

613
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:13,210
Michael: HERE HE IS.

614
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:21,309
HE.

615
00:56:26,442 --> 00:56:28,976
THANK YOU, MICHAEL.

616
00:56:47,342 --> 00:56:49,376
I STILL THINK
YOU SHOULD BE IN BED.

617
00:56:49,442 --> 00:56:52,342
LISTEN, MISTER,
WHO'S THE DOCTOR ON THIS CASE?

618
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:55,643
THAT'S RIGHT. DON'T ARGUE
WITH A SPECIALIST.

619
00:56:58,277 --> 00:57:01,376
MICHAEL, IS THAT THE BABY?

620
00:57:01,442 --> 00:57:04,143
I'LL GO SEE.

621
00:57:19,643 --> 00:57:21,076
HE WAS SNORING.

622
00:57:21,143 --> 00:57:22,409
HE WAS NOT.

623
00:57:22,476 --> 00:57:24,442
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I TOLD HIM TO TURN OVER.

624
00:57:26,709 --> 00:57:29,743
ROSEANNE...

625
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:31,609
WHEN ARE YOU GOING
TO GIVE HIM A NAME?

626
00:57:34,442 --> 00:57:36,010
SOON, I HOPE.

627
00:57:36,076 --> 00:57:38,709
WHY NOT NOW?
THIS IS AS GOOD A TIME AS ANY.

628
00:57:38,776 --> 00:57:41,210
YOU CAN'T KEEP ON
CALLING HIM BABY.

629
00:57:41,277 --> 00:57:43,676
HOW ABOUT GUTHRIE,

630
00:57:43,743 --> 00:57:45,876
OR GLENN, OR LEROY?

631
00:57:45,943 --> 00:57:47,376
YEAH, OR RALPH, OR SYLVESTER,

632
00:57:47,442 --> 00:57:49,810
OR NATHANIEL, OR GUSTAV -

633
00:57:49,876 --> 00:57:52,476
NO.

634
00:57:52,543 --> 00:57:55,743
I DON'T WANT
TO NAME HIM NOW.

635
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:58,876
I WANT TO WAIT
UNTIL I FOUND OUT AB-

636
00:57:58,943 --> 00:58:00,609
ABOUT HIS FATHER.

637
00:58:39,076 --> 00:58:41,810
DOES YOUR SHOULDER STILL HURT?

638
00:58:41,876 --> 00:58:44,243
NO, IT'S DOING FINE.

639
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:48,776
WHERE'S ERIC?

640
00:58:51,509 --> 00:58:53,709
HE TOOK THE JEEP
EARLY THIS MORNING,

641
00:58:53,776 --> 00:58:57,309
WENT OFF SOMEWHERE.

642
00:58:57,376 --> 00:58:59,543
I THINK WE BETTER TALK
ABOUT HIM NOW.

643
00:58:59,609 --> 00:59:01,776
HE SEEMS TO THINK THE FACT
HE'S SORRY SETTLES EVERYTHING.

644
00:59:01,843 --> 00:59:04,243
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
NOTHING'S SETTLED.

645
00:59:04,309 --> 00:59:07,576
MAYBE THE ANSWER IS
FOR ME TO GO AWAY.

646
00:59:07,643 --> 00:59:10,177
LOOK, WE'VE GOT TOO LITTLE
A WORLD LEFT TO RUN AWAY.

647
00:59:12,709 --> 00:59:14,143
WE'RE HERE, ALL OF US.

648
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:16,609
ERIC'S GOT TO UNDERSTAND THAT
ONCE AND FOR ALL

649
00:59:16,676 --> 00:59:17,943
AND RIGHT AWAY.

650
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:19,476
AND WHAT IF HE DOESN'T?

651
00:59:19,543 --> 00:59:21,442
THEN HE'S GOT TO GET OUT.

652
00:59:21,509 --> 00:59:23,943
DON'T YOU AGREE?

653
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:26,376
I DON'T KNOW.

654
00:59:26,442 --> 00:59:29,476
I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT.

655
00:59:41,743 --> 00:59:44,776
YOU SAID THERE CAN'T BE
ANY MORE RUNNING AWAY,

656
00:59:44,843 --> 00:59:47,976
AND YOU'RE RIGHT.

657
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:50,376
AT THE SAME TIME,

658
00:59:50,442 --> 00:59:52,943
HAVE WE THE RIGHT
TO SEND ANYONE AWAY?

659
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:56,210
ANYWAY, THE WAY
I'VE GOT IT FIGURED OUT,

660
00:59:56,277 --> 00:59:59,277
IT ISN'T ME OR YOU HE HATES.

661
01:00:01,309 --> 01:00:03,676
HE'S RIGHT, MICHAEL.

662
01:00:31,143 --> 01:00:33,876
WELL, THIS IS AN OCCASION.

663
01:00:36,876 --> 01:00:38,309
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

664
01:00:38,376 --> 01:00:39,910
ALL RIGHT.

665
01:00:39,976 --> 01:00:42,243
I BROUGHT YOU
A FEW THINGS.

666
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:43,776
THANK YOU.

667
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:47,243
I FOUND A PLACE
OVER THE RIDGE.

668
01:00:47,309 --> 01:00:51,043
SOME WEALTHY MAN BUILT HIMSELF
QUITE A BEAUTIFUL PLACE.

669
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:52,776
MANY THINGS THERE
WE COULD USE.

670
01:00:52,843 --> 01:00:54,776
WE'VE BEEN TALKING
ABOUT YOU.

671
01:00:54,843 --> 01:00:57,709
OH, IS THAT A FACT?

672
01:00:57,776 --> 01:00:59,476
I THINK I'LL GO IN.

673
01:01:04,110 --> 01:01:06,309
THANK YOU, CHARLES.

674
01:01:06,376 --> 01:01:07,810
THANK YOU FOR THE THINGS.

675
01:01:07,876 --> 01:01:10,943
NOT AT ALL. IT'S VERY NICE
TO SEE YOU UP AND ABOUT.

676
01:01:11,010 --> 01:01:12,643
THANK YOU.

677
01:01:18,609 --> 01:01:20,476
I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU.

678
01:01:20,543 --> 01:01:21,810
YES?

679
01:01:21,876 --> 01:01:24,643
I SAID WE'VE BEEN TALKING
ABOUT YOU.

680
01:01:24,709 --> 01:01:26,876
YOU'RE REPETITIOUS.

681
01:01:26,943 --> 01:01:28,442
LISTEN, ERIC,

682
01:01:28,509 --> 01:01:29,943
MAYBE WE'RE THE ONLY ONES
LEFT ON EARTH,

683
01:01:30,010 --> 01:01:31,442
AND, WELL, MAYBE IT'S TRUE

684
01:01:31,509 --> 01:01:33,243
THERE ARE OTHERS LEFT
BESIDES US.

685
01:01:33,309 --> 01:01:36,843
EITHER WAY, IT'S LIKE THE WORLD
WAS STARTING ALL OVER AGAIN.

686
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:39,442
WE'VE GOT A NEW CHANCE

687
01:01:39,509 --> 01:01:40,943
TO MAKE THE WORLD WHAT -

688
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:43,309
WHAT EVERYBODY
USED TO TALK ABOUT.

689
01:01:43,376 --> 01:01:45,743
WE'VE GOT THAT CHANCE.
LET'S MAKE THE MOST OF IT.

690
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:47,676
LET'S NOT MAKE
THE MISTAKES THEY DID -

691
01:01:47,743 --> 01:01:49,943
THE MILLIONS OF THEM.

692
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:52,177
LET'S NOT BE
AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS.

693
01:01:52,243 --> 01:01:53,676
LET'S WORK TOGETHER,

694
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:55,643
LIVE TOGETHER...

695
01:01:55,709 --> 01:01:58,409
LIKE FRIENDS.

696
01:01:58,476 --> 01:02:01,342
MAY I HAVE A CIGARETTE?

697
01:02:07,876 --> 01:02:10,243
LOOK, MICHAEL...

698
01:02:13,442 --> 01:02:15,843
WE'VE ALL BEEN LIVING
UNDER A GREAT STATE OF TENSION.

699
01:02:15,910 --> 01:02:18,476
THAT IS MY ONLY EXCUSE
FOR WHAT HAPPENED,

700
01:02:18,543 --> 01:02:20,810
BUT I THINK
IT IS A VALID ONE.

701
01:02:20,876 --> 01:02:22,709
THE TENSIONS ARE OVER.

702
01:02:22,776 --> 01:02:24,776
WHAT MORE CAN I SAY?

703
01:02:24,843 --> 01:02:27,277
I'VE GOT TO FIX
THE ROOF TOMORROW.

704
01:02:27,342 --> 01:02:28,776
WILL YOU GIVE ME A HAND?

705
01:02:28,843 --> 01:02:30,776
OF COURSE.

706
01:02:30,843 --> 01:02:32,476
DO YOU NEED HELP
UNLOADING THE JEEP?

707
01:02:32,543 --> 01:02:34,076
YES.

708
01:02:35,976 --> 01:02:37,643
I'LL GIVE YOU A HAND.

709
01:02:37,709 --> 01:02:39,110
THANK YOU.

710
01:02:39,177 --> 01:02:41,110
I'LL BE WITH YOU
IN A MOMENT.

711
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:06,076
THAT CRAZY IDIOT.

712
01:04:08,376 --> 01:04:09,810
WHY DOES HE DO IT?

713
01:04:09,876 --> 01:04:11,309
SOME PEOPLE HAVE
TO CLIMB MOUNTAINS

714
01:04:11,376 --> 01:04:13,743
TO JUSTIFY THEIR EXISTENCE.

715
01:04:18,277 --> 01:04:20,043
LET'S SIT IN THE SHADE.

716
01:04:37,177 --> 01:04:40,943
HOW ABOUT YOU?

717
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:42,910
AREN'T YOU HAPPY HERE?

718
01:04:45,509 --> 01:04:46,976
YES.

719
01:04:47,043 --> 01:04:50,476
WE COULD BE HAPPY NOW.

720
01:04:50,543 --> 01:04:53,309
I HAD SO MANY THINGS
TO SAY TO YOU, I -

721
01:04:53,376 --> 01:04:55,210
I LOST THEM ALL.

722
01:04:57,243 --> 01:04:59,409
ROSEANNE, LISTEN...

723
01:04:59,476 --> 01:05:03,576
I'M JUST AN ORDINARY GUY
WHO HAPPENS TO BE HERE.

724
01:05:03,643 --> 01:05:06,076
I THOUGHT I WAS ALONE, AND...

725
01:05:06,143 --> 01:05:08,243
IT DIDN'T MATTER MUCH.

726
01:05:08,309 --> 01:05:10,277
PEOPLE HADN'T
MEANT MUCH TO ME.

727
01:05:12,309 --> 01:05:15,976
WHEN YOU FIRST GOT HERE...

728
01:05:16,043 --> 01:05:18,910
WELL, YOU WERE JUST A WOMAN...

729
01:05:22,743 --> 01:05:26,442
BUT NOW YOU'RE ROSEANNE.

730
01:05:26,509 --> 01:05:29,110
I THINK OF YOU WHEN I WORK,

731
01:05:29,177 --> 01:05:30,609
WHEN I PLAN -

732
01:05:30,676 --> 01:05:33,943
SO MUCH I...

733
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:36,943
WANT TO DO.

734
01:05:46,243 --> 01:05:49,110
OH, MICHAEL.

735
01:05:49,177 --> 01:05:51,709
FILTHY SCAVENGERS.

736
01:05:51,776 --> 01:05:55,110
I SAW THEM IN THE CITY.

737
01:05:58,943 --> 01:06:00,910
IT'S GETTING LATE.

738
01:06:15,943 --> 01:06:18,043
IT'S CHARLES.
WHAT'S HE DOING DOWN HERE?

739
01:06:18,110 --> 01:06:20,810
THE BABY!

740
01:06:20,876 --> 01:06:23,210
CHARLES, IS THE BABY
ALL RIGHT?

741
01:06:23,277 --> 01:06:24,709
IS THE BABY ALL RIGHT?

742
01:06:24,776 --> 01:06:27,576
SURE - SLEEPING.

743
01:06:29,843 --> 01:06:31,110
ERIC?

744
01:06:31,177 --> 01:06:32,576
I SAW HIM FROM THE TERRACE.

745
01:06:32,643 --> 01:06:35,110
YOUR DEPUTY DROVE
THE JEEP THROUGH IT.

746
01:06:39,309 --> 01:06:40,743
IS HE ALL RIGHT?

747
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:42,609
YES.

748
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:48,376
HOW TERRIBLE.

749
01:06:48,442 --> 01:06:50,476
HOW DID -
ANIMAL.

750
01:06:50,543 --> 01:06:52,576
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND.

751
01:07:02,976 --> 01:07:04,409
WHY DID YOU DO IT?

752
01:07:04,476 --> 01:07:05,910
WHY DID I DO WHAT?

753
01:07:05,976 --> 01:07:07,910
CHARLES WORKED LIKE A DOG
TO MAKE IT GROW.

754
01:07:07,976 --> 01:07:09,609
WHY DID YOU DO IT?

755
01:07:13,943 --> 01:07:16,442
ALL THE FOOD
WE COULD POSSIBLY WANT

756
01:07:16,509 --> 01:07:18,910
IS IN 1,000 WAREHOUSES.

757
01:07:18,976 --> 01:07:21,910
IF THE MAN PERSISTS
IN WORKING LIKE AN ANIMAL,

758
01:07:21,976 --> 01:07:25,309
LET HIM WORK.

759
01:07:25,376 --> 01:07:28,143
I WAS TIRED.

760
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:30,043
I TOOK
THE SHORT ROUTE BACK.

761
01:07:30,110 --> 01:07:32,543
GET OUT. GET OUT NOW.

762
01:07:34,476 --> 01:07:36,309
I'LL GO...

763
01:07:36,376 --> 01:07:38,910
IN MY OWN TIME.

764
01:07:53,143 --> 01:07:55,076
IT SURE IS HOT TONIGHT.

765
01:07:58,143 --> 01:08:00,876
SURE WISH WE COULD FIND US
AN ELECTRIC DISHWASHER.

766
01:08:00,943 --> 01:08:04,010
WE'RE GOING TO GET
DISHPAN HANDS.

767
01:08:09,776 --> 01:08:11,743
I TOLD HIM TO GET OUT.

768
01:08:15,277 --> 01:08:17,576
WHAT DID HE SAY?

769
01:08:17,643 --> 01:08:19,110
HE SHOWED ME A GUN

770
01:08:19,177 --> 01:08:21,576
AND SAID HE'D LEAVE
IN HIS OWN TIME.

771
01:08:27,277 --> 01:08:29,976
HE'S SLEEPING.

772
01:08:30,043 --> 01:08:32,110
DID YOU FINISH
THE DISHES?

773
01:08:32,177 --> 01:08:34,243
ALL STARCHED AND IRONED.

774
01:08:39,643 --> 01:08:44,810
Roseanne: WHY DIDN'T ERIC
COME UP FOR DINNER TONIGHT?

775
01:08:44,876 --> 01:08:49,210
GUESS HE WENT OFF
SOMEWHERE.

776
01:08:49,277 --> 01:08:51,342
WELL, HE'LL NEVER KNOW
WHAT HE MISSED.

777
01:08:53,810 --> 01:08:54,976
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

778
01:08:55,043 --> 01:08:56,709
WAS THERE GROUND GLASS
IN THE SOUP?

779
01:08:56,776 --> 01:08:58,876
NO.

780
01:08:58,943 --> 01:09:01,376
THAT WAS
A MIGHTY FINE DINNER.

781
01:09:01,442 --> 01:09:02,576
I'M JUST SO FULL,

782
01:09:02,643 --> 01:09:06,143
I HAVEN'T GOT ANY ROOM
FOR CONVERSATION.

783
01:09:06,210 --> 01:09:08,210
GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY.

784
01:09:10,143 --> 01:09:14,143
GOOD NIGHT, CHARLES.

785
01:09:24,943 --> 01:09:27,409
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
MICHAEL?

786
01:09:30,609 --> 01:09:34,043
I WANT
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

787
01:09:34,110 --> 01:09:37,376
WHAT YOU SAID TODAY

788
01:09:37,442 --> 01:09:39,576
MADE ME VERY HAPPY,

789
01:09:39,643 --> 01:09:43,709
LIKE I USED TO BE.

790
01:09:43,776 --> 01:09:49,409
I FORGOT EVERYTHING
EXCEPT BEING ALIVE...

791
01:09:49,476 --> 01:09:51,709
BEING WITH YOU.

792
01:10:04,309 --> 01:10:06,609
OH, STEVEN.

793
01:10:34,509 --> 01:10:35,442
YES?

794
01:10:35,509 --> 01:10:36,543
IT'S ERIC.

795
01:10:36,609 --> 01:10:38,609
I'VE GOT TO TALK
TO YOU RIGHT AWAY.

796
01:10:38,676 --> 01:10:40,210
I'M VERY TIRED, ERIC.

797
01:10:40,277 --> 01:10:41,976
I'M GOING AWAY TONIGHT.

798
01:10:45,676 --> 01:10:46,609
TONIGHT?

799
01:10:46,676 --> 01:10:47,676
YES.

800
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:49,676
I'VE GOT TO FIND OUT
ONCE AND FOR ALL

801
01:10:49,743 --> 01:10:51,476
ABOUT THOSE OTHER PEOPLE.

802
01:10:51,543 --> 01:10:53,609
I OWE IT TO THEM,
I OWE IT TO MYSELF.

803
01:10:53,676 --> 01:10:54,843
WILL YOU BE BACK?

804
01:10:54,910 --> 01:10:56,776
YES, OF COURSE,
IN A FEW DAYS.

805
01:10:56,843 --> 01:11:00,277
AND THEN I'LL KNOW
ONCE AND FOR ALL WHERE WE STAND.

806
01:11:00,342 --> 01:11:01,509
YOUR HUSBAND -

807
01:11:01,576 --> 01:11:04,643
IF I FIND HIM,
I'LL BRING HIM BACK WITH ME.

808
01:11:04,709 --> 01:11:06,643
WE'RE A GROUP
OF LIVING MIRACLES.

809
01:11:06,709 --> 01:11:08,810
WHY NOT HE?

810
01:11:08,876 --> 01:11:10,976
YES.

811
01:11:11,043 --> 01:11:12,876
WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT?

812
01:11:12,943 --> 01:11:15,910
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE.

813
01:11:22,143 --> 01:11:23,876
I'LL GO WITH YOU.

814
01:11:23,943 --> 01:11:26,676
I HAVE THE JEEP PARKED
AT THE BEND OF THE ROAD.

815
01:11:26,743 --> 01:11:29,743
SHOULDN'T WE TELL?

816
01:11:29,810 --> 01:11:32,676
NO. DEFINITELY NO.

817
01:11:32,743 --> 01:11:36,143
MICHAEL - WHO KNOWS
WHAT HE WILL DO OR SAY?

818
01:11:36,210 --> 01:11:38,076
NOW WE CAN GO
WITHOUT ANY QUARRELING,

819
01:11:38,143 --> 01:11:39,376
COME BACK,

820
01:11:39,442 --> 01:11:41,210
AND THERE'LL BE
NO TROUBLE AT ALL.

821
01:11:41,277 --> 01:11:45,143
WELL, OF COURSE
YOU WILL TAKE THE CHILD.

822
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:46,076
COME.

823
01:11:46,143 --> 01:11:47,210
PACK YOUR THINGS.

824
01:11:47,277 --> 01:11:49,576
I'LL MEET YOU AT THE JEEP
IN 20 MINUTES.

825
01:11:49,643 --> 01:11:52,177
ALL RIGHT?

826
01:11:52,243 --> 01:11:54,743
YES.

827
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:56,277
GOOD.

828
01:12:33,676 --> 01:12:37,277
OH, I THOUGHT I WAS
THE ONLY ONE WHO COULDN'T SLEEP.

829
01:12:37,342 --> 01:12:38,910
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

830
01:12:38,976 --> 01:12:41,576
WHAT'S WRONG?
WHAT'S HAPPENING UP THERE?

831
01:12:54,210 --> 01:12:58,043
IT'S ALL RIGHT, DARLING.
WE'LL BE GOING SOON.

832
01:13:04,776 --> 01:13:08,110
I'M SORRY. IT TOOK LONGER
THAN I THOUGHT.

833
01:13:14,177 --> 01:13:17,943
WAS... ANYONE AWAKE?

834
01:13:18,010 --> 01:13:20,309
NO.

835
01:13:23,309 --> 01:13:26,277
WELL, WE ARE REALLY
ON OUR WAY.

836
01:14:03,776 --> 01:14:09,177
IT'S TOO BAD
YOU CAN'T DRIVE.

837
01:14:11,976 --> 01:14:14,609
LET ME SLEEP
UNTIL I WAKE UP.

838
01:15:08,776 --> 01:15:11,743
ROSEANNE!

839
01:20:51,476 --> 01:20:54,576
STEVEN!

840
01:20:54,643 --> 01:20:56,843
STEVEN.

841
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:17,442
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
GET IN, GET IN.

842
01:21:27,143 --> 01:21:31,309
YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN
WITH ME.

843
01:21:33,709 --> 01:21:35,576
I TOLD YOU.

844
01:21:35,643 --> 01:21:39,476
THE WHOLE WORLD -
A WAITING TREASURE CHEST.

845
01:21:42,210 --> 01:21:44,609
COULD WE GO NOW?

846
01:21:57,342 --> 01:22:01,076
I'LL GET SOMETHING BETTER.

847
01:22:01,143 --> 01:22:03,676
EVER THINK
YOU WOULD OWN THE WORLD?

848
01:22:03,743 --> 01:22:05,976
COULDN'T WE GO BACK NOW?

849
01:22:06,043 --> 01:22:07,543
BACK WHERE?

850
01:22:07,609 --> 01:22:09,810
YOU LITTLE FOOL.
I GOT YOU AWAY.

851
01:22:09,876 --> 01:22:11,843
YOU DON'T THINK I'M GOING
TO TAKE YOU BACK.

852
01:22:11,910 --> 01:22:13,876
I'LL GET ANOTHER CAR.

853
01:22:45,442 --> 01:22:48,210
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

854
01:22:48,277 --> 01:22:50,543
GET BACK IN THAT CAR.

855
01:22:50,609 --> 01:22:52,309
COME ON!

856
01:22:52,376 --> 01:22:54,876
STAY WITH ME AS LONG
AS I WANT YOU.

857
01:23:18,676 --> 01:23:22,943
AAH!

858
01:25:24,509 --> 01:25:32,043
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

859
01:25:42,143 --> 01:25:46,342
THERE'S NOTHING.

860
01:25:46,409 --> 01:25:49,076
THERE'S NOTHING!

861
01:27:34,776 --> 01:27:37,376
ROSEANNE!

862
01:27:37,442 --> 01:27:39,509
ROSEANNE.

863
01:27:46,676 --> 01:27:51,409
MY BABY'S DEAD.

864
01:28:11,609 --> 01:28:15,743
IF YOU COULD CRY.

865
01:29:23,476 --> 01:29:27,110
I WANT TO HELP YOU.
