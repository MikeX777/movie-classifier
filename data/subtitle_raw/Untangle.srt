1
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,671
Do you know when you dream
you're drowning?

2
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:55,841
You can't breathe
and you want to get out of it?

3
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:58,249
It's even worse in real life.

4
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:03,349
They say you see your life go by
when you're going to die.

5
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:06,559
But I could only think
of one thing.

6
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:11,556
No, hold on! Stop it.
Let's start at the beginning.

7
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:14,567
It started the day
my mom went on a trip.

8
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:21,540
Honey, the money's
in the drawer, ok?

9
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:23,007
If you need anything,
call your father.

10
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:26,409
And call me every day
like you promised, ok?

11
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,640
Actually, don't call your dad.
He is really complicated.

12
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:31,009
The paper's there,
on the fridge.

13
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,185
Better call your aunt first.

14
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:34,210
Are you listening to me sweetie?

15
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:35,879
20 days alone.

16
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:37,785
The entire house to myself.

17
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:39,159
I couldn't believe it.

18
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:44,461
And things you'll need, medicine,
grocery, all that stuff, ok?

19
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,829
I was scared to death
that she'd cancel the trip.

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,592
My mom's crazy.

21
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:52,661
I'm about to cancel.
Are you sure you'll really be ok?

22
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:55,004
I'll be fine, mom, I will.

23
00:02:56,409 --> 00:03:00,311
I trust you honey, ok?

24
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,783
I hate it when she says that.

25
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:08,146
There's always a guy
who's "the"guy.

26
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:13,390
Rafa. Do I need to say
anything else?

27
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,157
Of course he has something
to do with this story.

28
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:20,125
He looks at all the girls' asses
on the beach.

29
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,292
Do you think that's cool?

30
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,637
If he looked at mine...

31
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,198
Looks like everything's
in place.

32
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,940
If he'd only notice
that I exist!

33
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:34,541
What a drama!

34
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,215
You could try to use that.

35
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:40,781
Do you like it?

36
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:42,822
It's great for Carnival.

37
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,790
This is Caco. My best friend.

38
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:46,017
My only friend.

39
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:47,851
Look at this.

40
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:49,523
What is it?

41
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,261
Some of my mom's stuff,
I think.

42
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,596
You could sell it all
in a thrift shop.

43
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,506
You think she'll remember this?

44
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:05,939
No.

45
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,476
It's a relic.
What's this?

46
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:09,946
That's my dad's!

47
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,842
Read it for us!

48
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:16,645
"Clara, I must confess that I wasn't
that into Simple Minds..."

49
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:19,117
That concert was eons ago.

50
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:21,726
"...it was just to win you
at that concert."

51
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:22,726
How cute!

52
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,722
"Now, I listen to it
without stopping...

53
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:29,160
This tape's for you
to remember me with a soundtrack.

54
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:32,036
Kisses, Gabriel."

55
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,228
- Check it out, man.
- She sings like hell.

56
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:11,901
She is clueless.

57
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:32,924
Nice voice.

58
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,467
But you missed your stop,
we passed your school.

59
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,167
Later!

60
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:38,766
Rafa?

61
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:40,702
Rafa!

62
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,135
Driver!

63
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:16,109
- The great Tize!
- You're ridiculous, you know?

64
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:18,669
But you are... marvelous.

65
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,134
Did you take it?

66
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:24,550
I'm crazy man,
I want whoever wants me!

67
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,814
There's just one thing:
No one wants you.

68
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,547
And you're a big success,
right?

69
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,418
My business is in Alfenas.
I already told you.

70
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,452
Coutinho. What's up?

71
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,825
- Look at the time, Priscila.
- I know.

72
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:42,158
You're late! Slept more
than your bed?

73
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,203
Take a picture of her panties.

74
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:46,171
I took it, I did.

75
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,267
Look, red panties,
the color of passion...

76
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,438
Good morning, teacher Roberto.

77
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:17,658
Good morning to all.

78
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,604
Good morning!

79
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:23,073
Please take those
headphones off.

80
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,812
I'm sorry, teacher.

81
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:31,611
And you too, Tize,
turn off the cell phone.

82
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:34,016
I have a cool deal for you.

83
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:37,385
You're going to do
a quantitative research.

84
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:42,085
For this, you'll use
statistical calculus tools.

85
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:45,363
To make it more enjoyable,
cooler,

86
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:48,996
you'll choose themes you like,
current ones,

87
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:51,798
that are part
of your daily life.

88
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:55,136
Like, define the percentage
of fabric used in Tize's skirt?

89
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,844
How about calculating
the percentage of idiots

90
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,106
in our class, Boca?

91
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:03,242
Lovely exchange of compliments.
Nice to see you love each other.

92
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:07,449
But I have good and bad news
for this project.

93
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:10,483
The good one is that it will
be a group project.

94
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:14,890
The bad one is that
I'll select the groups.

95
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,626
What about democracy, teacher?

96
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,132
Democracy requires
centralized power...

97
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:21,963
and, here,
I'm the central power.

98
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,759
Think about the brighter side.

99
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:28,204
You'll build new social circles,

100
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:29,969
make new friends...

101
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,236
And who knows, even find
the love of your life...

102
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:39,110
The first group is...

103
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,449
Priscila, Carlos,

104
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:44,552
Tize...

105
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,093
She's Rafa's sister.

106
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:51,395
And João Pedro.

107
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,091
Who's João Pedro?

108
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:04,109
"What are you wearing?"

109
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:09,276
A top and really tiny shorts?

110
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:11,517
Jurema, get out of here,
please...

111
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:12,279
Boca!

112
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,744
"Little Doll"?
That's a man.

113
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,458
Boca, dude, get real.
If you're tall and got muscles,

114
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,119
she could be anything!

115
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:24,597
Jurema, you're messing
with me... Leave!

116
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,191
- I'm so scared!
- Stop it. Leave, please.

117
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:29,200
Ask her what nail polish
she uses.

118
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:32,703
Why would I ask
what nail polish she uses?

119
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,203
Because you'd find out
if it's a man or a woman.

120
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,710
Nice... Ask.

121
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,200
Calm down, Jurema.

122
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:44,573
"What nail polish do you use?"

123
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,110
She's taking too long.

124
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,656
No. She'll reply.

125
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:53,386
Yeah... he must be
googling the answer!

126
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,385
Come on, we're going
to miss the movie.

127
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,497
Now, don't leave stuff
on the keyboard!

128
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:01,089
Get out, Jurema, please.

129
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:05,367
Mom! I'm just kidding, idiot.

130
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:44,341
Sometimes I feel like
I'm at the movies.

131
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,779
I'm watching Rafa's life...

132
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,246
and he doesn't even know
I'm here.

133
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:53,215
Thank you.

134
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,785
I don't know how you
convinced me to follow this guy.

135
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:57,422
You love me.

136
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:04,855
- Look, our little princess.
- And my future sister-in-law.

137
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,989
- Keep dreaming!
- It's true.

138
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,935
That guy's looking
at you or me?

139
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,941
You know, I'm sick of this.

140
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:23,943
- Finally. Let's go?
- No. No way.

141
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:33,920
Captain's log,
Stardate 3 thousand and a ton.

142
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:37,260
Louse 1 tries to land
in the Venusian wasteland,

143
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,297
the driest place
in the universe...

144
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:42,468
But we are ambushed
by the terrible bald monster.

145
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,595
Losers, got nothing better
to do?

146
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,806
The terrible monster is angry!
Danger! Danger!

147
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:49,001
Get a girlfriend.
Get a fuck, you idiots!

148
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,134
The Venusian vulture
is really pissed off.

149
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:52,666
Next victim.

150
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,346
Attention, Mr. Suba,

151
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,915
we're being attracted
by that big black hole!

152
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:00,577
I repeat, an immense black hole.
What should we do?

153
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,417
Use the gluteus ray!
Repeating, use gluteus ray.

154
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,923
What's this?
I'll get you, punks!

155
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:10,586
You brat,
I know your mother!

156
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:14,299
The attack
of the furious laser beam.

157
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:15,595
8.

158
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:18,127
"The Payback".

159
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:40,523
Where're you heading?

160
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,925
Nowhere, I'm staying right here.

161
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:44,821
Let's leave.

162
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:46,630
No, no, honey.

163
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,364
It's now.

164
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,600
Or never.

165
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:32,904
"Rafa is pissing."

166
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,646
Just keep walking.

167
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,025
You ok?

168
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:54,527
Yeah.

169
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:56,666
Let's go in.

170
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:01,162
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

171
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:03,773
We're going. Gonna stay?

172
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,367
I'm done with this place.

173
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,275
I can't believe it.
You and my brother.

174
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:08,478
Hi, Tize.

175
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:09,844
She's in my class.

176
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:13,641
- This year's looking good, Rafa!
- Sure does.

177
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:16,148
What's your name again?

178
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,413
Relax, Priscila.

179
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:21,192
What? "Relax Priscila"?
Nice name!

180
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:23,818
It sounds like
a massage parlor.

181
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,588
Ignore them. It only gets worse.

182
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:28,292
- How about a nightcap?
- I'm in!

183
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,391
No, I'm out!

184
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:33,832
I'm in, I'm out, I'm in,
I'm out, I'm in...

185
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,037
Stop!

186
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:08,537
Now I get it.

187
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:12,410
You're the 80's girl
from the bus.

188
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,072
You don't want to go in?

189
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,353
You won't have a swim?
The water's great.

190
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,520
No. I'm afraid of the sea
at night.

191
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,257
Really? But that's why
it's good.

192
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,588
And during the day too.

193
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:34,659
I'll tell you something,

194
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:38,137
I stayed a lot on the shore.
A lot.

195
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:39,798
When the waves were big,
you know,

196
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,770
picturing myself in the wave,
catching a tube,

197
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:44,900
at the breaking of the waves...

198
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:50,639
Then, suddenly... it's real.
You're in it.

199
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:53,611
Real...

200
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:01,624
Hi. How's it going? You there?
Is everything ok?

201
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:06,659
No. I'm picturing myself
on that wave out there.

202
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,101
Or wherever you wish.

203
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,550
Pri. Where are you?

204
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:39,757
Hi, it's Clara.
I don't know if you remember me.

205
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:42,193
It all started
when I got pregnant with you...

206
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:45,131
Wrong number...

207
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,496
I have to tell you something.

208
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:18,501
Let's talk later.

209
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,441
I think it has
to happen sometime.

210
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:37,011
I think it's cool
that you're going to be the first.

211
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,049
You're a virgin?

212
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:49,293
Look, babe,
it's not gonna happen.

213
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,036
No, Rafa, you don't get it...

214
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:55,029
I get it. It's just
that I'm drunk, tired, stoned...

215
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,505
- It won't be cool for you.
- Yes, it will!

216
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,771
- Plus, it's late.
- So?

217
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:01,572
Let's talk another time, ok?

218
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:03,679
I'm gone.

219
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,783
What other time?
You're going to call me?

220
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,386
Rafa!

221
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:26,961
According to my Biology teacher,
70% of our body is water.

222
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:31,141
Would it be enough
to drown in?

223
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,099
Dude, you're really mixed up.

224
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:05,569
Why'd you say you're a virgin?
Let him find out.

225
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:07,177
I never thought he'd leave.

226
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,877
He must've thought
you'd be clingy.

227
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:12,883
Fall in love.
Then he's done for.

228
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:15,452
- Me?
- No, me. Obviously you.

229
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:16,681
And he was right, see?

230
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:19,355
Now it's impossible anything
will happen between you two.

231
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:23,118
Great, I don't have the courage
to look at him.

232
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:26,154
Caco, I want to die.

233
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:27,962
Caco!

234
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:30,895
Rafa, Letícia. Letícia, Rafa.

235
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:33,062
- How are you?
- Nice to meet you.

236
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:37,236
So, going to kill yourself?

237
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,345
Why's my brother
even talking to her?

238
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,369
Nothing in common.

239
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:47,016
My bad yesterday, I overdid it.

240
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:49,621
No, I shouldn't have said
what I did.

241
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:51,316
Rafa, you want
a ride or not?

242
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:52,889
I'm coming.

243
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,591
So... we'll talk.
See you.

244
00:19:59,131 --> 00:19:59,927
Let's go.

245
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,031
How many girls are virgins
in our school?

246
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,533
That doesn't exist, girl.

247
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,670
Of course it exists.
I personally...

248
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:07,295
I knew it!

249
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:08,999
I know a ton.

250
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,072
Like the majority of girls
in our class.

251
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:16,143
But that's not a problem,
I can help solve it.

252
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,512
You think you're so hot, right?

253
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,373
Why, is there a problem?

254
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:21,516
I don't want to flunk again, ok?

255
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,350
No one will answer that type
of question.

256
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,890
Sure they will,
if we ask properly.

257
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,552
Good idea, we can interview
at my house.

258
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:30,590
And if there're any left,
I'd serve them.

259
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,421
- Weird.
- I'm going to have nightmares.

260
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:35,801
Don't you think it's cool?
Aren't you curious?

261
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:38,804
Ok, "Relax Priscila",
count me in.

262
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:41,796
- Keep working, I'm off.
- Already?

263
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:44,068
Me too, we can think
about the questions.

264
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:47,104
How should we start?

265
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,981
Like name, age...

266
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:51,973
You look naive, but you
picked up my brother.

267
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:54,148
Thanks.

268
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:55,614
Don't cling to him, ok?

269
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:57,848
Like, I love Rafa,
but he's a real player.

270
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,588
Friendly advice, ok.

271
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:03,719
She called me a friend?

272
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:09,000
Hey, you dig Winning Eleven?

273
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,361
I prefer Sims.

274
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:15,197
Sims? The game where you
build houses, furry animals...

275
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,104
Yup.

276
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:18,502
Cool, cool.

277
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:23,738
Ok, so... Bye, dude.

278
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:25,077
I'll give it back, dude!

279
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:26,844
What? The journal?
No, I'll do it.

280
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:28,681
It's Priscila's, my friend.

281
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,689
Keep it cool,
I'll return it to her.

282
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:31,621
Boca!

283
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,216
Shit!

284
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,217
Boca, open the door, Boca.

285
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:38,953
Open up,
I want to take a shower.

286
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:40,530
Boca!

287
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:44,834
Mom! Mom!

288
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:48,461
Boca's reading dirty magazines
in the bathroom again!

289
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:51,739
Boca, open up now!

290
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:54,845
One, two...

291
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:57,038
"Virginity is not having
done something.

292
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:58,777
What've I really done?

293
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:01,887
I'm a getting wasted virgin,
all-nighter virgin,

294
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:03,582
travel by myself virgin."

295
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:06,624
"Hang-gliding virgin..."
Me too.

296
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:08,652
"Where should I start?

297
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:12,588
Rushing, fear, laziness...
I don't know.

298
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,632
Everything's so grey."

299
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:18,100
"But I think I saw a blue spot
in the sky."

300
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:21,201
"Maybe I'm just another girl.

301
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,972
But I don't want to be
just another girl."

302
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:25,675
Come on,
make up your mind!

303
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:28,110
Boca, open up now, Boca!

304
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,040
"The new Priscila's 3 wishes:

305
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:33,744
I want to feel special.

306
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,649
Like the people everyone
looks at in the street?

307
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:38,718
I want to stop being afraid
of the sea.

308
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,592
Stop dreaming about
a far-off wave,

309
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:41,752
I want to be in it.

310
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:44,293
I want someone to dedicate
a song to me.

311
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:46,290
Like my dad did for my mom.

312
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:48,092
Someone who likes me.

313
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,762
Is it possible?"

314
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:52,595
Go talk on the phone
and leave me alone, Ema!

315
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:53,660
Boca!

316
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:55,270
Jurema?

317
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:56,635
No, it's Priscila.

318
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,907
- Do you have my journal?
- Priscila?

319
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:02,677
Just a minute, wait.

320
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,051
It's ok now.

321
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:11,447
No, not yet, wait.

322
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:13,353
Now, it's ok.

323
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,255
You ok?

324
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:18,660
No, do you have my journal?

325
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:21,062
I was going to return it
tomorrow.

326
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:23,602
Ok, you can return it now.
Is it here?

327
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:26,264
What do you think I'd do with
your journal in the bathroom?

328
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:27,327
Of course not.

329
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,605
I can't believe it!

330
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:31,710
Can you lovebirds court
somewhere else?

331
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,075
No, she's not my girl...

332
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,276
My sister.

333
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:40,251
Your journal's in my room.

334
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:43,750
In my room.

335
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:45,356
Sorry.

336
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,358
Just a minute.

337
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:53,124
It's here somewhere,
let me look, one minute.

338
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:56,033
Did you read it?

339
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:58,931
Did I? I started,

340
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:01,895
but I thought it real boring
and dozed off.

341
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:05,369
I found it, here it is!

342
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,169
I found it in my bedroom.

343
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:13,673
Ok. Thank you. Bye.

344
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:16,185
See you tomorrow, Priscila.

345
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:35,100
What's up with that?

346
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:48,846
Hi, Jurema.

347
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:50,922
Boca.

348
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:54,048
Now it's your boyfriend.
Next time you open.

349
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:55,256
Come in.

350
00:24:57,462 --> 00:24:58,986
Come in, son.

351
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:02,222
Loser.

352
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:06,196
Did you fucking do her
or didn't you?

353
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:08,373
When I tell you I did,
you don't believe me.

354
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:10,475
When I say I didn't, you don't
believe me,

355
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:11,703
I dunno what to say.

356
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:14,540
Boca, I'm your friend,
you can tell me the truth.

357
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:17,081
Dude, I told you,
I didn't do her.

358
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:19,373
But I don't hide anything
from you.

359
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,853
I told you what happened
with my aunt in Alfenas.

360
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,556
Dude, don't start with that story
about your cousin again.

361
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:27,125
It's my aunt once removed.

362
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:29,685
I don't care if it's your aunt,
cousin, niece.

363
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:31,752
- Make up a better lie.
- Lie?

364
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:35,433
Dude, you don't believe me,
it sucks.

365
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:37,594
I'm not a virgin like you,
cherry.

366
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:38,931
You really wanna know?

367
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:40,532
I did it with Priscila.

368
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:43,540
I boinked her right where
you're sitting.

369
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:44,973
Now, say that again.

370
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:48,446
Dude, Priscila's a total slut,
does everything, see?

371
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:52,007
We've set a date to do it again,
but at her house.

372
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,081
- You wanna know the best part?
- Do it.

373
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:55,779
The best part is that
you're not invited.

374
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:57,079
Get lost, please.

375
00:25:57,522 --> 00:25:59,353
Shit, Boca,
you're a real asshole.

376
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:02,988
Dude, let me ask you,
do you have a home?

377
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:11,525
I come to the beach
for one reason.

378
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:13,864
Reason with name, address
and phone.

379
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:16,975
I mean, the sand itches,
I get sun burnt,

380
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:18,465
I look horrible in a bikini

381
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,003
and I said I'm scared
to death of the sea.

382
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,341
Wanna come in?

383
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:24,472
Why? Have you ever seen
me in it?

384
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:29,115
I should get a bucket so you
can get wet like the kids.

385
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:30,745
How funny!

386
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:36,385
I want to see you laugh.

387
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:38,352
Caco, stop!

388
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:59,080
And what if we did it?

389
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:05,382
What?

390
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,182
You know what!

391
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:09,652
You're joking, right?

392
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,555
Of course I am.

393
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:20,135
No, I'm not.

394
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:24,665
Caco, it's weird.
We're friends.

395
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:29,080
So, then you'd no longer
be a virgin.

396
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:31,650
No, I'm not
completely desperate.

397
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,708
Me neither.

398
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:45,195
But my mom's out of town...

399
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:46,628
Forget about it.

400
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:49,034
Caco, it was a good idea.

401
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:49,728
Was.

402
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,167
At least in theory.

403
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,169
Practice is the problem.

404
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:22,293
Listen, I'm going
to get it going, ok?

405
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,025
How's it going, excuse me?

406
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:27,602
Can I ask you
a simple question, please?

407
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:30,506
Which one of you is still
a virgin?

408
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:32,001
What?

409
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:35,143
I wanna know
if you are still pure.

410
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:38,444
Are you sick? You're crazy,
get out of here, kid!

411
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,348
I want to know which of you
pushed through, see?

412
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:43,521
Go ask your mother, shit.
What's up with this?

413
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:45,490
My mom already did,
that's true.

414
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:49,586
Idiot, get lost.
Moron. Are you nuts?

415
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:50,995
It's only a question.
Just a minute.

416
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:51,757
Just a minute.

417
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,160
Are you nuts?
Nobody'll answer it that way.

418
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:57,102
Weren't we supposed to ask
if they were virgins?

419
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:58,369
Dude, you're as subtle...

420
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:00,769
as two elephants fucking
in a china shop.

421
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:03,603
- Go ahead, ask yourself, go!
- You want me to ask them?

422
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:04,242
Go. Go then, go.

423
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:09,009
- I'm going.
- Go!

424
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:12,115
Hi, how's it going?
Excuse me.

425
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:14,151
I'm Priscila from 1102...

426
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:17,320
And we're doing a Math project
with teacher Mauro.

427
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:19,379
Would you mind answering
some questions?

428
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:23,084
Ok, what do you want to know?

429
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,421
Name, age, year.

430
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:29,826
Adriana, 16, I'm a junior.

431
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:31,160
Are you a virgin?

432
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:33,065
That's what you want to know?

433
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,003
Our project is to find out

434
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:38,201
how many virgins are
in high school.

435
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,705
I understand.
Yeah, I'm a Virgo.

436
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,774
And Scorpion's
my ascendant.

437
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:47,118
Good, really good Priscila.

438
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:50,321
Well done! Great interview!
You have a future.

439
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:52,118
No, for real.
What do we do now?

440
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:52,656
I don't know.

441
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:54,123
Now, let me do it, right?

442
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:56,151
Who are you going to interview?

443
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,592
No one. You're going
to interview me.

444
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:01,290
You wanna bet that after I do it,
everyone will?

445
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:03,197
Way to go! I'll do it too.

446
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,568
I'm not doing it in front
of you, ok?

447
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:10,096
Why not? I'm just as much part
of the group as anyone else.

448
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:12,541
I'll feel far more comfortable
with a girl.

449
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,702
Boca, it's true.

450
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,748
Yeah, Caco's gotta go too.

451
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:18,807
Neither of you, come on!

452
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,420
Couldn't you keep
your mouth shut?

453
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:29,286
Tize, 17, sophomore.

454
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:31,217
Obviously
I'm no longer a virgin.

455
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:34,532
- Ok, how old were you?
- 13.

456
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,568
What's up?

457
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:43,167
It's just that, at 13,
I still hadn't kissed.

458
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:45,469
Poor little thing.

459
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:48,808
And him?

460
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:52,545
It was my brother's friend,
as usual.

461
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:56,514
We were together forever.
Like 3 months, you know?

462
00:30:58,990 --> 00:30:59,820
Place?

463
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:04,594
Full-sized bed.
At a friend's house...

464
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:06,596
No, at his house.

465
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:13,199
Is it over?

466
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:17,202
I don't know. Is it over?

467
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:18,299
No.

468
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:22,641
So, we went to his house,
like I said...

469
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:24,504
And it was after a party...

470
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:50,941
Boca's group is really pumped!

471
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:54,906
Of course, their project's cool.
Not this shit you thought up.

472
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:57,415
Calculate how many guys
leave the toilet...

473
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,383
wiping their hands
on their pants?

474
00:31:58,383 --> 00:31:59,083
But it's cool!

475
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,381
Dude, couldn't find
anything grosser?

476
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:04,120
Quit complaining
and do the damn project.

477
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:05,883
- What's theirs?
- Virgin girls.

478
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:08,221
I bet it was Boca's idea,
that jerk off.

479
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:09,954
No, it was Priscila's.

480
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:11,863
The virgin herself? Spare me.

481
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:13,698
Ex-virgin.
What? You did it?

482
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:16,826
I know nothing. Ask Boca.

483
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:19,461
That tool boinked her
and didn't tell us.

484
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:21,027
It's a lie, can't be true.

485
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:25,439
There's more: People say she's
a slut and does everything.

486
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,307
- Everything?
- Come on. Get real.

487
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:29,039
- Slut...
- Dude!

488
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:40,856
Everything was right.

489
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:43,892
I'd already went to the doctor,
was on the pill.

490
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:46,189
And I gave up right there.

491
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:50,891
And a week later,
we'd broken up.

492
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:53,092
I'm still a virgin.

493
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:55,065
I wasn't thinking clearly.

494
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:58,776
And if I had been thinking,
it wouldn't have happened.

495
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:02,610
All my single friends
are also virgins.

496
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:03,609
It's normal.

497
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,850
Can I say how I think
it will be?

498
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:06,782
Almost...

499
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:10,752
If something happens by the end
of the month, I'll let you know.

500
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:11,749
It hurt!

501
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,480
I've been dating
for a year,

502
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:15,890
of course we already spoke
about it, but...

503
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:17,118
one day it'll happen.

504
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:19,129
It hurt like hell.

505
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:23,266
We were messing around
and suddenly...

506
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:27,136
I was no longer a virgin.

507
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:30,336
We spent a lot of time deciding,

508
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:31,739
it stressed me out.

509
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,770
And one day I pushed
and there it went.

510
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:39,743
Well, technically speaking,
I'm still a virgin.

511
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:41,819
It was funny.

512
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:43,787
We were there almost falling,

513
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:45,515
the intercom buzzing away,

514
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:48,388
and my head banging
on the table.

515
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,624
It was beautiful.

516
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:52,389
First time with a boy or a girl?

517
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:55,022
I went to Paraty with my parents
and boyfriend.

518
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:57,727
And there we had a room
to ourselves.

519
00:33:57,902 --> 00:33:58,926
So...

520
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:01,964
I don't know, see? Like...

521
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:03,433
It's not time yet.

522
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:06,136
The truth is that I took
my own virginity.

523
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:07,945
Because,
if he had to do it...

524
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:10,311
My parents thought that we'd
been doing it for a long time.

525
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:13,143
But it was there,
with them sleeping next door.

526
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:14,875
In the bathroom at a party.

527
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:17,887
It was my first time,
and the only thing I saw

528
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:21,755
was a sign saying:
"Don't throw paper in the toilet!"

529
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:30,097
Ok, you can start by saying
your name, age, year.

530
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:34,163
Leticia, 18, junior.

531
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:36,996
My first, second and third time
were at the same time.

532
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:39,166
You can see I liked it.

533
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:40,673
And you?

534
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,107
- Me?
- No, the wall.

535
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:44,816
You, of course.

536
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:48,274
Hey, and that chubby one,
is he all that?

537
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:50,650
- Who?
- Quit being naive.

538
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:52,689
Everyone's seen your video
with Boca.

539
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:53,416
What video?

540
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,218
No, it's a lie.

541
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:57,454
Yeah? And I'm a virgin.

542
00:34:58,329 --> 00:34:59,057
You are?

543
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:04,001
No, Leticia! I'm serious.
I'd never screw that nasty Boca.

544
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:04,990
Leticia!

545
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:16,646
Hey, last shot!

546
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:26,816
Ok, it's over.
Team, let's play.

547
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,892
Hey, you're playing like shit.

548
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,323
I'm world champion, respect me!

549
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:35,399
You weren't even born
when your team won that cup.

550
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:37,162
I don't talk with crybabies
about soccer.

551
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:40,135
Why are you complaining?
You do nothing.

552
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:41,899
Fuck, I made a goal.

553
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:44,976
You know what?
Priscila's making him like this.

554
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:45,910
That pale one?

555
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:48,246
That's her.
The insatiable pale girl.

556
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:50,781
You're talking shit! You don't know
what you're saying.

557
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:54,919
He's in love. How cute!

558
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:56,546
You don't you have
anything better to do?

559
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:57,918
Not really, dude.

560
00:35:58,589 --> 00:35:59,419
Hey Boca!

561
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,117
You can tell us,
we're your brothers.

562
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,026
Tell us, wait!

563
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:06,925
Dude, Priscila is a total slut.
She does everything...

564
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:09,999
We've set a date to fuck again,
but at her house.

565
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:11,361
You wanna know the best part?

566
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:13,870
The best part is
that you're not invited.

567
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:20,406
At least the editing is good.

568
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:24,879
Play it again, play it again.

569
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:27,049
You.

570
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:30,021
What the hell, Priscila?
This is the men's room.

571
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,579
So what are you doing here?

572
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:33,324
Calm down,
don't be rude.

573
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:34,926
Rude? Are you crazy?

574
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:36,951
You put it on the internet
that we screwed.

575
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,787
Ok, we didn't, right.

576
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:41,162
Ew! Obviously not.

577
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:43,059
Obviously?
What attitude is that?

578
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:45,796
I'd sure screw you,
if you want to know.

579
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:50,239
Cause I'm a super-slut
who does everything.

580
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,371
Aren't you going
to wash your hands?

581
00:36:56,914 --> 00:36:59,317
Sorry Priscila,
Amaral put it online...

582
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:01,877
- Amaral?
- But he's going to take it off.

583
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:04,478
Can't you do it somewhere else?

584
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:07,391
Great, that's all I needed.

585
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,916
Wait, you're not listening,
let me explain.

586
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:13,164
Priscila! You're not listening to me.
Stop and listen please.

587
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:14,756
- Priscila.
- Hi, Tize.

588
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:16,158
You were together in there?

589
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,327
No, I was trying to tell Priscila
what happened...

590
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,700
The site... You saw the video?

591
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:22,406
- Boca, forget it.
- What?

592
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,875
Forget it, everyone knows now.

593
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:27,070
- So, I'm trying to explain...
- Wait, is it true?

594
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:28,634
No, it's not true.

595
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:30,271
Yes, it is, Boca. We did it.

596
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,642
Did it? What?

597
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:33,684
Does your brother know?

598
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:36,645
You're joking?
Everyone knows.

599
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:37,854
You've got no idea.

600
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:38,820
How brave!

601
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:41,988
What? Did I hear right?
Brave?

602
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:43,083
Why "brave"?

603
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:47,598
So, I was thinking of camping
this weekend...

604
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,156
with Rafa and Ale,
wanna come?

605
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,902
- With Rafa?
- Camping? Cool, good idea.

606
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:54,302
No, we're not together.

607
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:55,940
I know, but we can camp.

608
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,175
- Dude, quit stalking me.
- I'm not stalking you.

609
00:37:58,175 --> 00:38:01,542
Dude, we did it once.
Never again.

610
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,474
- What are you talking about?
- Can I talk to my friend?

611
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:05,950
- Sure, but I'm just saying...
- Dude, get lost, go.

612
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:06,507
Goodbye.

613
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:07,778
What?

614
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:08,511
Goodbye.

615
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:15,055
Asshole.

616
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:17,085
What happened?
Tell me!

617
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,323
I dunno, I didn't think.

618
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:21,690
If I did,
I wouldn't have done it, see?

619
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,826
Can I ask you a question?

620
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,638
Did you use a condom?

621
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:35,169
Yeah, we did. Got to always.

622
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:37,441
Why?

623
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:43,009
Nothing. When I grow up,
I want to be just like you, bye.

624
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,015
Bye.

625
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:26,961
Hi Dad, it's me.

626
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:28,495
How are you?

627
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:31,993
Yeah, I know you exist,
that's why I'm calling.

628
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,796
So, do you have a tent?

629
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:36,834
For me.

630
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:38,833
Dad, everyone's going.

631
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:41,673
Everyone who Priscila?
Can I go too?

632
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:47,443
Dad, it's quick, just a weekend,
I'll be right back.

633
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:48,985
So, you gonna take it?

634
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:51,284
I don't know,
how many people fit?

635
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:53,424
Hi Pri.

636
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:56,927
- What people Priscila?
- At least 3, right?

637
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:57,951
Three who?

638
00:39:58,028 --> 00:40:01,259
Did you already ask your mother?
Did she let you go?

639
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:03,493
Dad, don't worry about my mom.

640
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,728
I'm not worried about her,
but about you.

641
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:06,735
Will your cell work?

642
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:08,795
Or you trust me
or I'll have to lie to you.

643
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:09,835
Good.

644
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:11,506
Whose side are you on?

645
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:15,242
It's the first time you go camping?

646
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:17,548
There's 2 sleeping bags,
a hotplate...

647
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:19,038
You don't have
to bring anything back.

648
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:21,016
- Wanna take a backgammon?
- The backgammon stays.

649
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:22,983
Not the backgammon!

650
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:27,855
What's up?

651
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,051
Good morning.

652
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:32,396
- What you got?
- Tangerines and apples.

653
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:34,261
That's exactly what I wanted.

654
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:36,333
- Can I take some?
- Yes.

655
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:37,425
Know what I can do?

656
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:40,166
Wow!

657
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:42,833
Clever girl, 'eh?

658
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:44,869
- Hi.
- Hi, honey.

659
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,900
- Let's go to the beach?
- Can I take it?

660
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:49,673
- Of course.
- Thanks.

661
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:06,928
You think you're going
to do her again?

662
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:08,823
- What?
- Shit, Boca!

663
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:11,800
Isn't that why we came
to this summer camp, dude?

664
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:14,368
No, you came here
to redeem yourself.

665
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:15,971
And she's got a name.

666
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:33,921
Look around, look around.

667
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:37,188
Only cool tents
and look at ours... a clothesline.

668
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,060
Shut up!

669
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:43,465
We're the homeless
of this beach, right?

670
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:46,070
It's the best I could do,
if you don't like it, hit me.

671
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:46,934
Ok, cool.

672
00:42:39,623 --> 00:42:40,647
Hey beautiful!

673
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:42,220
You ok?

674
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,050
Are you sure?

675
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:51,033
Scoot over a bit, thanks.

676
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,437
Beautiful sunset...

677
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:28,698
Hi, can you lend me
that flashlight?

678
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:29,701
No.

679
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:31,375
Quickly, Caco and I, we're...

680
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:32,103
No!

681
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:39,206
Fuck Boca!

682
00:43:39,483 --> 00:43:40,541
Priscila, Priscila!

683
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,224
- Here's the flashlight.
- Thank you.

684
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:56,357
If you need anything else,
Amaral and I are here to help.

685
00:43:56,433 --> 00:43:57,161
Just ask.

686
00:43:59,003 --> 00:44:00,197
Seriously, Boca.

687
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:02,131
You came here for me, right?

688
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:06,140
Who, me? Of course not.

689
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:08,333
Forget about it.

690
00:44:08,412 --> 00:44:11,006
Priscila, you never forget
your first time.

691
00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:13,743
Was it good for you?

692
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:16,146
It was so fast,
I don't remember.

693
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:19,681
Ok, cool.

694
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:23,352
So, if you want to eat,
come over, Caco's grub is ready.

695
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:25,019
- Thanks for the invite.
- No problem.

696
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:28,394
No way I'm eating Caco, man...

697
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:37,173
I left the flashlight
with your nice friend, ok?

698
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:41,330
It was about time!

699
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,741
You know when you dream
you're drowning?

700
00:45:54,852 --> 00:45:57,377
Can't breathe, want out
of the dream any way you can?

701
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:01,648
It's even worse in real life.

702
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:05,821
They say you see your life go by
when you're going to die.

703
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,261
But I could only think
of one thing:

704
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:11,432
I can't die a virgin!

705
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:42,726
You lose, dude.

706
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:45,661
What does he have that I don't?

707
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:50,396
It's true,
he doesn't have a gut.

708
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,499
At least I think she showed
some breast, dude.

709
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:54,211
Oh, dude, show me later.

710
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:56,076
This'll be a smash-hit
on Youtube.

711
00:46:58,282 --> 00:46:59,112
Or not.

712
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:10,952
It is for each one, isn't it?

713
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:14,562
- What is this?
- Take it easy.

714
00:47:15,098 --> 00:47:16,656
What? No, calm down, thanks.

715
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,392
"I never"...
The game is "I never", right?

716
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:22,695
- I'll begin, ok?
- No stuttering!

717
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:26,234
I never faked...

718
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:28,702
an orgasm!

719
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:31,942
Whoever did
has to drink.

720
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:42,893
You faked well, 'eh...

721
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:44,228
Who's next?

722
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:45,718
It's me, here I go...

723
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:48,755
I never...

724
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:51,400
I never had sex
without a condom.

725
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:57,608
I'm sick of this stupid game!

726
00:47:57,608 --> 00:47:59,343
What happened?

727
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:01,174
Great Tize.

728
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:02,708
Go talk to her, Ale.

729
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:08,777
Who's next?

730
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:10,687
It's me, me.

731
00:48:10,687 --> 00:48:14,088
- It's my turn now.
- Just go, then.

732
00:48:14,424 --> 00:48:15,823
I never...

733
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:19,793
kissed anyone
of the same sex.

734
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:27,431
She said kiss, you have to kiss.

735
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:30,532
What? I didn't see anything.

736
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:34,506
I missed!
I didn't see it!

737
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,877
Who saw, saw.
Who didn't, tough luck.

738
00:48:38,115 --> 00:48:39,582
It's my turn.

739
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,213
Now it's my turn.
I never went limp.

740
00:48:42,819 --> 00:48:43,843
That's true.

741
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,954
- Can I lie too?
- Did you?

742
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:50,661
Hey, she just said it's true.

743
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:52,595
- You acted like an ass!
- How could I have known?

744
00:48:54,831 --> 00:48:56,662
You should've noticed!

745
00:48:58,235 --> 00:49:01,830
You drop this bomb on me now.

746
00:49:01,905 --> 00:49:04,305
It's not easy for me either!

747
00:49:04,374 --> 00:49:06,774
I have to think.
I'm going for a walk.

748
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:08,867
Coward!

749
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:18,853
He acted like
it was all my fault!

750
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:22,548
Do you know what
you're going to do?

751
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:24,759
Of course not.

752
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:29,063
It might be good to see a doctor.

753
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:31,766
Now you're, like,
super-experienced?

754
00:49:37,774 --> 00:49:39,139
Your Mom's cool?

755
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:41,073
I don't know.

756
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:44,672
It'll be the 1st time
I tell her I'm pregnant.

757
00:49:44,948 --> 00:49:46,415
Mine'd kill me.

758
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:49,419
Maybe torture me first...

759
00:49:49,419 --> 00:49:51,114
You're not helping much.

760
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:54,421
Sorry.

761
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:00,186
Pri, come back.

762
00:50:00,964 --> 00:50:03,694
I don't want to sit here alone,
please.

763
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:10,639
Will it be a boy or a girl?

764
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:15,272
No, it's not anything yet.

765
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:16,770
You're tripping.

766
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:18,409
And if it were you?

767
00:50:18,782 --> 00:50:19,373
Me?

768
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:22,549
I'd cry.

769
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:25,216
A lot.

770
00:50:26,123 --> 00:50:27,454
I did that already.

771
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:39,092
How's my sister?

772
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:40,370
She's sleeping.

773
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:43,372
So, Ale went back to Rio.

774
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:45,672
Moron.

775
00:50:47,077 --> 00:50:49,944
The guy fucked up,
fucked up real bad,

776
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,548
- but...
- But?

777
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:53,038
Give the guy some time, ok?

778
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:55,819
He came here to relax
and got a shock...

779
00:50:55,819 --> 00:50:56,615
And you?

780
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,379
I use condoms, remember?

781
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:03,887
No, what did you
come here for?

782
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:08,061
To save girls in danger.

783
00:51:09,966 --> 00:51:10,796
I was foolish.

784
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:12,425
Foolish? Not at all.

785
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:14,202
You learn making mistakes.

786
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:15,830
There's no other way?

787
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:18,038
Want to teach me?

788
00:53:15,825 --> 00:53:16,760
Almost.

789
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:17,522
It's not time yet.

790
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:20,427
It hurt.
It hurt like hell.

791
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:22,532
Of course we already spoke
about it, but...

792
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:23,633
I wasn't thinking...

793
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:24,725
Suddenly...

794
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:26,903
It was perfect...

795
00:53:26,903 --> 00:53:27,927
It'll happen.

796
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:30,037
I was no longer a virgin.

797
00:53:38,582 --> 00:53:39,879
You were a virgin.

798
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:43,844
I was.

799
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:46,779
You were.
What about Boca?

800
00:53:47,924 --> 00:53:49,448
Nothing happened with him.

801
00:53:49,793 --> 00:53:51,317
This was my first time.

802
00:53:51,928 --> 00:53:54,089
You're really nuts.

803
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:58,499
No, I'm not.

804
00:53:59,102 --> 00:54:00,831
Well, I was a little with you.

805
00:54:00,937 --> 00:54:01,961
A little?

806
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:03,829
You bring me here,

807
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:06,465
you trick me, you seduce me,

808
00:54:06,543 --> 00:54:09,137
to use my body
and toss me out?

809
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:11,406
I know the type.

810
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,845
Yup, I'm a real heartbreaker.

811
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:16,950
What's wrong?

812
00:54:20,457 --> 00:54:21,185
I don't know.

813
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:24,990
Isn't this what you wanted?

814
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:28,996
Difficult question.

815
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:34,094
- Is it multiple choice?
- No, it should be an essay.

816
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:43,343
Well, they're going
to wake up soon.

817
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:45,448
Let's go back?

818
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:49,878
No, stay a little longer,
let's watch the sun rise.

819
00:54:50,086 --> 00:54:51,075
I've got to go.

820
00:54:51,755 --> 00:54:52,779
I'm all messed up.

821
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:56,190
I'm the one
who's messed up.

822
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:58,950
You knew.

823
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:02,260
I knew.

824
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:08,334
Go ahead. I'm going to stay
a little longer.

825
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:10,431
You are?

826
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:14,369
Ok, so I'm... heading off.

827
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:31,218
Are you really ok?

828
00:55:32,195 --> 00:55:32,752
Yeah.

829
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:05,894
Amaral, wake up!
Let's go dude.

830
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:08,024
Let's go, pack your bed.

831
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:09,530
I'm outta here.

832
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:16,031
You wanna know?

833
00:56:16,673 --> 00:56:17,799
Took you a while.

834
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:21,705
This clean air was starting
to make me sick.

835
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:22,642
Cool.

836
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:24,077
Take the bed.
Give it to me.

837
00:56:25,915 --> 00:56:27,109
Outta here. Let's go!

838
00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:51,104
Hey Boca, do you really think
we missed the fucking bus?

839
00:56:52,642 --> 00:56:55,202
Hey Boca! Hey fatso!

840
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:00,708
Dude, you're far away.
You're spaced out.

841
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:02,046
Amaral.

842
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,149
I need to tell you something.

843
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:06,922
You're going to be
a daddy, right?

844
00:57:07,223 --> 00:57:09,953
Going to be a dad,
I knew it.

845
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:11,618
Shit, congratulations.

846
00:57:12,395 --> 00:57:14,363
My bad. Spill it.

847
00:57:15,832 --> 00:57:17,493
I didn't sleep with Priscila.

848
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:21,264
I knew. Fuck, Boca,
I knew it, I was sure.

849
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:22,772
You lied to me.

850
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:24,239
Boca, you're a son
of a bitch, man.

851
00:57:24,307 --> 00:57:26,832
How could've I lied
if you just said you knew?

852
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:28,844
VB - Virgin Boca

853
00:57:29,245 --> 00:57:30,872
Just like AVT.

854
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:32,175
What's that, a disease?

855
00:57:32,248 --> 00:57:34,341
No. Amaral's a Virgin Too.

856
00:57:34,417 --> 00:57:35,907
Joker. Why virgin?

857
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:38,087
I already told you
about my aunt in Alfenas.

858
00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:40,857
Don't start again.
Alfenas, Alfalfa, Alfie...

859
00:57:40,857 --> 00:57:42,025
- I don't care.
- Ok.

860
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:43,253
I don't wanna know.

861
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,552
Does it have to be with Priscila?

862
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:49,697
For God's sake,
be rational, dude.

863
00:57:49,866 --> 00:57:53,700
Sophomore girls
only want older guys.

864
00:57:53,837 --> 00:57:55,304
What do you want?

865
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:57,401
Sex.

866
00:57:57,574 --> 00:57:59,599
Now you're talking, dude.

867
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:04,270
Forget that weirdo.

868
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:06,315
Pale, unloved...
Not worth it.

869
00:58:23,566 --> 00:58:24,328
Hello?

870
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:27,630
Hi, Mom.

871
00:58:29,138 --> 00:58:31,299
No, I was waiting for a call.

872
00:58:32,876 --> 00:58:33,934
From nobody.

873
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:37,472
I'm sorry. I know.
I was going to call you.

874
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:39,816
Ok, ok, ok. And you?

875
00:58:39,816 --> 00:58:40,748
And work?

876
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:42,515
How's everything?

877
00:58:42,652 --> 00:58:45,917
Are you eating your greens
and brushing your teeth?

878
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:47,149
I'm concerned.

879
00:58:49,259 --> 00:58:51,056
How much
you think they charge, Amaral?

880
00:58:51,127 --> 00:58:52,492
Let daddy fix it.

881
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:55,030
Wait, what if
they're transvestites?

882
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:57,089
You can't recognize a woman?

883
00:58:57,166 --> 00:58:59,157
There's a lot of people
who mix'em up.

884
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:00,099
C'mon, dude.

885
00:59:02,805 --> 00:59:05,137
- Four hundred.
- Fuck! That much?

886
00:59:05,942 --> 00:59:08,740
Looky here, ain't it worth it?

887
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:11,506
It is, of course.

888
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:13,309
But, we don't really have
any money.

889
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:15,015
We'll do it fast.

890
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:16,376
I bet!

891
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:18,717
Half-price for students?

892
00:59:19,155 --> 00:59:22,022
Don't pay attention,
he's a virgin.

893
00:59:22,091 --> 00:59:23,319
No, Bruna, I'm done.

894
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:25,952
I can't do charity.

895
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:29,362
I'd even do both of you!

896
00:59:29,933 --> 00:59:31,730
But you know how it is, right?

897
00:59:32,135 --> 00:59:33,469
We're working and can't.

898
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:34,766
Come on Bruna!

899
00:59:35,138 --> 00:59:37,163
Maybe later?

900
00:59:38,374 --> 00:59:39,432
Who knows?

901
00:59:39,642 --> 00:59:40,870
Come on, Bruna.

902
00:59:43,279 --> 00:59:44,871
Ah, dude.

903
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:48,848
You said you'd call.

904
00:59:49,118 --> 00:59:52,246
I know, but there was
no signal, sorry.

905
00:59:53,122 --> 00:59:54,724
Finally, the kids are asleep.

906
00:59:54,724 --> 00:59:57,591
I spent the entire weekend
without news.

907
00:59:57,727 --> 00:59:58,557
Sorry.

908
00:59:58,628 --> 01:00:00,562
Your mom calling me,
cursing me...

909
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:02,188
He even wanted
to go check, Pri.

910
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:04,290
Sorry, but nothing happened.

911
01:00:05,034 --> 01:00:05,902
Funny isn't it?

912
01:00:05,902 --> 01:00:08,404
How can someone
travel for 3 days

913
01:00:08,404 --> 01:00:10,372
and say nothing happened?

914
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:13,068
- Well, it happened, so what?
- What? Tell me!

915
01:00:13,142 --> 01:00:14,939
Dad, there are things
I won't tell you.

916
01:00:15,011 --> 01:00:17,002
What?
I'm your father, Priscila.

917
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:18,748
Why won't you tell me?

918
01:00:18,748 --> 01:00:20,579
- Honey, don't raise your voice.
- I'm not.

919
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:25,553
Priscila, you know
you can tell me anything.

920
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:27,084
Yes.

921
01:00:28,424 --> 01:00:31,484
So, what do you have to tell me
that you don't want to?

922
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:33,159
It's your turn.

923
01:00:33,229 --> 01:00:35,254
No, your turn.

924
01:00:35,431 --> 01:00:36,796
Dad, I'm not in the mood.

925
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:39,369
- Priscila,
- Dad, no...

926
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:42,405
Priscila, stop stalling me.
Spit it out.

927
01:00:42,405 --> 01:00:43,702
Dad, it's not the right time.

928
01:00:44,107 --> 01:00:46,234
That I'm no longer a virgin
for example?

929
01:00:56,886 --> 01:01:00,344
And do you love him?

930
01:01:04,527 --> 01:01:05,994
Who's winning this game?

931
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:08,657
She is, of course.

932
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:13,700
I think it's good now,
let's go!

933
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:16,364
You saw how many guys
they've been with?

934
01:01:16,472 --> 01:01:19,032
Bro, don't say that,
I'll go limp.

935
01:01:19,242 --> 01:01:20,038
Let's go.

936
01:01:20,743 --> 01:01:21,675
Oh, fuck...

937
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:23,604
Fuck.

938
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:30,119
Oh, fuck...

939
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:32,246
Another guy. Shit, let's go.

940
01:01:32,321 --> 01:01:33,456
No, wait.

941
01:01:33,456 --> 01:01:34,891
Stop, calm down.

942
01:01:34,891 --> 01:01:35,915
- Calm down.
- Get the fuck in!

943
01:01:36,325 --> 01:01:37,155
Let me go!

944
01:01:41,731 --> 01:01:42,698
Let's go, dude!

945
01:01:45,268 --> 01:01:46,860
Are you crazy Boca?

946
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:50,468
Motherfucker!

947
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,065
Brad, get the kid.

948
01:01:53,142 --> 01:01:55,511
Let's talk!

949
01:01:55,511 --> 01:01:57,877
I'll pay for it.

950
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,550
The cops,
let's get outta here.

951
01:02:05,154 --> 01:02:06,781
Brad!
Come, leave that punk.

952
01:02:15,865 --> 01:02:19,068
Bruna, I wanna go to bed!
You said it was a quickie.

953
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:20,592
Only 15 minutes more.

954
01:02:21,471 --> 01:02:23,962
We have 15 minutes.
Let's do it.

955
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:25,905
Ah, no pressure,
it'll get worse.

956
01:02:30,546 --> 01:02:31,414
What's wrong?

957
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:33,882
Are you still hurting? Bruised?

958
01:02:34,517 --> 01:02:35,950
Dude, I can't believe it.

959
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:47,056
Ah, it's ok. No problem.

960
01:02:47,396 --> 01:02:49,091
No problem for you.

961
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:50,994
You have no idea
how much I wanted it.

962
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:52,161
My bad.

963
01:02:52,869 --> 01:02:55,861
Look, what you did for me
out there...

964
01:02:55,972 --> 01:02:59,100
was better than the best sex
in the world.

965
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,372
- You think?
- I do.

966
01:03:01,844 --> 01:03:02,936
Well I don't.

967
01:03:04,013 --> 01:03:05,446
Don't be silly.

968
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:07,912
You don't understand women.

969
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:09,941
So learn.

970
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:14,354
A man can't win a girl
just in bed, understand?

971
01:03:15,992 --> 01:03:17,755
No, can you explain?

972
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:18,517
Ok.

973
01:03:18,995 --> 01:03:23,398
Look, a woman likes
surprises, romance...

974
01:03:23,666 --> 01:03:27,534
Ah. There's a girl
in my study group...

975
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:28,501
At college?

976
01:03:29,272 --> 01:03:30,398
No, in high school.

977
01:03:30,573 --> 01:03:33,041
Ok, and what do you do
to win her?

978
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:34,904
Nothing.

979
01:03:35,077 --> 01:03:36,408
Nothing?

980
01:03:37,046 --> 01:03:38,604
Well, now that is a problem.

981
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:41,884
Hello, it's Clara again.

982
01:03:41,951 --> 01:03:43,816
The person who pays
your cell phone bill.

983
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:46,222
Your phone will be cut off

984
01:03:46,222 --> 01:03:48,053
if you don't contact me.

985
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:50,853
I repeat:
Your phone will be cut off.

986
01:03:51,427 --> 01:03:55,056
Honey, I'm worried
and angry too, ok?

987
01:03:55,131 --> 01:03:56,063
Kiss, bye.

988
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:23,159
SO THAT YOU
DON'T FORGET ABOUT ME

989
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:25,457
Hi... Like the tape?

990
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:28,690
I loved meeting you,
you crazy little thing.

991
01:04:28,764 --> 01:04:31,961
It was the 1st time
a woman stripped for me.

992
01:04:33,269 --> 01:04:35,066
Let's do it all again?

993
01:04:35,238 --> 01:04:38,765
I promise I'll drink less
and make it more enjoyable.

994
01:04:38,841 --> 01:04:39,603
What does he mean?

995
01:04:39,675 --> 01:04:42,576
No pressure, but did you break up
with that loser yet?

996
01:04:42,678 --> 01:04:43,702
Hurry up.

997
01:04:45,748 --> 01:04:48,683
Mrs. Clara...
Wow!

998
01:05:06,702 --> 01:05:09,102
Jurema, is there someone
at the door?

999
01:05:09,171 --> 01:05:11,605
Just me, Mom.
I came to get the paper.

1000
01:05:13,142 --> 01:05:14,769
Your brother up yet?

1001
01:05:15,711 --> 01:05:18,281
Boca, well, Boc...

1002
01:05:18,281 --> 01:05:19,839
The remote's yours.

1003
01:05:20,283 --> 01:05:21,045
Not enough.

1004
01:05:22,685 --> 01:05:24,277
The remote and the computer.

1005
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:25,955
Mom...

1006
01:05:25,955 --> 01:05:26,853
For 3 months.

1007
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:31,987
Forever, Jurema, forever!
Let me go please?

1008
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:36,263
Boca's in the bathroom, Mom.

1009
01:05:36,332 --> 01:05:38,300
Taking forever as usual.

1010
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:39,927
I spoke with my mom.

1011
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:41,334
Tell me!

1012
01:05:41,871 --> 01:05:42,860
It was weird.

1013
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:45,508
She followed me
around the house asking,

1014
01:05:45,508 --> 01:05:47,109
"Where did I go wrong?"

1015
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:49,873
And me: "I was the wrong one".

1016
01:05:50,413 --> 01:05:51,175
Crazy.

1017
01:05:52,415 --> 01:05:56,511
Conclusion: She cried, I cried,
we both sat there crying.

1018
01:05:56,652 --> 01:05:57,448
And Ale?

1019
01:05:59,889 --> 01:06:02,687
I don't know him anymore.
Asshole.

1020
01:06:04,827 --> 01:06:06,351
Know who really supported me?

1021
01:06:07,029 --> 01:06:08,656
- No...
- Was super cool with me?

1022
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:09,893
Rafa.

1023
01:06:10,933 --> 01:06:12,730
My brother
never treated me so well.

1024
01:06:13,903 --> 01:06:16,269
Yeah? What else?

1025
01:06:17,173 --> 01:06:18,162
And you guys?

1026
01:06:20,376 --> 01:06:22,401
I don't know, we had sex.
That's all.

1027
01:06:22,712 --> 01:06:23,701
That's all?

1028
01:06:23,846 --> 01:06:25,973
Leticia is breathing fire at school.

1029
01:06:26,048 --> 01:06:27,606
Well, but she has a reason.

1030
01:06:27,883 --> 01:06:30,078
She's no saint, I know.

1031
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:34,817
- And?
- I don't know. Why?

1032
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:36,519
Nothing.

1033
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:40,688
No, it's not
that important to me.

1034
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:45,958
Of course you're in love.

1035
01:06:46,736 --> 01:06:48,135
He could've called.

1036
01:06:48,704 --> 01:06:50,194
- You see him?
- No.

1037
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:53,232
Caco, what do I do?

1038
01:06:53,409 --> 01:06:55,172
Why don't you get
professional help?

1039
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:56,971
You don't listen
to anything I tell you.

1040
01:06:57,279 --> 01:06:59,406
- Hey, what's with you?
- Nothing.

1041
01:07:03,152 --> 01:07:04,210
A ton of things.

1042
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:05,216
Forget it.

1043
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:06,080
No.

1044
01:07:06,989 --> 01:07:08,786
Can you understand
without me speaking?

1045
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:09,855
Can you?

1046
01:07:13,095 --> 01:07:15,086
Did you know
I thought you liked me?

1047
01:07:16,665 --> 01:07:17,825
But I like you.

1048
01:07:18,134 --> 01:07:19,999
Like a friend. Hot or cold?

1049
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:23,201
Hot, but I thought
it was something else.

1050
01:07:23,272 --> 01:07:24,102
Ah, me too.

1051
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:25,568
Stop!

1052
01:07:27,576 --> 01:07:33,310
And now, suddenly, you're starting
to look at guys in a different way.

1053
01:07:33,649 --> 01:07:34,274
Cold.

1054
01:07:36,285 --> 01:07:38,719
Come on, you don't want
to play the game?

1055
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:40,283
Lukewarm.

1056
01:07:43,993 --> 01:07:45,153
Nothing happened and...

1057
01:07:47,096 --> 01:07:47,858
You think?

1058
01:07:48,531 --> 01:07:49,793
Sometimes.

1059
01:07:50,466 --> 01:07:51,865
Look, we're close, right?

1060
01:07:52,768 --> 01:07:53,598
Of course.

1061
01:07:57,540 --> 01:07:58,939
Is it to make someone jealous?

1062
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:00,500
Look who's coming.

1063
01:08:03,979 --> 01:08:04,877
What do I do?

1064
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:06,339
Call him.

1065
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:07,006
Yeah?

1066
01:08:09,485 --> 01:08:10,144
Thank you.

1067
01:08:12,021 --> 01:08:14,824
What is it? Who is it?
It's a woman?

1068
01:08:14,824 --> 01:08:16,559
A girl, another pussy,
eh dude?

1069
01:08:16,559 --> 01:08:17,389
Hi, Julia.

1070
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:24,294
Let's go?

1071
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:29,461
- Check it out.
- What?

1072
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:46,180
What's wrong, dude?

1073
01:08:47,056 --> 01:08:49,149
I just ran faster than you.

1074
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:19,082
Good morning,
ladies & gentlemen,

1075
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:22,090
I could be robbing,
stealing, killing,

1076
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:24,490
but I'm selling candy,
3 for R$1. Sir?

1077
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:59,024
Hey Boca,
you have no idea who's coming.

1078
01:09:59,395 --> 01:10:02,626
No need to knock, you're family.

1079
01:10:02,965 --> 01:10:05,798
What's up?
Why the long face?

1080
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:24,652
Priscila,
this is for you.

1081
01:10:24,787 --> 01:10:27,347
You're traffic-stopping pretty.
Really, it's for you.

1082
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:38,394
"It's the first time
that I write to you."

1083
01:10:48,477 --> 01:10:49,171
Thank you.

1084
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:55,517
"Now I'm hiding,
but I can see you from here."

1085
01:10:55,517 --> 01:10:58,782
Priscila! Priscila!

1086
01:10:59,822 --> 01:11:01,153
This here's for you.

1087
01:11:03,192 --> 01:11:05,285
"I only wanted
to make your wish come true."

1088
01:11:52,007 --> 01:11:55,272
- She's digging it.
- Cool, you're lucky!

1089
01:12:03,552 --> 01:12:04,450
Who's there?

1090
01:12:04,586 --> 01:12:06,645
What do I say?

1091
01:12:06,789 --> 01:12:07,687
Rafa?

1092
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:11,289
Rafa, is that you?

1093
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:24,134
- "Rafa"!
- Man, I can't believe it, bro!

1094
01:12:30,913 --> 01:12:32,312
I WANT TO SEE YOU!

1095
01:12:35,451 --> 01:12:39,444
I did all this for Prince Charming
to get that pale girl!

1096
01:12:39,621 --> 01:12:41,088
Gimme a break, dude.

1097
01:12:41,156 --> 01:12:43,624
You want me to attack that bitch
with my laser?

1098
01:12:45,227 --> 01:12:46,660
100% confirmed?

1099
01:12:46,729 --> 01:12:47,718
Aye, Captain.

1100
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:51,396
Fire the fuck away!

1101
01:13:08,016 --> 01:13:10,348
Hi Mom, OK.

1102
01:13:10,686 --> 01:13:13,052
I'm not going to cheat
on a boyfriend that I don't have...

1103
01:13:13,122 --> 01:13:17,149
stripping for some drunk
I just met at a rock concert.

1104
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:19,085
Mom?

1105
01:13:21,597 --> 01:13:25,192
Ok, I love you too.
Big kiss.

1106
01:14:04,807 --> 01:14:05,899
I like.

1107
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,132
I was on that wave
and remembered you.

1108
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:09,228
What wave?

1109
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:12,330
That tube far off.

1110
01:15:14,943 --> 01:15:16,410
Crazy talk!

1111
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:31,187
Hey, you want a sip?

1112
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:33,894
No, I'm not so good now.

1113
01:15:39,768 --> 01:15:41,759
Crazy woman,
wanna dance?

1114
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:44,266
No, later.

1115
01:15:47,276 --> 01:15:48,868
Leave later for later.

1116
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:08,924
Hey girl, you need a life jacket?

1117
01:17:41,189 --> 01:17:42,622
Bye, angel...

1118
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:46,691
Enjoy class.

1119
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:52,830
It was true!

1120
01:17:52,901 --> 01:17:55,028
Did you see that?

1121
01:18:02,344 --> 01:18:03,242
Priscila!

1122
01:18:06,448 --> 01:18:08,507
- I found a place.
- You did?

1123
01:18:08,583 --> 01:18:10,073
Yeah, but I'm not sure
I have the courage.

1124
01:18:10,986 --> 01:18:12,476
- Bye.
- Bye.

1125
01:18:18,927 --> 01:18:22,522
Tize, Tize!
Hold on there.

1126
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:24,132
- Tize...
- Ale, get lost!

1127
01:18:24,132 --> 01:18:26,828
- Calm down.
- I don't want to talk to you.

1128
01:18:26,902 --> 01:18:28,267
Stop. Get lost!

1129
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:30,370
Tize is free
but the defence is closing in.

1130
01:18:30,505 --> 01:18:32,405
Goes to the right,
but the defender tackles her.

1131
01:18:32,474 --> 01:18:35,444
She tries to go left,
but is blocked by the other team.

1132
01:18:35,444 --> 01:18:37,241
The game's very difficult,
very hard.

1133
01:18:37,312 --> 01:18:39,648
Yeah, the game's really tough.

1134
01:18:39,648 --> 01:18:42,048
Looks like Ale's
going to counter-attack.

1135
01:18:42,451 --> 01:18:43,543
Back to you, Boca.

1136
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:47,823
Tize makes a foul,
but the ref doesn't see it!

1137
01:18:47,823 --> 01:18:50,192
Ale defends, holds her back.
The game goes on.

1138
01:18:50,192 --> 01:18:51,090
He's close to the goal.

1139
01:18:51,159 --> 01:18:57,232
Is it a goal? It is...
Goooaaaaallll!

1140
01:18:57,232 --> 01:18:59,132
Tize-ze-ze Zero.

1141
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:01,459
Ale-le-le one.

1142
01:19:01,536 --> 01:19:03,561
Ale-le-le one, you're right.

1143
01:19:06,141 --> 01:19:06,698
Bye.

1144
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:13,980
Please, stop that, please.

1145
01:19:15,016 --> 01:19:16,506
Ok, you can start.

1146
01:19:19,187 --> 01:19:23,283
So, almost half the girls
in High School are still virgins.

1147
01:19:23,458 --> 01:19:26,188
We interviewed up to last week.

1148
01:19:26,261 --> 01:19:27,956
And we also worked
with a margin of error,

1149
01:19:28,029 --> 01:19:29,053
'cause folks lie.

1150
01:19:29,131 --> 01:19:30,860
Like, a lot!

1151
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:33,624
And some data might have changed,
life goes on.

1152
01:19:34,970 --> 01:19:39,669
So, of the 120 interviewed,
about 70 lost their virginity...

1153
01:19:42,244 --> 01:19:44,508
Will I still remember him
in 20 years?

1154
01:19:47,415 --> 01:19:49,076
Of course I will.

1155
01:19:50,685 --> 01:19:53,176
But will it be
so important?

1156
01:19:54,823 --> 01:19:56,154
I don't know
if the time was right.

1157
01:19:56,224 --> 01:19:58,749
I don't know if there's
a right or wrong time.

1158
01:20:00,495 --> 01:20:04,659
That's losing your virginity,
it happens.

1159
01:20:08,069 --> 01:20:09,468
The best comes later.

1160
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:52,408
Great, great, everyone.
Very cool.

1161
01:20:52,581 --> 01:20:53,682
I'll only give the grade...

1162
01:20:53,682 --> 01:20:57,049
after all the projects
are presented, ok?

1163
01:20:57,719 --> 01:21:00,347
Where is our comrade
João Pedro?

1164
01:21:00,922 --> 01:21:01,889
Where's Boca?

1165
01:21:05,927 --> 01:21:08,157
Golden eagle
to pink lil' elephant.

1166
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:11,199
The target's in the vehicle
as planned.

1167
01:21:11,566 --> 01:21:12,897
Good luck, soldier!

1168
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:26,012
Driver!

1169
01:21:26,648 --> 01:21:27,512
Driver!

1170
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:38,927
Ladies and gentlemen,

1171
01:21:38,927 --> 01:21:40,724
sorry to interrupt
the quiet of your trip.

1172
01:21:41,062 --> 01:21:44,088
I could be stealing, killing,

1173
01:21:44,633 --> 01:21:46,100
but I'm playing the guitar.

1174
01:21:47,135 --> 01:21:49,603
I've brought a song here...

1175
01:21:50,171 --> 01:21:54,335
that I dedicate
to someone special.

1176
01:21:56,611 --> 01:21:58,875
Priscila, this is for you.

1177
01:22:04,286 --> 01:22:06,618
Where does it start?

1178
01:22:06,688 --> 01:22:09,452
Which way does the rush go?

1179
01:22:09,524 --> 01:22:12,594
When all was grey,
I started to see

1180
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:14,696
a blue spot in the sky

1181
01:22:14,696 --> 01:22:20,100
When it was all grey,
I started to see

1182
01:22:20,502 --> 01:22:24,438
I want to stop
being afraid of the sea

1183
01:22:24,506 --> 01:22:29,842
stop dreaming
about the far-off wave

1184
01:22:31,012 --> 01:22:36,382
One day,
I want someone to dedicate

1185
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:40,285
a song to me

1186
01:22:40,355 --> 01:22:42,057
Is it possible

1187
01:22:42,057 --> 01:22:44,793
- I think he's kinda cute.
- So cute!

1188
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:50,629
That someone
likes me so much?

1189
01:22:50,699 --> 01:22:55,966
Is it possible

1190
01:22:56,037 --> 01:23:01,100
that you now like me?

1191
01:23:01,176 --> 01:23:07,604
Is it possible

1192
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:11,519
that someone like you
likes me?

1193
01:23:11,519 --> 01:23:16,791
Is it possible

1194
01:23:16,791 --> 01:23:21,854
like that, someone likes me?

1195
01:23:22,063 --> 01:23:23,997
Give me a chance

1196
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:29,768
Thank you!

1197
01:23:35,577 --> 01:23:36,566
Can I sit there?

1198
01:23:42,751 --> 01:23:44,582
Hey, kiss him!

1199
01:23:44,886 --> 01:23:46,979
Don't worry, he's 12 years old.

1200
01:23:48,323 --> 01:23:49,620
I love it when you laugh.

1201
01:23:53,795 --> 01:23:55,626
I love it when you make me laugh.

1202
01:23:58,833 --> 01:24:08,731
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss!

1203
01:24:27,095 --> 01:24:29,290
There, it's in the right place.

1204
01:24:32,567 --> 01:24:33,625
And you, Boca,

1205
01:24:34,269 --> 01:24:35,702
what is your biggest wish?

1206
01:24:39,507 --> 01:24:40,371
A pen.

1207
01:24:42,544 --> 01:24:43,408
A pen?

1208
01:24:44,245 --> 01:24:45,041
A pen.

1209
01:24:46,047 --> 01:24:48,345
Fine, I'll go get a pen for you.

1210
01:25:37,098 --> 01:25:39,566
Honey, honey, I'm home.

1211
01:25:41,736 --> 01:25:42,760
Priscila!

1212
01:26:47,835 --> 01:26:50,395
"Mom, before you kill me,

1213
01:26:50,638 --> 01:26:52,538
remember you were 16 once.

1214
01:26:54,108 --> 01:26:56,201
Kisses, your beloved daughter."

1215
01:27:10,358 --> 01:27:12,952
Stop! Stop! Stop, dude!

1216
01:27:13,027 --> 01:27:14,927
Don't turn the lights on yet.
Relax.

1217
01:27:15,129 --> 01:27:17,529
Leave it off for people
to read the credits.

1218
01:27:17,599 --> 01:27:20,735
Let's enjoy
the romance in the air.

1219
01:27:20,735 --> 01:27:22,828
And let everyone kiss.

1220
01:27:22,904 --> 01:27:26,340
Exchange some spit.
Hug and cuddle, right?

1221
01:27:29,711 --> 01:27:30,905
"Cuddle"? Seriously?

1222
01:27:31,012 --> 01:27:34,243
Jim Kerr?
From Simple Minds?

1223
01:27:34,449 --> 01:27:35,245
Hi.

1224
01:27:35,950 --> 01:27:38,350
Hi. I only exists
because of you?

1225
01:27:38,519 --> 01:27:46,153
My mommy and may father met
on a concert of you in Rio in 1988?

1226
01:27:47,729 --> 01:27:48,753
Did you remember?

1227
01:27:48,863 --> 01:27:52,264
We never forget that we've
been in Brazil.

1228
01:27:52,367 --> 01:27:54,562
Because it was magic for us.

1229
01:27:54,669 --> 01:27:57,171
It was the first time
we1ve been in the country.

1230
01:27:57,171 --> 01:27:59,833
Na the boys of Glasgow,
you grow up listening...

1231
01:27:59,907 --> 01:28:06,247
that Brazil is a magical,
place to go for.

1232
01:28:06,247 --> 01:28:09,478
- What is your mommy's name?
- Her name is Clara.

1233
01:28:09,550 --> 01:28:10,881
I would like to dedicate...

1234
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:13,079
"Don't You Forget About Me"
to Clara.

1235
01:28:13,755 --> 01:28:14,779
Everybody!

1236
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:56,714
