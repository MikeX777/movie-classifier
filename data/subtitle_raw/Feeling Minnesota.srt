1
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,974
Hello. I'm Johnny Cash.

2
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:20,510
Good evening.

3
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:23,917
Feels good tonight.

4
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,426
Jjaks, go and get ready.
Your dad's coming.

5
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:41,133
Ifell into a burnin'
ring of fire

6
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,175
Went down, down, down

7
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:45,336
And the flames went higher

8
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:48,142
And it burns, burns, burns

9
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,704
The ring of fire

10
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:51,410
Why do I have to go
with my father?

11
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:54,647
Because Sam came first...

12
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,279
you came second...

13
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:01,659
so...
I might as well keep the first.

14
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:06,158
Bound

15
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,290
All right, ready?

16
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:10,131
One, two, three.

17
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:11,261
Paper beats rock.

18
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:13,965
Ifell into a ring of fire

19
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,977
Ifell into
a burnin' ring of fire

20
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:20,137
Went down, down, down

21
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:22,340
One, two, three.

22
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,677
Scissors beats paper.

23
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,650
And it burns, burns, burns

24
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:28,186
The ring of fire

25
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,222
The ring of fire

26
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:36,028
The Memphis Horns
and the Tennessee 3.

27
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,570
The taste

28
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,631
Of love is sweet

29
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:51,677
I don't want to go
with my father.

30
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:53,041
Get out.

31
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,081
When hearts like ours meet

32
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:00,018
Ifellfor you like a child

33
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:03,648
All right, again.
One, two... Yes!

34
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:05,418
Rock beats scissors.

35
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:08,086
But the fire went wild

36
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:11,062
Ifell into a burnin'
ring of fire

37
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,325
Chicken.

38
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:14,195
Went down, down, down

39
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:16,258
And the flames went higher

40
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:18,634
And it burns, burns, burns

41
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:19,672
The ring of fire

42
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:23,599
The ring of fire

43
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:26,611
And it burns, burns, burns

44
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,977
The ring of fire

45
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:31,141
The ring of fire

46
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,116
Got you! You're dead!

47
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:40,718
I'll show you whether I'm dead.

48
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,451
Ifell into a burnin'
ring of fire

49
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,656
Went down, down, down

50
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,096
Get off of me!

51
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,633
And the flames went higher

52
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,691
And it burns, burns, burns

53
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:50,963
The ring of fire

54
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:52,436
Aw, shit!

55
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,235
The ring of fire

56
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:58,141
And it burns, burns, burns

57
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,475
The ring of fire

58
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,071
The ring of fire

59
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,520
See you.

60
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:29,266
Come on!

61
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,142
Fuck you, Red!

62
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:42,483
Fuck you, too, baby!

63
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:06,509
World's going to think your head
blowing apart is a backfire.

64
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,047
Don't miss.

65
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:12,881
Forget about it, Red.
I'm not marrying him.

66
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:14,283
That's the deal you made.

67
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:16,549
Fuck the deal.

68
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,147
Fuck you!

69
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:27,498
I would hit you in the face,
but it's your wedding day.

70
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:30,058
You get the fuck up...

71
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:32,161
before you ruin
that nice dress even more.

72
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:33,500
Think you can make
a fool out of me...

73
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,473
stealfrom me
and just walk away?

74
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:38,533
You lucky you got
a nice piece of ass.

75
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,045
Otherwise...

76
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,548
I don't even want
to think about it.

77
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,208
You going to marry
that little fucker Sam...

78
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,118
and you going
to cook and clean...

79
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:50,451
and you going to suck his cock
every once in a while.

80
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:51,615
Do you want to know why?

81
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,960
'Cause that's the worst thing
I can think to do to you.

82
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:04,034
Now fix yourself up pretty
because people are waiting.

83
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,232
You want to fight me?

84
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,537
Go fuck...

85
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,645
I changed my mind.
Bill...

86
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:26,289
Stay right here.
Be right back.

87
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,404
Yo, Red. Red, how you doing?

88
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,972
Yeah, what?

89
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,407
Shake hands.
Go get a job, man.

90
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:45,569
Got one?

91
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,340
Come on.

92
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:50,348
That was good. I like that.

93
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,646
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Ruby.

94
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,015
My favorite cop.

95
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,022
Yeah, what?

96
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,718
I took care of that
little problem for you.

97
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:01,325
You might want to go away
for a couple of days...

98
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:03,225
go fishing or something.

99
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,422
All right.

100
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:12,570
- How'd we do this week?
- Good, boss.

101
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:17,636
I don't know. It looks like
it could've been better.

102
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,180
Good... Business is good.

103
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,087
Every day is payday.

104
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:44,033
That's a nice tux, Sam.

105
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:46,594
What's this?

106
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:50,934
The American dream, huh?

107
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,069
Yeah. Why not?

108
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,205
Hey, why not?

109
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,650
Get going, buddy.

110
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:08,986
Well...

111
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:11,521
There she is...

112
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,532
Your Christmas bonus...
a few months early.

113
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,127
You're a beautiful girl,
Freddie.

114
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:23,340
Ifeel bad the way you turned up
in this bad crowd situation.

115
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:25,036
It's a shame.

116
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:29,109
If ever you want a way out,
just...

117
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,083
give me a call.

118
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:33,982
You know? Maybe I can help.

119
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,317
Fuck you.

120
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:41,087
God. She's beautiful.

121
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:45,130
She was beautiful yesterday.

122
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,967
Yeah, but today, she's mine.

123
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:55,507
What are youfucking looking at?

124
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,338
Let me ask you something, Lloyd.

125
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,072
Why are you
such a fucking wick, huh?

126
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:20,562
All passengers
should be onboard.

127
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:55,563
I wonder if your brother
is going to show up.

128
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:56,966
Jjaks.

129
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,402
Who invited him?

130
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:00,870
I told him it wasn't right...

131
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,272
if he didn't come
to his brother's wedding.

132
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:08,075
But, please, if he comes,
try and get along with him.

133
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:10,012
Sam, I'm talking to you.

134
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:12,073
What if she doesn't come, Mom?

135
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:13,913
Will you stop eating?

136
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,989
I didn't take your money.
I told you that!

137
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,083
You embarrass me, little girl.

138
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,390
Sir, sit down right here.

139
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,160
Come on, Freddie,
make it easy on yourself.

140
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,405
Come on, get in the spirit.

141
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,305
Straighten up.

142
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,933
Hope you two kids
will be very happy.

143
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,965
Dearly beloved...

144
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,940
we are gathered here
in the sight of God...

145
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,067
to witness and bless...

146
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,201
Hi, Mom.

147
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:47,040
the joining together
of Sam and Freddie...

148
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,013
Jjaks, you came.

149
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,173
How nice.

150
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,343
What's the story?

151
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,753
They make a nice couple,
don't they?

152
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,685
No, they don't.

153
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,523
Behave yourself, Jjaks.

154
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,529
But that is the portion
in this life...

155
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,564
What did you get them?

156
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:08,930
Whisper it to me.

157
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,332
When it is God's will...

158
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,268
Come on.

159
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,432
Nothing, Mom.
I didn't get them nothing.

160
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,534
Knowledge
and love of the Lord...

161
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:21,011
Therefore, marriage
is not to be entered into...

162
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,674
unadvisedly or lightly.

163
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:26,547
You showed up empty-handed.

164
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,552
And in accordance...

165
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:31,283
What is the matter with you,
Jjaks?

166
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,619
Into the holy union...

167
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:36,594
Sam and Freddie
now come to be joined.

168
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,497
Here we go. I love this.

169
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,039
When somebody loves you

170
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:51,008
It's no good
unless he loves you

171
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,009
All the way

172
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:58,283
Happy to be near you

173
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,319
When you need someone
to cheer you

174
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:05,355
All the way

175
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:11,891
Can I get a beer?

176
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:16,224
I just want to get
the fuck out of here.

177
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:19,695
Thanks.

178
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:25,536
Who are you?

179
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:27,306
Jjaks.

180
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:29,641
Jack?

181
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:30,647
No, Jjaks.

182
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:33,085
Jjaks?

183
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,979
- Jjaks what?
- Clayton.

184
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,357
You're not related to him,
are you?

185
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,692
Sam's my brother.

186
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:50,491
I don't know who's worse off,
you or me.

187
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,240
Me.

188
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,449
Are you shy?

189
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,581
No.

190
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:12,351
He ain't heavy.

191
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:14,187
He's my shithead brother.

192
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:18,256
You didn't have to get
all dressed up, you know?

193
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,463
What were you in for
this time, huh?

194
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:29,307
My brother likes to spend
his free time in prison...

195
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,240
isn't that right, Jjaks?

196
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,709
Whenever I can get away.

197
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:38,481
This is my new wife Freddie.

198
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:47,492
Come on.

199
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,289
Chicken.

200
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:54,593
Come on.

201
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,036
Scissors beats paper.

202
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:05,076
Come on.

203
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,479
Paper beats rock.

204
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:11,140
OK?

205
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:12,184
Come on.

206
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:17,911
Shit!

207
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,515
Rock beats scissors.

208
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,499
God!

209
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,162
Fuck!

210
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,503
She's a knockout, isn't she?

211
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:44,511
So you won the game,
I won the girl.

212
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,354
I can't believe
you even showed up.

213
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:56,394
Especially without a present.

214
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:04,668
Nice tux, Sam.

215
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:20,651
I'm going to go pee.

216
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:26,091
They

217
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:28,649
Asked me how I knew

218
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:33,461
My true love was true

219
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,012
A little to the left.

220
00:15:50,047 --> 00:15:51,644
A little to the right.

221
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,648
Bull's-eye!

222
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,903
Did you come for me?

223
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,068
I don't even know you.

224
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,440
No! Did you come for me?

225
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,969
Did you?

226
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:06,618
You got to shave, baby.
You're ruining my skin.

227
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:18,597
Jesus.

228
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,234
I look like shit.

229
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:23,965
Don't I look like shit?

230
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:26,874
Yeah, I do.

231
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:29,140
I'm getting old.

232
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:32,650
You're not even, what,
twenty-five?

233
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,982
I'm closer to thirty
than to twenty.

234
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,958
I used to be seven years old.

235
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,994
I used to be unborn.

236
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,588
I used to be fourteen.

237
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:50,226
And tomorrow
I'll be forty orfifty.

238
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,302
So?

239
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,603
I'm dying.

240
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:59,610
I'm dying. You're dying.

241
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:03,238
Right now, we're both dying.

242
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:05,112
Listen to the ticking.

243
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:09,552
It gets louder
with every second.

244
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:15,391
I don't want to die here.

245
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,395
You should just split.

246
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:18,896
Really?

247
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,194
You think those guys are just
gonna let me walk away?

248
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:27,436
They haven't yet.

249
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:32,933
See? They did this to me.

250
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:35,172
- Jesus.
- Yeah, Jesus.

251
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:41,642
Red says that
I owe him ten grand.

252
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,984
He says that I stole it
from him.

253
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:45,148
It's bullshit.

254
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:50,593
He found it on the books.
Your damn brother did.

255
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:52,220
So, there it is.

256
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,665
I'm his reward.

257
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,435
He's my punishment.

258
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:03,836
Fuck them anyways.

259
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,416
Fuck them anyways.

260
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:30,268
See you out back?

261
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:47,284
You see a pair
of laughing eyes

262
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:50,981
And suddenly
you're sighing sighs

263
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:52,683
You're thinking nothing's wrong

264
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:55,587
You string along, boy, then snap

265
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:59,628
Those eyes, those sighs

266
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,895
They're part of the tender trap

267
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:06,199
It'll always turn to shit.

268
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:13,635
Not only don't you bring
a gift...

269
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,078
you don't even say good-bye.

270
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:21,347
Those dreams that dream

271
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,218
They're part of the tender trap

272
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:28,359
Some starry night

273
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:32,363
When her kisses make you tingle

274
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:35,366
She'll hold you tight

275
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:37,994
And you'll hate yourself
for bein'...

276
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,439
Empty the cash.

277
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:20,034
Come on, come on!
Move it, move it, move it!

278
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,707
Jjaks? Jjaks, is that you?

279
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,314
Damn it.

280
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,180
Just give me the money.

281
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:29,220
You wouldn't shoot me,
would you?

282
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:32,356
I'm not gonna shoot you.

283
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:45,494
Sorry, Bob.

284
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:06,288
In my life

285
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:09,691
There's been heartache and pain

286
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:15,298
I don't know
if I can face it again

287
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,301
Can't stop now

288
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,303
I've traveled so far

289
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:21,168
It's a candy dish.

290
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:23,332
Congratulations
on your marriage.

291
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:25,343
Good-bye.

292
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:37,346
Don't leave me.

293
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:47,965
I'm sorry.

294
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:51,969
Mommy!

295
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,268
- Oh, my God.
- Is she all right?

296
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:05,282
You...

297
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,284
You killed her.

298
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:33,035
You show up to my wedding
after no one invites you.

299
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:34,908
Mom invited me.

300
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,311
Get her all upset...

301
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:38,906
so she faints and dies
just like that.

302
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:40,611
Maybe it was you who upset her.

303
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:43,916
Me? Not me.
I was herfavorite!

304
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:46,355
She didn't send me off packing
when I was eight!

305
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:52,958
Stupid.

306
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:57,926
Hey, Freddie.

307
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:00,561
Sorry.

308
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:03,267
So how is married life
treating you?

309
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,277
That good, huh?

310
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:12,311
Hey, can I bum one of those?

311
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:17,013
Thanks.

312
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,685
Sorry about your mother, boys.

313
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:25,897
Mine died about six years ago.

314
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,330
Worstfuckin' day of my life.

315
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:31,301
I need a word with you, Jjaks.

316
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:33,303
Why? Huh?

317
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:35,339
What did he do this time?

318
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,303
Christ!
What did you do thatfor?

319
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:42,437
Tell me about the gas station
you knocked off.

320
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:45,483
I got a captain crawling
up my ass for an answer...

321
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:48,314
so I'm gonna take
a little refuge up yours.

322
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:50,411
Now that old guy, Bob...

323
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:54,186
he didn't see you,
but he heard you, right?

324
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,261
It's always something
when you show up.

325
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:05,233
It's notfinished
between me and you, Jjaks.

326
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:06,634
Just want you to know that.

327
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:23,678
I can't sleep.

328
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:26,152
It's cold in here.
Want another blanket?

329
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,889
Did you stay for me?

330
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,268
I stayed to bury my mother.

331
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:44,168
Tomorrow?

332
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:45,709
I'm taking off.

333
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:56,969
I know you've been
thinking about me.

334
00:25:57,004 --> 00:25:59,519
'Cause I've been
thinking about you.

335
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:03,527
And when I do...

336
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,359
I can feel you inside me.

337
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,060
You want to be
inside me again, Jjaks?

338
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:15,095
We shouldn't.

339
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:16,572
Again.

340
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:59,176
I thought I told you to shave.

341
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,376
Sorry.

342
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:16,260
Have you ever
been to Vegas, Jjaks?

343
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,965
It's the best.

344
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,031
I went there when I was little
with my mom.

345
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,276
We met Ann-Margret.

346
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:30,280
Man, she was the coolest.

347
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:32,282
I mean, she was like...

348
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,046
Like a kitten with balls,
you know what I mean?

349
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:39,321
She gave me this.

350
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:44,960
She signed her picture
and gave me this.

351
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:48,332
It's supposed to bring me luck.

352
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:53,602
Let's just go.

353
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:58,340
Let's just start this thing up
and get out of here.

354
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:02,903
I can't.

355
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:05,506
Why? Why can't you see?

356
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,608
Maybe all this shit happened
with me, with you...

357
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,119
with your mom dying...

358
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,121
Maybe it happened
so we'd end up together.

359
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,918
I can't.

360
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,357
If you leave me here
with these bastards...

361
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:19,090
I swear you're a biggerfucker
than they are.

362
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:20,859
Don't you see?

363
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:24,060
Itfeels too good.

364
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:27,127
It's gonna turn to shit!
I just can't!

365
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:45,148
Come on. I can make you happy.

366
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:48,192
- Don't touch me.
- I can't sleep.

367
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:49,624
I'm not in the mood.
Get off of me.

368
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:51,286
For Christ sakes, Freddie.
You're my wife.

369
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:54,092
- I want to make love.
- I don't want it!

370
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:58,295
- Let me...
- No, it hurts.

371
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:00,271
Don't push me away. Please.

372
00:29:00,306 --> 00:29:01,966
Sam, stop.

373
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,201
It hurts like that.
Come on. Get off me!

374
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:06,175
But itfeels good like that.

375
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,655
It's great out here.

376
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:22,291
Waitfor me. Come on.

377
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,422
Right over there.

378
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:58,989
What are you doing back here?

379
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:01,554
I got a car waiting outside.

380
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,197
For me?

381
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:09,469
You came back for me?

382
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:14,336
Where are we going?

383
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:20,482
What are you doing?

384
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,951
I'll be back in a minute.

385
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:06,997
Do you believe
in love atfirst sight?

386
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,893
Me neither.

387
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:17,141
It came with the car.

388
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:38,963
They're gonna be lookingfor me,
you know.

389
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:42,956
I know.

390
00:31:57,782 --> 00:32:00,478
How young are you?

391
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:02,883
How old am I?

392
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:06,287
Let's count the rings

393
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:08,689
Around my eyes

394
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:17,567
How smart are you?

395
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:20,604
How dumb am I?

396
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:23,368
Don't count any

397
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,308
Of my advice

398
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:27,605
Meet me

399
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,169
- Anyplace
- Anywhere

400
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:31,408
Or anytime

401
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:33,040
Now, I don't care

402
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,641
Meet me tonight

403
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:48,530
Let me speak to Red orJoseph.

404
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:52,001
Look, I don't care
what time it is.

405
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,671
OK, I'm sorry.

406
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:56,401
Just give me the...

407
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:03,314
I gotta turn my life around.

408
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:05,679
I gotta do things different.

409
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:08,249
So is this doing things
differently...

410
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,310
running off
with someone else's wife?

411
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,320
You can't look at it like that.

412
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:17,286
I mean,
look at it like this...

413
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:19,887
Time is like...

414
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:22,699
an orange.

415
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:26,302
It's round.

416
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:28,896
It means that everything
repeats itself.

417
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:33,239
And everything that happens
happens for a reason.

418
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:38,383
Lieutenant Ben Something.

419
00:33:38,418 --> 00:33:40,351
Some...

420
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:42,352
Costikyan! Yes!

421
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:44,911
Yes, just leave a message.

422
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:46,923
No, I don't need
to speak to anybody!

423
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:48,822
Just leave a message, OK?
Thanks.

424
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:53,629
The big promise I made myself...

425
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:56,599
was that I'd never spend
another day in prison.

426
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:58,658
Not one.

427
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:00,567
You want to know the truth?

428
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:02,469
You want to avoid prison?

429
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,371
Quit sticking up gas stations.

430
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:07,673
What I'm talking about
is different.

431
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:11,939
I'm just saying go home
one last time and get the money.

432
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:13,176
We have a little cash.

433
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:15,515
I gotfifty bucks
stuffed in my underwear...

434
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:19,044
and you've got enough
to springfor this swell place?

435
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:22,490
We left in a hurry, Jjaks.
We forgot.

436
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,494
- I know, but...
- Come on.

437
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:27,156
We're almost there.

438
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,165
Almost.

439
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:33,226
It's like, if I close my eyes...

440
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:36,465
I can see us in Vegas...

441
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:38,975
lying by a pool...

442
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:41,534
with water in it.

443
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:45,648
It's always sunny and warm.

444
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:50,651
And guys in white jackets
bring us daiquiris...

445
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:53,281
and all the food we can eat
forfour bucks.

446
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:59,724
And all the towels smell
like Downy fabric softener.

447
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:02,889
There's no clocks, no bedtime...

448
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:05,197
and when I get going there...

449
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,169
you can come see me
perform at night.

450
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:09,934
I'd be wearing
big redfeathers...

451
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:11,599
one of those things
on my head...

452
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:14,543
like crown things,
with diamonds in it.

453
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:19,911
When I come offstage
I'd be too wired to sleep...

454
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:22,680
so we'll make love
until morning...

455
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,047
sleep until 2:00.

456
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:46,443
It's half my money, Jjaks,
right?

457
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:48,445
I'm his wife, right?

458
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:50,276
It's the law.

459
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:54,712
He kept saying that he
was gonna make me happy...

460
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:58,217
that he had all this
money stashed away.

461
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:01,122
So after everything...

462
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:02,921
let him make me happy,
Jjaks.

463
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:07,594
I just don't know
where he hides it.

464
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,867
What?

465
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:26,379
You know where, don't you?

466
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,645
Do you?

467
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:30,414
Look at me.

468
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,683
You told me to call, Ben.

469
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:40,253
Nothing.

470
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:42,554
He's back.

471
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:44,060
Alone.

472
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:04,307
I spend my whole life trying
not to come back here.

473
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:07,374
I always end up
coming back here.

474
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,351
Where's Freddie?

475
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,911
Why don't I just
put the money back...

476
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:14,958
and really never come back?

477
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:18,086
So you and my wife
can live happily ever after?

478
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:20,357
That sounds like
a really good dealfor me.

479
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:23,025
We're gonna go at it,
aren't we, Sam?

480
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,068
Big time.

481
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:35,237
Shit!

482
00:38:57,234 --> 00:38:58,599
Bastard.

483
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:13,974
Shit.

484
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,088
You bastard! You piece of shit!

485
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,191
Take a little refuge up yours.

486
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:50,207
Jeez. You need a doctor?

487
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:53,182
I need a tank of gas.

488
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:56,185
Justfill it up.
Where's your can?

489
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:45,094
Hello.
I just saw a cop get beat up.

490
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:49,367
Ben... Ben Costi-hoo!
Costikyan.

491
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,601
Yes, I did. Jjaks Clayton.

492
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:54,735
I don't know. He just
beat the hell out of him.

493
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:56,970
He might be dead. Yes.

494
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:59,538
One-eighty-two Goodrich.

495
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:01,915
That's right. I don't...

496
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:39,012
Stop! That's my horse!

497
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:40,716
Clementine!

498
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:29,173
Hi, honey. I'm home.

499
00:43:29,208 --> 00:43:30,572
What happened?

500
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:33,405
- I got him good.
- You need a doctor.

501
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:34,967
No. I hate doctors.

502
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:37,513
I always throw up
around doctors.

503
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:42,478
Shit. I can't believe this.

504
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:45,386
Look. This is what he did.

505
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:46,980
Christ.

506
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:49,252
I hung on to the sucker, though.

507
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:51,089
My God, that is disgusting.

508
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:53,026
I don'tfeel good.

509
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:54,962
Let me help you, OK?

510
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:56,363
I need to lie down.

511
00:43:56,433 --> 00:43:58,594
Yeah, you should lie down.

512
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:00,660
You sure you know
what you're doing?

513
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:02,872
Be quiet.

514
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,235
You know how to operate this?

515
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,400
Look at that.

516
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:19,552
Isn't that your horse?

517
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:24,684
I didn't mean for this
to happen, Jjaks.

518
00:44:24,928 --> 00:44:25,986
I'm so sorry.

519
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:38,197
I'm afraid to ask.

520
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,272
What?

521
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:45,346
Did you get the money?

522
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:49,284
You think this is the best time
to discuss finances?

523
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,446
It's my last chance, Jjaks.

524
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,282
Yeah.

525
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:00,255
I got it.

526
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:19,942
That's what Ifound.

527
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:23,178
He's got more than this.
He said so.

528
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:26,668
- I don't understand.
- It's enough.

529
00:45:26,703 --> 00:45:30,084
We can check out of here
and go...

530
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,684
in the morning.

531
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:36,963
What are we gonna do?
This was our last chance!

532
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:39,298
They're gonna find us
andfucking kill us!

533
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:40,529
How could you
let him get to you?

534
00:45:40,604 --> 00:45:43,437
I didn't let him get to me.

535
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:44,940
Let go of me!

536
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:46,100
I counted on you, Jjaks!

537
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:48,542
- Hey, shut up in there!
- You shut up!

538
00:45:48,612 --> 00:45:51,410
You shut the fuck up!

539
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,715
Is everything
all right in there?

540
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:00,651
What's going on?

541
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:02,324
Where are the car keys?

542
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:04,519
I'm gonna call the cops!

543
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:07,359
I'll get you some help.

544
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:11,367
Show's over, so crawl
back into yourfucking hole.

545
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:11,730
All right.

546
00:46:21,678 --> 00:46:22,940
Hi, Freddie.

547
00:46:23,013 --> 00:46:25,982
- Where's Red and Joseph?
- It's just me.

548
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:28,483
Let's go for a drive.

549
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:30,110
Come on.

550
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:32,212
Come on, I want to talk.

551
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,655
Come on, drive.

552
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,125
You don't need that gun.

553
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:48,899
You gotta be reasonable
about this.

554
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,341
This wasn't meant to be.

555
00:46:51,376 --> 00:46:52,535
You know?

556
00:46:55,746 --> 00:47:00,206
I'm sure
there's lots of girls...

557
00:47:00,284 --> 00:47:03,344
I guess, who...

558
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:06,218
would be just rightfor you.

559
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:16,022
Let's talk about it.

560
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:18,659
It was supposed
to be a surprise...

561
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:20,392
but I can tell you now.

562
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:23,268
I sent half the money already.

563
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,274
Not a down payment,
but half of it.

564
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:26,900
You would...

565
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:32,615
You'd laugh if you knew how hard
it was to get this money.

566
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:35,208
Red'd shit his pants.

567
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:37,884
Look.

568
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:44,054
This is the model right here.
It's nice.

569
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:47,187
It's 2,700 square feet.

570
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:49,528
Central air and heat.

571
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:53,195
It's got cable
with fifty-seven channels...

572
00:47:54,338 --> 00:47:55,703
a two-car garage...

573
00:47:55,939 --> 00:47:59,272
and look, a swimming pool
with tennis courts...

574
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:01,402
and a park, you know,
that they're building.

575
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:04,311
I can't breathe.

576
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,611
Don't open the fucking door!

577
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:16,256
Look, I know that your dream
is to live in Vegas...

578
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:18,590
but this is close to Vegas,
but better.

579
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:22,564
It's like a real neighborhood.

580
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:25,566
We have a choice.

581
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:27,297
Look what it says here.

582
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:33,640
"Eggplant or ecru"
for the carpeting.

583
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:36,943
Is that a color?

584
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:40,347
I don't know. I guess.

585
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:44,982
Eggplant.

586
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:59,191
And how many children
should we have?

587
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,073
Two.

588
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,112
You're a liar.

589
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:49,469
Can I get a Coke...

590
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:51,507
and a Hostess cupcake?

591
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:52,701
Sure.

592
00:51:54,744 --> 00:51:57,645
One of those sweatshirts, too.

593
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:00,514
Here.

594
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:31,673
What are youfamous for?

595
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:36,478
I don't know.

596
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:39,283
That was a nice horse you had.

597
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:40,414
What?

598
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,424
You know.

599
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:45,592
Yeah, thanks.

600
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:48,495
So, did you call the cops?

601
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:50,658
No. Why? Did you?

602
00:52:50,734 --> 00:52:53,396
No. It wasn't my horse.

603
00:53:24,267 --> 00:53:26,292
Shoot.

604
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:34,033
Could I use your phone?

605
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:37,102
I'm sorry. We can't tie it up.

606
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:40,081
Tie it up?

607
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:45,013
- Who's gonna call?
- Sorry.

608
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:25,622
There's trouble in there.
A murder!

609
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:27,287
I saw the guy.

610
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:31,531
My name?

611
00:54:37,674 --> 00:54:39,107
Shit.

612
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:56,152
Jesus.

613
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,126
Oh, shit.

614
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:50,502
This is
the manager of the motel.

615
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:52,104
The police are here.

616
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,343
They want to have a look
around your room.

617
00:55:54,417 --> 00:55:57,682
Whatever you got going in there,
get rid of it.

618
00:55:57,754 --> 00:55:58,880
I ain't in the mood
to have the place busted.

619
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:08,996
So, what's going on?

620
00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:10,464
Well, let's find out.

621
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,107
I just spoke to him.

622
00:56:22,345 --> 00:56:24,609
I'm sorry.
I was in the bathroom...

623
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:26,911
and my wife is sleeping.

624
00:56:26,983 --> 00:56:28,350
Please, let's whisper.

625
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:30,546
She's come down
with some sort of flu.

626
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:44,132
Poor thing was throwing up
all night.

627
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:48,967
She justfell asleep
maybe ten minutes ago.

628
00:56:49,038 --> 00:56:51,506
What happened to you?

629
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:56,705
My stupid brother and me.
We got drunk.

630
00:56:56,946 --> 00:56:58,174
It was stupid.

631
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:08,321
- What's this?
- What?

632
00:57:08,391 --> 00:57:10,359
There's blood here on the sink.

633
00:57:12,328 --> 00:57:14,853
From my head.
He got me pretty good.

634
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:16,193
But I got him better.

635
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,631
Where is your brother?

636
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:19,429
Kicked his ass back home.

637
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:21,436
I came to visit, right?

638
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:23,495
He gets drunk
and all bent out of shape.

639
00:57:23,573 --> 00:57:25,234
Who needs that, right?

640
00:57:25,308 --> 00:57:26,639
Where is home?

641
00:57:26,709 --> 00:57:32,045
About half an hour
outside of St. Paul.

642
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:33,582
Let's go.

643
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:38,320
Why don't you come on outside?

644
00:57:43,426 --> 00:57:45,587
Come on out here for a second.

645
00:57:45,662 --> 00:57:47,687
Just need to talk to you.

646
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,899
You ever been in any trouble?

647
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,298
Not really.

648
00:57:52,368 --> 00:57:53,630
Maybe a little.

649
00:57:53,703 --> 00:57:56,672
You got a record?
Figured as much.

650
00:57:56,739 --> 00:57:58,570
You staying out of trouble?

651
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:01,872
Yes, sir.
I've got my life and my wife.

652
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:04,379
That's all a man needs
to turn things around.

653
00:58:06,382 --> 00:58:08,247
Yeah, well...

654
01:00:06,636 --> 01:00:08,263
I'm sorry, Freddie.

655
01:01:16,305 --> 01:01:17,431
And?

656
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:19,475
What...

657
01:01:19,542 --> 01:01:22,511
I got an emergency call,
come on!

658
01:01:22,578 --> 01:01:27,447
Life is one big emergency,
man, so fuck off.

659
01:01:29,252 --> 01:01:31,277
Some asshole. I don't know.

660
01:01:47,103 --> 01:01:50,004
Am I given to understand
you killed Freddie Clayton?

661
01:01:50,073 --> 01:01:51,404
Is that true?

662
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:56,671
Is that a yes or a no?

663
01:01:56,746 --> 01:01:59,510
It doesn't matter because
your brother here...

664
01:01:59,582 --> 01:02:01,413
says he knows where
you stashed the body.

665
01:02:01,484 --> 01:02:03,975
And if that's true,
that's a very sad thing...

666
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:05,987
because that was
a beautiful girl...

667
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:08,489
with her whole life
ahead of her!

668
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:12,685
Son of a bitch.

669
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:17,593
I liked that girl.

670
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:25,431
Kind of a stupidfucking name
is that, anyway?

671
01:02:30,012 --> 01:02:30,944
What?

672
01:02:31,047 --> 01:02:32,346
It was supposed to be Jack...

673
01:02:32,381 --> 01:02:35,612
but they fucked up
his birth certificate.

674
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:37,218
No, yeah!

675
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:40,347
A stupidfucking typo.

676
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:42,356
That's all your life
amounts to, huh?

677
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:55,333
It's here somewhere.

678
01:02:55,404 --> 01:02:56,928
Where?

679
01:02:59,408 --> 01:03:01,205
He must've did something
with it.

680
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:03,677
Sure you got the right spot?

681
01:03:03,913 --> 01:03:05,141
Well, there's nothing here.

682
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:07,682
Don't point out the obvious.
It's fucking annoying.

683
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:09,680
No, he moved her.
You did something.

684
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:12,387
Where is she?

685
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:14,252
Come on!

686
01:03:14,323 --> 01:03:16,291
Hey, hey! Jesus!

687
01:03:16,359 --> 01:03:20,056
You think I've got the time
to fool around?

688
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:22,529
You remember I'm a cop!

689
01:03:22,598 --> 01:03:24,532
People depend on me.

690
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,568
I'm here to serve and protect.

691
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:28,968
I don't have the time
to fuck around...

692
01:03:29,038 --> 01:03:30,699
with a couple of fucking losers
like you!

693
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:32,306
But I saw it!

694
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:34,002
How do you know she's here?

695
01:03:34,076 --> 01:03:35,907
Maybe it's up the road
or something.

696
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:39,004
This is it. This is the spot.

697
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:41,914
I'm telling you what I saw!

698
01:03:44,086 --> 01:03:46,316
I don't think so.
Youfind your own way back.

699
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:48,016
You can't just leave me
out here.

700
01:03:48,124 --> 01:03:49,716
I can't, huh?

701
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:24,255
Gimme a light, asshole.

702
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:39,697
So what went wrong?

703
01:04:41,277 --> 01:04:43,507
She make you mad?

704
01:04:43,579 --> 01:04:45,240
Come on, you can tell me.

705
01:04:45,314 --> 01:04:48,647
What did you do with her body?
You know I know.

706
01:04:48,751 --> 01:04:51,948
People know she didn't
want to be with you.

707
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:54,455
And people know
you let those motherfuckers...

708
01:04:54,523 --> 01:04:56,684
write that on her arm,
you bastard!

709
01:04:56,759 --> 01:04:59,193
- I didn't tell 'em to do it!
- Who did?

710
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:01,694
She was my wife!

711
01:05:01,729 --> 01:05:04,127
Forfourfucking days!

712
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,168
So?

713
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:07,964
Wasn't conventional.

714
01:05:08,037 --> 01:05:10,028
We didn't meet at the prom.
So what?

715
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:12,506
So why couldn't
she love me anyway?

716
01:05:17,113 --> 01:05:19,877
You know I didn't have
any reason to kill her...

717
01:05:19,949 --> 01:05:21,314
but you did!

718
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:24,911
I can't remember anything,
but you were there, right?

719
01:05:24,987 --> 01:05:26,386
Maybe.

720
01:05:44,674 --> 01:05:46,509
Where's the body?

721
01:05:46,544 --> 01:05:48,977
Kiss my ass.

722
01:05:49,045 --> 01:05:52,310
Hey, you set me up.

723
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:56,618
Only if you're setting me up.

724
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:13,102
So, was it love or just...
with Freddie?

725
01:06:13,137 --> 01:06:14,194
Fuck off.

726
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:20,238
A good blow job feels like love
every time, right?

727
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,452
Shit!

728
01:06:42,264 --> 01:06:42,889
I'm not letting you
out of my sight.

729
01:06:43,566 --> 01:06:45,056
Notfor a minute.

730
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:47,068
That's fine with me.

731
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:53,675
Where you going?

732
01:06:59,715 --> 01:07:00,579
Don't answer it.

733
01:07:06,389 --> 01:07:07,879
Who is it?

734
01:07:13,095 --> 01:07:14,653
Tell my brother
what you just told me.

735
01:07:14,897 --> 01:07:15,864
Who is it?

736
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:18,161
Just take the phone.

737
01:07:21,937 --> 01:07:23,564
That's right, Mr. Clayton.

738
01:07:23,639 --> 01:07:27,939
What my wife saw the other night
made me sick.

739
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:31,411
One of you carrying
that woman...

740
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:34,108
her body... into the room...

741
01:07:34,183 --> 01:07:36,117
and then the other one
carrying her out.

742
01:07:36,185 --> 01:07:37,618
I think you know what I mean.

743
01:07:37,686 --> 01:07:40,655
Fifty thousand dollars
ought to do it.

744
01:07:42,992 --> 01:07:46,018
I don't want to be hard,
'cause you got problems...

745
01:07:46,095 --> 01:07:48,120
but I'd really like
the money by morning...

746
01:07:48,197 --> 01:07:50,563
or I'll have to go
to the police.

747
01:07:50,633 --> 01:07:52,567
Sorry for the inconvenience.

748
01:07:56,372 --> 01:07:58,169
Did you hear what he said?

749
01:08:00,543 --> 01:08:03,410
He said...

750
01:08:03,479 --> 01:08:07,074
one of us carried her body
into the room...

751
01:08:07,149 --> 01:08:09,640
and one of us carried her out.

752
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:16,323
I only carried her out.

753
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:21,655
I mean, I couldn't remember.

754
01:08:24,533 --> 01:08:26,091
You bastard!

755
01:08:26,168 --> 01:08:28,033
You let me think it was me!

756
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:30,971
Look, it doesn't matter
who killed her, right?

757
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,907
I mean, he saw me
and he saw you...

758
01:08:33,976 --> 01:08:35,910
It matters!

759
01:08:36,011 --> 01:08:38,070
I loved her!

760
01:08:39,348 --> 01:08:41,316
Well, don't worry now.

761
01:08:41,383 --> 01:08:43,248
You did the right thing
calling me.

762
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:46,254
I'll take care
of everything, OK?

763
01:08:46,322 --> 01:08:50,383
But you gotta
take care of me, too.

764
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:58,432
Listen to me, asshole,
this is what's gonna happen.

765
01:08:58,467 --> 01:09:00,992
You buried me in this shit,
and you're gonna dig me out.

766
01:09:01,103 --> 01:09:02,627
You're gonna give me the money.

767
01:09:02,872 --> 01:09:05,432
- What money?
- To pay that motel guy off.

768
01:09:05,508 --> 01:09:07,203
There is no money.

769
01:09:07,276 --> 01:09:08,971
You lying sack of shit!

770
01:09:09,044 --> 01:09:11,638
I don't have it anymore!

771
01:09:11,881 --> 01:09:13,940
It's gone!

772
01:09:14,016 --> 01:09:16,644
I bought a house!

773
01:09:16,886 --> 01:09:19,047
Half a house.

774
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:23,319
Near Vegas for Freddie and me.

775
01:09:23,392 --> 01:09:25,917
We're supposed to have a house.

776
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:27,963
A house?

777
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:31,431
You bought a house?

778
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,161
Get up!

779
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:39,931
What are we going to do
with a fucking house?

780
01:09:42,912 --> 01:09:44,573
You're gonna get that money!

781
01:09:44,647 --> 01:09:46,979
Wait! Wait!

782
01:09:49,151 --> 01:09:50,880
I got it. I got it.

783
01:09:55,624 --> 01:09:57,558
This is what we do.

784
01:09:59,495 --> 01:10:02,464
We go to where
you hid her body...

785
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:06,092
and we dispose of it
once andfor all...

786
01:10:06,168 --> 01:10:08,932
where nobody can find it
in a thousand years.

787
01:10:10,072 --> 01:10:12,506
Then we don't have
to pay nobody nothing. See?

788
01:10:14,143 --> 01:10:16,304
You idiot!

789
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:17,310
What?

790
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:19,939
I never moved her body.

791
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:30,721
How could you lie to me
about that?

792
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:37,362
You ate my ear...

793
01:10:37,433 --> 01:10:39,628
you killed your wife,
youframed me...

794
01:10:39,702 --> 01:10:43,103
and you're mad at me for lying?

795
01:10:57,653 --> 01:11:00,679
Jesus, what kind of sicko
would take a dead body?

796
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:13,034
My head...

797
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:14,569
You really hurt my head.

798
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:16,103
Shut up.

799
01:11:20,576 --> 01:11:24,034
Better pray I calm
this motel guy down while...

800
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:26,047
I go to Red's
and ask him for the money.

801
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:28,174
Ask him?

802
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:29,217
Beg him.

803
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:31,719
Bear his fucking children
if you have to.

804
01:11:38,727 --> 01:11:40,024
You better take this.

805
01:11:40,095 --> 01:11:43,064
I don't need it.
I don't want any more problems.

806
01:11:43,165 --> 01:11:45,497
We're talking
about serious stuff here.

807
01:11:45,567 --> 01:11:47,728
You might need it just
to reason with the guy.

808
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:51,667
You don't have to shoot him
unless you absolutely have to.

809
01:11:55,044 --> 01:11:56,443
Good luck.

810
01:11:57,579 --> 01:11:59,240
Fuck off.

811
01:12:11,093 --> 01:12:13,323
Always burning the midnight oil,
as they say.

812
01:12:13,395 --> 01:12:16,023
Jesus Christ.
This is unbelievable.

813
01:12:16,098 --> 01:12:17,656
I was just about
to come to see you.

814
01:12:17,733 --> 01:12:19,257
Here you are.

815
01:12:21,704 --> 01:12:23,433
I should come back later.
You're busy.

816
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:24,972
No, I'm finished.

817
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:28,032
This adding and subtracting
shit you do is hard.

818
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:31,307
It's very hard.

819
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:33,405
I don't pay you enough.

820
01:12:33,482 --> 01:12:35,347
Yeah, well...

821
01:12:35,417 --> 01:12:37,351
What did you want
to see me about?

822
01:12:39,421 --> 01:12:41,116
It can wait.

823
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:43,681
Naw, it can't.

824
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,048
Well...

825
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:13,044
I'm in kind of a fix, you know?

826
01:13:17,693 --> 01:13:21,094
I was gonna see
about borrowing...

827
01:13:21,163 --> 01:13:22,528
some money, maybe.

828
01:13:22,631 --> 01:13:24,963
You want more money?

829
01:13:27,569 --> 01:13:30,506
You think you can fuck
with my books...

830
01:13:30,541 --> 01:13:31,666
and I won'tfind out?

831
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:34,231
Who the fuck are you?

832
01:13:34,309 --> 01:13:36,436
I didn't take nothin', I swear!

833
01:13:38,447 --> 01:13:40,972
OK, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

834
01:13:43,185 --> 01:13:45,085
I want it all back.

835
01:13:45,154 --> 01:13:47,486
I'm gonna break
yourfucking legs anyway...

836
01:13:47,556 --> 01:13:50,616
but you are going
to give me back every dime...

837
01:13:50,692 --> 01:13:54,059
and every seed of every joint
you ever smoked of mine...

838
01:13:54,129 --> 01:13:56,256
that didn't belong to you!

839
01:13:58,967 --> 01:14:00,491
I don't have it anymore.
He took the money.

840
01:14:00,569 --> 01:14:01,593
My brother...

841
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:04,901
I don't give a shit!
You took itfirst!

842
01:14:04,973 --> 01:14:06,907
He stole itfrom you,
you steal it back.

843
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:09,637
I got no beef with your brother.
Thirty-eight grand you owe me.

844
01:14:09,711 --> 01:14:11,645
That's what Ifigure's
gone over the past year...

845
01:14:11,713 --> 01:14:13,544
give or take a penny or a pill.

846
01:14:13,615 --> 01:14:14,547
I mean it.

847
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:16,481
If I had it, I'd give it to you.

848
01:14:17,986 --> 01:14:19,647
No! That prick...

849
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:21,348
Are you listening to me?

850
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:24,426
I don't care about
yourfucking problems!

851
01:14:24,461 --> 01:14:26,393
I look like a fucking shrink?

852
01:14:26,428 --> 01:14:28,396
You tell it to that cunt
Ann Landers.

853
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:29,931
You do what you gotta do.

854
01:14:29,998 --> 01:14:32,364
Sell your mama's blood
for nickels.

855
01:14:32,434 --> 01:14:34,299
I don't give a fuck.

856
01:14:34,369 --> 01:14:35,495
My mama's dead.

857
01:14:35,571 --> 01:14:39,439
Right. Well, I guess
you shit outta luck.

858
01:14:42,711 --> 01:14:44,110
Just let me go.

859
01:14:44,179 --> 01:14:46,147
OK? I'm sorry.

860
01:14:46,215 --> 01:14:47,648
Hey, don't move!

861
01:14:47,716 --> 01:14:49,946
Red, don't move.

862
01:14:51,053 --> 01:14:52,987
Youfucking shit!

863
01:14:55,424 --> 01:14:58,961
All right... Damn, Red!

864
01:14:58,996 --> 01:15:00,485
Drop the gun.

865
01:15:00,562 --> 01:15:02,086
You drop yours.

866
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:04,394
I pulled mine outfirst.

867
01:15:06,101 --> 01:15:09,559
Then, Sam, you're fired.

868
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:15,567
Aw, shit!

869
01:15:19,047 --> 01:15:21,174
Aw, shit!

870
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:24,185
Shit. Shit.

871
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:35,063
It's forty-six thousand,
youfucking idiot.

872
01:15:35,731 --> 01:15:38,256
You can't count, you bastard.

873
01:15:54,082 --> 01:15:56,141
You got here fast.

874
01:15:56,251 --> 01:15:57,650
You said by morning.

875
01:15:57,753 --> 01:15:59,334
That's right. I guess I did.

876
01:15:59,369 --> 01:16:00,915
Would you like a cup of tea?

877
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:04,858
A sandwich?

878
01:16:04,927 --> 01:16:07,122
So, where's your brother,
parking the car?

879
01:16:07,195 --> 01:16:09,095
Relax. He's getting the money.

880
01:16:09,164 --> 01:16:10,426
He'll be along.

881
01:16:10,499 --> 01:16:12,592
He'll be along?

882
01:16:12,668 --> 01:16:14,431
- Yeah.
- When?

883
01:16:14,503 --> 01:16:17,028
Look, I just...
I don't want no trouble.

884
01:16:17,105 --> 01:16:18,902
Just relax, OK?

885
01:16:18,974 --> 01:16:20,305
OK, I'll relax.

886
01:16:23,378 --> 01:16:24,640
You relax, too.

887
01:16:31,019 --> 01:16:32,509
What's the matter?

888
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:35,022
Where you going?

889
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:48,501
Look, maybe this wasn't
such a good idea.

890
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:51,698
What the fuck is going on here?

891
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:53,931
Stop it! Stop it!

892
01:16:54,009 --> 01:16:57,501
You took her body, you sick
son of a bitch, didn't you?

893
01:16:57,579 --> 01:17:00,070
You sick fucker, you!

894
01:17:00,148 --> 01:17:02,878
Where is she?

895
01:17:14,496 --> 01:17:17,260
She put us up to it! That girl...

896
01:17:17,332 --> 01:17:18,299
Shut up!

897
01:17:20,268 --> 01:17:22,395
I'm really tired
of the motel business.

898
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:24,496
There's no future in it,
you know?

899
01:17:24,573 --> 01:17:25,505
Inside.

900
01:17:25,574 --> 01:17:28,042
We had our eye
on this really nice RV.

901
01:17:35,217 --> 01:17:36,479
It's OK, baby.

902
01:17:36,551 --> 01:17:39,486
Don't worry.

903
01:17:39,554 --> 01:17:41,522
I know it was Sam who killed me.

904
01:17:56,338 --> 01:17:57,635
Fuck!

905
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,295
Oh, shit.

906
01:19:02,037 --> 01:19:03,129
It's OK.

907
01:19:10,946 --> 01:19:12,243
I don't...

908
01:19:14,182 --> 01:19:15,945
I don't get it.

909
01:19:16,017 --> 01:19:18,281
Someone found me
at the side of the road.

910
01:19:18,353 --> 01:19:19,513
Jesus.

911
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:21,351
Saved my life.

912
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:26,190
But I saw... I mean, I saw.

913
01:19:26,261 --> 01:19:28,058
Oh, my God, you're bleeding.

914
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:29,654
She's bleeding! Help!

915
01:19:29,898 --> 01:19:31,422
I'm OK. I'm OK.

916
01:19:33,335 --> 01:19:35,360
Sam's a lousy shot.

917
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:37,962
Even that close.

918
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:46,879
The bullet went in there
and out there.

919
01:19:49,551 --> 01:19:52,918
Doctor says I was lucky.

920
01:19:52,988 --> 01:19:56,082
I told him
there's no such thing as luck.

921
01:19:56,158 --> 01:19:59,559
It's real, right?

922
01:20:01,263 --> 01:20:03,595
It must be.

923
01:20:03,665 --> 01:20:06,998
I mean, I've neverfelt like...

924
01:20:07,068 --> 01:20:10,231
Whatever that word is.

925
01:20:10,305 --> 01:20:11,636
Happy.

926
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:18,275
I need you to tell me
exactly what happened.

927
01:20:18,346 --> 01:20:20,644
I don't know exactly.

928
01:20:20,715 --> 01:20:22,205
I blacked out.

929
01:20:22,284 --> 01:20:25,378
I couldn't remember
anything and...

930
01:20:25,453 --> 01:20:28,047
there you were.

931
01:20:28,123 --> 01:20:29,715
I thought I'd killed you.

932
01:20:32,027 --> 01:20:33,995
- Why would you want to kill me?
- I wouldn't.

933
01:20:34,062 --> 01:20:37,623
- What did I ever do to you?
- Nothing.

934
01:20:37,699 --> 01:20:39,633
Just thinking about you
in that ravine...

935
01:20:39,701 --> 01:20:41,168
bleeding to death...

936
01:20:47,409 --> 01:20:49,001
You broke my heart, Jjaks.

937
01:20:53,582 --> 01:20:54,981
I was scared.

938
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:56,677
I was stupid. I was fucked up.

939
01:20:56,751 --> 01:20:59,083
Please forgive me.

940
01:21:00,722 --> 01:21:03,190
Baby...

941
01:21:03,258 --> 01:21:04,987
I've already forgiven you.

942
01:21:27,549 --> 01:21:29,517
- Where are you going?
- I'm hungry.

943
01:21:29,584 --> 01:21:32,246
I've got a fucking hole
in my stomach.

944
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:34,254
You want something to eat?

945
01:21:34,322 --> 01:21:36,483
I'll bring us back something.
You wait here.

946
01:22:07,589 --> 01:22:09,284
Oh, shit.

947
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:14,592
Damn.

948
01:22:15,964 --> 01:22:17,932
Here you go.

949
01:22:17,999 --> 01:22:19,990
Can I ask you something?

950
01:22:20,068 --> 01:22:21,933
You want me to throw
that outfor you?

951
01:22:22,003 --> 01:22:25,097
What? No.

952
01:22:25,173 --> 01:22:26,936
Are you OK?

953
01:22:30,679 --> 01:22:32,408
Can I ask you something?

954
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:35,005
Go ahead. Shoot.

955
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:44,021
If you had, you know,
killed two people...

956
01:22:49,631 --> 01:22:52,532
murdered them...

957
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:57,594
and in the process had gotten
almost a hundred grand...

958
01:22:57,672 --> 01:22:59,640
That's close to
ninety-eight thousand dollars...

959
01:22:59,708 --> 01:23:02,677
which nobody was going
to miss, you hope...

960
01:23:02,911 --> 01:23:07,575
and a stranger
was blackmailing you...

961
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:10,584
would you give him
a big chunk of that money...

962
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:12,552
you worked so hard to get?

963
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:16,078
You are weird.

964
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:24,632
No, I wouldn't give
the bastard a red cent.

965
01:23:24,667 --> 01:23:27,897
Yeah? That's what I think, too.

966
01:23:27,969 --> 01:23:29,095
Could you...

967
01:23:31,272 --> 01:23:34,139
bring me...

968
01:23:34,209 --> 01:23:35,676
one of those doughnuts, too?

969
01:23:37,078 --> 01:23:38,978
Yeah, hold on.

970
01:23:44,352 --> 01:23:47,253
Since I'm a regular,
think I could use your phone?

971
01:23:50,091 --> 01:23:52,059
Yeah, but...

972
01:23:52,127 --> 01:23:55,028
don't make a habit of it, OK?

973
01:23:56,331 --> 01:23:57,389
The Suburban motel.

974
01:23:57,465 --> 01:23:59,592
Twenty-one ninety-five.
That includes a color TV.

975
01:23:59,667 --> 01:24:01,157
How can I help you?

976
01:24:01,236 --> 01:24:02,965
Put him on.

977
01:24:05,407 --> 01:24:07,607
- Yeah?
- It's me.

978
01:24:07,642 --> 01:24:10,110
It's about time.
Did you get the money?

979
01:24:10,178 --> 01:24:11,509
I got the money.

980
01:24:11,579 --> 01:24:13,046
Good.

981
01:24:13,114 --> 01:24:14,911
OK, so come on.

982
01:24:14,983 --> 01:24:17,385
You should have seen me.

983
01:24:17,420 --> 01:24:18,977
I was great.

984
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:20,282
So we'll see you soon, right?

985
01:24:20,355 --> 01:24:22,924
He had no choice
when I put it the way I put it.

986
01:24:22,959 --> 01:24:24,915
I made him see it my way.

987
01:24:24,993 --> 01:24:27,325
And, Sam, bring the key.

988
01:24:27,395 --> 01:24:28,885
What key?

989
01:24:28,963 --> 01:24:31,329
On top of everything,
he says I owe him 30 bucks...

990
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:33,162
for the motel key I took.

991
01:24:33,234 --> 01:24:35,702
It's in the fish dish.

992
01:24:35,937 --> 01:24:40,203
The fish dish.
Look on top of the TV.

993
01:24:41,709 --> 01:24:43,142
But I'm not at home.

994
01:24:43,211 --> 01:24:45,008
Where are you?

995
01:24:50,485 --> 01:24:52,680
I'll get you another cup.

996
01:24:53,188 --> 01:24:54,951
See ya.

997
01:24:58,226 --> 01:25:00,057
- Shit.
- What?

998
01:25:00,128 --> 01:25:02,289
Stupid machine forgot
to put sugar in my coffee.

999
01:25:08,670 --> 01:25:10,331
This is weird.

1000
01:25:13,007 --> 01:25:15,339
You scream
like you just saw a ghost.

1001
01:25:15,410 --> 01:25:17,469
I'm the one
who just saw a ghost.

1002
01:25:17,545 --> 01:25:20,070
You are a ghost, aren't you?

1003
01:25:20,148 --> 01:25:23,117
I know 'cause I killed you.
I was there.

1004
01:25:27,055 --> 01:25:28,113
Youfucker, you.

1005
01:25:28,189 --> 01:25:31,647
What are you gonna do,
kill us all?

1006
01:25:33,461 --> 01:25:37,397
Come on, what's in the bag?
Is that money?

1007
01:25:37,465 --> 01:25:39,160
We can all get out of here.

1008
01:25:39,234 --> 01:25:41,168
Oh, boy.

1009
01:25:42,670 --> 01:25:44,638
You know...

1010
01:25:47,308 --> 01:25:50,334
how does something like this
happen to me?

1011
01:25:50,411 --> 01:25:52,606
All along
it never occurred to me...

1012
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:57,208
that the only reason
that your body was missing...

1013
01:26:00,622 --> 01:26:02,089
is because you weren't dead.

1014
01:26:16,137 --> 01:26:18,105
I gotta keep my head here.

1015
01:26:20,575 --> 01:26:23,601
I gotta do something right!

1016
01:26:27,448 --> 01:26:28,642
You know, Jjaks...

1017
01:26:28,716 --> 01:26:31,480
why can't it be nice
when you come home to visit?

1018
01:26:31,553 --> 01:26:34,283
Normal, like otherfamilies?

1019
01:26:53,508 --> 01:26:55,499
Leave him alone!

1020
01:26:55,577 --> 01:26:56,942
Stop!

1021
01:27:06,588 --> 01:27:08,112
No! No more, please!

1022
01:27:08,189 --> 01:27:10,020
It's all right.
I'm a police officer.

1023
01:27:10,091 --> 01:27:13,061
Drop the gun, Jjaks.
Come here, Freddie.

1024
01:27:13,096 --> 01:27:14,961
I'm sorry.

1025
01:27:15,029 --> 01:27:16,519
Come on.

1026
01:27:23,471 --> 01:27:25,564
You drop that gun, Jjaks.

1027
01:27:28,476 --> 01:27:30,944
Folks, you mind
stepping outside, please?

1028
01:27:31,012 --> 01:27:32,502
This is officially
a crime scene.

1029
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:34,377
Oh, my God.

1030
01:27:34,449 --> 01:27:37,111
I don't think
I can go through with this.

1031
01:27:37,185 --> 01:27:40,154
You called me, remember?

1032
01:27:40,221 --> 01:27:42,314
There's no turning back now.

1033
01:27:42,423 --> 01:27:43,355
It's done.

1034
01:27:43,424 --> 01:27:45,358
Don't worry. It'll be nice.

1035
01:27:57,205 --> 01:27:59,787
You tried to bury me, Jjaks.

1036
01:27:59,822 --> 01:28:02,370
Fuckin'- A. And, Jjaks...

1037
01:28:02,443 --> 01:28:04,911
if you're gonna kill someone...

1038
01:28:04,979 --> 01:28:07,038
you gotta kill 'em.

1039
01:29:15,383 --> 01:29:19,114
I could really get
in a lot of trouble for this.

1040
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:23,453
I'm not supposed to let you in
without Mr. Cos... Custodian.

1041
01:29:24,559 --> 01:29:26,584
Well...

1042
01:29:26,661 --> 01:29:28,993
I won't tell if you don't tell.

1043
01:29:33,601 --> 01:29:34,863
Thanks.

1044
01:29:34,936 --> 01:29:36,870
What is your name again?

1045
01:29:36,971 --> 01:29:39,565
Listen, Lloyd,
I am trying to help you.

1046
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:41,574
I was there. I saw everything.

1047
01:29:41,642 --> 01:29:43,872
Jjaks did not kill his brother.

1048
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:48,110
Listen, I gotta go.

1049
01:29:48,182 --> 01:29:50,047
He's gonna be OK, right?

1050
01:30:01,329 --> 01:30:03,058
Leave me alone!

1051
01:30:03,131 --> 01:30:05,361
I don't know where...

1052
01:30:05,433 --> 01:30:07,301
You promise?
What are you gonna do?

1053
01:30:07,336 --> 01:30:08,529
I'll look into it.

1054
01:30:08,603 --> 01:30:11,697
How?
All my money is fucking gone!

1055
01:30:20,014 --> 01:30:22,278
Oh, oh, jeez.

1056
01:30:22,350 --> 01:30:23,612
There's nothing wrong
with my wife, is there?

1057
01:30:23,684 --> 01:30:26,312
Your wife's fine, Ben.

1058
01:30:26,387 --> 01:30:28,287
She's a little pissed at you.

1059
01:30:28,356 --> 01:30:30,449
We got a callfrom Freddie.

1060
01:30:30,525 --> 01:30:32,049
Freddie who?

1061
01:30:32,126 --> 01:30:34,560
And she had some very
interesting things to say.

1062
01:30:36,197 --> 01:30:38,062
She stole all my fucking money.

1063
01:30:38,132 --> 01:30:39,599
Ask this guy.

1064
01:30:39,667 --> 01:30:41,362
Hey, tell him.

1065
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:43,927
Tell this fucker,
who works for me...

1066
01:30:44,005 --> 01:30:46,098
that she stole
every lastfucking cent.

1067
01:30:46,174 --> 01:30:47,300
Tell him, for Christ's sake!

1068
01:30:47,375 --> 01:30:48,535
Come on, hey!

1069
01:30:49,744 --> 01:30:52,110
Look, hey, Lloyd, OK,
we're cops.

1070
01:30:52,180 --> 01:30:54,546
We gotta stick together.
That's what we do.

1071
01:30:56,584 --> 01:30:59,917
If we don't look out
for each other, who will, man?

1072
01:30:59,987 --> 01:31:01,978
Let me ask you something, Ben.

1073
01:31:02,056 --> 01:31:05,184
Why you such
a fucking wick, huh?

1074
01:31:05,259 --> 01:31:07,193
Hey, I got pants up there!

1075
01:31:09,530 --> 01:31:10,497
Hey, listen!

1076
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:24,335
I suppose
it's none of my business...

1077
01:31:24,412 --> 01:31:27,245
but after all that...

1078
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:29,681
you sure
this is the right woman for you?

1079
01:31:31,586 --> 01:31:32,610
I don't know.

1080
01:31:34,255 --> 01:31:35,483
Maybe.

1081
01:32:09,123 --> 01:32:11,614
How do you know for sure
she's even here?

1082
01:32:13,594 --> 01:32:14,560
She's here.

1083
01:32:14,595 --> 01:32:17,063
Thanks for the ride.
Appreciate it.

1084
01:32:17,131 --> 01:32:19,497
Take one of these with you.

1085
01:32:19,567 --> 01:32:22,229
I don't have twenty-five bucks
for a Bible.

1086
01:32:22,303 --> 01:32:24,430
- It's a gift.
- Keep it.

1087
01:32:24,505 --> 01:32:26,336
You got a family to feed.

1088
01:32:28,509 --> 01:32:30,409
Don't look so worried.

1089
01:32:30,478 --> 01:32:32,139
Look at this.

1090
01:32:35,016 --> 01:32:37,610
I got a letterfrom her
not too long ago.

1091
01:32:42,156 --> 01:32:44,522
"DearJjaks,
maybe it's all bullshit.

1092
01:32:44,625 --> 01:32:47,461
"Maybe nothing does happen
for a reason after all...

1093
01:32:47,496 --> 01:32:49,156
"but I'm doing great.

1094
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:51,391
"I'm living my dream.

1095
01:32:51,465 --> 01:32:55,094
"So fuck you anyways.
Freddie. "

1096
01:32:57,371 --> 01:32:59,305
I hate to say this, son...

1097
01:32:59,373 --> 01:33:01,273
but that don't sound
exactly like a love letter.

1098
01:33:05,112 --> 01:33:07,307
You gotta read
between the lines.

1099
01:33:08,716 --> 01:33:10,115
Good luck.

1100
01:34:27,495 --> 01:34:29,053
Good night, Freddie.

1101
01:34:36,003 --> 01:34:37,937
What took you so fucking long?
