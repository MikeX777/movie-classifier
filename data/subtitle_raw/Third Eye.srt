1
00:00:26,746 --> 00:00:27,918
Get down here!

2
00:00:28,247 --> 00:00:29,648
Why are you shouting at me?!

3
00:00:29,649 --> 00:00:30,889
I am not deaf!

4
00:00:31,184 --> 00:00:32,822
There you go. All fixed!

5
00:00:33,286 --> 00:00:35,197
Don't go too far, okay? Take care.

6
00:00:35,788 --> 00:00:39,065
- Okay. Thank you.
<i>- I'll</i> just fix the lights.

7
00:00:39,892 --> 00:00:42,099
Put this in place. Take care, okay?

8
00:00:42,795 --> 00:00:43,865
Go ahead.

9
00:00:45,164 --> 00:00:48,077
You're not deaf?! I've been calling you!

10
00:00:48,568 --> 00:00:53,104
What is it, my king?
What do you need, my grace?

11
00:00:53,105 --> 00:00:55,711
- Are you hungry?
- Belen, watch your mouth!

12
00:00:55,908 --> 00:00:59,945
Do I need to wash your ass?!
Do you want me to feed you?!

13
00:00:59,946 --> 00:01:00,947
Stop it!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,252
Are you trying to fool me around?!

15
00:01:03,115 --> 00:01:04,958
Ouch! Let me go!

16
00:01:05,585 --> 00:01:08,225
- Let go of me!
- What are you trying to prove here?!

17
00:01:09,021 --> 00:01:11,160
Mama! Mama!

18
00:01:11,357 --> 00:01:13,428
Mama! Look!

19
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:16,003
- I can do it!
- Oh yes.

20
00:01:16,362 --> 00:01:20,504
But I told you to go slow.
You might get scratched.

21
00:01:21,467 --> 00:01:23,743
- Where's your dad?
- He's inside.

22
00:01:24,203 --> 00:01:26,114
Fixing the lights.

23
00:01:26,339 --> 00:01:27,443
Good.

24
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,877
Mr. Waldo and Ms. Belen are fighting again.

25
00:01:31,878 --> 00:01:33,380
- Enough!
- I will kill you!

26
00:01:33,913 --> 00:01:37,827
Go ahead. Hurry up.
You look filthy.

27
00:01:38,584 --> 00:01:43,584
*voices fighting'

28
00:01:57,637 --> 00:01:59,583
He'll me!

29
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:01,145
Help!

30
00:02:05,177 --> 00:02:06,918
Help!

31
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,618
He'll me!

32
00:02:10,082 --> 00:02:11,254
Help!

33
00:02:12,552 --> 00:02:14,862
Help me! Help!

34
00:02:15,521 --> 00:02:19,128
- Mama! Mama!
- Please!

35
00:02:19,692 --> 00:02:20,759
What's happening?!

36
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,173
It's Ms. Belen!

37
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:27,502
Stay there! Don't go down! Stay there!

38
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:29,234
What is it?!

39
00:02:29,235 --> 00:02:31,977
- It's Belen and Waldo!
- What's happening?!

40
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:36,418
Belen! Oh My! Belen.
What happened to you?!

41
00:02:39,011 --> 00:02:41,313
Don't worry. We'll take care of you.

42
00:02:41,314 --> 00:02:42,814
- We'll ask for help.
- Belen!

43
00:02:42,815 --> 00:02:46,888
Somebody help! Help us! Neighbors!

44
00:02:53,092 --> 00:02:54,070
No please!

45
00:02:54,694 --> 00:02:57,573
Please. Don't do this to Belen!

46
00:02:58,297 --> 00:02:59,674
No!

47
00:02:59,865 --> 00:03:01,276
Have pity!

48
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:03,010
No!

49
00:03:03,536 --> 00:03:06,574
Please! No!

50
00:03:19,251 --> 00:03:21,288
Ms. Belen?

51
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,392
Papa?

52
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,137
Mama?

53
00:04:04,463 --> 00:04:06,272
Mama...

54
00:04:06,866 --> 00:04:08,675
Papa...

55
00:04:48,107 --> 00:04:49,916
Papa...

56
00:04:51,911 --> 00:04:54,517
I'
'Mylene!

57
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,826
- Mylene! Mylene!
- Grandma!

58
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:59,453
- Mylene, what's happening?!
- Grandma!

59
00:05:02,354 --> 00:05:06,359
- Papa! Papa!
- Mylene.

60
00:05:07,793 --> 00:05:09,966
Stop. Stop. Stop crying-

61
00:05:10,696 --> 00:05:12,733
You're just having a nightmare.
You're just dreaming.

62
00:05:14,533 --> 00:05:18,675
I should've helped her.
I should've helped her.

63
00:05:18,938 --> 00:05:22,010
I should've let her in!

64
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:27,423
It wouldn't have happened to mom and dad!

65
00:05:28,647 --> 00:05:31,093
Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry.

66
00:05:31,817 --> 00:05:33,888
Mama!

67
00:05:35,421 --> 00:05:37,401
Papa!

68
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,629
Mylene.

69
00:06:11,924 --> 00:06:13,835
Close your eyes.

70
00:06:14,794 --> 00:06:16,899
Our Father, who art in heaven

71
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,806
hallowed be thy name.

72
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,881
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done,

73
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,577
on earth as it is in heaven.

74
00:06:29,642 --> 00:06:33,385
Give us this day our daily bread

75
00:06:33,813 --> 00:06:40,355
and forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive those who trespass against us.

76
00:06:40,653 --> 00:06:45,966
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil. Amen.

77
00:06:53,365 --> 00:06:56,574
Mylene, open your eyes.

78
00:07:00,105 --> 00:07:02,051
Do you see nothing now?

79
00:07:08,113 --> 00:07:09,421
They're gone!

80
00:07:10,082 --> 00:07:12,187
I don't see them anymore!

81
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:23,039
You may not see them now, Mylene,

82
00:07:23,696 --> 00:07:25,437
but there will come a time,

83
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:29,103
especially when you're
going through tough times,

84
00:07:31,503 --> 00:07:33,744
your eyes will open once again.

85
00:07:35,674 --> 00:07:38,154
And you will see more.

86
00:07:39,011 --> 00:07:42,754
Not only ghosts, not only spirits.

87
00:07:47,686 --> 00:07:50,530
The world will not always be as you see it.

88
00:07:51,123 --> 00:07:53,069
And sometimes,

89
00:07:55,861 --> 00:07:57,898
sometimes, you will get hurt.

90
00:07:58,664 --> 00:08:00,541
But when those times come,

91
00:08:02,468 --> 00:08:04,505
I want you to be strong,

92
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:07,207
be brave!

93
00:08:08,674 --> 00:08:10,620
And always remember,

94
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,551
you should always do what is right.

95
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:45,146
Mylene...

96
00:10:09,028 --> 00:10:10,564
Are you okay?

97
00:10:14,933 --> 00:10:16,913
I just miss her.

98
00:10:22,975 --> 00:10:24,921
I never told you

99
00:10:25,944 --> 00:10:29,448
I see ghosts when I was a kid.

100
00:10:31,216 --> 00:10:32,456
Really?

101
00:10:33,352 --> 00:10:35,958
But grandma closed my â€œthird eye...

102
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:38,397
Right now,

103
00:10:39,358 --> 00:10:41,929
I wish, even for just a while,

104
00:10:43,195 --> 00:10:45,106
I could see them again.

105
00:10:46,865 --> 00:10:48,970
I might see her again.

106
00:10:55,274 --> 00:10:56,582
Maybe you're already late.

107
00:10:59,445 --> 00:11:02,324
Old people say

108
00:11:02,548 --> 00:11:07,429
the spirit of the dead goes to
heaven after forty days.

109
00:11:08,687 --> 00:11:10,667
I feel so alone right now.

110
00:11:11,323 --> 00:11:12,199
Hey.

111
00:11:12,925 --> 00:11:14,370
I'm here.

112
00:11:23,535 --> 00:11:25,913
You're all I have now, Jimmy.

113
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:30,484
Please promise me, you won't ever leave me.

114
00:11:40,085 --> 00:11:42,691
Oh My. Ervic is so stubborn.

115
00:11:42,888 --> 00:11:45,425
He let himself suffer of not seeing anything.

116
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:50,868
Ask your husband when does
he like to visit the clinic?

117
00:11:51,063 --> 00:11:52,770
When he's already blind?

118
00:11:55,167 --> 00:11:57,602
Wait. It's Jimmy. He's already outside.

119
00:11:57,603 --> 00:12:00,238
- Thanks, doc.
- Thanks, Linda, bye.

120
00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:01,912
Hello, Jimmy, where are you now?

121
00:12:02,407 --> 00:12:04,148
Sorry, I won't be able to pick you up.

122
00:12:04,977 --> 00:12:05,955
What?

123
00:12:06,578 --> 00:12:10,458
I didn't bring a car today.
You said you're going to fetch me.

124
00:12:10,549 --> 00:12:13,291
I'm really sorry. Boss just called me up.

125
00:12:13,585 --> 00:12:15,087
I'm not sure what time will I finish.

126
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,799
Never mind, never mind.

127
00:12:16,955 --> 00:12:19,401
I'll just take a cab. I'll see you at home.

128
00:12:19,658 --> 00:12:20,432
Bye.

129
00:12:20,626 --> 00:12:21,969
Bye.

130
00:12:59,298 --> 00:13:01,869
I just don't want you calling me!

131
00:13:02,334 --> 00:13:03,972
Especially at this time!

132
00:13:05,637 --> 00:13:08,311
Fine. Tomorrow.

133
00:13:09,308 --> 00:13:10,378
I'll take care of it.

134
00:13:11,076 --> 00:13:12,111
Come on!

135
00:13:12,678 --> 00:13:14,180
I'll see you tomorrow.

136
00:13:15,347 --> 00:13:16,655
I said yes.

137
00:13:22,287 --> 00:13:23,732
Okay. Okay.

138
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,024
You're naughty!

139
00:13:54,119 --> 00:13:58,590
I promise myself I won't attend to that reunion

140
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:02,294
'til I lose thirty pounds!

141
00:14:03,495 --> 00:14:05,529
I thought you already moved on?

142
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:08,067
I thought you're so over Lloyd.

143
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:13,545
I want him to choke on regretting
when he sees how sexy I am!

144
00:14:13,739 --> 00:14:16,107
All these hassles for a cheater like him?!

145
00:14:16,108 --> 00:14:18,110
Let me do my thing, girl.

146
00:14:21,913 --> 00:14:25,053
Oh My. That guy is so slow!

147
00:14:36,695 --> 00:14:38,140
Are you okay?

148
00:14:39,398 --> 00:14:40,934
Yes, I'm okay.

149
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,404
You look like you've seen a ghost.

150
00:16:09,054 --> 00:16:10,465
Have you asked Randy?

151
00:16:10,956 --> 00:16:12,936
About Aunt Agnes' birthday.

152
00:16:14,593 --> 00:16:15,571
Yes.

153
00:16:17,562 --> 00:16:20,668
Do you want to buy gift
after dinner tomorrow?

154
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:23,602
Okay-

155
00:16:25,137 --> 00:16:26,514
Okay, good night.

156
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:47,993
Mister!

157
00:16:48,126 --> 00:16:49,571
Can you open this?

158
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,407
- Is Mylene here?
- She's inside.

159
00:16:59,438 --> 00:17:01,816
Are you sure you really don't want coffee?

160
00:17:02,274 --> 00:17:04,686
No, thanks. My heart might palpitate.

161
00:17:06,378 --> 00:17:09,689
I thought you're going straight to aunt Agnes.

162
00:17:09,815 --> 00:17:12,295
We finished early at the seminar

163
00:17:12,484 --> 00:17:14,293
that's why I went straight here instead and

164
00:17:14,486 --> 00:17:16,659
I really need to tell you something.

165
00:17:18,056 --> 00:17:19,967
Where's Jimmy?

166
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,905
He's upstairs. Why do you ask?

167
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:27,877
You said you really wanted
to talk to me about something.

168
00:17:30,268 --> 00:17:32,407
I need you to hear this sitting down.

169
00:17:40,312 --> 00:17:43,384
Mylene, I don't know what I saw but

170
00:17:43,515 --> 00:17:45,552
I was in Quezon City last week,

171
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,991
Please don't put me into this situation!

172
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,266
It'll look like it's my fault!

173
00:17:51,256 --> 00:17:52,599
I'll call you back.

174
00:17:55,327 --> 00:17:57,238
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.

175
00:18:03,001 --> 00:18:04,571
I'm not sure what I saw.

176
00:18:04,736 --> 00:18:08,411
She could be a friend,
a relative or a long lost friend.

177
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,219
But I feel like it's my duty
to tell you as my friend.

178
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,199
These past few weeks,
he's been out with somebody I don't know.

179
00:18:34,099 --> 00:18:36,579
Sometimes, I see him talking to his phone.

180
00:18:37,168 --> 00:18:39,114
And he doesn't want me to hear it.

181
00:18:40,438 --> 00:18:43,180
He's been hiding a lot of things from me lately.

182
00:18:43,575 --> 00:18:46,556
Do you think Jimmy is cheating on you?

183
00:18:48,513 --> 00:18:50,151
You said the woman's pregnant?

184
00:18:50,248 --> 00:18:51,693
Yes.

185
00:18:54,185 --> 00:18:55,391
Look, Mylene,

186
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:59,591
It's not a reason that you can't give him
a child for him to cheat on you.

187
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:03,132
You can adopt. There are lots of ways.

188
00:19:03,695 --> 00:19:06,335
But Mylene, you have to set things straight.

189
00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:17,419
Hey, Ryza.

190
00:19:18,009 --> 00:19:19,113
Are you guys going somewhere?

191
00:19:19,711 --> 00:19:21,088
Yes, later.

192
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,389
You want coffee?

193
00:19:24,316 --> 00:19:26,592
No, thanks. I need to go.

194
00:19:27,352 --> 00:19:31,892
Wait. You said you're coming to
aunt Agnes' birthday dinner.

195
00:19:35,327 --> 00:19:36,965
I forgot to tell you.

196
00:19:37,829 --> 00:19:39,706
There's an emergency with our project in Rizal.

197
00:19:40,031 --> 00:19:41,271
I have to go check it.

198
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,774
And I have to stay overnight.

199
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,641
Just greet aunt Agnes for me, okay?

200
00:19:54,045 --> 00:19:55,388
EmergenEY?

201
00:19:57,682 --> 00:19:59,559
What kind of an emergency?

202
00:20:04,089 --> 00:20:08,037
Our contractor has a problem
with the subdivision.

203
00:20:13,131 --> 00:20:15,907
What exactly is the problem
with your contractor?

204
00:20:16,901 --> 00:20:19,973
Since when did you get interested with
my real estate problems?

205
00:20:21,473 --> 00:20:23,248
You're my husband.

206
00:20:23,742 --> 00:20:25,688
I believe it's pan of my job to know.

207
00:20:26,211 --> 00:20:27,315
What's your problem?!

208
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:31,488
Excuse me. I'll just go to the powder room.

209
00:20:35,954 --> 00:20:36,864
Look.

210
00:20:37,222 --> 00:20:39,327
I know I promised to go to aunt Agnes.

211
00:20:39,591 --> 00:20:40,968
If that's why you're upset.

212
00:20:47,532 --> 00:20:49,978
Are you having an affair?

213
00:20:51,202 --> 00:20:52,203
What?!

214
00:20:53,104 --> 00:20:54,208
Hey, Mylene. What is this all about?!

215
00:20:54,439 --> 00:20:57,010
I asked you a straight question.

216
00:20:58,176 --> 00:21:01,316
Are you having an affair?

217
00:21:01,579 --> 00:21:02,557
Is that what Ryza told you?!

218
00:21:02,914 --> 00:21:04,689
What did she tell you?!

219
00:21:04,783 --> 00:21:07,423
This is not about her! So answer me!

220
00:21:07,952 --> 00:21:10,660
Mylene, you are being paranoid!

221
00:21:11,222 --> 00:21:12,200
Why is that?

222
00:21:13,391 --> 00:21:15,268
Because you can't tell me the truth!

223
00:21:16,227 --> 00:21:18,571
Because you know you're cheating on me?!

224
00:21:21,566 --> 00:21:22,772
I have to go.

225
00:21:32,711 --> 00:21:34,156
Boy! Open the gate!

226
00:22:18,456 --> 00:22:19,935
Where's Mylene?

227
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:23,163
She went rushing out. She used your car.

228
00:22:23,528 --> 00:22:24,529
What?!

229
00:22:27,532 --> 00:22:30,376
Mylene! Mylene!

230
00:22:31,469 --> 00:22:33,176
Oh no!

231
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,301
What's her problem, man?!

232
00:23:40,672 --> 00:23:42,515
I'm already here outside.

233
00:24:40,531 --> 00:24:44,843
Doc, do you believe that the eyes
are the windows to the soul?

234
00:24:45,837 --> 00:24:47,748
Look straight please.

235
00:24:49,874 --> 00:24:55,449
Well, Mr. Trinidad. All your tests show that
there's really nothing wrong with your eyes.

236
00:24:58,182 --> 00:24:58,785
Really?

237
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:00,961
How many consultations have you had already?

238
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:02,696
Three, four times?

239
00:25:03,254 --> 00:25:07,168
If you want me to refer you
to another specialist, I can.

240
00:25:07,692 --> 00:25:09,035
Okay-

241
00:25:11,329 --> 00:25:13,206
I have a confession to make.

242
00:25:15,433 --> 00:25:17,640
Mr. Trinidad, I am not a priest.

243
00:25:18,036 --> 00:25:20,209
I have other patients waiting.

244
00:25:20,438 --> 00:25:22,645
And they have real eye problems.

245
00:25:23,141 --> 00:25:24,313
Sorry.

246
00:25:24,943 --> 00:25:28,220
<i>- I'll</i> go.
- Don't bother paying for the consultation.

247
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,487
No. I insist.

248
00:25:33,117 --> 00:25:35,529
Instead of coming over
and over again in my clinic,

249
00:25:36,554 --> 00:25:38,363
you would save money,

250
00:25:38,723 --> 00:25:41,363
if you invite me out, Mr. Trinidad.

251
00:25:51,336 --> 00:25:52,781
Let's do it together.

252
00:25:52,971 --> 00:25:54,075
Delicious!

253
00:25:54,372 --> 00:25:56,010
Your tum.

254
00:25:56,374 --> 00:25:58,047
Thank you.

255
00:26:03,915 --> 00:26:06,589
- Thank you, doc.
- You're welcome.

256
00:26:06,851 --> 00:26:10,594
Promise, doc, we'll take care
of our new eyeglasses.

257
00:26:10,655 --> 00:26:15,161
Okay. But not only the eyeglasses,
you should also take care of your eyesight.

258
00:26:15,326 --> 00:26:21,743
- You should all eat...
-vegetables, carrots, squash.

259
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:23,836
Very good!

260
00:26:30,341 --> 00:26:32,651
Jimmy, I know it's you.

261
00:26:40,351 --> 00:26:42,592
Where have you been?
Why are you all dressed up?

262
00:26:56,167 --> 00:26:58,738
Oh no. Wrong! You're mixed up!

263
00:27:09,914 --> 00:27:13,487
I've never thought of the day
I'd be ready to do this

264
00:27:14,185 --> 00:27:16,256
But I don't know what to do

265
00:27:17,588 --> 00:27:19,329
for the rest of my life

266
00:27:19,924 --> 00:27:20,959
without you.

267
00:27:21,392 --> 00:27:22,871
I will take care of you.

268
00:27:23,161 --> 00:27:24,834
You and our future child.

269
00:27:25,096 --> 00:27:27,042
I want to start a family with you.

270
00:27:50,321 --> 00:27:53,564
Hey, the kids have been
waiting for you outside.

271
00:27:54,792 --> 00:27:57,671
I was able to talk to Dr. Santiago.

272
00:27:58,096 --> 00:28:00,599
I won't be able to give you a child.

273
00:28:01,699 --> 00:28:04,202
I'm so sorry, Jimmy.

274
00:28:07,171 --> 00:28:09,412
I'm so sorry.

275
00:28:33,431 --> 00:28:35,377
They said the paint still smells upstairs.

276
00:28:35,867 --> 00:28:37,778
We can stay downstairs for the mean time.

277
00:28:40,705 --> 00:28:42,742
You've been quiet.

278
00:28:43,774 --> 00:28:45,310
Is there a problem?

279
00:28:47,945 --> 00:28:49,083
Nothing.

280
00:29:08,933 --> 00:29:11,004
Tum left, sir.

281
00:29:11,302 --> 00:29:15,682
You will see a sign. It'll lead you to the highway.

282
00:29:16,073 --> 00:29:17,848
Go ahead. Go ahead.

283
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,773
Are you mad?

284
00:29:46,737 --> 00:29:48,614
Did I say anything wrong?

285
00:29:49,874 --> 00:29:53,788
You're not - You're not the only one
who has a problem!

286
00:29:54,178 --> 00:29:56,215
People are asking me about my situation!

287
00:29:56,347 --> 00:29:59,021
I don't want to explain anymore!
I'm done lying, Jimmy!

288
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,695
Janet!

289
00:30:01,352 --> 00:30:03,423
I'm going back to Manila when it's my due.

290
00:30:04,155 --> 00:30:06,101
Mylene, confronted me.

291
00:30:07,358 --> 00:30:11,170
She asked me if I'm having an affair.

292
00:30:12,263 --> 00:30:14,334
What did you tell her?

293
00:30:44,762 --> 00:30:46,673
Are we still on the right way?

294
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:51,541
I don't know. Have you seen any sign?

295
00:30:52,003 --> 00:30:53,482
I didn't see one.

296
00:30:53,938 --> 00:30:55,315
Shm

297
00:30:56,073 --> 00:30:58,280
We shouldn't have gone out today.

298
00:30:58,876 --> 00:31:00,116
Fine!

299
00:31:00,244 --> 00:31:02,520
This is all my fault!

300
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,920
Janet, please!

301
00:31:04,282 --> 00:31:05,590
We're lost!

302
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,793
Don't make this about yourself!

303
00:31:08,185 --> 00:31:09,823
That's the problem!

304
00:31:10,254 --> 00:31:12,200
It's never about myself to you!

305
00:31:12,523 --> 00:31:15,026
I don't want to go back to Manila!
I don't want to go back!

306
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,530
Finally, you admit it!

307
00:31:17,862 --> 00:31:19,637
You didn't even think about the baby?!

308
00:31:20,898 --> 00:31:23,071
Janet, your doctor is there!

309
00:31:23,501 --> 00:31:25,879
What if complications occur
when you give birth?!

310
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:34,956
Even for once,

311
00:31:36,013 --> 00:31:38,584
could you be a little bit concern about me?

312
00:31:40,084 --> 00:31:42,223
And not all about the baby?!

313
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,224
We talked clearly about this.

314
00:31:44,689 --> 00:31:47,363
You said before, we were just having fun.

315
00:31:47,491 --> 00:31:49,129
Nothing serious.

316
00:31:50,594 --> 00:31:52,540
Janet, I didn't want you to get pregnant!

317
00:31:52,797 --> 00:31:54,572
But what am I suppose to do?!
It's already there!

318
00:31:54,965 --> 00:31:56,945
As if I'll abandon my baby!

319
00:32:06,677 --> 00:32:08,452
Stop the car!

320
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,420
Janet!

321
00:32:14,318 --> 00:32:16,764
Stop! Stop!

322
00:32:34,905 --> 00:32:36,384
Are you okay?

323
00:32:44,815 --> 00:32:47,386
Miss. Good afternoon!

324
00:32:48,185 --> 00:32:49,721
Good afternoon.

325
00:32:49,954 --> 00:32:52,901
We'd just like to ask
for a direction to the highway?

326
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:55,429
Looks like you're lost.

327
00:32:56,427 --> 00:32:58,236
Who's that with you?

328
00:32:59,163 --> 00:33:00,665
My wife.

329
00:33:00,998 --> 00:33:03,410
She looks like she's going to give birth soon.

330
00:33:05,803 --> 00:33:08,579
Miss. How are we going out of here?

331
00:33:09,507 --> 00:33:11,111
You're too far.

332
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:14,390
If you want, I could go with you
back to where you're from.

333
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,015
No, thank you.

334
00:33:17,548 --> 00:33:19,755
We'll just go back instead.

335
00:33:20,918 --> 00:33:22,591
Sorry for bothering you.

336
00:33:29,427 --> 00:33:31,429
Jimmy! Jimmy!

337
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:33,640
Jimmy!

338
00:36:25,369 --> 00:36:27,246
Hello?

339
00:36:28,872 --> 00:36:30,647
Someone there?!

340
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,520
Someone there?!

341
00:37:38,842 --> 00:37:40,981
Somebody home?

342
00:37:48,185 --> 00:37:49,892
Somebody home?!

343
00:38:50,814 --> 00:38:52,054
Wait!

344
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,252
Wait!

345
00:38:58,789 --> 00:39:00,325
Boy?

346
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,521
I'm Mylene. I need help.

347
00:39:30,287 --> 00:39:33,734
Don't be afraid of me please.
I won't hurt you.

348
00:40:15,632 --> 00:40:17,111
What's your name?

349
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:21,447
Who lives with you here?

350
00:40:22,072 --> 00:40:24,211
Are your parents here?

351
00:40:25,809 --> 00:40:28,050
Will they come back home soon?

352
00:40:29,313 --> 00:40:34,126
I wanted to call the police but
I don't know how to get out of here.

353
00:41:14,658 --> 00:41:16,262
Ram Ram!

354
00:41:17,661 --> 00:41:19,140
Ram Ram!

355
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,040
Who are you?

356
00:41:24,468 --> 00:41:27,312
Ma'am, sorry for bothering you. I just need your help.

357
00:41:27,437 --> 00:41:30,816
It's my husband. I need to call the -

358
00:41:34,678 --> 00:41:36,521
She's looking for the police.

359
00:41:37,147 --> 00:41:39,218
Get inside.

360
00:41:40,884 --> 00:41:42,886
You wanted to call the police?

361
00:41:45,188 --> 00:41:48,567
I don't know the way out.

362
00:41:48,926 --> 00:41:52,169
- That's why I asked for help.
- Where are you from?

363
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:55,742
They closed the main highway.

364
00:41:57,067 --> 00:41:58,637
Then I got lost.

365
00:42:00,671 --> 00:42:02,344
He'll me!

366
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,613
Help!

367
00:42:09,246 --> 00:42:11,248
Where do you think you're going?!

368
00:42:11,381 --> 00:42:12,826
Let me go!

369
00:42:21,825 --> 00:42:23,532
Help!

370
00:42:25,295 --> 00:42:28,674
What did you do to Jimmy!

371
00:42:36,273 --> 00:42:38,219
Come here!

372
00:44:10,734 --> 00:44:12,475
Help!

373
00:44:22,679 --> 00:44:23,846
Jimmy?!

374
00:44:23,847 --> 00:44:23,858
Jimmy?!

375
00:44:32,422 --> 00:44:33,492
Susan!

376
00:44:35,459 --> 00:44:36,494
Where are you going?

377
00:44:36,726 --> 00:44:38,899
I just found a good offering for Cenon.

378
00:44:39,296 --> 00:44:41,037
But someone got in.

379
00:44:42,132 --> 00:44:44,134
She saw what I did.

380
00:44:46,937 --> 00:44:48,780
Come on. Hurry.

381
00:44:52,375 --> 00:44:54,321
What are you doing here?

382
00:44:55,579 --> 00:44:57,752
I followed you when you left.

383
00:44:58,248 --> 00:45:00,387
We have to get out of here!

384
00:45:02,486 --> 00:45:04,022
Janet?

385
00:45:04,955 --> 00:45:08,767
- Where's Janet?
- Jimmy, you're hurt. I have to get you out of here!

386
00:45:10,627 --> 00:45:12,163
They've taken Janet with them.

387
00:45:13,296 --> 00:45:15,537
That woman took Janet with her!

388
00:45:29,045 --> 00:45:31,491
I need your wife and your child.

389
00:45:39,489 --> 00:45:41,833
She's pregnant with your child?

390
00:45:51,468 --> 00:45:53,277
I'm so sorry, Mylene.

391
00:45:56,606 --> 00:45:59,018
I didn't know how to tell you.

392
00:46:03,013 --> 00:46:04,856
I didn't want to hurt you.

393
00:46:08,318 --> 00:46:09,991
I'm sorry.

394
00:46:12,222 --> 00:46:14,463
Mylene, I love you.

395
00:46:16,326 --> 00:46:18,067
I made a mistake.

396
00:46:19,896 --> 00:46:23,867
You really want me to believe that you
didn't intend to get her pregnant?!

397
00:46:26,136 --> 00:46:27,911
You shouldn't have come here.

398
00:46:28,371 --> 00:46:30,373
Well, it's too late for that now!

399
00:46:31,408 --> 00:46:33,217
We have to get out of here.

400
00:46:34,211 --> 00:46:35,417
What about Janet?

401
00:46:36,179 --> 00:46:38,455
Jimmy, you need to go to the hospital.

402
00:46:38,782 --> 00:46:40,557
You lost a lot of blood!

403
00:46:40,984 --> 00:46:42,486
I can't leave her alone.

404
00:46:43,353 --> 00:46:44,991
I can't leave her and my child alone.

405
00:46:45,155 --> 00:46:48,034
We'll call the police when we get out of here!

406
00:46:48,191 --> 00:46:51,229
We'll ask for their help!
They can do something about this!

407
00:47:14,651 --> 00:47:16,255
She took the guy with her!

408
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,763
They'll have a hard time getting out of here.

409
00:47:19,189 --> 00:47:21,257
Go now! Go after them!

410
00:47:21,258 --> 00:47:24,793
I have to get home. I have to
start offering the pregnant one!

411
00:47:24,794 --> 00:47:28,230
Remember this.
The woman should die first.

412
00:47:28,231 --> 00:47:31,667
When her heartbeat stops,
that's when you take the child

413
00:47:31,668 --> 00:47:33,807
for the thanksgiving offering!

414
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:59,763
We have to find the way back to my car.

415
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:02,440
Your car's networking.

416
00:48:02,899 --> 00:48:05,675
You go, Mylene. I'll go after that woman!

417
00:48:06,136 --> 00:48:10,016
Jimmy! Obviously, they're killers!

418
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:12,315
You're hurt! What can you do?!

419
00:48:12,909 --> 00:48:15,651
Didn't you hear?! They're going to kill them!

420
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:23,190
Forgive me, Mylene. You have to go.

421
00:48:23,386 --> 00:48:26,333
I have to do this! Save yourself.

422
00:48:26,489 --> 00:48:28,127
Call the police.

423
00:48:37,767 --> 00:48:39,075
Jimmy!

424
00:48:40,503 --> 00:48:42,210
I'll go with you!

425
00:48:42,872 --> 00:48:44,374
You don't have to do this!

426
00:48:44,974 --> 00:48:48,421
I have to! You don't know
what you're getting into!

427
00:48:49,779 --> 00:48:51,383
I was able to get inside their house.

428
00:48:51,681 --> 00:48:54,161
I already saw the couple and their son!

429
00:48:55,985 --> 00:48:57,658
Wait!

430
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,546
Are you sure this is the way back?

431
00:49:13,303 --> 00:49:15,442
This is the only way to the house.

432
00:49:17,974 --> 00:49:20,318
You said you saw a guy.

433
00:49:21,611 --> 00:49:22,783
Yes.

434
00:49:23,513 --> 00:49:25,754
He was there
when you guys were taken.

435
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:29,653
- The guy?
- What is it?

436
00:49:30,954 --> 00:49:32,956
I didn't see a guy.

437
00:49:37,694 --> 00:49:39,799
I saw them earlier.

438
00:49:40,897 --> 00:49:42,103
Who?

439
00:49:42,332 --> 00:49:43,538
Is somebody there?

440
00:49:43,933 --> 00:49:46,140
I saw them at the car accident.

441
00:49:58,715 --> 00:50:00,126
Mylene?

442
00:50:04,854 --> 00:50:05,798
Myleneg

443
00:50:21,938 --> 00:50:23,042
Mylene?

444
00:50:25,742 --> 00:50:27,244
Mylene, what is it?

445
00:50:28,878 --> 00:50:29,481
Let's go, Jimmy.

446
00:50:39,722 --> 00:50:40,598
That's the house.

447
00:50:42,425 --> 00:50:43,028
Are you okay?

448
00:50:43,793 --> 00:50:44,326
Mylene --

449
00:50:44,327 --> 00:50:45,431
Be careful.

450
00:50:46,663 --> 00:50:47,869
He'll me!

451
00:50:55,138 --> 00:50:56,048
Jimmy, wait! Jimmy!

452
00:51:02,745 --> 00:51:03,553
I have to help Janet!

453
00:51:04,881 --> 00:51:05,916
I'll go inside.

454
00:51:06,916 --> 00:51:07,394
What?!

455
00:51:10,353 --> 00:51:11,297
Wait for me here.

456
00:51:25,368 --> 00:51:26,142
Take care of yourself.

457
00:51:34,644 --> 00:51:37,022
Please. Don't hurt my baby. Please!

458
00:51:41,017 --> 00:51:42,325
Please! My baby!

459
00:51:47,657 --> 00:51:52,657
'Prayer offering*
*woman shrieking*

460
00:53:07,604 --> 00:53:10,676
You're just a spirit!
You can't do anything to me!

461
00:53:11,841 --> 00:53:12,751
Leave me alone!

462
00:53:33,029 --> 00:53:36,135
Blood of two souls, I offer to you.

463
00:53:36,399 --> 00:53:39,209
Blood of two souls, I offer to you.

464
00:53:40,370 --> 00:53:43,408
Blood of two souls, I offer to you.

465
00:53:43,873 --> 00:53:45,614
Blood of two souls...

466
00:54:08,331 --> 00:54:10,208
Come with me. Give me a hand.

467
00:54:45,835 --> 00:54:47,007
Get the goat.

468
00:55:17,767 --> 00:55:19,041
Soon, Cenon.

469
00:55:23,473 --> 00:55:25,146
You will soon come back.

470
00:55:38,755 --> 00:55:40,792
One life's blood with two souls,

471
00:55:41,691 --> 00:55:43,602
with two beating hearts.

472
00:55:44,861 --> 00:55:46,932
One life's blood with two souls,

473
00:55:48,131 --> 00:55:50,077
with two beating hearts.

474
00:56:06,716 --> 00:56:08,662
Come. Follow me.

475
00:57:55,825 --> 00:57:57,498
You're Jimmy's wife.

476
00:57:57,827 --> 00:58:00,899
This isn't the time to introduce each other.

477
00:58:02,565 --> 00:58:04,135
We need to get out of here.

478
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:05,303
Where's Jimmy?

479
00:58:06,335 --> 00:58:07,973
He's badly hurt.

480
00:58:08,571 --> 00:58:11,177
I have no choice but to help him save you.

481
00:58:11,908 --> 00:58:13,888
But I don't intend to die saving you.

482
00:58:14,877 --> 00:58:16,322
We have to move now!

483
00:58:44,573 --> 00:58:49,573
*Prayer offering'

484
00:59:05,294 --> 00:59:07,797
Bring back our beloved Cenon.

485
00:59:08,464 --> 00:59:10,842
To our powerful ancestors,

486
00:59:11,167 --> 00:59:14,205
who gives life in return for our offer.

487
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,750
Bring back our beloved Cenon!

488
00:59:20,309 --> 00:59:21,617
Bring him back to us!

489
00:59:24,013 --> 00:59:25,686
Bring him back to us.

490
00:59:28,117 --> 00:59:29,892
Soul, blood and life.

491
00:59:30,953 --> 00:59:32,489
Soul, blood and life!

492
00:59:33,756 --> 00:59:35,599
Soul, blood and life.

493
00:59:37,193 --> 00:59:39,400
Soul, blood and life.

494
01:00:29,245 --> 01:00:30,986
Ram Ram, Ram Ram...

495
01:00:32,481 --> 01:00:34,188
Do you still remember me?

496
01:00:34,817 --> 01:00:37,457
I told you I need help.

497
01:01:09,552 --> 01:01:10,758
You have the nerve!

498
01:01:30,606 --> 01:01:32,677
Go ahead! Come near!

499
01:01:33,008 --> 01:01:36,251
Let's see if your husband's going to
live if I smash his head with this!

500
01:02:21,757 --> 01:02:24,670
Hurry!

501
01:02:28,797 --> 01:02:29,468
Jimmy!

502
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:31,434
- Jimmy!
- Jimmy.

503
01:02:32,067 --> 01:02:32,875
- Jimmy!
- Jimmy.

504
01:02:38,774 --> 01:02:39,616
Mylene...

505
01:02:40,843 --> 01:02:41,981
I'm sorry.

506
01:02:42,578 --> 01:02:43,852
I'm so sorry.

507
01:02:46,115 --> 01:02:47,025
I love you.

508
01:02:47,483 --> 01:02:48,188
I...

509
01:02:53,222 --> 01:02:56,396
Jimmy, don't do this to me please.

510
01:02:58,360 --> 01:02:59,930
For our child...

511
01:03:01,397 --> 01:03:02,068
Janet.

512
01:03:03,632 --> 01:03:05,168
- I'm so sorry.
- No!

513
01:03:08,904 --> 01:03:09,814
Jimmy!

514
01:03:10,239 --> 01:03:10,808
- Jimmy!
-Jimmy!

515
01:03:12,041 --> 01:03:13,042
Jimmy!

516
01:04:17,973 --> 01:04:20,544
Once the mother of the child dies,

517
01:04:21,610 --> 01:04:23,590
you will be whole again.

518
01:04:25,381 --> 01:04:29,329
You will have your soul back

519
01:04:30,653 --> 01:04:32,132
to your body.

520
01:04:32,621 --> 01:04:33,759
Follow them.

521
01:04:35,424 --> 01:04:38,667
They can't leave.

522
01:05:39,555 --> 01:05:41,865
I've been wanting to tell you.

523
01:05:44,293 --> 01:05:46,432
I want to blame you!

524
01:05:48,797 --> 01:05:52,210
I want to yell at you!
I want to hurt you!

525
01:06:00,542 --> 01:06:02,920
We're in this nightmare because of you!

526
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:07,420
My husband's dead because of you!

527
01:06:33,409 --> 01:06:35,355
I'm sorry.

528
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:39,655
I'm sorry.

529
01:07:53,956 --> 01:07:55,594
I saw a woman earlier.

530
01:07:55,858 --> 01:07:57,303
She was peeking inside your house.

531
01:07:57,626 --> 01:08:00,072
She's probably the one
Susan was talking about.

532
01:08:00,229 --> 01:08:02,964
What if that woman
comes back with the police?

533
01:08:02,965 --> 01:08:04,171
I've been worrying about that.

534
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:07,444
That's the only way
I know back to the car.

535
01:08:08,337 --> 01:08:09,782
You take care of the charcoals.

536
01:08:10,038 --> 01:08:10,448
Okay-

537
01:08:10,672 --> 01:08:12,413
I have to go get Lydia
from the riverside.

538
01:09:04,993 --> 01:09:05,630
Please.

539
01:09:06,328 --> 01:09:07,466
Please don't hurt me.

540
01:09:08,163 --> 01:09:09,972
Help us escape. Please.

541
01:09:10,699 --> 01:09:12,406
Please. Please.

542
01:09:13,635 --> 01:09:14,079
Please.

543
01:09:45,934 --> 01:09:47,208
Don't worry.

544
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:54,481
Your father will bring me back.

545
01:09:56,612 --> 01:09:58,819
Just like what we did to both of you.

546
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,622
We will see each other again.

547
01:10:40,288 --> 01:10:41,164
Someone might be there.

548
01:10:42,257 --> 01:10:43,565
Let's ask for help!

549
01:10:45,127 --> 01:10:47,073
I have this bad feeling about this place.

550
01:10:54,069 --> 01:10:55,878
I won't make it, Mylene!

551
01:11:00,108 --> 01:11:00,779
Let's go there.

552
01:11:03,578 --> 01:11:05,421
Come. Looks like no one's home

553
01:13:06,968 --> 01:13:07,469
Mylene.

554
01:13:09,938 --> 01:13:10,712
I'm sorry.

555
01:13:11,606 --> 01:13:13,347
I didn't want this to happen.

556
01:13:22,417 --> 01:13:24,260
Is he planning to leave me?

557
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:27,099
I know he loves you.

558
01:13:30,492 --> 01:13:32,529
He's not leaving you.

559
01:13:34,496 --> 01:13:37,136
I didn't know what he felt about me.

560
01:13:40,902 --> 01:13:44,748
What I know is he loves our child.

561
01:13:53,181 --> 01:13:55,252
I can't take it anymore, Mylene!

562
01:14:01,523 --> 01:14:02,489
I can't!

563
01:14:02,490 --> 01:14:05,437
You can do it!
You can do it, Janet! Push!

564
01:14:10,098 --> 01:14:14,137
We have to go to Susan
to witness the offering.

565
01:14:27,949 --> 01:14:28,586
Louder!

566
01:14:43,765 --> 01:14:45,472
We just came from Susan.

567
01:14:46,067 --> 01:14:48,638
She's gone. She's dead!

568
01:14:49,437 --> 01:14:52,179
The pregnant woman's inside.

569
01:14:52,874 --> 01:14:55,252
She was taken by that woman
I was telling you about.

570
01:14:59,514 --> 01:15:00,515
Call the others.

571
01:15:14,729 --> 01:15:17,972
There are people outside.
They're with the woman who took you.

572
01:15:18,433 --> 01:15:19,571
You're almost done! Push!

573
01:15:24,873 --> 01:15:26,375
One, two, three, push!

574
01:15:30,845 --> 01:15:31,880
It's coming!

575
01:15:38,386 --> 01:15:40,798
The three of you!
Guard the back!

576
01:15:42,123 --> 01:15:44,797
You! Stay around the house!

577
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:46,933
Hurry! Here!

578
01:15:56,604 --> 01:15:57,446
Break the door!

579
01:15:57,906 --> 01:15:58,509
Hurry!

580
01:15:58,907 --> 01:15:59,510
Tear it down!

581
01:16:03,445 --> 01:16:04,082
Mylene.

582
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:09,692
Please. Save my baby.

583
01:16:32,207 --> 01:16:32,514
Go.

584
01:16:48,823 --> 01:16:50,632
Janet, I need your help.

585
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:05,806
Where's the other one?!

586
01:17:05,807 --> 01:17:06,842
Don't open the door!

587
01:17:08,476 --> 01:17:09,576
Where's the baby?

588
01:17:09,577 --> 01:17:10,647
Don't come near me!

589
01:17:12,113 --> 01:17:12,989
Stay away!

590
01:17:13,748 --> 01:17:15,056
Don't open the door!

591
01:17:51,753 --> 01:17:52,663
She got out!

592
01:18:06,367 --> 01:18:07,903
She's here! Hurry!

593
01:18:08,002 --> 01:18:08,639
Follow me!

594
01:18:09,304 --> 01:18:11,375
Run after her! Hurry!

595
01:18:19,047 --> 01:18:21,027
Hurry! Hurry!

596
01:18:32,927 --> 01:18:35,567
You can't do anything to me.
You're just a spirit.

597
01:18:36,131 --> 01:18:37,474
Stop this!

598
01:18:37,765 --> 01:18:38,766
Leave me alone!

599
01:18:56,518 --> 01:18:57,895
I'm not afraid of you.

600
01:18:58,219 --> 01:18:59,425
Leave me alone!

601
01:19:37,659 --> 01:19:39,366
Please don't!

602
01:20:39,053 --> 01:20:40,020
<i>Canon!</i>

603
01:20:40,021 --> 01:20:42,262
- Cenon's alive!
- Cenon's finally alive!

604
01:20:42,590 --> 01:20:44,228
It's him!

605
01:20:44,525 --> 01:20:45,560
He's alive!

606
01:22:20,121 --> 01:22:21,464
Hurry!

607
01:22:35,069 --> 01:22:36,878
Hurry! Hurry! Go!

608
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:47,951
Go! Hurry! Get her!

609
01:23:06,401 --> 01:23:08,034
Come in, come in, HQ.

610
01:23:08,035 --> 01:23:10,208
This is HQ, where are you?

611
01:23:10,271 --> 01:23:12,217
We're at the town of Sungayan.

612
01:23:12,507 --> 01:23:14,174
We're here with the complainant.

613
01:23:14,175 --> 01:23:17,645
I think what they're saying about
the cannibal tribe is actually true.

614
01:23:18,346 --> 01:23:20,690
Okay. We'll be there.
Over and out.

615
01:23:25,853 --> 01:23:29,096
Ma'am, they're gone.
Is this what you're talking about?

616
01:23:30,825 --> 01:23:33,305
Okay, we'll take this as an evidence.

617
01:24:03,991 --> 01:24:06,835
Now, where are we going
to find a place to stay?

618
01:24:06,928 --> 01:24:09,807
In Quezon, Alodia's daughter is there.

619
01:24:10,064 --> 01:24:11,372
This is so heavy.

620
01:24:11,666 --> 01:24:13,236
I'm hungry.

621
01:24:13,534 --> 01:24:15,802
Are we still travelling far?

622
01:24:15,803 --> 01:24:17,111
I think so.

623
01:24:17,305 --> 01:24:19,080
Are you hungry?

624
01:24:28,182 --> 01:24:30,128
Put it at the back.

625
01:24:31,886 --> 01:24:34,799
- Here.
- Thank you so much.

626
01:24:35,323 --> 01:24:39,328
- That's already big. Are you due this month?
- Yes, actually.

627
01:24:43,097 --> 01:24:46,203
My child, I'm really thirsty.

628
01:24:46,567 --> 01:24:48,376
Can I have something to drink?

629
01:24:48,669 --> 01:24:50,945
Sure. Come inside.

630
01:25:00,481 --> 01:25:02,757
- Let's go.
- Hurry! Go!

631
01:25:20,735 --> 01:25:21,873
You know what?

632
01:25:23,337 --> 01:25:25,544
You have your daddy's eyes.

633
01:26:02,910 --> 01:26:04,583
Stay away from us!

634
01:26:06,247 --> 01:26:07,749
There's nothing you can do!

635
01:26:08,549 --> 01:26:10,551
Leave me alone!
