00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,497
Here you are.

4
00:01:20,639 --> 00:01:21,949
Why do you come to Thailand?

5
00:01:22,847 --> 00:01:24,254
To deliver some goods.

6
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:26,396
What's in your bag?

7
00:01:26,943 --> 00:01:28,350
Let me see.

8
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,989
Pour it.

9
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,625
What's all this rubbish?

10
00:01:39,487 --> 00:01:42,586
Okay pass. Go go.

11
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,814
Go.

12
00:01:46,847 --> 00:01:48,189
Go. Hurry.

13
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,974
Hold on. Hold on.

14
00:01:50,816 --> 00:01:52,125
What is that?

15
00:01:52,192 --> 00:01:53,817
That's around your neck.

16
00:01:55,104 --> 00:01:56,314
What is that?

17
00:01:56,607 --> 00:01:58,517
That's right.

18
00:01:59,775 --> 00:02:01,237
Take it off.

19
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:06,038
What is it?

20
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:07,260
Love potion.

21
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,341
Love potion?

22
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:10,394
Holy shit. Love potion.

23
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:13,878
Look, it's Love potion.

24
00:02:14,591 --> 00:02:16,282
Have you ever seen it for real?

25
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,105
It's used for love and lust spells.

26
00:02:18,431 --> 00:02:20,765
Wow, I've only heard of it.

27
00:02:23,008 --> 00:02:24,601
Is this the real deal?

28
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,716
Hey, you want to try some?

29
00:02:36,896 --> 00:02:37,844
No!

30
00:02:53,951 --> 00:02:56,668
What a nonsense!

31
00:02:58,751 --> 00:02:59,798
Go, go.

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,204
What a waste of time.

35
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:17,564
After we'd been through the big flood crisis,

36
00:05:18,623 --> 00:05:23,228
our company had to recover
and restore in several aspects.

37
00:05:24,127 --> 00:05:28,502
The staffs from all departments
had been co-operating very well.

38
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,141
Therefore, our company
managed to recover quite fast.

39
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:42,077
I want you all to congratulate
yourselves on this success.

40
00:05:46,687 --> 00:05:47,931
However...

41
00:05:49,408 --> 00:05:52,506
I believe that you all can do better.

42
00:05:53,055 --> 00:05:55,356
Better and better,

43
00:05:56,063 --> 00:05:57,307
A lot more.

44
00:05:57,471 --> 00:05:59,359
Just like our company's motto:

45
00:05:59,455 --> 00:06:03,285
The company's our life,
committed like slaves,

46
00:06:03,487 --> 00:06:05,342
with the greatest quality

47
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:08,119

Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Yippee!

49
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:14,744
Oh my, you all lightened up my day.

50
00:06:15,263 --> 00:06:20,501
Well, now we can go back to our work.

51
00:06:21,151 --> 00:06:22,263
Attention...

52
00:06:22,943 --> 00:06:25,464
Dismissed!

53
00:06:25,631 --> 00:06:26,711
Yeah!

54
00:06:35,807 --> 00:06:38,524
Hey, Prae. Do you mind going through this?

55
00:06:38,719 --> 00:06:39,832
Do it, please.

56
00:06:42,015 --> 00:06:44,829
Prae, Boss Toy wants to see you.

57
00:06:46,912 --> 00:06:48,821
Come on in. Sit down. Have a seat.

58
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:58,396
You know, I just landed last night.

59
00:06:58,687 --> 00:07:03,356
Japan was so beautiful. Really.

60
00:07:03,967 --> 00:07:06,717
Oh, I went to Japanese hot spring.

61
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:09,406
I got to be naked in pool.

62
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,073
Everybody was naked in all that glory.

63
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,694
What do you need to see me for?

64
00:07:16,831 --> 00:07:18,619
Oh, here it is.

65
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:20,631
I have something for you.

66
00:07:20,735 --> 00:07:23,604
Straight out of the plane from Japan.

67
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:25,789
You see?

68
00:07:26,911 --> 00:07:29,945
It costs me 8,000 yen.

69
00:07:30,431 --> 00:07:34,555
Watch this. You'll see how it works. Hold on.

70
00:07:34,847 --> 00:07:38,906
Oh, right here. Gotta turn it on. See this?

71
00:07:44,735 --> 00:07:48,891
Cut it off now. Enough. Or she'll pass out.

72
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:52,788
I bought this specially for you, Prae.

73
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:55,512
You can put it on your desk, okay?

74
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,141
I'd rather pass on this.

75
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,383
Why not?

76
00:07:59,711 --> 00:08:00,988
Are we done yet?

77
00:08:01,055 --> 00:08:02,844
Then I'll go back to work now.

78
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,629
Prae. Prae. Prae.

79
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,196
Prae.

80
00:08:07,391 --> 00:08:08,952
Hold on. Hold on.

81
00:08:11,071 --> 00:08:12,664
What's wrong with this?

82
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,360
It's so cute.

83
00:08:16,735 --> 00:08:20,313
Here we go. Here we go. Give her hard, man.

84
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,763
So damn fucking cute.

85
00:08:30,527 --> 00:08:32,734
I told you it's not about work.

86
00:08:32,735 --> 00:08:35,517
Come on, pay me now.

87
00:08:35,935 --> 00:08:37,113
There goes my money.

88
00:09:15,967 --> 00:09:16,915
Prae.

89
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:21,402
Well, can I ask you for something?

90
00:09:23,551 --> 00:09:25,405
It can be more than one thing.
What do you want?

91
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,119
I...

92
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:30,972
I want you, Prae.

93
00:09:32,191 --> 00:09:33,532
Come again, Lek?

94
00:09:33,855 --> 00:09:35,032
I, well...

95
00:09:36,287 --> 00:09:37,748
I wanna bang you, Prae.

96
00:09:44,511 --> 00:09:45,722
Of course, you can.

97
00:10:00,287 --> 00:10:01,278
You dickhead, Lek.

98
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,392
Asshole.

99
00:10:02,911 --> 00:10:05,021
What the heck is wrong with you?
I almost shit my pants.

100
00:10:05,023 --> 00:10:06,300
What are you doing?

101
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:09,246
I was thinking about work!

102
00:10:09,311 --> 00:10:11,678
About work, my ass.
You were bending yourself.

103
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:13,246
What do you want?

104
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,792
You told me about that sexy chick Prae.

105
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,682
You still wanna tap that ass?

106
00:10:19,551 --> 00:10:22,169
You're saying bullshit. She's my friend!

107
00:10:22,431 --> 00:10:25,300
I stopped thinking about that long time ago.

108
00:10:25,471 --> 00:10:26,748
Well, alright, then.

109
00:10:26,783 --> 00:10:28,987
Because I was gonna help you with that.

110
00:10:31,007 --> 00:10:32,119
Help me?

111
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:34,462
How would you do that?

112
00:10:34,463 --> 00:10:35,673
Snatch her!

113
00:10:35,871 --> 00:10:36,918
Damn.

114
00:10:37,247 --> 00:10:39,549
Do that and you'll end up in jail, Moron.

115
00:10:39,647 --> 00:10:42,581
Just kidding. I really know how to help you.

116
00:10:47,871 --> 00:10:49,497
You remember Boss Tong?

117
00:10:52,383 --> 00:10:55,383
A few months ago,
Boss Tong gave this to my uncle.

118
00:10:55,999 --> 00:10:58,366
Your uncle who died last week?

119
00:10:58,751 --> 00:10:59,514
Yep.

120
00:11:01,311 --> 00:11:02,588
What the hell is it?

121
00:11:02,847 --> 00:11:05,432
My uncle told me it's gotten out of Cambodia.

122
00:11:05,887 --> 00:11:07,643
Someone else gave it to Boss Tong.

123
00:11:10,047 --> 00:11:12,436
There's a abracadabra to go with it.

124
00:11:14,527 --> 00:11:16,894
What is that? Love potion?

125
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,434
Vacuum clean it, please.

126
00:11:43,454 --> 00:11:45,243
Want to test drive as well?

127
00:12:46,431 --> 00:12:47,772
Is it really work?

128
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,144
You want it or not?

129
00:12:49,246 --> 00:12:50,556
If not, then suit yourself.

130
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:54,548
With a face like this,
I have no need for that potion.

131
00:12:56,351 --> 00:12:58,260
Duck face, you're full of shit.

132
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:16,148
Miss, follow me to the finance office.

133
00:13:56,255 --> 00:13:58,524
Why you come back home so late
these days?

134
00:14:00,351 --> 00:14:02,009
I stopped by the hospital.

135
00:14:03,422 --> 00:14:05,724
I told you. It's a waste of time.

136
00:14:06,207 --> 00:14:08,596
Your mom won't make it through,
no matter what.

137
00:14:09,311 --> 00:14:12,311
You should just sell that old
junk car of hers already.

138
00:14:12,606 --> 00:14:14,232
She has no need for a ride anymore.

139
00:14:24,671 --> 00:14:26,875
Someone will come to see this house
in a few days.

140
00:14:27,006 --> 00:14:29,854
Make sure you keep the place clean
and neat.

141
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:32,948
I'm not selling this house, uncle.

142
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,905
My mom won't let you, either.

143
00:14:37,022 --> 00:14:38,997
Is she able to talk to you yet?

144
00:14:40,094 --> 00:14:42,680
This house's
under my name and your mom's.

145
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,337
When she dies,
I can do anything I want with it.

146
00:14:47,582 --> 00:14:48,826
Don't forget that.

147
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,673
Who has provided for you
since you were young?

148
00:14:52,126 --> 00:14:53,621
The debt your father left us,

149
00:14:53,663 --> 00:14:55,518
who's been paying for that?

150
00:15:00,926 --> 00:15:02,268
I'm asking you now.

151
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:05,140
Have you ever thought of repaying me a bit?

152
00:15:09,758 --> 00:15:11,067
Hi, there.

153
00:15:22,911 --> 00:15:24,504
Not now, darling.

154
00:15:38,847 --> 00:15:40,669
You're sure this is the place, Prae?

155
00:15:41,663 --> 00:15:42,808
I can't believe it.

156
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:45,366
Meeting a customer at a Karaoke restaurant.

157
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,373
Okay, that's nice.

158
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:53,629
Hello, guys. What kind of room do you want?

159
00:15:54,782 --> 00:15:55,797
I'm here to talk business.

160
00:15:55,838 --> 00:15:56,766
Oh.

161
00:15:56,767 --> 00:15:59,516
They said the room is booked for Boss Pravit.

162
00:16:00,479 --> 00:16:03,326
Oh, Boss Toy, the V3 room.

163
00:16:03,391 --> 00:16:05,562
Go upstairs to the second floor,
it's on your left.

164
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:06,394
The V3 room.

165
00:16:06,431 --> 00:16:08,219
Alright, girls, escort them there.

166
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:09,725
Go ahead, sir.

167
00:16:09,726 --> 00:16:10,675
This way, please.

168
00:16:10,975 --> 00:16:12,349
The V3 room.

169
00:16:12,703 --> 00:16:14,842
Hey, candy boy, no need to hurry.

170
00:16:14,942 --> 00:16:17,495
Why don't you take
one of these cute girls with you?

171
00:16:25,502 --> 00:16:26,844
Very nice.

172
00:16:27,326 --> 00:16:29,301
Oh. Hold on now.

173
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,631
Prae, you've made it here.

174
00:16:34,111 --> 00:16:36,282
Come on in and have a seat. Sit, sit, sit.

175
00:16:36,606 --> 00:16:38,679
Can you move over a bit?

176
00:16:39,263 --> 00:16:41,150
Come on, Prae. Go ahead. Sit here.

177
00:16:41,247 --> 00:16:43,003
The customer's not here yet?

178
00:16:43,038 --> 00:16:45,755
Oh, the customer...

179
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,791
He called me to postpone the meeting
to another day.

180
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,595
Well, the room is booked
and the food is ordered.

181
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,949
So I think why not inviting you tonight.

182
00:16:59,231 --> 00:17:03,988
Here, can you fill it up with beer a bit?

183
00:17:04,862 --> 00:17:06,356
Come on here. Sit down. Sit.

184
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,699
Well, it's good that the customer bailed.

185
00:17:16,767 --> 00:17:18,523
I happened to bring my friend along.

186
00:17:18,718 --> 00:17:20,213
You brought a friend?

187
00:17:23,071 --> 00:17:25,013
Hello, I'm Lek.

188
00:17:31,934 --> 00:17:33,438
He's a colleague.

189
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,479
He works in the maintenance team.

190
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,921
Go ahead and order something.
That's a menu.

191
00:17:43,391 --> 00:17:45,114
Nah, let me help you order.

192
00:17:46,431 --> 00:17:48,570
The fish-bone spicy soup.

193
00:17:48,703 --> 00:17:51,802
The nosy sauteed salad's not bad.

194
00:17:52,926 --> 00:17:55,348
Well, the meddled pork leg is...

195
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,201
...very tasty, actually.

196
00:17:58,686 --> 00:18:00,629
Prae, I think I'll leave now.

197
00:18:01,471 --> 00:18:02,419
Hold on, Lek.

198
00:18:06,398 --> 00:18:07,707
I'm sorry.

199
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:08,862
I'm really sorry, boss.

200
00:18:08,863 --> 00:18:11,416
Gosh, now I'm a mess.

201
00:18:11,518 --> 00:18:13,242
So I'll leave now, all right?

202
00:18:14,815 --> 00:18:15,357
Come on, Lek.

203
00:18:15,358 --> 00:18:16,154
Goodbye, sir.

204
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,819
Fish-face.

205
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,972
Meddling alligator.

206
00:18:30,398 --> 00:18:33,693
Lek, are you hungry?
You haven't eaten anything.

207
00:18:34,527 --> 00:18:36,185
Wanna stop and grab some bite?

208
00:18:41,439 --> 00:18:43,162
No need to be shy.

209
00:18:43,294 --> 00:18:45,433
Think of it as my apology to you.

210
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,205
Hello?

211
00:19:10,206 --> 00:19:12,661
Hey, did you ask about how to use it for me?

212
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:13,716
Nobody knows.

213
00:19:13,758 --> 00:19:16,029
The potion must be for the body.

214
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,524
Fuckface. So...

215
00:19:17,854 --> 00:19:19,453
Just tapping it on the body and that's it?

216
00:19:19,454 --> 00:19:22,007
Just using it, man. It'll work just the same.

217
00:19:22,046 --> 00:19:22,974
Gotta go now.

218
00:19:25,118 --> 00:19:27,223
Damn it! Do me no good, you homo.

219
00:19:36,223 --> 00:19:37,237
Are you full?

220
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,197
I'm not that hungry.

221
00:19:39,999 --> 00:19:41,242
So how is it going?

222
00:19:41,438 --> 00:19:43,380
Are you getting along
with your new work place?

223
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,525
My department has only guys. It's been fun.

224
00:19:47,006 --> 00:19:48,119
That's good.

225
00:19:48,158 --> 00:19:49,751
Mine is all-girl.

226
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,765
I can't trust anybody.

227
00:19:51,966 --> 00:19:54,519
Just my boss alone
is already hard to deal with.

228
00:19:56,766 --> 00:19:59,668
If you weren't there,
I would have felt so lonely.

229
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,548
You wanna drink something?
I'll order it for you.

230
00:20:06,846 --> 00:20:08,122
Nah, I'm good.

231
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:13,748
But if you wanna order some beer, go ahead.

232
00:20:13,855 --> 00:20:14,837
Don't worry about me.

233
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,154
I can drink with you.

234
00:20:17,054 --> 00:20:18,396
You drink beer?

235
00:20:18,846 --> 00:20:20,373
Just a little bit.

236
00:20:21,118 --> 00:20:22,067
Go ahead and order.

237
00:20:22,303 --> 00:20:23,480
I'll go to toilet.

238
00:20:23,711 --> 00:20:24,856
Right. Okay.

239
00:20:35,999 --> 00:20:36,947
Hey!

240
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,418
Hey, you!

241
00:20:39,231 --> 00:20:40,030
Hey, you bastard!

242
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:40,859
Yes, sir.

243
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,780
One bottle of beer and two glasses.

244
00:20:48,606 --> 00:20:49,948
No. Don't. I'll take care of that.

245
00:20:50,046 --> 00:20:51,121
Just stick to your business.

246
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:06,365
Jon. Jongjood.

247
00:21:06,782 --> 00:21:09,597
Jongjood. Hood. Dong-i.

248
00:21:09,854 --> 00:21:11,959
Salai. Salai-i.

249
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:15,478
Jongted. Pong-i.

250
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,752
Jong-slong.

251
00:21:18,718 --> 00:21:20,093
Pong-i.

252
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:38,558
Shit!

253
00:21:44,351 --> 00:21:45,365
What?!

254
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,779
You carry it all yourself?

255
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:05,118
The waiter is busy so I thought
I'd handle it myself.

256
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,917
Cheers!

257
00:22:09,086 --> 00:22:10,548
Just one glass, okay?

258
00:22:10,846 --> 00:22:11,926
Then I'll just sit with you.

259
00:22:11,966 --> 00:22:13,111
Sure. Sure.

260
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,644
What's the matter, Prae?

261
00:22:28,446 --> 00:22:29,875
What's wrong?

262
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,255
Are you okay?

263
00:22:32,446 --> 00:22:34,039
It tastes so weird.

264
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:35,987
Weird?

265
00:22:38,846 --> 00:22:40,188
Mine tastes normal.

266
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,456
You want a new one. I can order that.

267
00:22:42,686 --> 00:22:44,955
I think it's because I don't drink it that often.

268
00:22:45,566 --> 00:22:46,613
I'll just sip along.

269
00:22:47,582 --> 00:22:48,597
Yeah, could be.

270
00:23:24,766 --> 00:23:25,748
Prae.

271
00:23:27,262 --> 00:23:28,309
Prae.

272
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,422
Are you alright?

273
00:24:34,238 --> 00:24:35,482
What are you doing, Lek?

274
00:24:40,926 --> 00:24:41,629
What the fuck?!

275
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,459
No!

276
00:24:46,206 --> 00:24:48,923
Prae. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

277
00:24:49,374 --> 00:24:50,356
Get out now!

278
00:24:50,686 --> 00:24:52,508
I'm...

279
00:24:53,406 --> 00:24:54,551
I'm sorry.

280
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,088
Get out!

281
00:27:05,086 --> 00:27:06,101
Prae.

282
00:27:06,878 --> 00:27:09,431
Prae, are you alright?

283
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,036
You want it so bad?

284
00:27:31,518 --> 00:27:34,202
You are not saying that we?

285
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:51,860
Just keep it slow.

286
00:27:55,998 --> 00:27:58,387
Whoa. That's right.

287
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,674
You've been so timid. I never thought...

288
00:28:03,965 --> 00:28:05,875
you would be on fire like this.

289
00:28:11,446 --> 00:28:13,934
You must have some feelings for me.

290
00:28:14,038 --> 00:28:15,282
Right, Prae?

291
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,496
Ghost! She's a ghost!

292
00:28:29,046 --> 00:28:30,355
No more!

293
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:39,476
Help me! Help!

294
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:44,565
No!

295
00:28:44,662 --> 00:28:45,677
No!

296
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,415
No more!

297
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:36,587
Yeah, that's right.

298
00:31:37,398 --> 00:31:38,510
Hey!

299
00:31:40,214 --> 00:31:41,807
Don't come home late again tonight.

300
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:40,686
Please do come in, officer.

301
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:42,740
This is very unusual.

302
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:46,061
We tried calling him home,
no one answered. He's gone missing.

303
00:33:14,485 --> 00:33:17,519
Prae. Going through it line by line.
Just like usual.

304
00:33:17,846 --> 00:33:18,958
Thanks.

305
00:33:48,278 --> 00:33:49,587
Excuse-me.

306
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,342
You're Prae, right?

307
00:33:52,118 --> 00:33:53,362
Thana...

308
00:33:53,685 --> 00:33:54,994
What a coincidence!

309
00:33:56,246 --> 00:33:58,580
How have you been?
We haven't met for ages.

310
00:34:00,309 --> 00:34:02,065
Since the senior year in high school...

311
00:34:02,358 --> 00:34:03,884
It's probably been 10 years now.

312
00:34:04,726 --> 00:34:06,831
Yeah, such a long time.

313
00:34:14,038 --> 00:34:16,755
I didn't mean to
stop keeping in touch with you.

314
00:34:20,438 --> 00:34:23,187
It's alright. It's nice to see you again.

315
00:34:23,669 --> 00:34:24,717
You're doing fine, right?

316
00:34:25,206 --> 00:34:26,667
Well, I can get by.

317
00:34:27,638 --> 00:34:29,907
You're in town for business?

318
00:34:32,182 --> 00:34:34,484
You remember where I used to live?

319
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:36,849
Yeah, I heard someone's renting it now.

320
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:39,601
Yeah, but I've had it renovated.

321
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:41,323
I turned it into a restaurant.

322
00:34:41,974 --> 00:34:44,461
That's why I have to
be here every weekends.

323
00:34:45,046 --> 00:34:47,915
And go back to work on Mondays.

324
00:34:48,598 --> 00:34:51,249
You could come whenever you're free, Prae.

325
00:34:53,813 --> 00:34:55,122
That's so awesome.

326
00:34:57,109 --> 00:34:58,735
I'll stop by later, okay?

327
00:34:59,893 --> 00:35:01,682
You haven't changed a bit, you know.

328
00:35:02,869 --> 00:35:04,047
How so?

329
00:35:05,397 --> 00:35:07,699
Well, back then...

330
00:35:13,269 --> 00:35:16,531
if my parents didn't have to move to Bangkok,

331
00:35:17,525 --> 00:35:19,183
it would have been great.

332
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:28,110
Well, however...

333
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:31,317
can I have your number?

334
00:35:33,718 --> 00:35:34,830
Sure.

335
00:35:43,029 --> 00:35:45,200
Okay. This is my number.

336
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,179
I'll have to go now.

337
00:35:47,766 --> 00:35:49,740
Let's catch up next time.

338
00:36:38,902 --> 00:36:40,079
Prae,

339
00:36:42,038 --> 00:36:42,670
Yes?

340
00:36:42,709 --> 00:36:44,302
Boss Toy wants to see you.

341
00:36:45,878 --> 00:36:47,918
Oh, hey, Prae. You're here.

342
00:36:48,629 --> 00:36:50,004
Come on in.

343
00:36:50,645 --> 00:36:52,533
This is Inspector Eak.

344
00:36:52,598 --> 00:36:53,580
Hi.

345
00:36:54,006 --> 00:36:55,467
Sit down. Have a seat.

346
00:36:56,693 --> 00:36:57,838
You're Prae, right?

347
00:36:58,038 --> 00:37:00,307
Boss Pravit said that you and Lek are close.

348
00:37:01,909 --> 00:37:05,040
Yes. We've been friends
since junior high school.

349
00:37:05,141 --> 00:37:06,221
What's going on?

350
00:37:19,349 --> 00:37:20,626
Well, actually,

351
00:37:20,693 --> 00:37:24,108
when someone's gone missing less
than 24 hours,

352
00:37:24,853 --> 00:37:26,479
there's nothing wrong.

353
00:37:26,773 --> 00:37:28,366
Except for this man's case.

354
00:37:29,141 --> 00:37:31,345
Yesterday, he was picking up
some cash for the company.

355
00:37:31,989 --> 00:37:35,819
Last night, he had over 400 grand with him.

356
00:37:41,589 --> 00:37:43,116
According to the procedure,

357
00:37:43,414 --> 00:37:47,440
he's supposed to deposit this
money to the company's account.

358
00:37:48,245 --> 00:37:50,831
But up until now, 1:50 pm,

359
00:37:50,902 --> 00:37:52,876
nothing's in the system yet.

360
00:37:54,293 --> 00:37:57,195
Moreover, Lek cannot be reached at all.

361
00:37:57,718 --> 00:37:59,757
Considering that you're close to Lek,

362
00:38:00,373 --> 00:38:01,715
I would like to ask you

363
00:38:02,037 --> 00:38:04,787
whether you know where he is.

364
00:38:07,797 --> 00:38:09,324
I really have no idea.

365
00:38:17,526 --> 00:38:18,867
Sayan.

366
00:38:28,086 --> 00:38:29,034
Puckish.

367
00:38:30,549 --> 00:38:33,200
I've been told that last night
you picked Lek up

368
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:34,927
and left together.

369
00:38:36,341 --> 00:38:40,083
Yes. Boss Pravit set up a
meeting with me and our customer.

370
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:44,204
That's right. The customer called
and postponed it.

371
00:38:49,685 --> 00:38:51,147
I asked Lek to accompany me.

372
00:38:51,253 --> 00:38:54,123
You shouldn't have brought that fuck-face.

373
00:38:54,197 --> 00:38:57,045
That meddling dick ruined my mood.

374
00:38:57,269 --> 00:38:59,124
Boss Pravit told me

375
00:39:00,118 --> 00:39:02,256
you and Lek were sitting there
only a little while

376
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,625
and left the place together.

377
00:39:03,637 --> 00:39:06,158
Yes. At the same time.

378
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,822
Only the two of them.

379
00:39:08,469 --> 00:39:10,160
So if that's the case,

380
00:39:11,605 --> 00:39:14,736
you are the last person who saw him,
correct?

381
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:17,844
You should know where he was going.

382
00:39:18,037 --> 00:39:19,630
Or at least, you could tell me

383
00:39:19,669 --> 00:39:21,906
where you were going with him
after you guys left.

384
00:39:22,421 --> 00:39:23,948
Think hard.

385
00:39:28,053 --> 00:39:32,112
Otherwise, you'll be an accomplice
of an embezzlement case.

386
00:39:33,878 --> 00:39:36,082
Hold on, officer.

387
00:39:37,237 --> 00:39:39,474
It shouldn't be that serious.

388
00:39:41,077 --> 00:39:46,544
I, personally, don't think
Prae is that kind of person.

389
00:39:49,365 --> 00:39:50,674
So you know it or not?

390
00:39:50,773 --> 00:39:52,366
Where is Lek now?

391
00:39:52,949 --> 00:39:54,291
I know nothing about that.

392
00:39:54,549 --> 00:39:56,621
How can she know?

393
00:39:56,853 --> 00:40:00,170
Last night, she was with me.

394
00:40:00,502 --> 00:40:05,390
That fuck-face duck face headed home alone.

395
00:40:05,558 --> 00:40:10,314
Me and Prae, we were having dinner there

396
00:40:10,549 --> 00:40:12,076
til we were more than full.

397
00:40:12,245 --> 00:40:15,922
Then we each went our separate ways, right?

398
00:40:16,405 --> 00:40:17,716
Huh? But you said...

399
00:40:17,717 --> 00:40:19,473
Oh, I forgot it.

400
00:40:19,637 --> 00:40:21,939
It just came to my mind now.

401
00:40:22,645 --> 00:40:24,270
Let's say it like this:

402
00:40:24,597 --> 00:40:27,631
When anything comes to your mind again,
call me.

403
00:40:27,829 --> 00:40:30,001
I'm tired of this shit.

404
00:40:32,245 --> 00:40:33,357
Sayan, let's go.

405
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:50,515
I feel something in my bones.

406
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:53,297
Something bad must have happened...

407
00:40:55,733 --> 00:40:56,910
for sure.

408
00:41:09,397 --> 00:41:15,278
Prae, now you owe me, you know that?

409
00:41:15,638 --> 00:41:17,677
I really don't know where Lek is.

410
00:41:18,069 --> 00:41:22,291
Okay. Alright. You don't have
to tell me that now. Later.

411
00:41:23,125 --> 00:41:24,532
For now,

412
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:29,452
let me buy you one meal to calm you down.

413
00:41:29,845 --> 00:41:34,318
See, I know where we can
get good bouncy meatballs.

414
00:41:34,581 --> 00:41:38,804
I bet you'll be addicted to it.

415
00:41:42,197 --> 00:41:43,953
Here you are, the bouncy pork.

416
00:41:52,118 --> 00:41:54,703
Excuse-me.
Where is the man who came with me?

417
00:41:54,741 --> 00:41:56,432
He's taking a shower over there, Ma'am.

418
00:41:56,629 --> 00:41:57,396
Taking a shower?

419
00:41:57,397 --> 00:41:58,063
Yes, Ma'am.

420
00:42:03,957 --> 00:42:05,167
It's hot and humid.

421
00:42:05,205 --> 00:42:08,466
A shower can make you
feel much more refreshing.

422
00:42:08,789 --> 00:42:10,699
But, boss, we agreed to
just have dinner together.

423
00:42:12,085 --> 00:42:13,808
Calm down.

424
00:42:15,605 --> 00:42:18,954
They make good bouncy meatballs here.

425
00:42:22,997 --> 00:42:24,458
And that thing with the police,

426
00:42:24,789 --> 00:42:26,796
I put my neck on the line for you.

427
00:42:27,029 --> 00:42:30,706
You see now how much I care about you?

428
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:34,703
400,000 baht is totally nothing for me.

429
00:42:35,989 --> 00:42:39,502
I just want you to repay me some time.

430
00:42:39,637 --> 00:42:41,546
Just a little bit.

431
00:42:43,509 --> 00:42:45,418
I think you misunderstood me, boss.

432
00:42:46,037 --> 00:42:49,135
Hold on. Hold on, Prae. Wait, please.

433
00:42:50,677 --> 00:42:52,947
If you're doing this to me,

434
00:42:53,717 --> 00:42:57,230
plus that friend of yours who
stole the company's money,

435
00:42:58,101 --> 00:43:00,468
I think you can definitely get into trouble.

436
00:43:00,853 --> 00:43:03,341
It's not what you and the police think.

437
00:43:03,797 --> 00:43:05,902
Lek did leave the restaurant with me.

438
00:43:06,069 --> 00:43:07,956
But on the way, I fell asleep.

439
00:43:08,213 --> 00:43:10,001
And Lek tried to...

440
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:16,267
The fact that Lek went missing
or that money thing

441
00:43:16,405 --> 00:43:17,615
has nothing to do with me.

442
00:43:17,909 --> 00:43:19,819
Hold on. Alright then.

443
00:43:20,629 --> 00:43:24,207
Just come up to the room
and tell me the whole story.

444
00:43:24,725 --> 00:43:27,278
I can listen to you all night long.

445
00:43:27,477 --> 00:43:28,425
Let go of me.

446
00:43:29,077 --> 00:43:30,190
Let me go, boss.

447
00:43:31,189 --> 00:43:34,702
Let's think of this as an early year-end bonus.

448
00:44:02,805 --> 00:44:03,700
When did you find him?

449
00:44:03,701 --> 00:44:05,042
Early in the evening.

450
00:44:05,717 --> 00:44:07,756
These two civilians found him, sir.

451
00:44:49,717 --> 00:44:51,659
I never dream that this would come true.

452
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,796
What do you want me to do first?

453
00:44:56,629 --> 00:44:59,051
Take off your top? Sure.

454
00:45:00,949 --> 00:45:01,810
Not good?

455
00:45:02,037 --> 00:45:05,386
Then your skirt. Let's take your skirt off.

456
00:45:05,717 --> 00:45:08,750
Why now? Not the skirt?

457
00:45:11,829 --> 00:45:13,968
I know now.

458
00:45:15,061 --> 00:45:16,654
You like it in uniform, right?

459
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:33,231
Wow.

460
00:45:33,909 --> 00:45:35,218
Blue.

461
00:45:37,685 --> 00:45:39,179
That's right.

462
00:45:39,253 --> 00:45:41,041
Just like my taste.

463
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:44,564
I'm going in now.

464
00:45:58,317 --> 00:46:00,041
I'll give it to you.

465
00:46:09,518 --> 00:46:11,722
So this is how it feels.

466
00:46:14,925 --> 00:46:16,202
Are you awake now, darling?

467
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:17,546
Just do nothing.

468
00:46:17,774 --> 00:46:18,722
Let me give it to you.

469
00:46:24,941 --> 00:46:27,113
Oh, lord has mercy.

470
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:30,277
Zeus bless me. Oh my god.

471
00:46:34,285 --> 00:46:35,562
I cum. I cum.

472
00:46:36,526 --> 00:46:37,387
Ghost!

473
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:39,561
Help me! Help me!

474
00:46:40,814 --> 00:46:41,577
Get off!

475
00:46:42,606 --> 00:46:46,762
Shit. Ghost. Ghost. Ghost.

476
00:47:23,278 --> 00:47:24,652
Hello? Yes.

477
00:47:31,054 --> 00:47:32,199
That's right.

478
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:40,678
Really?

479
00:47:43,726 --> 00:47:44,838
When?

480
00:47:54,606 --> 00:47:56,461
What do I have to do now?

481
00:48:06,574 --> 00:48:07,588
Mhm.

482
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:10,470
I will donor her body.

483
00:48:18,158 --> 00:48:20,580
I've arranged everything for the hospital.

484
00:48:48,845 --> 00:48:53,930
"House on hot sale."

485
00:49:20,205 --> 00:49:21,863
Who fucks you best?

486
00:49:24,238 --> 00:49:25,699
Who's the best?

487
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:27,404
You, sir!

488
00:49:27,918 --> 00:49:29,444
You, sir!

489
00:49:32,366 --> 00:49:34,635
Shit. Fucking bitch.

490
00:49:35,469 --> 00:49:37,160
You never saw people fuck?

491
00:49:40,398 --> 00:49:42,787
Stupid whore. Just like your damn mother.

492
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:44,812
Don't ever show your face here again.

493
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:13,604
Oh, hey, Prae.

494
00:50:21,517 --> 00:50:24,551
What about your mom? How is she?

495
00:50:25,549 --> 00:50:28,037
You looks not good

496
00:50:32,302 --> 00:50:33,382
Oh, my mom?

497
00:50:37,677 --> 00:50:39,238
She's better now.

498
00:50:41,325 --> 00:50:43,235
Hey, can I have the bill?

499
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:44,520
We're closing, sir.

500
00:50:44,589 --> 00:50:45,963
Bring me the bill, then.

501
00:50:49,518 --> 00:50:53,740
Prae, there are rooms available
next to our restaurant.

502
00:50:54,445 --> 00:50:57,991
If you still don't want to go home,
you can rest here.

503
00:51:04,365 --> 00:51:05,642
Take some rest here, Prae.

504
00:51:06,094 --> 00:51:07,620
I'm around here anyway.

505
00:51:12,909 --> 00:51:14,316
Thank you.

506
00:51:15,694 --> 00:51:17,100
But I'd rather not.

507
00:51:21,069 --> 00:51:23,076
We can split here.

508
00:51:29,005 --> 00:51:31,623
Prae, are you sure that you
can go home alone?

509
00:51:39,598 --> 00:51:42,467
What about Ning? Is she fine?

510
00:51:43,021 --> 00:51:44,844
We broke up long time ago.

511
00:51:45,645 --> 00:51:46,987
It just didn't work.

512
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:49,317
Just like you said.

513
00:51:58,925 --> 00:52:00,583
Then I'll leave now.

514
00:52:01,901 --> 00:52:04,203
Thanks for keeping me company.

515
00:53:52,397 --> 00:53:55,244
I'm... I'm sorry, Prae.

516
00:53:58,029 --> 00:53:59,458
I think...

517
00:54:05,101 --> 00:54:06,989
I think we shouldn't do it yet.

518
00:54:15,885 --> 00:54:17,892
I don't know how to explain.

519
00:54:18,413 --> 00:54:20,584
There's something weird happening to me.

520
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:26,665
Prae, you don't need to be afraid.

521
00:54:27,917 --> 00:54:31,266
We are always meant to be, you know.

522
00:54:32,941 --> 00:54:37,219
If anything's meant to happen, just let it be.

523
00:58:44,429 --> 00:58:46,317
You're the one who captured Pravit?

524
00:58:46,349 --> 00:58:47,277
Yes, sir.

525
00:58:47,757 --> 00:58:49,318
Last night, he was running out naked,

526
00:58:49,357 --> 00:58:51,496
shouting about some ghost in the market.

527
00:58:51,757 --> 00:58:53,929
So I put him here to calm him down.

528
00:58:55,469 --> 00:58:57,378
I heard him raving the whole night.

529
00:58:58,541 --> 00:59:01,388
Then this morning, I found him like this.

530
00:59:04,844 --> 00:59:07,233
This shit is getting out of control.

531
00:59:19,405 --> 00:59:20,834
I saw you smiling.

532
00:59:21,965 --> 00:59:23,274
Why were you smiling?

533
00:59:29,965 --> 00:59:31,459
He fell for a spell.

534
00:59:31,597 --> 00:59:32,971
My spell.

535
00:59:41,324 --> 00:59:42,983
You understand what he says?

536
00:59:43,437 --> 00:59:44,517
No, sir.

537
00:59:49,037 --> 00:59:50,499
What is he in for?

538
00:59:53,773 --> 00:59:56,740
Someone accused him of making potions.

539
00:59:57,709 --> 00:59:59,596
He's waiting to be identified today.

540
01:00:06,157 --> 01:00:07,269
What do you know?

541
01:00:07,341 --> 01:00:08,683
Want to tell me about it?

542
01:00:14,701 --> 01:00:17,319
If I do, would you let me out?

543
01:00:33,037 --> 01:00:34,630
It's a long story.

544
01:00:36,685 --> 01:00:37,830
It has to do with...

545
01:00:37,964 --> 01:00:39,109
the Virgo woman

546
01:00:39,725 --> 01:00:40,838
who entrusted

547
01:00:41,037 --> 01:00:42,019
her heart

548
01:00:42,316 --> 01:00:43,244
her body

549
01:00:43,245 --> 01:00:44,357
and her life

550
01:00:45,325 --> 01:00:47,212
to this one and only guy.

551
01:01:37,229 --> 01:01:38,636
Before she found out

552
01:01:38,989 --> 01:01:42,055
that she was too naive.

553
01:01:59,917 --> 01:02:02,732
The reality hit her in the face.

554
01:02:04,109 --> 01:02:05,833
Love... does not exist.

555
01:02:09,197 --> 01:02:11,717
But what's worse is that she was pregnant

556
01:02:13,357 --> 01:02:14,571
with a baby...

557
01:02:14,572 --> 01:02:16,394
that no one wanted.

558
01:02:31,213 --> 01:02:33,067
That's where you came in, right?

559
01:02:51,468 --> 01:02:53,705
I will revenge you all.

560
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:55,333
I will haunt you,

561
01:02:55,437 --> 01:02:57,444
damn you for all your life!

562
01:02:57,709 --> 01:02:59,269
I will haunt you,

563
01:03:00,429 --> 01:03:02,436
damn you for all your life!

564
01:03:02,572 --> 01:03:04,296
I will haunt you!

565
01:03:04,748 --> 01:03:07,748
The blood and pus
from the unforgiving woman

566
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:09,355
was processed in the ancient voodoo cult

567
01:03:09,356 --> 01:03:10,982
and reunited with the spirit.

568
01:03:11,085 --> 01:03:12,492
If you use it right,

569
01:03:12,524 --> 01:03:14,150
it will manipulate the fire of lust

570
01:03:14,925 --> 01:03:16,451
that belongs to its slaves.

571
01:03:16,589 --> 01:03:18,247
But if someone's using it...

572
01:03:18,637 --> 01:03:20,360
with no regard of the ancient rules:

573
01:03:20,524 --> 01:03:22,412
Stealing the love potion...

574
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:23,784
using force...

575
01:03:23,885 --> 01:03:25,227
without the owner's consent,

576
01:03:25,357 --> 01:03:27,594
they must face the consequences

577
01:03:28,044 --> 01:03:30,532
and they can never control the vengeful spirit.

578
01:03:36,492 --> 01:03:39,143
Someone took love potion from you?

579
01:03:41,101 --> 01:03:42,377
It was...

580
01:03:45,324 --> 01:03:47,146
taken away from me

581
01:03:48,077 --> 01:03:49,287
since the first day...

582
01:03:49,389 --> 01:03:51,112
I ever put my feet on this country.

583
01:03:58,252 --> 01:04:01,798
The potion you talked about
used to be in here, right?

584
01:04:07,725 --> 01:04:09,318
Human Resource Manager

585
01:04:26,221 --> 01:04:28,075
He was running naked in the market at night.

586
01:04:46,508 --> 01:04:47,621
Hello?

587
01:04:48,045 --> 01:04:50,117
Hi, Prae.

588
01:04:50,733 --> 01:04:52,391
Why didn't you wake me up this morning?

589
01:04:53,069 --> 01:04:54,695
It's a good thing I didn't.

590
01:04:55,981 --> 01:04:59,909
Oh, really? Well, about last night...

591
01:05:01,549 --> 01:05:03,436
Are you alright?

592
01:05:03,852 --> 01:05:05,892
Yeah, I'm fine.

593
01:05:06,764 --> 01:05:09,514
I told you, don't worry.

594
01:05:10,476 --> 01:05:11,753
But...

595
01:05:12,109 --> 01:05:16,331
It's not that I don't believe you. But last night,

596
01:05:16,717 --> 01:05:19,434
we proved that there's nothing.

597
01:05:23,084 --> 01:05:24,513
You're right...

598
01:05:25,612 --> 01:05:26,822
Good, then.

599
01:05:27,948 --> 01:05:31,145
So can we meet again today?

600
01:05:32,332 --> 01:05:34,187
I miss you.

601
01:05:54,028 --> 01:05:57,858
Thana, let's not see each other for a while.

602
01:05:58,029 --> 01:06:01,957
Why, Prae? But we...

603
01:06:02,092 --> 01:06:03,750
I've gotta go now.

604
01:06:04,236 --> 01:06:06,473
I miss you, too, you know.

605
01:06:06,764 --> 01:06:08,357
Let me get back to you.

606
01:07:36,748 --> 01:07:39,269
I just checked out the footage

607
01:07:40,332 --> 01:07:44,391
from the mini-mart close to where you
and Lek were eating the other night.

608
01:07:51,117 --> 01:07:53,964
I followed the trace of you that night.

609
01:07:54,188 --> 01:07:55,595
I found this.

610
01:08:05,804 --> 01:08:06,949
Have you seen it before?

611
01:08:07,885 --> 01:08:08,812
Never.

612
01:08:10,829 --> 01:08:12,552
Do you know 'Boss Tong'?

613
01:08:13,388 --> 01:08:14,501
No, sir.

614
01:08:26,412 --> 01:08:27,623
I think...

615
01:08:28,205 --> 01:08:31,554
I can get you some explanation on this

616
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:33,187
but probably not all of it.

617
01:08:35,084 --> 01:08:39,208
This kind of thing happened to a
dirty old man who's already dead.

618
01:08:39,436 --> 01:08:41,225
I don't want it to ever happen again.

619
01:08:41,804 --> 01:08:42,982
What happened?

620
01:08:46,189 --> 01:08:49,985
Some women fall under the spell
that's gone wrong,

621
01:08:50,797 --> 01:08:55,434
making those men
they slept with die or go mad

622
01:08:56,076 --> 01:08:57,865
again and again.

623
01:09:03,469 --> 01:09:05,770
Are you saying that I'm one of them?

624
01:09:13,548 --> 01:09:15,304
Are there anyways to revoke the spell?

625
01:09:17,932 --> 01:09:21,544
There's a way to get that
black magic out of you.

626
01:09:24,845 --> 01:09:26,371
You can do that?

627
01:09:29,452 --> 01:09:30,913
Someone can.

628
01:09:33,196 --> 01:09:34,625
But the woman

629
01:09:34,988 --> 01:09:36,199
has to cooperate.

630
01:09:53,228 --> 01:09:54,657
Let me ask you frankly,

631
01:09:55,628 --> 01:09:56,970
in these past few days,

632
01:09:57,004 --> 01:10:00,168
you remember whom you have slept with?

633
01:10:01,581 --> 01:10:02,922
Does it matter?

634
01:10:06,989 --> 01:10:08,876
If you are under the potion from this bottle,

635
01:10:08,909 --> 01:10:12,007
you probably can't remember or realize it.

636
01:10:12,749 --> 01:10:14,756
But for those men you slept with,

637
01:10:16,044 --> 01:10:17,669
there's a real danger.

638
01:10:18,764 --> 01:10:20,225
It can't be true, then.

639
01:10:21,548 --> 01:10:23,141
Because he just called me.

640
01:10:23,212 --> 01:10:24,935
He sounded normal.

641
01:10:30,572 --> 01:10:31,979
Are you sure...

642
01:10:32,876 --> 01:10:34,120
that he's alright?

643
01:12:45,516 --> 01:12:46,825
Someone's here for you.

644
01:12:49,068 --> 01:12:52,102
Oh, Prae, didn't you tell me you want
some time off?

645
01:12:56,428 --> 01:12:58,086
We haven't met for ages, Prae.

646
01:12:58,284 --> 01:13:01,797
We've been together for so long.
Our fire's never burnt out.

647
01:13:05,132 --> 01:13:06,626
Wanna join, Prae?

648
01:13:07,948 --> 01:13:09,158
What do you say, Prae?

649
01:13:09,196 --> 01:13:10,123
It's such fun.

650
01:13:13,676 --> 01:13:14,724
Cool.

651
01:13:16,012 --> 01:13:17,866
I've always wanted to try it.

652
01:13:22,188 --> 01:13:23,464
What's this?

653
01:13:23,564 --> 01:13:25,157
You'll see.

654
01:13:25,548 --> 01:13:26,825
No. Come on.

655
01:13:29,708 --> 01:13:31,912
Hey, Prae, why are you standing there?

656
01:13:32,012 --> 01:13:33,092
Come on in.

657
01:13:35,212 --> 01:13:37,251
Thana, Prae is here.

658
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:42,951
Cool. It's down here, right?

659
01:13:46,468 --> 01:13:49,021
Yeah. Why not.

660
01:13:57,092 --> 01:13:59,994
I told you, Prae. We're meant to be.

661
01:15:11,747 --> 01:15:12,826
Ning.

662
01:15:13,602 --> 01:15:14,584
Ning.

663
01:15:14,851 --> 01:15:15,680
Shit!

664
01:15:16,579 --> 01:15:18,750
Ning! Ning, what's wrong with you?

665
01:16:12,547 --> 01:16:13,856
Dear Inspector,

666
01:16:14,690 --> 01:16:17,309
I'm aware that you've been
investigating this case for a while.

667
01:16:18,082 --> 01:16:20,834
You must think I am the cause of it all,

668
01:16:20,835 --> 01:16:24,632
the one who's hurt Lek, the manager, Thana

669
01:16:24,867 --> 01:16:26,754
and probably, Boss Tong

670
01:16:27,203 --> 01:16:30,465
or any other guys that you're aware of.

671
01:16:32,003 --> 01:16:34,752
In fact, there's more to it.

672
01:16:35,619 --> 01:16:38,488
It's much more complicated than you knew.

673
01:16:39,331 --> 01:16:42,909
Well, I have no need to tell you about it.

674
01:16:43,171 --> 01:16:45,113
"House on hot sale."

675
01:16:45,539 --> 01:16:47,546
You must be wondering

676
01:16:47,842 --> 01:16:52,152
about why I left this note to you, then.

677
01:16:53,187 --> 01:16:56,057
I just don't want you to
waste your precious time.

678
01:16:56,611 --> 01:16:58,466
A good cop like you

679
01:16:58,658 --> 01:17:00,764
should be spending time
pursuing other cases

680
01:17:00,803 --> 01:17:03,552
that are more beneficial for the people.

681
01:17:07,939 --> 01:17:10,306
I just want you to quit tracking me down.

682
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:12,475
Quit finding the truth.

683
01:17:12,642 --> 01:17:13,984
Because, in the end,

684
01:17:14,018 --> 01:17:17,815
you'll never know what really happened.

685
01:17:19,395 --> 01:17:21,370
You should just let me go.

686
01:17:21,667 --> 01:17:25,442
There're a lot of bad guys
out there who deserve it.

687
01:17:25,667 --> 01:17:27,390
So long, Inspector.

688
01:17:27,554 --> 01:17:29,758
I hope we'll never meet again.
