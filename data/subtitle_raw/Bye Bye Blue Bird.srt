1
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:32,310
I don't suppose we could have the penthouse,
madame?

2
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,319
Did you do the decorating yourselves?

3
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,309
Welcome to the Faroe Islands.
We wish you a pleasant stay.

4
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,318
Rooms are only 300 Dkr per night.

5
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,318
A quick drink?

6
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,316
We're here to have some fun

7
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,319
We could put our pictures in the papers.

8
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:48,310
No, it's better to show up without warning.

9
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,319
Shit, I forgot to tell dad.
He has no idea where I am.

10
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,360
Hey dad. I bet you don't know
where I am right now.

11
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,360
Not Berlin ...

12
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,316
Not London either.

13
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:34,360
Actually I'm in ... the Faroes.

14
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,319
The land of your roots, you know.

15
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,751
Dad, are you still there?

16
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,116
But we were supposed to stay away from her!
Now what do I do?

17
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,360
I don't give a shit about your agreement .

18
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,360
You were the one who promised to leave here
alone. Not me.

19
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,319
Don't be so pathetic.

20
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,319
I just want to see her
reaction when she sees me.

21
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,360
Well, you could have come up here some more
with me.

22
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:22,310
Yes, I know you should have left me with her back
then.

23
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,318
Oh, don't cry, -

24
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,318
- you don't trust me any more.

25
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,360
I've got to go, daddy.

26
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,319
I love you no matter what.
You're the best.

27
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,319
That's all folks.

28
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,319
What if I don't recognize her?

29
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,316
That's her.

30
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,318
Hi, love. Give us a kiss.

31
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,360
How the hell did she make
a Dane come and live up here?

32
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,318
I'll bet he's an islander too.

33
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,318
Let's wait till tomorrow, eh?

34
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,309
So you still want to do it?

35
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,360
This is the first thing I remember from when I was
little.

36
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,318
Have you tried the other way?

37
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,318
Welcome to the Faroes, Barba.

38
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,316
Hey, God.

39
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,318
I'm ready now.

40
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,315
Damn kids.

41
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,309
Aren't you going to tell her?
- Shut up. Let me do this.

42
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,360
It can't be ...
- Why not?

43
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,316
What's happening?

44
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,319
What are a pair of clowns
like you doing here?

45
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,309
Anybody you know?
- We might just be family.

46
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,319
Well, what are you trying to pull?

47
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,316
You'd better stop that.

48
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,360
Thanks for lending me these -

49
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,360
It's 19 years ago today.

50
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:39,309
I did like them once
a long time ago.

51
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,309
What do you think you're doing?
What's wrong, baby?

52
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,316
Stop that right now.

53
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,318
How long do you think
you'll play mama this time?

54
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:25,360
"Dearest mama, I want to sleep,
my eyes are heavy"

55
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:33,313
"Jesus will take care of me."

56
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:40,310
"Dearest mama, tuck me in..."

57
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,316
What the hell's going on here.?

58
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,309
Have you seen two crazy girls
run past here? ... Thanks.

59
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,309
So you girls are
looking for a ride?
Yes.

60
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,360
I'm going up north.

61
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,360
So are we. We're going to see Rannvá's parents.
Shouldn't we just forget the whole thing?

62
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:37,310
Well, you can come with me
- if a long detour is OK with you?

63
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:59,277
Hello love. Don't bother
dressing up in Faroese wool.

64
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:15,277
You'll always just be a Dane.

65
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,319
I love the zebra, don't you?

66
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,318
Yes, did you do it yourself?
Yes.

67
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,318
What are you going up north for?

68
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,316
Well ... business.

69
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,318
So are we.

70
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,318
Stop. Let me out.

71
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:25,310
Are you crazy? Don't you know
the air in here is dangerous?

72
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,360
Why the hell did you have to drag me up here?

73
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,318
I have nothing to do here.
I'm not ready yet.

74
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,360
I just thought you missed them. That's all.

75
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,318
I didn't know ...
- What the hell do you know?

76
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:51,276
No. I just don't understand:
You have a good family here.

77
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:57,360
It's all right, but not too fast.
I just need some time.

78
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,360
No problem. I've got lots of business to do on the
way.

79
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,360
But let's get out of here before the gnomes think
we live here.

80
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,316
You're not pregnant, are you?

81
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,319
I'd have beaten you up
if you were.

82
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:58,360
Yes, imagine what healthy and happy kids you'd
have.

83
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,318
This is going to take a while...

84
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,360
Just two points.

85
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,309
I thought moustaches were out up here.

86
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,318
Nice profile.

87
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,309
Did you see him?
Almost too good to be true.

88
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,319
But he probably gets pissed every weekend -

89
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,318
- while his wife's at home with the kids, right?

90
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,360
Rúni, do you also drink
and fuck around every weekend -

91
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,319
- while your wife's at home with the kids? Do you?

92
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:13,309
Blah blah. Is that all you got out of going abroad for
so long?

93
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,318
Now look.

94
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,360
No, I don't want you
to go over there.

95
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,318
Don't go. I don't want you to.

96
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,319
So you want to fuck with me,
you no good sailor?

97
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,360
Are you so far gone you need two whores?

98
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,319
No friends left?

99
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,360
It's a bit late
to shut up, isn't it?

100
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,360
You had to babble about it
on the radio, didn't you?

101
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:59,309
You're done with fishing, you .. blabber mouth.
What's that?

102
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,360
Leave my friends alone.

103
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,309
Do your wife's little secrets bother you?

104
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,319
Don't worry. She'll probably wash your bum for you
tonight.

105
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,318
She's in that yellow car.

106
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,318
I can feel it.

107
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,316
Rúni, what was he going on about?

108
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:47,309
No idea. He's just a confused Dane who's bored up
here.

109
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:10,310
I need to do something here.
You can go to the village hall.

110
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,319
You should have gone with us tonight, Rúni.
What a waste.

111
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,309
Your dad must be good with the ladies.
Ha. They find him - not the other way around.

112
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,360
Brigitte, 25 years old.
Slept all morning -

113
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:09,360
Smelling sweetly of sweat.
She gave me chocolate all day,-

114
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,319
- and showed me
the starsigns in the sky.

115
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:19,360
A man came and took her away, said she was his.
Disappeared.

116
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:26,360
Joanne, 30, a boozer.
Never slept.

117
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:31,360
She could make porridge
and sing opera.

118
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,360
Always well dressed -
I borrowed her clothes.

119
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:40,360
One day she fell ill,
Perhaps from drinking.

120
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,318
Disappeared.

121
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:52,360
HeIene, 27, very shy.

122
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:58,360
Smelled like a mother.

123
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:02,360
Steaks and chocolate pudding every day.

124
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:06,360
Always cried when she read
sad stories to me.

125
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,360
She said I was good
at consoling her.

126
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,360
Her tears drove my father crazy.

127
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,319
She's in a closed ward now.

128
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:30,310
Are you never afraid there's a camera
behind the mirror?

129
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:37,309
I often think people send evil eyes to me
from their windows.

130
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,319
Then I have to wave at them
To get rid of their spell.

131
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,360
When something good happens to me
I hardly dare tell anyone.

132
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,360
That's just Nemesis.

133
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:55,360
I often imagine that I am
somebody else I'd rather be.

134
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,319
Michelle Pfeiffer,
and then she's me.

135
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:04,360
But everybody keeps pretending I'm still me.

136
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:10,310
I'll tell you if you suddenly turn into some screen
bimbo.

137
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:30,360
There's a phone in the room.
Who says I need to call anybody?

138
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,318
It's written all over you.

139
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:48,309
What the hell are you up to?
What's in it for you?

140
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:00,360
Hello, this is Faroese Pool Promoters. Is your
mother in?

141
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,360
Ok.

142
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:08,360
My little brother says she'll be gone for a few days.

143
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,318
Everybody's got their own thing.

144
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,309
You gutless arseholes!
This is a bloody conspiracy!

145
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:27,310
Kill all those rich idiots!
All I'm asking for is a chance!

146
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,318
Rúni?

147
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:38,319
I just told the truth.
You'll never get rid of me!

148
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:20,360
Rúni, drive down to the village,
I want to talk to somebody.

149
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:27,360
I've never talked to them before,
I've only seen them from far away

150
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,318
Do you want to come?

151
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:36,319
Who is it?
Remember: no secrets.

152
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,319
My mother's parents . .
Grandma and grandpa.

153
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,360
Rúni, why don't you go for a little ride around the
village?

154
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,360
Maybe you'll find a pub with some strippers in it?

155
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,316
See you later.

156
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,360
Nobody having anything to do with our former
daughter is welcome.

157
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:36,360
Your mother was led astray by your sinful father
before getting the Lord's blessing.

158
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,360
And therefore her daughter is unclean.

159
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,360
Excuse me. Do you know what year this is?

160
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,360
Original sin has no age.

161
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:51,309
Probably not. But we must have got it from you,
grandma.

162
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:57,309
Close the door please.
It's getting cold inside.

163
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:10,319
Don't be too sure the pearly gates of Heaven will
open for you.

164
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,360
Here's all the ungodly family.

165
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:24,276
Sweet dreams to all the things we could have done
together. Bye.

166
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:37,273
Great Rannvá.
Off you go now.

167
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,309
I think they know by now.
What the hell do you know?

168
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:54,311
Don't leave us with them.
No, I'd prefer real Hell.

169
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:12,360
"Thoughts in pride are in my mind,
Falseness, envy, hate I feel."

170
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:16,360
"Our Father, please, be kind - "

171
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:21,309
Show me quick how I may heal."

172
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,309
This guy's life is probably already planned for him.
He just doesn't know it yet.

173
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,318
He'll probably never meet
someone like me again.

174
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,360
Do you have to flirt with everybody on the way?

175
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:06,360
We're here to have fun, remember?
I've never been with a Faroese guy before.

176
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:13,360
He's a real daddy's boy
on his way into politics.
Probably lived his first years in Denmark -

177
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:18,360
- and now he talks too much
and thinks too little.

178
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:22,360
Yeah, real Faroese don't talk much.
First they think long and deep -

179
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:27,360
- then they do all they can
to keep it all to themselves.

180
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,559
Why are you so boring?
I just want to know what a Faroese guy is like.

181
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,714
Mama would know... though she's with a bloody
Dane now.

182
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:41,074
What the hell do the Danes have to do with it?
- I hope you'll have it all settled before I come
back.

183
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,319
I just saw someone who owes me a favour.

184
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,360
You're not jealous, are you?

185
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:54,310
I just want to play with him.

186
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,319
Your father should see you now.

187
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:16,360
That was fun.

188
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:21,360
He really believes I'm Lulu from France who's lost
her way.

189
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:25,319
He's good with compliments.
My knees went all soft.

190
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:42,360
Why don't people just give each other compliments
all day?

191
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:49,311
Like: that grim face really becomes you, Rannvá.

192
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,318
- Do you want to talk about it?
- No.

193
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:33,309
- Rúni, come here.
- Jesus.

194
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:43,360
Wait, Rúni.
Do you know this guy?

195
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:49,360
Please, go over there. Well, you asked for it.

196
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:54,309
Nobody's on board till next week.
Flemish Cap for three months.

197
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,318
Come out here.

198
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:13,360
So you're the girls dragging poor Rúni all over the
country.

199
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:17,360
I know all about you girls.
- Surprise, surprise.

200
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,318
The first mate himself.
- Really.

201
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,316
Come on.

202
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:32,309
Here's to Rúni.
The best, most stubborn and stupidest sailor of all.

203
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:39,360
He seems to enjoy breaking all the unwritten rules
of this country.

204
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:44,360
Our dear first mate here is known for his
bullshitting.

205
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,360
It was your big mouth
that said on national TV -

206
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:51,360
how you and the other small fishermen got drunk -

207
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:56,309
with the large shipowners who then could make
you sign anything.

208
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,360
And for that,
my beautiful damsels, -

209
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:11,360
he's been blacklisted all over this pretty little land.

210
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:17,360
And now look at him: a lonely stubborn man who's
lost everything

211
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:22,360
Well, he's not totally alone.
We're here.

212
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:27,309
Now, that's a good one.
A damn good one.

213
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,360
Of course I agree with Rúni in principle -

214
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:36,309
But it's just not the right way to do it.
- What is the right way then?

215
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:42,360
Now I think that two such nice girls should have a
drink -

216
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:46,319
- and sing all night with two real sailors.

217
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:56,360
"Strong, young boys, guzzling booze, is what we
want .."

218
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,318
Stop that.

219
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,360
Ha. Faroese women.

220
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:08,360
They get so holy and boring when they've been
abroad too long.

221
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,318
Are you coming, Rúni?
- No.

222
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:25,311
"Strong, young boys,
killing whales, is what we want.."

223
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:52,309
I've got to get out.
I can't breathe in here.

224
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:55,309
Oh Rannvá, what are we doing here?

225
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,316
Open up.

226
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:27,360
Help me put him to bed.

227
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:30,318
You've got to get up now anyway.

228
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:05,319
We ought to take a picture of you and send it to
your dad.

229
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:10,319
He's always been fighting with his filthy rich father.

230
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:17,360
''Drunk sailor found in ladies underwear in village
hotel.''
That story will travel fast.

231
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:22,360
A present from me to his father.

232
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,318
He can't get rid of me that easy.

233
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:30,360
When he wakes up he'll think he's spent a hot night
with you two.

234
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:35,360
He'll have a hard-on for days and think how
advanced he is.

235
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:39,319
- Don't you feel sorry for him?
- No.

236
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:08,319
Girl on the starboard side.
Damsel in distress.

237
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:30,318
I'm on my way to the airport.

238
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:52,360
Nice to meet one of the natives. They always have
so much to tell.

239
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:57,309
Pretend you don't hear her.
She didn't grow up here.

240
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:03,360
I'm going to Denmark to get an abortion.
I stole the money from mum and dad.

241
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:06,318
They think I'm going
to Christian Camp.

242
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:12,309
''Jesus will take care of everything'', they say.

243
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:26,360
If you asked that woman
where her husband is -

244
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:31,309
she'd say he's out watching football -
or at home with a hangover.

245
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:37,360
Not necessarily.

246
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:42,360
And one child now doesn't mean you have to get a
whole football team.
You decide that for yourself.

247
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:45,318
What do you know?

248
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:50,360
Getting the kids is easy - but giving them a good
home is not.

249
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:55,360
And I cannot and will not
do that now.

250
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:59,360
You just have to be careful -
or was the sex too good?

251
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:06,311
I don't want to give birth to a child -
who will never know its real mother.

252
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:19,310
This is where our ways part.
Your way looks as crooked and broad as ours.

253
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,318
Thanks for the ride.

254
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:32,318
It's too easy to get pregnant.

255
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,360
It shouldn't be possible without having the brain
say -

256
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:41,360
''Ding dong. Now's the perfect time. Get on with it.''

257
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,316
Right?.

258
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,318
I've got some business to do in the village hall.

259
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:19,309
They don't drink in there -
so there's probably no dancing on the tables.

260
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:41,309
But they'll find some fun anyway.

261
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,360
He's sweet, isn't he?

262
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:57,309
A wedding with no drinking?
Is that possible?

263
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:04,360
My dad took me
to such a party once.

264
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:08,360
The women had coffee and cake while the men
went in and out.

265
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:13,360
The men looked happier every time they'd been
out -

266
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:18,309
- and the women looked more and more sulky.
- Surprise, surprise.

267
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:35,318
Come here. Have a drink.
What a party.

268
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:41,318
Look at that. Ladies.

269
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:51,309
Hello there. What's up.
You're looking cute.

270
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:57,309
Here have a drink.

271
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:02,360
Are you girls wearing make-up tonight?
No, we were born like this.

272
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:06,319
Jesus, I'm sorry to hear that.
Won't you have a drink too?

273
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:10,360
Listen why don't you
come out of the car a for a while?

274
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:14,319
Jesus, they're coming out.

275
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,360
Now all of you stand over there and smile.

276
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:21,319
Is she going to take photos now?

277
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:30,360
More pictures?
Well I'll be damned.

278
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:35,360
Hey, what are you going to do with those photos?
We'll send them all around the world.

279
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:38,318
All around the world? Really?

280
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:47,319
Hi, I'm the groom.
Are you going to kidnap me?

281
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:56,311
Mum, now he's also gone
over to those girls.

282
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:02,318
Tell the others to come out.

283
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:16,319
Is that you? My old girlfriend?

284
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:22,360
Why are you here?
You ought to see yourself.

285
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:27,360
I've bought a new house with my husband and we
have two new cars -

286
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:30,360
- while you're just fooling around, making a show of
yourself.

287
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:34,360
It's easier just to run away, isn't it Rannvá?

288
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:40,360
Why are you so angry? We used to have so much
fun together.

289
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:44,360
You wanted all the world to see you dance -
and what's happened?

290
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:50,360
Has he knocked you up
to make you stay?

291
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:54,319
You cheeky cow.

292
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:58,318
Rúni.

293
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:04,360
Hey, we need some good Samaritans here.

294
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:07,360
Are you deaf or what?
- Take it easy. It's no use.

295
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:10,318
Let go of me. Let's go.

296
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:26,310
I've just had an offer I can't refuse -
See you in the next Bed & Breakfast, right?

297
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,360
No need to hurry.

298
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:44,309
Can't we just go for a ride?

299
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:28,309
I know somebody here.
See you later, ok?

300
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:33,319
Try and get some sleep.
I'll see you tomorrow.

301
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:17,360
Did you really think you could just hide behind all
that make-up?

302
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:21,319
I know your smell, you know.

303
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:27,318
Why did you run away?

304
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:33,309
Did you just use me
for some sort of revenge?

305
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:41,360
Say something, damn it.

306
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:44,360
If you knew how much I've been longing for you...

307
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:48,319
Just once more.

308
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:55,319
Shut up. Shut up.

309
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:09,360
Oh no, not her.

310
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:15,360
Rannvá, what's going on?
- What do you care?

311
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:19,360
Think of your pretty lover there -

312
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:25,360
He made a friend of mine pregnant when she was
only 1 7.

313
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:29,360
For two years he pretended he loved her and the
baby -

314
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:35,360
- and then he just suddenly ran away.
He broke her heart.

315
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:39,360
What are you talking about?
What happened just now?

316
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:43,360
I'm so tired.
- What's wrong with you?

317
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:45,316
Excuse me.

318
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:08,319
Now you'll never hear
from Mr Handsome again.

319
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:10,360
It's not easy to know what's the right or wrong thing
to say here.

320
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:14,360
How could you know?
You didn't grow up here.

321
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:19,360
No. but I'm still
a product of this country.

322
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:22,318
If this country was a little bigger, Dad could've
stayed.

323
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:28,309
He wouldn't have had to constantly meet my
mother and her boyfriend.

324
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:48,319
Rúni, why are we always
talking about us?

325
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:55,310
Yeah, tell us about
all your business?

326
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:04,360
Will you tell me about that bastard from yesterday?

327
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:07,360
Oh, that was just somebody who tried to help me
once -

328
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:13,310
And I thanked him
by hurting him deeply.

329
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:23,360
Hello Jesus.
Did you send Rúni to us?

330
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:28,309
Take care further ahead -
it's full of trolls and gnomes.

331
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:34,309
Hello again. - Yeah, you were good.
-Thanks, I'm not used to people listening to me
here.

332
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,360
Do you really live here?

333
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:41,318
I spent 20 years abroad-

334
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:45,360
Trying to make a living out of singing.

335
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:50,360
Here they've learnt to bear with me.
After all, I'm one of them.

336
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:57,360
I often wish this country was bigger.
It would be easier to meet someone you get along
with.

337
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:01,360
The rest of the world is so far away up here.

338
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:08,360
Look at me: here I am singing the last lines of a
terrible song.

339
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:14,310
- Why the last lines?
- Who says the song is terrible?

340
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:33,360
I have a son I never see.

341
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:39,360
He's a famous singer now.

342
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:42,360
I miss him so much -

343
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:47,309
But I taught him myself
not to need me.

344
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:51,360
All I thought of then was singing-

345
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:59,313
So he grew up abroad with his foreign father and
family.

346
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:06,360
I know what to do. I know a great Faroese guy
abroad.

347
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:10,360
You'd like him.

348
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:13,360
Have you got a pen?

349
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:18,309
Well, why not?
Okay, great.

350
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:24,319
Come. We're leaving now.

351
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:31,309
Take care.
And don't forget to call him.

352
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:41,360
Damn it. All I'm asking for is a chance.
He's really pissed today.

353
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:45,319
You'll never make me hit back.

354
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:53,311
I don't recognize him any more.
I'm not afraid of you.
I can wait.

355
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:20,360
Want some?
Now what?

356
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:23,318
Don't.

357
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:55,360
Barba, I saw you give her your father's address.

358
00:59:55,360 --> 01:00:01,360
What are you up to?
She's alone. He's alone.

359
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:04,360
You have to push a little, right?

360
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:08,319
Perhaps an exciting Faroese woman is all he ever
wanted?

361
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:17,360
She's not one to sit at home knitting things for your
children.

362
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:22,309
I'm not going to have any.
I'll manage not to.

363
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:28,360
How many parents or children are really happy in
this world?

364
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:33,360
20%? 10%?

365
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:39,360
Only 2%?
You're such a hypocrite.

366
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:45,360
You think people just have children -
so they can give them a miserable time and make
them unhappy.

367
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:48,318
So what?

368
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:53,360
You don't know what you're saying.

369
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:57,360
''You just have to be more careful.''

370
01:00:57,360 --> 01:01:03,310
I can't stand it.
Why don't you give your mother a chance for
once?

371
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:11,360
You've no idea what it's like
to have children -
or you wouldn't be so full of shit.

372
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:14,360
If you knew so much about children -

373
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:18,273
- then you wouldn't have treated your parents like
that.

374
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:52,277
I know more about ...

375
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:55,318
I could be somewhere abroad now -

376
01:01:56,360 --> 01:02:00,360
- enjoying the heat and the noise -

377
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:04,319
while admirers waited on me.

378
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:14,319
This peace is driving me crazy.

379
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:21,360
It's so typical for me to have a mother -

380
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:29,313
- in this desolate ... cold ... naked ...

381
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:35,318
... windy place.

382
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:42,310
Small islands are not for people: just for birds that
can fly away.

383
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:16,318
Mama?

384
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:45,360
She'll probably think
she saw me in a dream -

385
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:49,319
- or a nightmare.
Do you want her to keep it?

386
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:56,319
They ... want me at home.

387
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:02,309
It's probably better
if she thinks I was just a dream.

388
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:05,316
Why's that better?

389
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:11,309
Cause ... I don't know what to do.

390
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:15,360
Cause I'm ashamed.

391
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:20,309
I don't know if I can face her.

392
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:30,310
Well, I hope you find out
before she leaves again.

393
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:35,318
No ... no ...

394
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:31,309
It looks as if your father's got competition, Barba.

395
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:52,360
Was she the only one who answered your ad in the
personals?

396
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:57,309
A used woman. You must be desperate, Rúni.

397
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:10,360
Well, now you've seen my son -

398
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,360
- and his mother.

399
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:17,309
7 months ago she just
ran off abroad with the boy.

400
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:24,319
7 weeks later I got a postcard just saying they were
okay.

401
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:38,309
I started sailing when I was 14.

402
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:44,360
I saved up and got my own boat.

403
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:50,360
Fishing was good
and everything was great -

404
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:57,360
- but the big guys wouldn't let me keep that.

405
01:07:57,360 --> 01:08:02,360
I was as stupid as everybody else at that fine dinner!

406
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:06,360
We were going to create one big firm of
shipowners.

407
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:12,360
We were all drunk when we signed the papers to
secure our future.

408
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:18,360
We would fish and they would sell it at the best
price.

409
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:24,360
We thought.

410
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:30,360
But that night we signed off the right to our own
boats and lives.

411
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:35,360
And the small fishermen would rather live as slaves
than admit they'd been fooled.

412
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:39,360
But was it right to say the truth on national TV?

413
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:43,360
Great attitude, Rannvá.
Typically Faroese.

414
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:47,360
Shut up, Barba. You still don't know what it's like
here.

415
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:51,360
No, but people bloody well
create their own lives.

416
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:55,360
Maybe so, Barba.
But right now we're talking about Rúni.

417
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:59,360
Can't you show them
you can do without them?

418
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:06,311
Yeah, show them that there are other things than
cod ...
... money ... and trash fish.

419
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:58,360
What? Trash fish in the boot?

420
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:03,360
I just heard of a boat going 5 months to the Barents
Sea.
- So who knows?

421
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:07,319
Nobody knows.
That's it.

422
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:31,318
Pull over here, Rúni.

423
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:39,360
This is where I grew up
with a mother and a father.

424
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:45,310
Come on, it's not your fault
both your parents wanted you.

425
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:49,360
So what will it be?

426
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:52,360
Well, I'm waiting for Rannvá to ask us in for a cup
of tea.

427
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:58,310
No, I've got one last thing to do.
Well, we'll come along then, all right?

428
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:23,318
This is my chance.

429
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:30,318
Here we go.

430
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:36,316
What's he going to do
with the gun?

431
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:41,360
Too many American movies?

432
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:45,319
A man can own a gun, though...

433
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:54,360
There are so many other things than people to
shoot ...
... hares ... birds ... and ...

434
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:58,319
Fish. ... Can't you shoot fish?

435
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:02,316
Oh, no. Look out.

436
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:02,318
Hey, what happened?
I don't know: here you are -

437
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:10,360
- well taken care of - and you look really cool
with all that bandage on.

438
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:15,360
You would have lost if that cod hadn't interfered.

439
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:19,360
So cods are useful
for something, then?

440
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:22,318
Daddy could have been one of the people in the
house.

441
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:27,360
But just when everything was going for him, he lost
interest -

442
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:32,360
He sold all his ships to be the first and only village
bohemian.

443
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:37,360
But I don't like having a daughter who plays hide
and seek -

444
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:42,309
- without saying when the game is over, so we can
find her.

445
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:00,318
Rumours had it
you'd made your entrance.

446
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:05,319
You can see it on your father
that you have.

447
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:10,360
You two were always so close.

448
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:13,318
Hello darling.

449
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:17,318
Have you seen who's here?

450
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:32,276
I know you're my mother. I have lots of pictures of
you.

451
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:36,310
I think you're so pretty.
- I'm sorry.

452
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:47,360
I'm so sorry. Suddenly one day she disappeared.

453
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:51,360
One year later we got a postcard from abroad.

454
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:56,360
Then we'd start seeing her in the magazines and
the ads.

455
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:59,360
Ask her what day it is today.

456
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:03,360
And ask her if she's brought a present for her
daughter.

457
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:09,310
Rannvá you shit. What's wrong with people?

458
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:18,360
At least my mother waved goodbye to me when
Dad and I moved abroad.

459
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:24,310
You know all about me,
and I know nothing about you.

460
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:31,310
All I know is that I'll never leave her again.

461
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:44,360
Oh no. That friend of yours...

462
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:47,360
The one who got pregnant with Mr Handsome ...

463
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:52,309
I'm so stupid.

464
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:58,319
Don't.
I'm so embarrassed.

465
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:03,360
Fuck it all.. I don't care why you left.

466
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:09,360
But you left us knowing nothing for all this time.

467
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:11,360
If your lovely daughter and your wonderful father
hadn't been here -

468
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:19,313
- then ... then ....

469
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:28,319
Listen, we have to trust her now.

470
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:31,360
It's always like that:

471
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:37,310
I do all the boring things - and you get all the hugs.

472
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:41,360
Mama, I can handle it now.

473
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:44,360
I want to.

474
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:48,360
You'll manage. I'll be there.

475
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:51,318
But what is wrong with this country?

476
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:56,360
It gave birth to all your ancestors.

477
01:16:56,360 --> 01:17:00,319
Damn it, mama. This must be the only place in the
world -

478
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:04,360
- where you're seen as a traitor for wanting to live
somewhere else.

479
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:09,360
Some want to go. Some don't.

480
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:14,360
And islanders always want to know what is beyond
the horizon.

481
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:18,319
Ha. I've seen it,
and I'm not tempted by it.

482
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:22,318
No. That's exactly it.

483
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:58,360
Do you want me to push you
closer to the window?

484
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:01,318
No need to.

485
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:12,311
Barba, how come you didn't find out about
Rannvá?
I found out almost immediately.

486
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:19,360
Well, dinner's coming up.

487
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:23,319
We've got to go now.

488
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:27,316
Well, ... bye.

489
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:19,360
"Then fare ye well,
your God proclaims - "

490
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:23,360
"-your life and soul."

491
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:27,319
"He shelters you
where you may go - "

492
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:33,309
"- you will be back again."

493
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:15,360
Perhaps these tiny islands are not just
for birds that can fly away.

494
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:18,318
Perhaps they're also for people
who don't want to fly away.

495
