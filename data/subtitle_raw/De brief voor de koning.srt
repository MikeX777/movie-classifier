1
00:01:06,591 --> 00:01:09,519
This is a tale of long ago...

2
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,571
when there were still knights.

3
00:01:11,774 --> 00:01:14,493
The story happens in two kingdoms:

4
00:01:14,743 --> 00:01:18,243
the land of King Unauwen...

5
00:01:17,245 --> 00:01:19,869
... and the land of King Dagonaut.

6
00:01:20,669 --> 00:01:22,380
They are good friends.

7
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,670
King Dagonaut is a good and just ruler.

8
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,810
There is peace and security in his country ...

9
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,276
... thanks to his many valiant knights.

10
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:38,310
In the west, beyond the great mountains,

11
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,060
... lies Unauwen.

12
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:43,118
King Unauwen has two sons,

13
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:44,633
who are twins.

14
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,159
One is called Iridian, the crown prince.

15
00:01:47,961 --> 00:01:50,176
The other son, Viridian,

16
00:01:50,302 --> 00:01:53,831
is the ruler over the land of Eviellan in the south.

17
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,672
Viridian is the enemy of his father...

18
00:01:58,033 --> 00:02:00,652
... and has often tried to invade the land of Unauwen ...

19
00:02:00,398 --> 00:02:02,540
... with his Red Riders.

20
00:02:05,844 --> 00:02:09,469
But the story starts in the City of Dagonaut,

21
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,117
just before the great day...

22
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:16,365
... on which five young squires wil be knighted by the king.

23
00:02:33,858 --> 00:02:35,264
Tiuri!

24
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,071
It's going well, right?

25
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,078
No, not well at all. Again.

26
00:02:51,944 --> 00:02:53,528
Tiuri! What are you doing?

27
00:02:54,021 --> 00:02:55,029
Ouch!

28
00:02:54,804 --> 00:02:56,319
Finish it.

29
00:02:58,964 --> 00:03:00,749
You are now dead, noble knight.

30
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:03,842
One of the squires about to be knighted...

31
00:03:04,295 --> 00:03:09,007
is Tiuri, son of the famous Sir Tiuri the Valiant.

32
00:03:12,321 --> 00:03:15,540
Well? Are you looking forward to tomorrow?

33
00:03:15,512 --> 00:03:17,725
Yeah, but...

34
00:03:17,575 --> 00:03:18,986
But?

35
00:03:19,687 --> 00:03:21,777
I could have waited another four years, Mother.

36
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:24,185
Look there! The knight-to-be.

37
00:03:25,556 --> 00:03:27,362
How did it go this morning?

38
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:28,631
All right.

39
00:03:28,753 --> 00:03:30,356
Good. Now for tonight...

40
00:03:30,212 --> 00:03:33,021
... and tomorrow is the big day.

41
00:03:37,649 --> 00:03:41,480
You have now passed all the tests, except one.

42
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:46,664
You have been pages, served with a lord,

43
00:03:46,618 --> 00:03:49,343
been your proud fathers' squires.

44
00:03:49,942 --> 00:03:53,262
But after tomorrow you will really have to prove ...

45
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,351
... that you are honest, helpful and brave.

46
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:02,406
And now, the final test.

47
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:05,853
A vigil in the chapel on the hill.

48
00:04:06,392 --> 00:04:09,418
You shall wake through the night.

49
00:04:09,714 --> 00:04:13,344
You may pray, dream about your knighthood,

50
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:16,058
... but you must keep silent.

51
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,810
Speak to no one.

52
00:04:18,204 --> 00:04:20,619
Not eat or drink.

53
00:04:21,413 --> 00:04:27,861
And you may not open the door for anyone-- for anyone!

54
00:04:28,144 --> 00:04:30,469
And not leave the chapel...

55
00:04:30,753 --> 00:04:34,074
... until tomorrow at sunrise ...

56
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:39,455
... when your fathers will come to take you to the festive procession.

57
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:43,463
If you break one of these rules...

58
00:04:44,048 --> 00:04:49,591
... you will not be knighted tomorrow.

59
00:06:17,086 --> 00:11:47,559
(Knock on the door)

60
00:06:17,857 --> 00:06:20,271
Anybody there?

61
00:06:22,016 --> 00:06:24,837
(Knock)

62
00:06:25,197 --> 00:06:26,605
(Door latch)

63
00:06:26,562 --> 00:06:28,729
Open in God's name!

64
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,158
(Moaning)

65
00:06:33,365 --> 00:06:36,185
(Rattling latch)

66
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,310
(Knock)

67
00:06:39,027 --> 00:06:41,245
Please, help me!

68
00:06:49,114 --> 00:06:50,826
(Knock)

69
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,466
Have you no heart?

70
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:01,104
(Rattling latch)

71
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,756
Help me, I'm wounded!

72
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,581
Help me!

73
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:37,315
Thank you. I crave your help.

74
00:07:41,141 --> 00:07:44,497
Quick, quick, there is little time.

75
00:07:44,313 --> 00:07:47,133
I may not speak to anyone, I'm to be knighted tomorrow.

76
00:07:47,253 --> 00:07:49,167
No! No!

77
00:07:49,086 --> 00:07:50,899
Oh, no.

78
00:07:55,674 --> 00:07:57,989
What's your name?

79
00:07:57,622 --> 00:08:00,441
Who are you? What do you want of me?

80
00:08:01,451 --> 00:08:04,575
This letter is very important.

81
00:08:04,983 --> 00:08:08,190
It's a matter of life and death.

82
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:11,009
It is addressed to the king of Unauwen.

83
00:08:11,563 --> 00:08:13,832
My knight, the Black Knight with the White Shield...

84
00:08:13,946 --> 00:08:15,865
... has to deliver it.

85
00:08:16,102 --> 00:08:19,729
You must bring the letter to him.

86
00:08:19,996 --> 00:08:23,351
But why have you come here? The city is full of knights you can trust.

87
00:08:23,258 --> 00:08:25,376
They are too conspicuous.
- Am I not, too?

88
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,839
You aren't known.

89
00:08:27,312 --> 00:08:28,518
Here.

90
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:33,672
Go! Quick! Take my horse.

91
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,196
My knight is hiding in the King's Wood near here.

92
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:40,099
May God reward you.

93
00:08:41,713 --> 00:08:44,237
Tell him Vokia sent you.

94
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:09,943
(Moaning)

95
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:14,419
Who are you?

96
00:10:15,077 --> 00:10:16,788
Tiuri, my lord.

97
00:10:17,134 --> 00:10:25,801
Tiuri... I know that name. Sir Tiuri the Valiant.

98
00:10:26,155 --> 00:10:27,966
That's my father.

99
00:10:30,575 --> 00:10:34,201
Your father. He and I have...

100
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:36,661
But what are you doing here?

101
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:45,993
I've come for you.
- For me?

102
00:10:47,142 --> 00:10:54,294
Vokia sent me. --Here.

103
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:06,266
This letter is for the king, the king of Unauwen.

104
00:11:06,205 --> 00:11:10,632
It's vitally important for his country, but for your country as well.

105
00:11:11,205 --> 00:11:13,726
Now I can't deliver it myself...

106
00:11:13,751 --> 00:11:15,571
... you have to do it.

107
00:11:15,538 --> 00:11:18,971
Me?
- Yes, you. There's no time to lose. Listen carefully.

108
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,718
Travel to the west, by the Blue River...

109
00:11:24,077 --> 00:11:26,701
... until you get to the wellspring in the mountains.

110
00:11:27,111 --> 00:11:30,799
There is a hermit living there, Menaures.

111
00:11:30,973 --> 00:11:33,682
Here, take this ring.

112
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:40,309
If you show it to him, he'll know that I sent you.

113
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:44,226
He'll get you over the mountains safe.

114
00:11:44,302 --> 00:11:45,727
That's the shortest way to Unauwen.

115
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,707
Why can't someone else do that? I can't.

116
00:11:47,687 --> 00:11:49,534
I'm not suited for it, really.

117
00:11:51,246 --> 00:11:56,603
Look at me. You, you must do it. You can do it.

118
00:11:56,393 --> 00:11:59,317
But beware: there are enemies everywhere.

119
00:11:59,937 --> 00:12:02,883
The Red Riders. They want the letter.

120
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:07,607
Never open it, unless you're in danger of your life.

121
00:12:08,183 --> 00:12:13,536
Then you must read and destroy it.

122
00:12:13,455 --> 00:12:14,991
Are you listening?

123
00:12:17,673 --> 00:12:19,286
Before...

124
00:12:48,205 --> 00:12:51,938
(Shouting)

125
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,930
I don't have a letter!

126
00:13:00,338 --> 00:13:02,234
He's got the letter! He's got it!

127
00:13:02,045 --> 00:13:03,320
I don't have a letter!

128
00:13:03,328 --> 00:13:05,325
Where's the letter! Tell!
- Finish him off.

129
00:13:06,241 --> 00:13:07,535
I don't have a letter! Aargh!

130
00:13:40,442 --> 00:13:44,931
Well, we're in this together.
What's your name?

131
00:13:51,422 --> 00:13:53,907
This ring will protect us.

132
00:14:46,282 --> 00:14:50,812
(Voices)

133
00:14:54,773 --> 00:14:55,593
Stop!

134
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,898
Whoa!

135
00:14:58,508 --> 00:15:00,017
Stand still!

136
00:15:18,847 --> 00:15:20,240
Follow us!

137
00:15:58,594 --> 00:16:04,487
(Shouts in the distance)

138
00:16:28,495 --> 00:16:30,898
Thank you, good beast.

139
00:16:35,187 --> 00:16:36,950
Come on! We're in a hurry!

140
00:17:39,867 --> 00:17:41,537
Give us your money!

141
00:17:47,836 --> 00:17:51,858
What do you want? I don't have any money, I have nothing.

142
00:17:51,645 --> 00:17:53,056
Then what's this?

143
00:17:52,935 --> 00:17:54,142
Let me go!

144
00:18:00,945 --> 00:18:04,550
You're not getting the ring. You won't get it!

145
00:18:04,134 --> 00:18:05,954
So if I just took the ring?

146
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,163
I implore you... I got this ring from someone who just died.

147
00:18:12,748 --> 00:18:14,462
It's very precious to me.

148
00:18:14,712 --> 00:18:17,748
Precious? Precious?!

149
00:18:21,991 --> 00:18:23,818
I have a proposition.

150
00:18:24,315 --> 00:18:31,761
If you get to choose between your ring and your horse, which do you keep?

151
00:18:33,938 --> 00:18:35,146
Both?

152
00:18:35,997 --> 00:18:37,408
Both?

153
00:18:38,246 --> 00:18:41,881
Choose! Or I'll chop off that finger!

154
00:18:46,329 --> 00:18:49,557
The ring.
- The ring?

155
00:18:51,162 --> 00:18:56,295
Beat it, stupid. Beat it with your ring!

156
00:18:56,496 --> 00:18:59,420
Who'd have thought the little...

157
00:20:36,932 --> 00:20:42,874
(faint voices)

158
00:20:41,701 --> 00:20:44,318
I haven't done anything!

159
00:20:44,933 --> 00:20:47,441
Mercy, lord, mercy!

160
00:20:47,206 --> 00:20:49,754
For a coward like you there is no mercy.

161
00:20:50,103 --> 00:20:51,439
Where did you get that horse?

162
00:20:51,572 --> 00:20:52,784
Got given it.

163
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,581
How did you get that horse?

164
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,161
The horse is mine.
- You're lying!

165
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,178
We know that horse. It's Ardanwen.

166
00:20:58,527 --> 00:20:59,839
Ardanwen.

167
00:20:59,939 --> 00:21:02,562
Someone gave it to him.
- A lad we met.

168
00:21:02,448 --> 00:21:03,858
Liar!

169
00:21:04,344 --> 00:21:06,614
A lad with a... with a ring.

170
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:07,781
So what did that lad look like?

171
00:21:07,548 --> 00:21:12,893
Well, er, it was dark, he was wearing a long shirt, a bit whitish.

172
00:21:13,126 --> 00:21:14,335
How old is that lad?

173
00:21:14,032 --> 00:21:15,543
About fifteen, sixteen.

174
00:21:15,758 --> 00:21:18,675
You stupid oaf. You should have killed the boy!

175
00:21:18,721 --> 00:21:19,829
Where is he now?

176
00:21:19,663 --> 00:21:22,191
No idea, he went that way, can't be far.

177
00:21:22,355 --> 00:21:24,868
Next time you'll swing. We're keeping an eye on you!

178
00:21:47,992 --> 00:21:59,369
(Banter)

179
00:22:00,811 --> 00:22:02,523
Whoa!

180
00:22:04,266 --> 00:22:05,515
Good morning, brothers.

181
00:22:05,922 --> 00:22:08,754
God be with you, young traveller.
- Thank you.

182
00:22:09,177 --> 00:22:10,986
Are you by any chance going west?

183
00:22:11,154 --> 00:22:14,282
We're bound for the Brown Monastery, it's that way.

184
00:22:14,763 --> 00:22:17,388
Could you please give me a ride?

185
00:22:18,057 --> 00:22:19,972
Of course, my son.

186
00:22:20,136 --> 00:22:21,643
Thank you.

187
00:22:35,058 --> 00:22:38,279
Are you cold? Here, put this on.

188
00:22:38,546 --> 00:22:40,565
Thank you, Brother...

189
00:22:40,411 --> 00:22:41,817
Martin.
-Martin.

190
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,683
I suppose you're hungry too.
- No.

191
00:22:43,786 --> 00:22:45,626
Well, yes in fact.

192
00:22:46,874 --> 00:22:49,492
May I know where you're bound?

193
00:22:49,988 --> 00:22:52,708
I'm going to the spring of the Blue River, in the mountains.

194
00:22:53,176 --> 00:22:57,168
You're going to visit Menaures, the old hermit.
- Yes. Do you know him?

195
00:22:57,361 --> 00:22:59,174
Er, yes.

196
00:22:59,224 --> 00:23:02,924
(Shouting in the distance)

197
00:23:06,164 --> 00:23:09,482
Stay where you are!
- Whoa!

198
00:23:14,628 --> 00:23:16,817
Tell us! Where are you going?

199
00:23:16,856 --> 00:23:20,002
We're on our way to the Brown Monastery, my lord, not far from here.

200
00:23:20,243 --> 00:23:21,660
Hoods off!

201
00:23:28,628 --> 00:23:32,050
Er, our young brother is blind, my lord.

202
00:23:33,484 --> 00:23:35,199
Come!

203
00:23:45,274 --> 00:23:47,134
Why did you do that?

204
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:53,210
I can't tell you now. It's a bit complicated.

205
00:23:59,528 --> 00:24:01,658
Whoa. Giddy-up!

206
00:24:05,482 --> 00:24:07,380
Hey, keep that.

207
00:24:07,427 --> 00:24:08,688
Oh! Thanks.

208
00:24:08,523 --> 00:24:10,808
So you go that way.

209
00:24:10,872 --> 00:24:12,477
Make good pace, you'll get to Castle Mistrinaut before dark.

210
00:24:12,389 --> 00:24:13,696
They're very hospitable there.

211
00:24:13,574 --> 00:24:14,680
Thank you, brothers.

212
00:24:14,672 --> 00:24:17,279
I'm sorry I couldn't tell more about myself, but...

213
00:24:17,185 --> 00:24:18,589
... I hope you trust me.

214
00:24:18,664 --> 00:24:19,769
Have a good journey.

215
00:24:25,084 --> 00:24:27,403
You don't trust him.

216
00:24:27,313 --> 00:24:29,533
Someone is looking for him.

217
00:24:56,506 --> 00:24:58,600
Good evening, brother.

218
00:24:58,609 --> 00:24:59,216
Good evening,.

219
00:24:59,348 --> 00:25:00,568
You want to spend the night?

220
00:25:00,738 --> 00:25:01,444
Yes.

221
00:25:01,516 --> 00:25:03,812
And you are?
- Brother Martin.

222
00:25:03,581 --> 00:25:06,003
One moment please. Have to write that down.

223
00:25:06,569 --> 00:25:10,509
Lord Rafox always wants to know who his guests are.

224
00:25:16,235 --> 00:25:17,747
All right, go on.

225
00:25:18,009 --> 00:25:19,818
Thanks.

226
00:25:27,798 --> 00:25:32,135
(Talking and singing)

227
00:25:34,668 --> 00:25:36,966
Come sit here, brother.

228
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,819
Sit down.

229
00:25:52,172 --> 00:25:53,473
(Bell)

230
00:25:54,309 --> 00:25:57,129
Get up, stand.

231
00:26:23,192 --> 00:26:28,776
Yes, she's a beauty, isn't she? Or isn't a young monk supposed to enjoy that?

232
00:26:29,534 --> 00:26:31,854
What kind of man is the lord here?

233
00:26:31,719 --> 00:26:38,679
Lord Rafox, well, he's a strong just lord.

234
00:26:38,503 --> 00:26:42,438
Used to be different, he was in some sort of...

235
00:27:11,891 --> 00:27:15,315
(Hooves)

236
00:27:33,774 --> 00:27:36,395
(Bell tolls, cock crows)

237
00:27:38,817 --> 00:27:40,732
(Dog barks)

238
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:44,739
Hey, brother... what was it?

239
00:27:44,822 --> 00:27:45,636
Martin.

240
00:27:45,715 --> 00:27:47,126
Ah, yes, Martin.

241
00:27:46,769 --> 00:27:48,922
Such a bother here, never had that before.

242
00:27:48,923 --> 00:27:50,130
Gate closed.

243
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,251
Do you know why?

244
00:27:52,286 --> 00:27:55,075
Well, there were some knights who came in the night...

245
00:27:55,223 --> 00:27:58,008
... friends of Lord Rafox's, and now the gate is closed.

246
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,842
But I have to get out with my basket, so...

247
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,064
Well, try again...

248
00:28:03,404 --> 00:28:05,110
You again?

249
00:28:05,291 --> 00:28:06,876
The gate stays closed.

250
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:15,815
So how do I get to the next castle then?

251
00:28:17,215 --> 00:28:21,857
Hey, Brother Martin, it's no use, the gate is closed.

252
00:28:27,016 --> 00:28:29,502
I don't know either, Lord Rafox, he's going off...

253
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:31,877
I told him the gate is closed, it's (??)

254
00:28:38,837 --> 00:28:43,682
Good morning. The brother from the Brown Monastery, I presume?

255
00:28:44,308 --> 00:28:46,629
Let me ask you, reverend brother.

256
00:28:46,874 --> 00:28:49,994
Did you by any chance meet a boy on your way...

257
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,678
... about sixteen years old ...

258
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,333
... brown hair, blue eyes?

259
00:28:54,948 --> 00:28:58,739
A boy? Not that I remember, my lord.

260
00:28:59,381 --> 00:29:01,003
What's your name again, brother?

261
00:29:01,154 --> 00:29:01,966
Martin.

262
00:29:04,092 --> 00:29:06,392
Would you take your hood off, please?

263
00:29:06,487 --> 00:29:08,099
Yes, may I ask why?

264
00:29:11,735 --> 00:29:16,271
Look there. Brown hair and blue eyes.

265
00:29:23,284 --> 00:29:26,011
Why, my lord? You're mistaken, you've got the wrong one.

266
00:29:26,123 --> 00:29:28,324
What's going on, Father?

267
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:31,772
I'd like to introduce you to a couple of friends of mine.

268
00:29:31,905 --> 00:29:35,696
If you aren't the one they're looking for nothing will happen.

269
00:29:50,631 --> 00:29:53,913
I think this is the boy you're looking for.

270
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,051
Maybe.

271
00:30:00,619 --> 00:30:02,101
Does he have the ring?

272
00:30:02,152 --> 00:30:03,455
May I know who you are?

273
00:30:03,976 --> 00:30:05,484
Where is the ring?

274
00:30:05,932 --> 00:30:08,193
Ring? I don't know what you're talking about.

275
00:30:08,215 --> 00:30:09,591
Were you travelling through the King's Wood?

276
00:30:09,832 --> 00:30:12,557
No, I came from the Brown Monastery.

277
00:30:12,771 --> 00:30:14,584
Search his clothes.

278
00:30:16,226 --> 00:30:18,334
Why don't you just tell me who you are?

279
00:30:18,494 --> 00:30:21,831
Do something! I'm your guest, I claim your protection!

280
00:30:23,094 --> 00:30:26,647
Stop it! Stop it, I've got a ring.

281
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,268
This is the ring.

282
00:30:38,235 --> 00:30:39,584
He's the one we've been looking for.

283
00:30:39,664 --> 00:30:42,687
Rafox, he's ours now.

284
00:30:42,734 --> 00:30:43,478
Take him away.

285
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,397
Lord Rafox, believe me. I've done nothing.

286
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:48,073
Believe me!

287
00:30:48,553 --> 00:30:49,748
Let me go!

288
00:30:50,597 --> 00:30:54,115
I am Tiuri, son of Tiuri the Valiant!

289
00:31:02,741 --> 00:31:06,006
But I am the son of Tiuri the Valiant!

290
00:31:06,188 --> 00:31:09,426
Hold your tongue, liar.

291
00:32:20,723 --> 00:32:27,822
Wrong. Wrong.

292
00:32:29,675 --> 00:32:32,809
I was wrong about you.

293
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:51,446
Who are you?

294
00:32:53,267 --> 00:32:57,213
Are you really Tiuri the Valiant's son?
- Yes.

295
00:33:00,647 --> 00:33:03,310
Why are you in disguise?

296
00:32:57,152 --> 00:33:00,652
Because I...

297
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:09,659
Did you steal the ring and the horse Ardanwen?
- No!

298
00:33:10,047 --> 00:33:13,385
I can explain everything.
Later.

299
00:33:22,488 --> 00:33:24,703
Take your robe off, quick.

300
00:33:27,257 --> 00:33:28,978
Put this on.

301
00:33:32,204 --> 00:33:33,616
Why are you doing this?

302
00:33:34,184 --> 00:33:36,059
I'm not to know anything...

303
00:33:36,362 --> 00:33:39,306
... but I heard my father talking excitedly about you with the Grey Knights.

304
00:33:39,349 --> 00:33:40,683
The Grey Knights?

305
00:33:40,545 --> 00:33:42,256
They want revenge.

306
00:33:42,506 --> 00:33:43,303
Revenge?

307
00:33:43,484 --> 00:33:45,500
They want to avenge the death of a friend.

308
00:33:45,513 --> 00:33:46,952
They'll come for you presently.

309
00:33:47,231 --> 00:33:48,202
Why? It's not as if I...

310
00:33:48,204 --> 00:33:49,850
My father has doubts about your guilt too.

311
00:33:49,879 --> 00:33:51,090
But they have...

312
00:33:51,256 --> 00:33:51,856
(Rattling at the door)

313
00:33:51,855 --> 00:33:52,760
Come on!

314
00:33:58,477 --> 00:34:00,293
Come on, here.

315
00:34:02,214 --> 00:34:03,592
I think I know something.

316
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,602
At the back of the castle there's a rowboat in the moat.

317
00:34:06,508 --> 00:34:07,011
If I take you...

318
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:07,785
Quick.

319
00:34:08,826 --> 00:34:10,576
And thank you.

320
00:34:19,175 --> 00:34:21,251
Come on!

321
00:34:24,206 --> 00:34:25,420
Stop!

322
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:28,534
Come! Here!

323
00:34:31,574 --> 00:34:32,988
You.

324
00:34:35,145 --> 00:34:36,352
Stop! Here!

325
00:35:04,897 --> 00:35:06,341
What do you want of me?

326
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:11,100
Please, tell me what you want.

327
00:35:14,393 --> 00:35:15,905
Kneel.

328
00:35:54,826 --> 00:35:57,237
Bendoe, you.

329
00:36:14,613 --> 00:36:16,156
Tell me who you are!

330
00:36:16,036 --> 00:36:19,088
Or are you some of the cowards who killed the Knight with the White Shield?

331
00:36:18,922 --> 00:36:20,022
Stop!

332
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:20,549
Stop.

333
00:36:25,595 --> 00:36:27,270
Why are you fleeing?

334
00:36:27,404 --> 00:36:29,567
Only someone with a bad conscience takes flight.

335
00:36:29,666 --> 00:36:31,690
You'd already condemned me.

336
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:34,047
Father! You think he's innocent.

337
00:36:34,081 --> 00:36:36,422
So help him!

338
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,697
Tell him who you are, Ristridin.

339
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,686
I am Ristridin of the South.

340
00:36:49,688 --> 00:36:52,112
These are Sir Bendoe and Sir Arwaut.

341
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:54,813
This is Sir Ewijn, he is from the West.

342
00:36:56,209 --> 00:36:58,035
And you?

343
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:03,438
Are you Tiuri, the son of Tiuri the Valiant?

344
00:37:03,785 --> 00:37:04,696
Yes.

345
00:37:06,011 --> 00:37:09,000
Then tell me how in God's name it's possible that you left the chapel...

346
00:37:09,014 --> 00:37:11,439
... the night before you were to be knighted.

347
00:37:11,427 --> 00:37:15,613
That is not only unheard of and against all the rules...

348
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,985
... but you have also shamed your father, Tiuri the Valiant.

349
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:23,078
There was a reason. Which, I can't say.

350
00:37:22,808 --> 00:37:24,404
No, of course not.

351
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,329
Because you can't say either who you got that ring from...

352
00:37:26,336 --> 00:37:28,453
... and how you got the horse, Ardanwen.

353
00:37:30,002 --> 00:37:31,719
How did you come by that ring?

354
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,547
Someone gave it to me.

355
00:37:33,616 --> 00:37:35,128
Gave it.

356
00:37:35,103 --> 00:37:36,520
A murdered knight.

357
00:37:37,102 --> 00:37:38,309
He was ambushed ...

358
00:37:38,384 --> 00:37:39,682
... by the Red Riders from Eviellan.

359
00:37:41,237 --> 00:37:43,777
He told me that, just before he died.

360
00:37:44,014 --> 00:37:45,318
Then he gave me the ring.

361
00:37:45,862 --> 00:37:46,976
To a squire like you, I suppose.

362
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,007
Yes!

363
00:37:48,306 --> 00:37:50,072
You must believe me, you knew him!

364
00:37:50,164 --> 00:37:52,370
You were his friends!

365
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:56,635
Let's go inside.

366
00:38:02,401 --> 00:38:05,616
Why didn't you go back at once that morning to seek help?

367
00:38:06,666 --> 00:38:10,470
From your father or the king.

368
00:38:11,858 --> 00:38:14,572
I promised not to say more than I've already said.

369
00:38:16,092 --> 00:38:20,464
It's often that the mask of innocence hides falsehood and treason.

370
00:38:20,504 --> 00:38:22,217
I'm not a traitor!

371
00:38:32,149 --> 00:38:34,315
Much of this is unclear.

372
00:38:37,975 --> 00:38:40,238
But I believe you.

373
00:38:42,896 --> 00:38:46,431
And I want to apologise because I doubted your innocence.

374
00:38:47,262 --> 00:38:50,028
Thank my daughter Lavinia that you're still alive.

375
00:38:53,032 --> 00:38:55,253
Here, the ring.

376
00:38:57,874 --> 00:39:00,295
And we'd like to accompany you for a bit tomorrow.

377
00:39:09,572 --> 00:39:12,118
I must thank you that you believed me.

378
00:39:12,635 --> 00:39:14,209
You were very brave.

379
00:39:15,288 --> 00:39:17,933
Later, when I come back, I'll tell you everything.

380
00:39:32,656 --> 00:39:34,393
I won't ask you what it is...

381
00:39:34,557 --> 00:39:38,082
... but I suspect that Sir Edwinem entrusted you with a mission.

382
00:39:38,345 --> 00:39:41,825
That your road is longer than to the hermit Menaures in the mountains.

383
00:39:43,618 --> 00:39:46,337
Is Sir Edwinem the Black Knight with the White Shield?

384
00:39:46,659 --> 00:39:48,773
Sir Edwinem of Foresterra.

385
00:39:48,513 --> 00:39:50,630
Unauwen's noblest knight.

386
00:39:51,977 --> 00:39:55,213
You know that Viridian, the Prince of Eviellan...

387
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:56,951
... is a son of the King of Unauwen?

388
00:39:57,077 --> 00:39:58,994
Yes. Viridian is the younger of the twins.

389
00:39:59,257 --> 00:40:01,643
Iridian is the elder. The crown prince.

390
00:40:01,355 --> 00:40:06,509
Exactly. And Viridian hates his brother because he'll be King of Unauwen, not himself.

391
00:40:07,124 --> 00:40:09,550
Viridian is his father's greatest enemy.

392
00:40:09,794 --> 00:40:11,718
That is, he was.

393
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:15,683
A few months ago he suddenly wanted to make peace with his father.

394
00:40:15,494 --> 00:40:17,814
The king sent some of his best knights to Eviellan at once...

395
00:40:18,059 --> 00:40:19,217
... to negotiate.

396
00:40:19,377 --> 00:40:20,774
Something went wrong.

397
00:40:21,476 --> 00:40:25,003
We don't know exactly why, but Edwinem had to flee.

398
00:40:25,174 --> 00:40:27,774
Well, you were the last person to speak to him.

399
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:29,786
Yes, but-- I still don't understand why...

400
00:40:29,788 --> 00:40:32,024
Red Riders!

401
00:40:32,064 --> 00:40:33,843
You stay with Tiuri!

402
00:41:47,407 --> 00:41:48,581
Give me the letter!

403
00:42:10,671 --> 00:42:12,286
Stay down, Tiuri.

404
00:42:12,656 --> 00:42:13,963
Stay down.

405
00:42:14,141 --> 00:42:15,858
You defended yourself well.

406
00:42:35,756 --> 00:42:36,991
Whoa!

407
00:42:43,451 --> 00:42:44,963
How's your arm?

408
00:42:45,087 --> 00:42:46,245
Better.

409
00:42:50,377 --> 00:42:51,794
Here our ways part, Tiuri.

410
00:42:51,941 --> 00:42:54,864
You'll have to go on foot in the mountains.

411
00:42:56,632 --> 00:42:59,651
Do I have to leave you again, Ardanwen.

412
00:43:01,232 --> 00:43:03,890
You'll have him back as soon as your mission is done.

413
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:04,794
But he's not mine!

414
00:43:04,997 --> 00:43:06,609
He is yours.

415
00:43:09,407 --> 00:43:12,127
And take the robe. It's cold up there.

416
00:43:12,075 --> 00:43:15,097
Take this rope, Tiuri. And my dagger.

417
00:43:15,591 --> 00:43:18,847
Ilmar is your master now.

418
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:20,975
Until I 'm back.

419
00:43:23,397 --> 00:43:26,383
And thanks Ilmar, you were really brave.

420
00:43:26,497 --> 00:43:28,251
Valiant of you.

421
00:43:28,163 --> 00:43:29,470
It's all right, Tiuri.

422
00:43:31,122 --> 00:43:34,213
Thank you! Thank you all!

423
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:35,807
Watch out for strangers!

424
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,434
Good journey, Tiuri!

425
00:44:11,711 --> 00:44:14,285
(Footsteps)

426
00:44:25,845 --> 00:44:28,770
Wait! Traveller!

427
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:34,088
Greetings, pilgrim. What a climb!

428
00:44:35,752 --> 00:44:40,018
I'm so glad to see you. I'm not very much at home in the mountains.

429
00:44:40,062 --> 00:44:42,362
I suppose you're going to see the hermit Menaures?

430
00:44:42,663 --> 00:44:43,372
Yes.

431
00:44:43,898 --> 00:44:46,009
Is it all right if I travel with you?

432
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:53,013
To be honest I'd rather travel alone. I'm in a hurry.

433
00:44:53,844 --> 00:44:55,969
I'm sorry, brother.

434
00:44:56,149 --> 00:44:58,294
I didn't mean to impose.

435
00:44:58,262 --> 00:44:59,772
I'll rest here for a while.

436
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:01,192
Goodbye.

437
00:45:06,056 --> 00:45:09,756
I didn't mean it like that. Of course you can come along.

438
00:45:09,779 --> 00:45:11,977
I'm sorry I was so rude.

439
00:45:12,697 --> 00:45:14,709
I promise I won't be in the way.

440
00:45:15,695 --> 00:45:18,621
I'm Jaro. I live in the valley.

441
00:45:19,228 --> 00:45:21,859
I am ... Martin.

442
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:24,483
Brother Martin.

443
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:26,661
Shall I go ahead?

444
00:46:01,687 --> 00:46:04,725
We should go up there. On top, along the chasm.

445
00:46:27,044 --> 00:46:29,457
Aah! Aargh!

446
00:46:30,731 --> 00:46:31,756
Help me!

447
00:46:31,772 --> 00:46:33,180
Take my hand.

448
00:46:36,969 --> 00:46:38,585
Grab the rope!

449
00:46:39,256 --> 00:46:44,457
It's no use.

450
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:46,413
I'm coming!

451
00:46:55,169 --> 00:46:57,157
Stand on my knee!

452
00:46:57,887 --> 00:46:59,400
Aargh!
- Stand on my knee!

453
00:47:13,284 --> 00:47:15,405
Help me up!

454
00:47:15,434 --> 00:47:16,441
Help me!

455
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,640
Help me up!

456
00:47:32,331 --> 00:47:34,976
Why didn't you help me?

457
00:48:07,722 --> 00:48:09,963
Good evening.

458
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:11,768
Good evening to you too.

459
00:48:12,249 --> 00:48:13,438
You've come to see Menaures?

460
00:48:13,812 --> 00:48:14,389
Yes.

461
00:48:15,482 --> 00:48:18,430
Menaures? Menaures.

462
00:48:18,508 --> 00:48:19,724
Visitors.

463
00:48:27,603 --> 00:48:29,774
Welcome, travellers.

464
00:48:30,452 --> 00:48:31,680
What brings you here?

465
00:48:32,512 --> 00:48:35,872
Er, well, I er...
- As for me, I'm bound for the other side of the mountains...

466
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:37,606
... holy man.

467
00:48:38,037 --> 00:48:39,713
I'm not a holy man.

468
00:48:40,129 --> 00:48:41,438
Who are you?

469
00:48:41,508 --> 00:48:45,135
Er, I'm Martin, and this is...
- Jaro.

470
00:48:45,335 --> 00:48:49,065
I've heard that you know the way through the mountains like no other.

471
00:48:49,488 --> 00:48:53,993
Ways I know, yes. Unfortunately I can't follow them myself any more.

472
00:48:54,847 --> 00:48:56,569
Perhaps you can show them to us?

473
00:48:56,603 --> 00:48:58,918
Even then. It's impossible without a guide.

474
00:49:00,703 --> 00:49:04,061
And, brother Martin, wat is the goal of your journey?

475
00:49:04,164 --> 00:49:06,738
Er, yes, I want to...

476
00:49:09,376 --> 00:49:11,191
I 'd like to talk to you about something.

477
00:49:12,125 --> 00:49:13,736
Hm?

478
00:49:13,995 --> 00:49:15,111
I'll wait here.

479
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,174
Let's go into the hut.

480
00:49:23,641 --> 00:49:26,031
My name isn't Martin.

481
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,494
I'm not a monk.

482
00:49:28,531 --> 00:49:30,031
That's what I thought.

483
00:49:30,564 --> 00:49:32,484
I am Tiuri.

484
00:49:34,314 --> 00:49:37,793
Sir Edwinem sent me. This is the ring he gave to me.

485
00:49:40,342 --> 00:49:45,303
Sir Edwinem. Bearer of the White Shield.

486
00:49:48,292 --> 00:49:52,435
He is dead. He's been murdered.

487
00:50:00,439 --> 00:50:03,158
That is sad news indeed.

488
00:50:03,478 --> 00:50:08,232
I've known him for a long time. He's been here often.

489
00:50:08,935 --> 00:50:12,018
Sit down, Tiuri, and tell me more.

490
00:50:16,155 --> 00:50:18,530
You're hurt!

491
00:50:19,414 --> 00:50:21,305
A little.

492
00:50:31,252 --> 00:50:34,837
And your mission will become harder still.

493
00:50:35,456 --> 00:50:37,900
I don't know if I can do this, Menaures.

494
00:50:38,307 --> 00:50:42,352
Why didn't someone else, a knight, get the mission?

495
00:50:43,202 --> 00:50:46,277
Don't give up now, Tiuri.

496
00:50:47,091 --> 00:50:49,742
I'll give you a guide.

497
00:50:49,992 --> 00:50:53,134
One you can trust like yourself.

498
00:50:53,942 --> 00:50:58,585
My faithful helper Piak, the boy you saw outside.

499
00:50:58,938 --> 00:51:01,760
But don't you need him yourself?

500
00:51:01,742 --> 00:51:04,622
This is more important.

501
00:51:05,113 --> 00:51:06,526
Thank you.

502
00:51:07,024 --> 00:51:11,933
Put this on. That mail shirt is far too heavy to wear in the mountains.

503
00:51:38,689 --> 00:51:40,499
(Door squeaks)

504
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:59,222
I couldn't sleep.

505
00:52:00,154 --> 00:52:04,089
Menaures, do you know what is in the letter?

506
00:52:04,126 --> 00:52:07,185
No, I don't know. Any more than you do.

507
00:52:07,573 --> 00:52:12,423
But you don't have to know. Your only charge is to deliver the letter.

508
00:52:13,994 --> 00:52:16,083
Do you know King Unauwen and his sons?

509
00:52:17,385 --> 00:52:19,217
Yes.

510
00:52:19,696 --> 00:52:23,526
I'm his brother. His twin brother.

511
00:52:23,776 --> 00:52:27,276
(Thunder)

512
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,658
The king's twin brother!

513
00:52:28,908 --> 00:52:32,105
Then you must know that Viridian wants to make peace with his father.

514
00:52:32,506 --> 00:52:36,171
Yes, perhaps he wants that.

515
00:52:37,894 --> 00:52:41,488
It's not easy being twins.

516
00:52:42,608 --> 00:52:45,436
(Thunder)

517
00:52:47,467 --> 00:52:50,795
What do you think of Jaro?

518
00:52:51,627 --> 00:52:56,981
I think he can't sleep either, just like us.

519
00:52:57,787 --> 00:53:00,744
You go. I'll keep watch.

520
00:53:01,547 --> 00:53:02,663
Thank you.

521
00:53:16,039 --> 00:53:18,651
You really have to squeeze it, Piak.

522
00:53:18,853 --> 00:53:20,766
And roll it up better.

523
00:53:27,489 --> 00:53:30,577
Good morning, Jaro. Are you ready to travel?
- I'm leaving.

524
00:53:30,539 --> 00:53:33,043
Leaving? What do you mean?

525
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:36,457
I'm going back. You beat me, yesterday.

526
00:53:36,711 --> 00:53:39,754
Beat you? How?

527
00:53:40,585 --> 00:53:43,469
I'm one of the Red Riders sent to kill you...

528
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:47,279
... so the letter you carry with you would never reach the king of Unauwen.

529
00:53:47,529 --> 00:53:51,624
I wanted to pull you into the chasm and then you were foolish enough to save my life.

530
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:53,924
And by your folly...

531
00:53:54,594 --> 00:53:56,452
... you made me powerless.

532
00:53:56,808 --> 00:54:00,066
I can't kill you. Not any more.

533
00:54:00,035 --> 00:54:01,145
Farewell.

534
00:54:03,465 --> 00:54:04,780
But what will you do now?

535
00:54:04,838 --> 00:54:06,250
That's none of your business.

536
00:54:08,543 --> 00:54:10,664
And don't think the danger is over now, either.

537
00:54:10,708 --> 00:54:15,668
If I don't return in time he will do everything to arrive before you do, by the main road.

538
00:54:15,602 --> 00:54:17,115
Who is 'he'?

539
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:19,029
Slupor.

540
00:54:18,714 --> 00:54:21,892
There's no one meaner or more cunning.

541
00:54:41,399 --> 00:54:45,863
Be careful. Very careful.

542
00:54:47,521 --> 00:54:48,990
Yes, it's all right, Piak.

543
00:54:49,108 --> 00:54:51,529
See that Tiuri gets across the mountains as quickly as possible.

544
00:54:51,659 --> 00:54:53,774
Go with him as far as is needed.

545
00:54:55,677 --> 00:54:56,593
Thank you, Menaures.

546
00:54:56,914 --> 00:54:58,019
Auspicious journey.

547
00:55:20,683 --> 00:55:24,634
Fancy your father being a knight. So are you his squire?

548
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:25,808
Yes.

549
00:55:26,158 --> 00:55:29,774
So you've learnt swordfighting, archery...

550
00:55:31,388 --> 00:55:33,277
Living in the mountains is splendid too.

551
00:55:34,199 --> 00:55:37,186
All my family is from the mountains.

552
00:55:38,436 --> 00:55:40,956
My father fell into a chasm one day.

553
00:55:41,806 --> 00:55:45,076
Because he was a daredevil, they said.

554
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:47,703
Are you a daredevil, too?

555
00:55:48,006 --> 00:55:50,608
Don't worry.

556
00:56:07,992 --> 00:56:12,033
I can't see a thing! We have to find shelter.

557
00:56:12,143 --> 00:56:15,256
I know a cave. Come on!

558
00:56:37,932 --> 00:56:42,149
We have to stay awake. Don't go to sleep!

559
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:01,998
(Footsteps)

560
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:04,495
Hey! Stay awake!

561
00:57:08,415 --> 00:57:09,840
Were you dreaming?

562
00:57:10,096 --> 00:57:11,927
I think so.

563
00:57:12,607 --> 00:57:13,910
Of what?

564
00:57:15,238 --> 00:57:16,111
My father.

565
00:57:16,187 --> 00:57:17,225
Your father?

566
00:57:18,014 --> 00:57:21,050
Yes, my father, I think.

567
00:57:36,667 --> 00:57:38,929
And I know about your secret mission, too.

568
00:57:39,266 --> 00:57:40,317
The letter.

569
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:44,113
But you can trust me.

570
00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:47,493
I do trust you, Piak.

571
00:57:47,558 --> 00:57:49,777
But you must never let anyone else know what you know.
Okay.

572
00:57:50,372 --> 00:57:53,766
Not that my name is Tiuri, either.

573
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:33,946
Look, Tiuri: Unauwen.

574
00:58:36,939 --> 00:58:39,432
I'm wondering so much what the country is like.

575
00:58:39,472 --> 00:58:41,382
I've never been there.

576
00:58:44,342 --> 00:58:44,436
What is it?

577
00:58:46,562 --> 00:58:48,368
Weren't you going to take me over the mountains...

578
00:58:48,451 --> 00:58:50,163
... and then go back to Menaures?

579
00:58:50,346 --> 00:58:52,058
Can't I come any further?

580
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:53,490
Well, you promised Menaures that you...

581
00:58:53,437 --> 00:58:56,452
That I'd go with you as far as you need me.

582
00:58:57,207 --> 00:58:58,966
Did he say that?

583
00:59:01,826 --> 00:59:04,117
I don't need you any more, Piak.

584
00:59:06,776 --> 00:59:08,792
You hate it, don't you, to be...

585
00:59:08,731 --> 00:59:11,220
Piak, listen. It's just plain too

586
00:59:11,091 --> 00:59:14,598
Dangerous? Two can do much more than one, can't they?

587
00:59:14,624 --> 00:59:17,754
Tiuri, please. Let me come with you, and then...

588
00:59:18,296 --> 00:59:23,200
Then I'll be your squire and obey you in everything.
- Stop that nonsense!

589
00:59:23,458 --> 00:59:26,787
We're just... fellow travellers.

590
00:59:27,051 --> 00:59:29,694
That's all right too.

591
00:59:29,588 --> 00:59:30,694
Yes?

592
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:33,822
Okay.

593
00:59:42,595 --> 00:59:44,807
Do you know the city of Dagonaut?

594
00:59:45,233 --> 00:59:47,448
Yes, I've been there a couple of times.

595
00:59:47,581 --> 00:59:49,314
Do you come here often, in Dangria?

596
00:59:49,355 --> 00:59:52,782
Yes, every now and again. Used to be more often.

597
01:00:06,968 --> 01:00:08,774
Good afternoon, Lord Ardoc.

598
01:00:08,852 --> 01:00:11,682
Who are your companions, if I may ask?

599
01:00:11,732 --> 01:00:15,624
Two young men from Dagonaut, from the mountains.

600
01:00:18,362 --> 01:00:20,185
Well, then I've got a pleasant surprise for you.

601
01:00:20,234 --> 01:00:26,285
Our mayor is always very interested in news from Dagonaut.

602
01:00:26,391 --> 01:00:30,351
I'm sure he'll like to meet you and dine with you.

603
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:35,050
Very nice of the mayor, but we're rather in a hurry.

604
01:00:35,051 --> 01:00:39,646
An invitation from the mayor? I know what I'd do.

605
01:00:39,701 --> 01:00:41,901
I wouldn't refuse that.

606
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:45,615
And if you want to tell about it, I'm in the White Swan Inn.
- Come along!

607
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:27,484
Wait here a moment.

608
01:01:39,144 --> 01:01:42,215
The mayor will be along presently.

609
01:01:57,686 --> 01:02:01,046
Well, well, what a surprise. Young men from Dagonaut.

610
01:02:01,115 --> 01:02:02,934
Welcome to my city.

611
01:02:03,122 --> 01:02:04,967
Thank you, Lord Mayor.

612
01:02:04,776 --> 01:02:06,789
I thought there were two of you.

613
01:02:08,178 --> 01:02:12,270
Yes, my friend is somewhere around here.
He's quite impressed with the hall.

614
01:02:13,877 --> 01:02:15,683
Let him have a look around.

615
01:02:15,874 --> 01:02:19,548
My secretary will see that you have a nice room.

616
01:02:19,475 --> 01:02:21,703
All right. Then we'll go upstairs now.

617
01:02:21,734 --> 01:02:24,972
Martin! It's a trap! The letter! I've got it here!

618
01:02:25,884 --> 01:02:26,897
Stop him!

619
01:02:26,808 --> 01:02:28,211
I'll deliver it!

620
01:02:29,325 --> 01:02:31,645
Hey, you. After him!

621
01:02:34,309 --> 01:02:35,395
Stay here! Come back! Come back!

622
01:02:48,662 --> 01:02:49,514
Yes, there!

623
01:03:00,890 --> 01:03:03,040
Open up! Open!
(Banging on the door)

624
01:03:06,409 --> 01:03:07,478
The key's gone.

625
01:03:07,515 --> 01:03:08,815
Go!

626
01:03:10,073 --> 01:03:11,176
Open up!

627
01:03:11,423 --> 01:03:13,038
Open that door!

628
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:18,024
Open it!

629
01:03:19,717 --> 01:03:21,339
He's here. Lads!

630
01:03:22,703 --> 01:03:24,951
Use the other door.

631
01:03:32,047 --> 01:03:34,069
... from the other side ...

632
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,350
Here he is.

633
01:03:41,863 --> 01:03:46,384
Ek byor ... what is this?

634
01:03:46,434 --> 01:03:51,230
Call the gatekeepers. Search the whole city!
Inns, cellars. Move, lazybones!

635
01:03:51,879 --> 01:03:53,222
The door's been bolted from the inside.

636
01:03:53,278 --> 01:03:55,886
Clumsy oafs. Break that door.
No, get an axe!

637
01:03:56,598 --> 01:03:59,248
Open up!
- Ek byor ... (etcetera)

638
01:03:59,555 --> 01:04:03,762
This is the mayor speaking.
Come out. You can't go anywhere.

639
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:07,120
(strange language)

640
01:04:16,221 --> 01:04:18,953
For the last time: give yourself up!

641
01:04:19,903 --> 01:04:23,403
(strange language)

642
01:04:46,737 --> 01:04:51,382
This is my final warning. Open that door!

643
01:04:52,132 --> 01:04:56,527
All right, stubborn little git, stay where you are.

644
01:04:56,749 --> 01:05:00,655
We'll take care of that friend of yours first.

645
01:05:05,518 --> 01:05:06,908
Piak!

646
01:05:46,094 --> 01:05:48,501
Hands on your head! Stand still.

647
01:05:48,899 --> 01:05:50,413
I'll shoot you if you move.

648
01:05:51,032 --> 01:05:51,807
Good.

649
01:05:52,608 --> 01:05:55,974
And now back slowly, very slowly.

650
01:05:56,045 --> 01:05:57,659
Backwards.

651
01:06:01,507 --> 01:06:02,917
Turn! Turn!

652
01:06:03,999 --> 01:06:05,461
Hands on your back!

653
01:06:07,399 --> 01:06:10,566
Now to the wall. To the wall!

654
01:06:15,702 --> 01:06:17,823
(Footsteps)

655
01:06:20,851 --> 01:06:24,809
(Banging on the door)
Help! Help! He's locked me in!

656
01:06:25,048 --> 01:06:26,493
Stay!

657
01:06:39,043 --> 01:06:39,937
Hands up!

658
01:06:43,967 --> 01:06:46,116
Who are you?
- That's not important.

659
01:06:47,765 --> 01:06:50,530
Apparently the mayor was expecting you.

660
01:06:50,536 --> 01:06:53,258
He gave orders to the gatekeepers that every young man...

661
01:06:53,457 --> 01:06:55,494
... between fourteen and eighteen who passed the gate ...

662
01:06:55,643 --> 01:06:57,348
... was to be brought to him.

663
01:06:57,598 --> 01:06:58,759
How do you know?

664
01:06:59,491 --> 01:07:03,149
A few days ago he got a message from the east.

665
01:07:03,388 --> 01:07:04,811
By carrier pigeon.

666
01:07:05,198 --> 01:07:08,108
I wasn't allowed to read it or to file the letter.

667
01:07:08,308 --> 01:07:09,827
Who was the message from?

668
01:07:10,698 --> 01:07:12,046
I don't

669
01:07:12,644 --> 01:07:14,914
You probably know that a lot better.

670
01:07:16,027 --> 01:07:18,051
It's safe.

671
01:07:18,882 --> 01:07:20,242
Why do you want to help me?

672
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:24,397
Because lately there's a lot happening in the city hall and in the city that I don't like.

673
01:07:24,447 --> 01:07:27,063
With the mayor...
- Piak! My friend!

674
01:07:27,415 --> 01:07:29,103
They've caught him. I have to help him!

675
01:07:29,082 --> 01:07:32,175
Well, better go right now then.
You can help your friend best if you're free.

676
01:07:32,204 --> 01:07:33,570
I'd hurry if I were you.

677
01:07:55,367 --> 01:07:58,217
Excuse me, do you happen to know where the White Swan Inn is?

678
01:07:58,229 --> 01:08:00,652
I know the way. I'll show you.

679
01:08:03,824 --> 01:08:07,542
If you want to be caught, do keep carrying that bow and arrow around.

680
01:08:14,912 --> 01:08:16,106
Wait here.

681
01:08:29,485 --> 01:08:34,824
(Noise)

682
01:08:35,852 --> 01:08:36,937
Tiuri!

683
01:08:36,973 --> 01:08:37,980
Piak!

684
01:08:38,651 --> 01:08:41,570
I was hiding behind here. I don't dare go inside.

685
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:43,978
Oh, I'm so glad that they didn't ...
- Not you, either?

686
01:08:44,672 --> 01:08:46,304
The secretary.

687
01:08:46,872 --> 01:08:49,570
The whole city is ...
-Go, go, go, go!

688
01:08:53,976 --> 01:08:57,358
... have a look, because they entered the city with this merchant Ardoc.

689
01:08:57,369 --> 01:09:01,111
The mayor closed all the gates, so we should be able to find them.

690
01:09:01,257 --> 01:09:05,021
We'll keep looking, Master Secretary.
- I'll keep looking for them too.

691
01:09:11,476 --> 01:09:13,715
Your friend hasn't been in.

692
01:09:14,452 --> 01:09:18,028
Ah! All right, you must go. Now.

693
01:09:18,402 --> 01:09:20,959
I know a way. Come on!

694
01:09:22,852 --> 01:09:26,347
I'll go to the City of Unauwen as soon as I can to inform the king.

695
01:09:32,056 --> 01:09:38,998
Listen. Over here, then to the right.
Go on until you get to the Rainbow River and cross the toll-bridge.

696
01:09:39,156 --> 01:09:40,865
Yes.
- Go!

697
01:09:41,314 --> 01:09:43,519
Thank you.
- Thanks.

698
01:10:03,876 --> 01:10:06,729
Here you are, and goodbye!

699
01:10:06,952 --> 01:10:08,702
Come, let's go.

700
01:10:09,374 --> 01:10:11,598
Three gold pieces!?

701
01:10:11,648 --> 01:10:12,864
Hi Warmin.

702
01:10:13,384 --> 01:10:17,572
Whoever crosses the Rainbow River for the first time has to pay the toll.

703
01:10:17,654 --> 01:10:19,472
But we don't have that much.

704
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,222
Then you can't pass.

705
01:10:24,716 --> 01:10:27,742
So poor people can never cross.
Oh yes they can!

706
01:10:28,688 --> 01:10:33,410
They can earn their toll money by working on the lord's farms, over there.

707
01:10:33,659 --> 01:10:36,892
Each week that you work you earn one gold piece, so...

708
01:10:37,176 --> 01:10:39,092
We don't have that much time.

709
01:10:39,923 --> 01:10:42,748
That's what everybody says who wants to cross for free.

710
01:10:43,042 --> 01:10:46,379
Anyone who tries to cross some other way ...

711
01:10:46,554 --> 01:10:49,083
... is caught and locked up for three weeks.

712
01:10:52,096 --> 01:10:55,119
All right, let's go work on the farm. Come on.

713
01:10:59,304 --> 01:11:01,114
You didn't mean it about the farm, did you?

714
01:11:00,939 --> 01:11:03,665
No, of course not. We'll have to think of something else.

715
01:11:08,536 --> 01:11:10,450
I can't swim.

716
01:11:11,466 --> 01:11:12,678
You can still go back.

717
01:11:12,996 --> 01:11:15,138
Why? Do you think I'm scared?

718
01:11:15,257 --> 01:11:16,573
Yes.

719
01:11:24,084 --> 01:11:28,819
I've got an idea. But we'll have to wait until dark. Come on.

720
01:11:45,548 --> 01:11:49,712
I don't mind if you start a little later ...

721
01:12:33,706 --> 01:12:34,813
Are you all right?

722
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:46,948
We're almost there.

723
01:12:47,199 --> 01:12:48,205
I see.

724
01:13:07,608 --> 01:13:08,478
Piak!

725
01:13:12,939 --> 01:13:16,461
Piak! Piak!

726
01:13:16,572 --> 01:13:18,686
It's so much water.

727
01:13:18,648 --> 01:13:20,763
We've made it.

728
01:13:23,266 --> 01:13:25,352
Tiuri! You rescued me!

729
01:13:25,471 --> 01:13:27,777
What are you talking about? Of course I rescued you.

730
01:13:27,568 --> 01:13:31,510
Not listening, eh? Now you're even worse off!

731
01:13:31,474 --> 01:13:32,719
Three weeks in the lockup.

732
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:35,684
No! I want to speak to the lord!

733
01:13:35,694 --> 01:13:38,679
Wait what?
- I've got something! I can pay with this.

734
01:13:38,770 --> 01:13:40,739
It's worth much more than three gold pieces.

735
01:13:42,605 --> 01:13:44,797
I was really given it, my lord.

736
01:13:44,928 --> 01:13:47,533
Given? By whom?

737
01:13:47,573 --> 01:13:49,583
You're babbling! Look!

738
01:13:51,619 --> 01:13:53,034
There are only twelve of these.

739
01:13:53,915 --> 01:13:56,733
It's a personal gift from the King of Unauwen.

740
01:13:58,422 --> 01:14:01,684
Don't tell me any lies! How did you get this ring?

741
01:14:01,868 --> 01:14:04,429
My lord, I got it from someone I think you know.

742
01:14:04,526 --> 01:14:06,035
Sir Edwinem.

743
01:14:08,013 --> 01:14:11,145
Are you claiming that Sir Edwinem gave you this ring?
- He's been murdered, my lord.

744
01:14:11,207 --> 01:14:14,639
What did you say?
- He's been murdered.

745
01:14:15,438 --> 01:14:17,255
By the Red Riders from Eviellan.

746
01:14:18,227 --> 01:14:20,039
Murdered.

747
01:14:34,723 --> 01:14:36,643
Whoa!

748
01:14:38,476 --> 01:14:40,250
I'm on my way to Unauwen.

749
01:14:40,697 --> 01:14:44,301
Ah! The secretary. Good evening.
- I have an important message for the king.

750
01:14:45,230 --> 01:14:46,846
Have a good journey.

751
01:14:50,889 --> 01:14:53,932
I don't understand any more what's going on in this country.

752
01:14:54,224 --> 01:14:56,325
But I do understand now why you are in such a hurry.

753
01:14:57,131 --> 01:14:58,984
I just hope we can stay ahead of that Slupor.

754
01:14:59,039 --> 01:15:01,919
Do you have any idea of what he looks like?
- None, my lord.

755
01:15:03,653 --> 01:15:08,797
Here. Give it only to the king himself.

756
01:15:09,408 --> 01:15:11,928
Marwinni, see that he and his friend Piak ...

757
01:15:12,049 --> 01:15:14,371
... get horses and weapons, they must be off at once.

758
01:15:15,043 --> 01:15:16,358
Certainly, my lord.

759
01:15:17,353 --> 01:15:18,542
Thank you.

760
01:15:21,863 --> 01:15:24,725
Where did you learn to ride like that, little horseman?

761
01:15:24,791 --> 01:15:27,666
On a mountain goat, little knight.

762
01:15:30,742 --> 01:15:31,563
Go ahead.

763
01:15:38,333 --> 01:15:41,962
(strange language)

764
01:15:45,393 --> 01:15:49,955
Piak, do you have a good memory? Words and things?

765
01:15:50,411 --> 01:15:53,306
Words? How, words?

766
01:15:53,562 --> 01:15:55,581
Er, yes.

767
01:15:55,631 --> 01:15:59,492
Ek byo jor adleggia alt kappa.
- What? What did you say?

768
01:16:00,242 --> 01:16:04,204
Those are some of the words from the letter.
I think you should learn them too.

769
01:16:04,932 --> 01:16:08,721
You said that my mission is yours as well.

770
01:16:09,062 --> 01:16:13,288
If anything happens to me, then... then you...

771
01:16:14,421 --> 01:16:16,740
Hm. Say something?

772
01:16:17,034 --> 01:16:21,467
All right. Listen.
Ek byo jor adleggia alt kappa.

773
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:24,220
Ek byo jor...

774
01:16:24,403 --> 01:16:26,177
... adeggia ...
- ... adleggia ...

775
01:16:26,938 --> 01:16:28,563
... kappa.
- Alt kappa.

776
01:16:28,502 --> 01:16:29,309
Alt kappa.

777
01:16:30,161 --> 01:16:32,408
You know what, Tiuri? We ought to sing it.

778
01:16:32,658 --> 01:16:36,333
Sing it?
- Yes. That makes it easier to remember.

779
01:16:36,610 --> 01:16:42,925
(Singing) Ek byo jor adleggia alt kappa ...

780
01:16:45,193 --> 01:16:46,910
Not so loud!

781
01:16:48,655 --> 01:16:53,524
(Humming)

782
01:17:22,516 --> 01:17:25,437
Come. Shh.

783
01:17:30,148 --> 01:17:31,312
Did you hear that?

784
01:17:31,694 --> 01:17:32,803
What was that?

785
01:17:33,653 --> 01:17:38,857
I don't know.

786
01:17:35,713 --> 01:17:40,573
(Footsteps)

787
01:17:47,542 --> 01:17:51,902
What are you doing?
- I'm going to look. You stay here.

788
01:18:24,036 --> 01:18:28,425
Piak, he helped us, and now ...

789
01:18:29,812 --> 01:18:31,112
Don't move!

790
01:18:31,362 --> 01:18:34,035
There, by that tree, on the hill.

791
01:18:35,310 --> 01:18:36,623
Come on!

792
01:18:40,485 --> 01:18:42,554
If he's there our lives are at stake.

793
01:18:42,587 --> 01:18:44,004
Who? Do you think ...
- Shh!

794
01:18:46,908 --> 01:18:48,220
Come on, come on!

795
01:19:09,229 --> 01:19:13,596
They must be here somewhere. I can tell by the tracks.

796
01:19:12,798 --> 01:19:13,942
I think that's Warmin.

797
01:19:13,983 --> 01:19:15,894
Martin! Piak!

798
01:19:16,144 --> 01:19:17,523
Who are you?

799
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:22,781
I am Warmin, the tollbridge warden,
to offer you protect you.

800
01:19:32,614 --> 01:19:40,046
Er, we just found someone.
Dead. There.

801
01:19:47,007 --> 01:19:49,763
I'll see to it that he's buried.

802
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:57,623
Iminir let the black stranger through ...

803
01:19:57,673 --> 01:20:00,438
... who asked whether two young men, friends of his from Dangria ...

804
01:20:00,652 --> 01:20:02,314
... had passed through.

805
01:20:02,215 --> 01:20:04,186
I told him that I'd let through a young horseman from Dangria ...

806
01:20:04,281 --> 01:20:06,730
... with a sealed message for King Unauwen.

807
01:20:06,776 --> 01:20:09,121
Then he looked at me with very scary eyes ...

808
01:20:09,237 --> 01:20:11,173
... and he wanted to know what the young man looked like.

809
01:20:11,244 --> 01:20:13,110
And he spurred on his horse right away.

810
01:20:13,154 --> 01:20:16,175
Yes, I thought it was so strange, I went to tell the lord at once.

811
01:20:16,903 --> 01:20:20,333
You search around here.
Catch him, dead or alive. Go!

812
01:20:20,985 --> 01:20:24,360
We'll accompany you to the inn at Ingewel.

813
01:20:31,777 --> 01:20:33,795
Why did you let us sleep?

814
01:20:33,645 --> 01:20:35,550
You were exhausted.

815
01:20:35,982 --> 01:20:37,303
Yes, but we have to go quickly.

816
01:20:37,473 --> 01:20:38,883
I know; eat first.

817
01:20:40,039 --> 01:20:41,244
Eat something.

818
01:20:41,894 --> 01:20:46,207
There's a messenger here wants to speak to the warden. Is that you
- Yes.

819
01:20:56,058 --> 01:20:59,620
Are you Master Warmin from the toll bridge?
- Yes.

820
01:21:01,367 --> 01:21:06,069
I have a message for you.
And for the two young men travelling with you.

821
01:21:06,743 --> 01:21:08,156
Go on.

822
01:21:08,649 --> 01:21:12,076
Tonight in our village your men caught the one ...

823
01:21:13,116 --> 01:21:15,829
... who killed that young man from Dangria.

824
01:21:15,917 --> 01:21:20,386
He had a strange name, Sloo... Sl...

825
01:21:20,689 --> 01:21:23,428
Oh! Slupor, I think.

826
01:21:24,355 --> 01:21:25,068
Slupor!

827
01:21:25,118 --> 01:21:28,962
First he denied being the killer, but when we'd locked him up ...

828
01:21:29,034 --> 01:21:32,108
... he started to curse and swear like anything.

829
01:21:32,464 --> 01:21:34,480
It fair scared me!

830
01:21:34,830 --> 01:21:36,830
But fortunately he's locked up now.

831
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:39,615
They've caught him, Piak.

832
01:21:40,246 --> 01:21:42,259
Thank you very much for this good news.

833
01:21:42,509 --> 01:21:46,192
No thanks, Master Warmin.
I'll be getting back home. Good day.

834
01:21:48,563 --> 01:21:50,500
Well lads, you've heard it.
- Yes.

835
01:21:50,509 --> 01:21:52,275
You can go on alone.

836
01:22:01,594 --> 01:22:05,216
We're there! Almost.

837
01:22:06,908 --> 01:22:07,721
Come on.

838
01:22:44,962 --> 01:22:45,982
There.

839
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:53,799
Excuse me, do you know where the palace is
- That way.

840
01:22:53,847 --> 01:22:55,554
Thank you.

841
01:22:57,686 --> 01:23:00,376
Friendly people here.
- Yes.

842
01:23:03,847 --> 01:23:09,646
A penny please ... Please, a penny ...

843
01:23:10,221 --> 01:23:13,534
Please, travellers, a penny!

844
01:23:13,469 --> 01:23:16,992
Shall we give him our last coins?
- Yes. For luck.

845
01:23:17,303 --> 01:23:22,891
Thank you, stranger.
May you achieve in your life what you deserve.

846
01:23:25,405 --> 01:23:27,498
Slupor!
- You fool!

847
01:23:35,685 --> 01:23:37,830
Give me the letter!

848
01:24:05,950 --> 01:24:09,503
Get that beggar! A traitor! A murderer!

849
01:24:11,949 --> 01:24:14,365
Tiuri! Catch!

850
01:24:29,734 --> 01:24:34,380
See him lying there.
Sir Tiuri the Valiant's spoilt little boy.

851
01:24:34,415 --> 01:24:38,240
Everything has gone wrong.
No letter for the king and not a knight.

852
01:24:38,281 --> 01:24:40,098
It was all in vain, little man.

853
01:24:39,834 --> 01:24:42,290
Pride goes before the fall.

854
01:24:46,082 --> 01:24:50,853
Come on, strike!
Hey! Or don't you have the guts?

855
01:24:50,910 --> 01:24:54,382
Another attack of compassion?
Coward!

856
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:55,959
Let go of me!

857
01:24:57,352 --> 01:25:01,210
A curse on you, Tiuri, and on your famous father.

858
01:25:01,248 --> 01:25:05,031
Blood be on you, the king, and this whole despicable country.

859
01:25:13,834 --> 01:25:14,930
Dead!

860
01:25:16,641 --> 01:25:19,531
Tiuri! The ring, the ring!

861
01:25:20,692 --> 01:25:22,897
I've got a very important message for the king!

862
01:25:22,991 --> 01:25:25,207
This ring is proof. You must believe me!

863
01:25:25,536 --> 01:25:27,252
You must believe me!

864
01:25:29,576 --> 01:25:33,452
All right. To the palace.

865
01:25:39,646 --> 01:25:42,266
The king can receive you now.
- Good luck.

866
01:25:50,249 --> 01:25:52,278
Come closer, messenger.

867
01:26:06,153 --> 01:26:10,837
Sire, I bring you a message from Sir Edwinem with the White Shield.

868
01:26:13,191 --> 01:26:16,281
Rise. First, rise.

869
01:26:19,244 --> 01:26:21,655
I have to tell you that Sir Edwinem ...

870
01:26:22,302 --> 01:26:23,813
... is dead,.

871
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:27,903
Before he died he gave me a letter to deliver to you ...

872
01:26:28,092 --> 01:26:29,637
... and his ring as well.

873
01:26:40,671 --> 01:26:42,084
Give me the letter.

874
01:26:43,369 --> 01:26:44,774
I don't have it any more.

875
01:26:45,684 --> 01:26:47,365
Sir Edwinem laid it on me to destroy the letter ...

876
01:26:47,415 --> 01:26:49,528
... if there was any danger of it being taken from me.

877
01:26:50,036 --> 01:26:51,552
So I did that.

878
01:26:52,350 --> 01:26:54,587
But I know the contents by heart.

879
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:57,634
Who are you?

880
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:00,461
Tiuri, Sire.

881
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:03,776
Well, Tiuri, I'm listening.

882
01:27:08,134 --> 01:27:10,946
I have to think.

883
01:27:12,727 --> 01:27:17,322
My friend, he's waiting outside, he knows ... he's made a tune ...

884
01:27:19,367 --> 01:27:24,616
(Hums)
Ek byo jor ...

885
01:27:24,677 --> 01:27:31,897
Ek byo jor adleggia (etcetera)

886
01:27:51,578 --> 01:27:52,982
That's all.

887
01:28:01,907 --> 01:28:05,529
Call the crown prince and all knights and councillors of the realm ...

888
01:28:05,598 --> 01:28:08,635
... for a very pressing matter, at once.

889
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:18,974
It has been known to you for some time ...

890
01:28:19,258 --> 01:28:24,698
... that the Prince of Eviellan, my son Viridian, sought to make peace.

891
01:28:26,147 --> 01:28:30,375
But then, the letter arrives ...

892
01:28:30,378 --> 01:28:32,732
... which tells us what danger would have befallen us ...

893
01:28:33,286 --> 01:28:36,186
... if we had accepted his proposals for peace.

894
01:28:36,991 --> 01:28:43,423
It says that after the treaty the crown prince, Prince Iridian ...

895
01:28:44,329 --> 01:28:47,096
... would have met with sudden death.

896
01:28:48,567 --> 01:28:53,343
Viridian was plotting to poison his brother ...

897
01:28:53,025 --> 01:28:55,844
... his twin brother! ...

898
01:28:55,915 --> 01:28:59,921
... as soon as nobody suspected him of any malice any longer.

899
01:29:01,037 --> 01:29:03,232
To have him murdered.

900
01:29:05,088 --> 01:29:08,524
And he himself would have been heir to the throne ...

901
01:29:08,584 --> 01:29:14,846
... and so, after my death, ruler of our beloved realm, Unauwen.

902
01:29:16,264 --> 01:29:20,587
And from here he would also have been a threat for the Realm of Dagonaut ...

903
01:29:21,234 --> 01:29:23,753
... the homeland of Tiuri and his friend.

904
01:29:26,750 --> 01:29:32,654
It is a sad tale, a very sad tale, that I had to tell.

905
01:29:33,165 --> 01:29:36,837
But now we know where the danger lies.

906
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:41,875
Therefore I would call you, if it is needed ...

907
01:29:42,049 --> 01:29:46,391
... to take up arms together against him.

908
01:29:46,399 --> 01:29:49,165
Which of you will join me?

909
01:29:49,271 --> 01:29:51,391
(Cheers)

910
01:30:23,390 --> 01:30:24,576
Menaures!

911
01:30:25,261 --> 01:30:28,114
Piak. Welcome.

912
01:30:30,041 --> 01:30:31,839
Tiuri.
- Good day, Menaures.

913
01:30:32,141 --> 01:30:34,897
Come on in.

914
01:30:38,351 --> 01:30:40,436
Everybody is grateful to you, Tiuri ...

915
01:30:40,549 --> 01:30:43,943
... for what you have accomplished together with Piak.

916
01:30:47,205 --> 01:30:49,425
Have you missed me, Menaures?

917
01:30:50,464 --> 01:30:53,322
Certainly I have.

918
01:30:53,398 --> 01:30:59,061
And-- what if I went with Tiuri to Dagonaut?

919
01:30:59,949 --> 01:31:04,085
That I have missed you doesn't mean that I can't do without you.

920
01:31:05,826 --> 01:31:10,370
There will always be something you miss, whether you go or stay.

921
01:31:16,918 --> 01:31:20,066
You have to make up your own mind, Piak.

922
01:31:23,511 --> 01:31:26,943
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

923
01:32:05,915 --> 01:32:06,829
Whoa!

924
01:32:10,787 --> 01:32:13,400
Tiuri! You're back!

925
01:32:27,736 --> 01:32:28,953
Sire.

926
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:37,526
That you ran away from the chapel,
that has never happened of here before.

927
01:32:39,795 --> 01:32:43,104
And I consider it a very serious transgression.

928
01:32:53,633 --> 01:32:57,739
Now go, and give my regards to your father.

929
01:33:08,766 --> 01:33:11,768
Tiuri!
- Mother!

930
01:33:12,017 --> 01:33:15,142
O darling, I've been so worried!

931
01:33:17,107 --> 01:33:18,892
How is Father? What does he think ...

932
01:33:19,142 --> 01:33:23,420
I don't know. He's been very upset. I ...

933
01:33:23,432 --> 01:33:24,966
(Footsteps)

934
01:33:33,387 --> 01:33:35,491
Father, I ...

935
01:33:35,663 --> 01:33:37,944
If in four years you get another chance ...

936
01:33:38,226 --> 01:33:40,823
... to have a wake in the chapel ...

937
01:33:41,570 --> 01:33:44,197
... and there would be someone asking for help again ...

938
01:33:45,198 --> 01:33:46,576
... what would you do?

939
01:33:47,537 --> 01:33:49,152
I'd do the same.

940
01:33:50,633 --> 01:33:52,933
You'd do the same.

941
01:33:55,487 --> 01:33:57,812
I'm so sorry, Father.

942
01:34:03,288 --> 01:34:05,600
I'm so glad you're standing here in front of me again, son.

943
01:34:09,615 --> 01:34:11,532
And that you're alive.

944
01:34:14,167 --> 01:34:16,827
That you're alive, my son.

945
01:34:17,899 --> 01:34:19,985
But I'm not a knight.

946
01:34:20,823 --> 01:34:23,548
I've heard that you have behaved in a knightly way.

947
01:34:24,628 --> 01:34:26,471
Not all the time.

948
01:34:27,408 --> 01:34:32,916
Father, may I be your squire again for the next four years?

949
01:34:38,028 --> 01:34:40,732
That is for the king to decide.

950
01:35:25,810 --> 01:35:28,953
And that is why our knights also, with their men ...

951
01:35:28,963 --> 01:35:30,878
... will go to the southern border ...

952
01:35:30,906 --> 01:35:35,663
... to stop the power-hungry Prince Viridian.

953
01:35:36,733 --> 01:35:39,690
But in the letter I was sent by King Unauwen ...

954
01:35:40,028 --> 01:35:44,310
... which has been delivered to me by Tiuri, son of Sir Tiuri ...

955
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:46,961
... there is more.

956
01:35:48,111 --> 01:35:54,302
And that is why I now ask him to come forward.

957
01:36:04,959 --> 01:36:10,131
Tiuri, son of Tiuri the Valiant ...

958
01:36:11,423 --> 01:36:14,067
... you know that in this palace ...

959
01:36:14,806 --> 01:36:20,230
... squires are knighted only once every four years.

960
01:36:20,748 --> 01:36:22,913
You have forfeited your chance.

961
01:36:23,316 --> 01:36:26,285
If that night in the chapel you would not have answered ...

962
01:36:26,326 --> 01:36:28,346
... the plea for help ...

963
01:36:28,752 --> 01:36:33,292
... then you would now have been ...

964
01:36:33,549 --> 01:36:35,267
... a knight, like the four others.

965
01:36:38,073 --> 01:36:39,353
But--

966
01:36:40,858 --> 01:36:43,182
But now that you have done that ...

967
01:36:43,912 --> 01:36:48,735
... and kept your promise to the murdered Sir Edwinem of Foresterra ...

968
01:36:49,328 --> 01:36:54,962
... and so spared both Unauwen and our country a disaster ...

969
01:36:55,718 --> 01:36:58,037
... would you not be a knight?

970
01:36:59,107 --> 01:37:01,435
You haven't been dubbed ...

971
01:37:02,035 --> 01:37:04,859
... but you have shown yourself to be a knight.

972
01:37:05,376 --> 01:37:11,562
You can be a knight even without sword and shield.

973
01:37:14,872 --> 01:37:16,584
Give me your sword.

974
01:37:23,658 --> 01:37:24,967
Kneel.

975
01:37:40,331 --> 01:37:44,167
Sir Tiuri.

976
01:37:46,905 --> 01:37:53,014
You shall have Sir Edwinem of Foresterra's shield.

977
01:37:54,221 --> 01:37:58,761
And that the shield is white also means that you, at his express request ...

978
01:37:58,854 --> 01:38:02,405
... shall also serve the King of Unauwen.

979
01:38:02,497 --> 01:38:06,647
Because you saved both our countries from disaster.

980
01:38:11,544 --> 01:38:14,882
Arise, Sir Tiuri.

981
01:38:24,638 --> 01:38:28,323
I vow to serve you faithfully as a knight, and also all your subjects ...

982
01:38:28,570 --> 01:38:30,389
... and whosoever seeks succour from me.

983
01:38:31,106 --> 01:38:35,370
I vow to wield my sword only for good, against evil ...

984
01:38:35,458 --> 01:38:39,863
... and with my shield protect those that are weaker than myself.

985
01:38:42,986 --> 01:38:45,474
Long live Sir Tiuri with the White Shield!

986
01:38:46,136 --> 01:38:50,403
(Applause)

987
01:39:13,957 --> 01:39:16,217
Tiuri spent that night in solitude in the chapel ...

988
01:39:16,614 --> 01:39:19,436
... to prove himself in the knight's final test after all.

989
01:39:19,700 --> 01:39:22,230
Now all his adventures seemed a dream.

990
01:39:22,903 --> 01:39:25,124
He thought of the people he had met ...

991
01:39:25,509 --> 01:39:27,167
... of his future as a knight ...

992
01:39:27,325 --> 01:39:31,950
... and above all of Lavinia.

993
01:39:34,869 --> 01:39:37,720
But that Piak had chosen to leave Menaures ...

994
01:39:37,722 --> 01:39:38,938
... to become his squire ...

995
01:39:39,179 --> 01:39:40,660
Piak
- Tiuri!

996
01:39:40,660 --> 01:39:43,792
... was more than he had dared dream.

997
01:39:49,175 --> 01:39:50,929
Is that Lavinia?

998
01:39:51,296 --> 01:39:53,776
Yes. That's her.

999
01:40:42,921 --> 01:40:50,152
