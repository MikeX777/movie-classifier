00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:37,291
(Commotion)

2
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,166
Gilbert, I don't have it.

3
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:41,291
-It's not true ?

4
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,000
-In 25 years, 
I have never forgotten a corkscrew.

5
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:45,916
-Promise, I won't say it.

6
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:47,208
-Thank you.

7
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:49,333
-Christian? The crane.

8
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,125
-Yes I know.

9
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:54,708
(Cadenced music)

10
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,708
-51 meters high.

11
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:43,166
This crane can lift 
up to 100 tonnes!

12
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:46,875
One hundred tonnes of containers 
to unload ships.

13
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:48,166
-BRAVO !

14
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:55,333
-This crane 
is three million euros!

15
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:57,583
-Four. 
-I'm told four.

16
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,333
-AH YES. 
-Financed

17
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,625
40% 
from the Languedoc-Roussillon region.

18
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:03,708
-Occitanie.

19
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:06,500
- Sorry, no, no. Occitanie!

20
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:08,833
-AH ANYWAY !

21
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,958
-40% by the general council

22
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:20,166
of the eastern Pyrenees!

23
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:26,791
40% by the ... 
-No, because here we are at 120%.

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,333
-Ah, well yes.

25
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:33,708
And at 20% by the 
Perpignan Chamber of Commerce , in charge

26
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:35,666
port management.

27
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:40,291
I now declare open 
the crane's inauguration

28
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:43,125
<span id="divTranslatedText27" contenteditable="true">ceremony</span>! 
(Applause)

29
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:46,666
-Thank you.

30
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,625
(Whispers)

31
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,541
-And There you go ! 
(Clamor)

32
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:00,666
-Thank you.

33
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,583
-My dear friends, this crane,

34
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:11,000
unique, is able to lift everything. 
All ! Except our glasses.

35
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,958
(Laughs)

36
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:17,291
I now appeal 
to the essentials, let's raise our glasses!

37
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,875
And for that, 
I invite you to join

38
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,041
the buffet with confidence.

39
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,666
(Brouhaha)

40
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:37,500
-You saw the mayor 
for the inauguration?

41
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:39,750
"Yes, the pride of Port-Vendres,

42
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:42,416
"a 51 meter high crane!

43
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,250
"Huh, Milene, Milene ..."

44
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,750
-Wait, I'm doing Milene.

45
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,291
"I'm coming, Mr. Mayor, I'm coming!"

46
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:52,375
-Milene!

47
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:55,500
-Wait, I have something to say. 
-AH.

48
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,791
-I have something to tell you.

49
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:00,166
So what's going on?

50
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:01,958
-Oh, Christian! 
-What?

51
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,375
-It's homemade, 
I just finished.

52
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:08,291
-You don't have any other 
boxes in your freezer

53
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,583
homemade? 
(Laughs)

54
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,375
There's Jean-Mi, 
and that's why we're here,

55
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:16,083
celebrating the end 
of his nervous breakdown!

56
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,291
-YES!

57
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,333
-Thank you. 
-go, JEAN-MI!

58
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,333
JEAN-MI! JEAN-MI!

59
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,791
-But Jean-Mi, you too! 
Looked !

60
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:27,916
-I walked in. 
-Shit, that brings good luck.

61
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,791
(Laughs)

62
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:34,000
-It's true that it's better. 
I feel it !

63
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,083
I used to cry for nothing.

64
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,958
All this is over.

65
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,375
I feel depression ...

66
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,625
is behind me.

67
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:47,375
-Jean-Mi is healed! 
-YES!

68
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:51,000
JEAN-MI! JEAN-MI! JEAN-MI!

69
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,583
-She has a face.

70
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,375
- For the moment, 
no boat to unload.

71
00:04:57,583 --> 00:05:00,291
Those who come 
already have their crane!

72
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,791
-But it's a region 
that has projects.

73
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:06,875
As an elected official, it is useless to carry out 
projects, it is enough to have them.

74
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,666
(Laughs)

75
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,333
By the way, Mr. Mayor.

76
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,500
-Yes ? 
-What's up ?

77
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:12,958
-For ?

78
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:16,458
-You were not committed 
to reduce the staff of the town hall?

79
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:17,875
-Is that so ? Menard?

80
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,833
-It becomes clearer. We are going to ...

81
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,000
We're going to strangle them.

82
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,291
- Can't we wait for 
the elections?

83
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,208
We elected, we are still there 
to be re-elected.

84
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:30,583
(Laughs)

85
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,416
-But, Mayor, I 
promise, I promise.

86
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,208
-Ah yes.

87
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:35,666
-let's go to the crane!

88
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,333
-TO THE CRANE.

89
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,708
-What is that ?

90
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:49,000
-It's weird. 
It's the same, but it's not the same.

91
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:50,125
-I dunno.

92
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,875
-Something is missing.

93
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,000
-Thierry ?

94
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,708
-Yes, my Michel?

95
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,833
(He moans.) 
What is it?

96
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:02,625
(he whispers) 
- What is it?

97
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,583
-What? 
-What's this ?

98
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,666
Speak !

99
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,958
-I do not understand. 
-Wait, I did taekwondo.

100
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,916
I'm a good one! 
-It's okay.

101
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:15,916
-Thierry, you can mess around 
on women and rugby,

102
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:19,833
on your homemade frozen dishes, 
but never on Ricard!

103
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:22,666
You will not kiss us on the Ricard! 
-Speak !

104
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,166
Before it's too late.

105
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,500
He can be stupid, and so can I!

106
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:29,125
If we start with 2, 
you will believe that we are 3.

107
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,375
-I know.

108
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,500
It's not pastis 51.

109
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,458
It's pastis 45! 
-It's not true ?

110
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,416
- You never do it again!

111
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,833
You never do that to us!

112
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,541
Six degrees?

113
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:49,041
In the yellow, 
it's like at NASA,

114
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,208
within 6 degrees, 
you miss the goal!

115
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:54,625
-Six degrees lower, 
you're targeting Cahors, you're farting Limoges.

116
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,958
-We have no room for error. 
-NO.

117
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,708
-You know 
what the town hall is preparing for us?

118
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:03,375
Lay off people.

119
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:06,708
We won't let it happen. 
The revolt rumbles.

120
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,166
The fight is getting ready!

121
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:09,791
(He sings) 
<i>It's the fight</i>

122
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:12,416
<i>Finale</i>

123
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:15,708
<i>Let's get together and tomorrow</i>

124
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:20,000
<i>The International</i>

125
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:23,083
<i>Will be the human race</i>

126
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,750
-I didn't introduce 
Frédéric Lambert from BIC.

127
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,916
-The what? 
-The Catalan Industrial Bank.

128
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,958
- Sir. 
-My regards.

129
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,041
I introduce you

130
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,375
my wife, Céline.

131
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,333
- My tributes, madam.

132
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,166
You're charming.

133
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,125
-Thank you.

134
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,541
-She often comes to rest 
on our sailboat.

135
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:44,333
-It's so relaxing, 
so peaceful ...

136
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,875
Sometimes a little long, 
especially in the evening.

137
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:50,833
-Ah yes, that is loneliness.

138
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,541
I will come to see you.

139
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,666
Finally, see your boat, 
because I love sailing.

140
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:57,916
-You cross out?

141
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,708
-All the time. 
Finally, as soon as possible.

142
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:05,833
I love tillers, 
straight bars, very solid.

143
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,791
Finally, the bars, what.

144
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,416
-Me too.

145
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,333
-Here, there. 
I suggest you taste

146
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,916
these famous mini-pizzas

147
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,916
of Thierry, on the quay. 
-Thank you.

148
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,458
-It's homemade.

149
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:21,458
Please, Mr. Mayor. 
With me...

150
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:22,375
-I'm not hungry anymore.

151
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,583
-We do the prawn dance?

152
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,916
-YES!

153
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,708
- I'm going to get my guitar.

154
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,000
-NON !

155
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:34,791
-But, you, 
I'm doing taekwondo.

156
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,083
-Get out of here !

157
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,750
-XO, XO, HI, HI. 
(They chuckle.)

158
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,000
-Let's go !

159
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:44,666

160
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,458

00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:31,375
<i>IT'S THE DANCE OF THE GAMBAS</i>

179
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:34,583
<i>MOUTH FULL, FULL HAND 
It's disgusting</i>

180
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:35,833
<i>PALAM PAM PAM</i>

181
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,583
<i>WE ARE...</i>

182
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,375
-It's homemade! 
(Hubbub)

183
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,583
<i>-WE ARE ... 
-GAMBAS!</i>

184
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,750
-Very beautiful house.

185
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,458
-Ah yes, really, very beautiful. 
-Thank you.

186
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:57,750
So, I don't know 
if you saw the terrace,

187
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:01,416
but the stainless steel posts 
were welded by hand,

188
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:02,750
old.

189
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,708
-By the municipal, I hope?

190
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:07,541
-You are never better served 
than by yourself.

191
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,208
-During working hours? 
-Of course.

192
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:14,708
-Of course. There are some leaders, 
but they have a good background.

193
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:17,458
Ah, Madame Lambert!

194
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,125
Have you seen my posts? 
-Stainless steel posts!

195
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,916
Welded by hand, I love it.

196
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,083
- By hand, I love it.

197
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,958
(Laughs) 
Huh, Mayor?

198
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,958
-Are you doing well, Ménard?

199
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:33,458
-Please have 
a moment of attention.

200
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:37,166
-Wait, there is Gilbert 
who wants to speak. Listen to Gilbert!

201
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,791
-Thank you, Christian.

202
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:42,625
-I will help you. Oh, silence, 
there is Gilbert who wants to speak.

203
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:45,541
-So ... 
-I have something to say before.

204
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,291
Good news, that's it,

205
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:51,125
the union office, 
he connected us.

206
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,791
La "wify" marche.

207
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,583
-AH !

208
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,458
-We will vote 
for the trip with the union.

209
00:10:58,625 --> 00:10:59,916
We have 2 options.

210
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:04,500
Or a 3-day stay in Paris, 
with a visit to the Louvre,

211
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:07,291
Eiffel Tower, 
Sacré-Coeur, finally ...

212
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,541
With Paris, 
with the air of Paris, gray weather,

213
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,958
pollution ... Paris, what!

214
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:17,541
Either 3 days in Perthus, 
with its snow-capped mountains,

215
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,958
its clean air, its zero-rated Ricard,

216
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:23,291
and his daughters who are waiting 
to get the purses.

217
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,666
We go to the vote,

218
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:27,041
who is for Perthus? 
-YES!

219
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,833
-For the 6th consecutive year,

220
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:32,333
Perthus was adopted 
unanimously.

221
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,125
-YES! 
-Yes!

222
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,666
-We can't do anything about it, 
it's democracy.

223
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,625
-My mother said to me:

224
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,583
"If you like this Vero that much,

225
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,916
"you have to marry her.

226
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,833
"Because at Lavergne, 
we are clean.

227
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,541
"We get married, and then we go to bed."

228
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,208
The problem is that...

229
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:53,666
she's from Port-Vendres 
, I'm from Collioure ...

230
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:57,083
I tell myself that love 
can erase this difference,

231
00:11:57,291 --> 00:12:00,041
but there are several kilometers. 
At least three.

232
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:03,750
-If you think she's the woman 
of your life, marry her.

233
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,291
-There is no other anyway.

234
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,916
You just have to know 
if we're going well together.

235
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,958
-Are you kidding or what, Gilbert?

236
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:15,791
Already, I will tell you, 
physically, you are on top.

237
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,791
After that, what remains? 
Intellectually?

238
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,291
Intellectually, you are ...

239
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,791
How to tell you, you are ...

240
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,708
You are the same, that's it.

241
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,458
No, I mean,

242
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:33,166
you will get no better 
than this Vero, I think.

243
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:36,916
* - We sheath, we draw. 
We sheath, we draw.

244
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:41,500
Yes, that's good, Vero, like that. 
Very hard on the buttocks. It's coming.

245
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,250
We draw, we sheath.

246
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,166
We draw, we sheath.

247
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,125
We draw, we sheath.

248
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,458
-In any case, 
I put more than 36.

249
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:52,958
-A 36 maybe, 
but who is suffering, Vero, huh?

250
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,083
* -Go girls, let's go down.

251
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,708
Always lower.

252
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:00,916
<i>She sneers. 
</i>-Oh there, it's not a thong,

253
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,916
it is a wire for cutting butter.

254
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,291
It's a fat cutting wire! 
(Laughs)

255
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,625
* -And we believe in it.

256
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,875
We spread our thighs well, Vero.

257
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,875
Yes that's it ! 
-But that's what we dream of.

258
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,125
(To laugh)

259
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:16,708
- It makes me think that Sunday, 
I'm going to make a blank.

260
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:18,958
Are you okay, Solange?

261
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,125
The reflections?

262
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:24,166
When I see you, I tell myself 
that I'm going to do a stew.

263
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,625
Or veal.

264
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:28,333
In sauce. 
And why are you here?

265
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,791
It is 
the town hall dance class .

266
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,458
And you are a baker!

267
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,875
-I have an exemption.

268
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,208
My brother-in-law,

269
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:39,583
who was a municipal employee, 
died on duty.

270
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,500
-Is it working, cirrhosis, 
in a work accident?

271
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:45,666
( Vero laughter .) * -Hush, hush, ladies.

272
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,250
We left. We sheath again.

273
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:49,916
On <span id="divTranslatedText272" contenteditable="true">sheath</span>. On <span id="divTranslatedText272" contenteditable="true">sheath </span>again.

274
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,583
It is English.

275
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,958
(They chuckle.)

276
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,125
I'm fine, Miss Perec,

277
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,000
are you comfortable?

278
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,833
This outfit 
is more for the death of the swan.

279
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,208
-There is the capture of the duck.

280
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,791
(Laughs)

281
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,458
* -Go, we finish

282
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,458
as usual, on 5 pumps.

283
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,041
Let's go.

284
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,500
(Techno music)

285
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:15,958
And one...

286
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,250
-But my breasts are cupping.

287
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:19,750
*-And two...

288
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:25,625
-The couple is a team, 
an osmosis, a complementarity.

289
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:29,750
It's a harmony, that's it. 
The couple is a harmony.

290
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,666
Oh shit, it closed!

291
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,541
Damn, damn, bitch.

292
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,791
What did I tell you? 
-You were in harmony.

293
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,583
-Here, the couple 
is a harmony.

294
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:42,750
Sweetheart !

295
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,250
Sweetheart !

296
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,208
-Yes, it's closed.

297
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,125
-She is angry

298
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:53,291
because she doesn't know 
how to tell me I love you.

299
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:54,583
-Here !

300
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:59,208
- Apparently, she figured out 
how to say I love you.

301
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:02,125
Well see you tomorrow. 
-Yes, hi, Gilbert!

302
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,666
I'm going, 
because the evening is going to be ...

303
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:07,708
It is normal, 
it is necessary, sometimes.

304
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:08,791
Sweetheart ?

305
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,166
Sweetheart ?

306
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,583
It's me, it's Christian.

307
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,125
-Skates.

308
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:22,041
-How do you know 
I don't have skates?

309
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,500
Your back is turned.

310
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:24,958
-based on the Noise.

311
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,250
We respect the soil. 
It's the tiling

312
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:28,666
to Mom.

313
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,791
-It is true that he is pretty,

314
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,750
tiling for mom.

315
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,750
-Do not overdo it.

316
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,708
What do you think this is?

317
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:38,666
-Bah, that,

318
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:39,916
it's suitcases.

319
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:43,500
-Bravo, you're in good shape. 
And what do you deduce from this?

320
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:44,416
-I dunno.

321
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,375
-I leave.

322
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:48,708
And after ?

323
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:52,375
-After "I'm leaving"? Well, you're leaving,

324
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,125
he leaves,

325
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:55,875
we leave, you leave ...

326
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,708
-I'm leaving you.

327
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:04,541
-I leave you, you leave me, 
he leaves us ...

328
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,125
Are you leaving me?

329
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:07,625
Ghislaine, you?

330
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:10,541
But wait, 
think, look at yourself.

331
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:13,166
I mean, 
that's more what it was.

332
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,750
In my opinion, you will find nobody.

333
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,750
Or else, you 
must have cash in common.

334
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:21,000
I don't want to be pessimistic ...

335
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,458
-Salaud, go!

336
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:23,333
-Here.

337
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,625
Women, you want the truth,

338
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:26,791
and afterwards you moan.

339
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:27,708
(Sigh)

340
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,250
-Ah! 
-My crib!

341
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:33,333
My crib! 
-You inflate us, with your crib!

342
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,208
A communist who makes a manger. 
It's ridiculous.

343
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:39,250
With a train! 
In Palestine, moreover!

344
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,791
-The train 
is a tribute to the SNCF.

345
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,750
-You mouth, 
is this a tribute to bullshit?

346
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,708
-Sweetheart ? 
-Do not touch me !

347
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,791
I'm stuck from the back.

348
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,458
-Damn !

349
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,833
Ah, Mayor! 
(Veroic laughter.)

350
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,583
Yes, I will tell them.

351
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,291
Please excuse me,

352
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,000
I just got the mayor 
on the phone,

353
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,708
he is on his way.

354
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:52,833
(Clamours of relief)

355
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,458
-Another one who was taken 
for his skills.

356
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:59,083
-She does 95 F in skills.

357
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:02,250
-And 36 in general culture. 
(Laughs)

358
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,916
-Menard, faster, 
I have to celebrate a marriage.

359
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,208
(Laughs)

360
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:12,166
-Mr. the Mayor, the pourou! 
The pourou!

361
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:13,666
-Oh no ! 
-LE POUROU.

362
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,208
-LE POUROU, LE POUROU.

363
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,458
-So, the pourou,

364
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,333
if you don't know,

365
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,083
you drop it 
directly into your mouth.

366
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:24,791
But as I am

367
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,125
very strong ... 
-Oh yes, you're strong.

368
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,041
-It falls on the head,

369
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,833
runs down the nose 
and then it ends up in the mouth.

370
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,041
Attention,

371
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:34,916
we often have our faces full.

372
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,416
-It reminds me of something! 
-Is that so ?

373
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,416
-Ah yes, full face! Go ahead !

374
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,125
(Hoarse laughs)

375
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:47,958
Looked. 
-Shit !

376
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:49,958
-Well then? 
-I stained it!

377
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,250
-So ?

378
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:56,333
-So what ?

379
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,125
-Do we know more? 
-Sure ?

380
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,791
-The noise that runs.

381
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,375
-Wait, it's confirmed.

382
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:05,625
We are talking about a cart 
of 30 early retirements.

383
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,875
More moral harassment, the total.

384
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,375
But here we are.

385
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,541
-You are too strong. 
-I know.

386
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,166
(Tire screeching)

387
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,833
-He's there ! 
That's it, there it is.

388
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
(Sighs relieved)

389
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,125
(Horns) 
Youhou!

390
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,541
We are here !

391
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:33,125
-Another girl from Port-Vendres 
who leaves for Collioure.

392
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,291
They seek to depopulate us.

393
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,416
Collioure has stretched out his nets.

394
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,750
-So, 
they don't just fish anchovies,

395
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:40,833
in Collioure.

396
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,791
-They also catch tunas.

397
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,833
(Laughs) 
-With red eyes!

398
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,166
-It's bluefin tuna.

399
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,875
-Stop,

400
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,750
she could hear us.

401
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,041
-But I hear everything.

402
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:55,625
Bitch!

403
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:59,000
<i>Someone knocked.</i>

404
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,333
-Ah, Milene! 
-Mr. the mayor.

405
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:08,375
-Ah, but they are there! 
There is a lot of people. Okay okay !

406
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,375
-What is this shirt?

407
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,458
-It's good, it's nothing.

408
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,458
Good evening.

409
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,916
Ah !

410
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,333
Bah, sit down, huh.

411
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,416
So,

412
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:26,000
we're not going to be pissed off 
at the start.

413
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,791
So, under the powers

414
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,708
conferred on me, I ...

415
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:34,666
It is with great joy 
and a certain honor

416
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:38,000
that I'm going to ask you 
the fateful question.

417
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,333
M. Gilbert Lavergne,

418
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:43,375
do you accept to take for wife

419
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:46,708
Miss Véronique Lafarge, 
here present?

420
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,583
-I think.

421
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,000
-Ah no.

422
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,583
No, we don't say: "I think".

423
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:56,708
-I believe ?

424
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:57,750
-No more.

425
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,333
No no.

426
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,416
We say yes!

427
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:02,791
-Yes.

428
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,875
-Here ! To you.

429
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:07,166
Miss Véronique Lafarge,

430
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,833
do you agree to take as a spouse

431
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Mr. Gilbert Lavergne, here present?

432
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,708
-I think I believe it.

433
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,166
-Ah not!

434
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:18,875
-I think I think so.

435
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:20,291
-Non !

436
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,458
Okay, come on, uh, yes.

437
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,125
Huh? Here. 
-Yes.

438
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:26,541
-So, under powers,

439
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:29,583
I declare you husband and wife.

440
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:33,000
So traditionally,

441
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,208
the town hall of Port-Vendres 
has joy ... What?

442
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,416
Huh? Ah shit!

443
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:44,625
-Normally, the city offers you 
a liter of olive oil,

444
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:47,500
but we don't have any more.

445
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:50,625
You will take it next year ... 
for divorce.

446
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,166
(Laughs)

447
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:54,791
- Okay, come on.

448
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:56,333
Uh ... sorry.

449
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,250
I'm exhausted, I'm going to ...

450
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:01,250
Come on. 
-And this shirt?

451
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:03,500
-It's fashionable. It's nothing.

452
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:05,333
Good evening,

453
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,625
rest well, see you later.

454
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:09,250
(The door slams.)

455
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,750
-My brothers, my friends, my children,

456
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:20,375
you are always welcome 
in the house of Christ.

457
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:23,708
Let’s sit down, my brothers.

458
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:27,583
We will now be 
able to sing. Solange?

459
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:32,291

Three, four.

506
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:55,791
The supervisory ministry is formal and 
will have to start skimming.

Skim, Mr. Mayor. 
We're going to degrease the mammoth.

It starts tomorrow.

-Ah, his Titounet. 
-Thanks thanks.

00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,333

Ah, how I put her!

521
00:26:45,625 --> 00:26:48,666
Ah, but are you reading, Michel? 
-It's Philo magazine.

522
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,833
-Philo magazine? 
-Yes, I am subscribed.

(He whistles.)

524
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:55,833
It's because of the Internet. 
I wanted to subscribe

525
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,166
at Fishing Trolling magazine, 
but my finger snapped

526
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:00,583
and I checked Philo.

527
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,125
So, I read it.

528
00:27:02,291 --> 00:27:04,083
-And then, what does that say?

529
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:07,416
-This week is: 
"The ego is a fiction".

530
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:08,541
-But lego,

531
00:27:08,708 --> 00:27:10,916
lego, the game? Because I love it.

532
00:27:13,416 --> 00:27:16,416
-Here is a song 
from my composition, in English,

533
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:18,500
because yes, I write in English.

534
00:27:18,666 --> 00:27:21,208
I write a little 
in all languages.

535
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:24,166
Italy inspired me 
with beautiful melodies,

536
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:26,125
Africa, wild rhythms.

537
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:28,833
Cette chanson s'appelle :
"Oh wast to win".

538
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,583
-Wast to win.

539
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:34,208
<i>-Oh wast to win</i>

540
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:36,791
<i>Oh win wast</i>

541
00:27:37,166 --> 00:27:39,125
<i>And come to be</i>

542
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:40,958
<i>To be away</i>

543
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:44,166
-He ensures, in English, Rémy.

544
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:46,541
-The Rock it's English.

545
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:49,291
It's like the pool. 
It is English.

546
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,583
"On, off".

547
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,458
The pool broom. "On, off".

548
00:27:53,625 --> 00:27:57,416
And "Full" when the basket is full. 
"Full" means full.

549
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:59,541
-I won't be long to be full.

550
00:27:59,708 --> 00:28:02,083
(Laughs) 
-Hop hop, no stories.

551
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,125
I want you in working order.

552
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:08,875
My body is a youth center 
with many workshops.

553
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:10,416
And...

554
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:12,208
they are all open. 
(Growl)

555
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,583
(Laughter) 
-Gilbert!

556
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:16,541
<i>-And come to be</i>

557
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:18,708
<i>To be away</i>

558
00:28:25,541 --> 00:28:27,000
(Applause)

559
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:28,166
Thanks thanks.

560
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:30,166
And now a slow.

561
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,833
I will ask the newlyweds 
to open the ball.

562
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,666
- Come on. 
(Cheers)

563
00:28:39,666 --> 00:28:42,000
(Soft music)

564
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:43,708
I want you.

565
00:28:43,916 --> 00:28:46,625
I want to ... from your body.

566
00:28:47,541 --> 00:28:49,375
-We're going to eat first, huh?

567
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:51,208
-We will eat, my chick.

568
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:53,458
We will eat. We will eat!

569
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:55,541
We'll eat everything, huh?

570
00:28:55,708 --> 00:28:57,000
Huh, chick? 
(He moans.)

571
00:28:58,833 --> 00:29:01,166
Excuse me, with the warmth,

572
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:03,208
I have the deformation that turns.

573
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:07,166
-Ah no, I ... 
It smells good, the deodorant that turns.

574
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:09,000
- Don't force yourself, come on.

575
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:12,833
With the heat, I know, 
I have sweat that smells of urine.

576
00:29:13,958 --> 00:29:17,625
You see, sometimes I tell myself 
that I pissed myself on it,

577
00:29:17,833 --> 00:29:19,166
and in fact not!

578
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:21,666
I just have sweaty hands.

579
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:28,125
- Wait for me, Vero!

580
00:29:29,458 --> 00:29:30,416
(Disgusted sigh)

581
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:37,250
Come on, Vero. 
I will make you dream.

582
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,708
-Bah, Gilbert ?

583
00:29:39,916 --> 00:29:43,166
What is it, Gilbert? 
It doesn't seem to be going.

584
00:29:43,375 --> 00:29:44,666
-She scares me.

585
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:46,458
-What? 
-I don't feel it.

586
00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:50,458
-You make me laugh, 
we had to deal with it before.

587
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:51,791
You said yes.

588
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,916
-At church I was going to say no.

589
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,958
-But why did you say yes?

590
00:29:56,166 --> 00:29:58,875
-I saw, 
they had prepared couscous ...

591
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:01,750
Hats, all that, 
costs money.

592
00:30:01,958 --> 00:30:04,291
-Don't worry, it'll work out.

593
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:09,250
The couple is the habit. 
The couple is an osmosis.

594
00:30:09,458 --> 00:30:10,791
-Are you with Gisou?

595
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,541
-Gisou, right now, she is ... 
(He is snarling.)

596
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,166
a bit like that.

597
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:17,250
<i>"Paquito"

598
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:27,166

603

-Are we going, Gilbert? 
-I will take couscous.

607
00:32:23,791 --> 00:32:26,916
-We're going, I'm telling you. 
It will be royal, couscous.

608
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:29,833
Well served, with meat. 
(Growl)

609
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,041

that you were a little drunk.

612

And as we suspected, 
that you would be drunk,

613
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:23,416
it's me, who brings everyone back.

614
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:25,708
-Go, Michel! 
-Go!

615
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,333

616

-Ah not,

617
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:32,375
it's Kevin who will bring us back.

00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:46,041
there is against, finally ...

Fucking whore whore!

652
00:35:39,958 --> 00:35:40,916
Are you there, Maurice?

653
00:35:41,125 --> 00:35:44,250
-Well, yes, this 
is my parents' hotel.

654
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:45,708
There, I keep it,

655
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:48,791
since they are at ... a wedding!

656
00:35:48,958 --> 00:35:52,416
It's ... what's their name? 
It's Gilbert and Véro

657
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:53,666
who get married.

658
00:35:53,875 --> 00:35:56,166
-Are you stupid or what? 
We were there !

659
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:57,416
-Is that so ?

660
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:01,208
There, the newlyweds will not delay,

661
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:02,791
I'm waiting for them.

662
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:04,416
The bedroom is over there.

663
00:36:04,583 --> 00:36:08,458
You have ... How to say? 
At 12.43 m, there is a staircase.

664
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:11,125
And 8.43 m after, the bedroom.

665
00:36:11,833 --> 00:36:13,416
Number 12 and a half.

666
00:36:13,583 --> 00:36:16,708
-He is boring with his measurements. 
Why 12 and a half?

667
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:20,916
-Because in hotels, 
room 13, it brings bad luck.

668
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:23,666
So my parents, they said to themselves,

669
00:36:23,833 --> 00:36:27,583
so as not to lose a room, 
they will do the 12 and a half

670
00:36:27,791 --> 00:36:30,625
Because my father at first 
said to my mother ...

671
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:34,333
-Go ahead, Guingamp! 
Damn, there's the whole team.

672
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,500
12 and a half?

673
00:36:35,666 --> 00:36:37,666
-12 and a half, 12 and a half.

674
00:36:40,875 --> 00:36:41,916
(Someone knocked.)

675
00:36:43,458 --> 00:36:44,583
-Gilbert ?

676
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,708
-Why are you there? 
-To see if it's okay.

677
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:51,750
-Yes, for the moment, it's okay, 
she's calm.

678
00:36:51,916 --> 00:36:53,041
-She is beautiful !

679
00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:54,541
-She scares me !

680
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,000
-But she's bleeding!

681
00:36:56,166 --> 00:36:57,875
Did you hit it?

682
00:36:58,041 --> 00:37:01,375
-I didn't feel anything. 
It looks like a dead trout.

683
00:37:01,583 --> 00:37:02,750
-Yes because...

684
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:04,250
she has red eyes.

685
00:37:04,416 --> 00:37:06,666
Okay, Gilbert, you gotta go.

686
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:09,583
-Did you see how 
she protrudes from the bed?

687
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:10,916
(Grunts)

688
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:12,958
Oh fuck ! She scares me.

689
00:37:13,166 --> 00:37:14,666
-Gilbert, you said yes.

690
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:15,875
-I said yes...

691
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:17,916
-You said yes. 
-No, I think.

692
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:19,041
-Gilbert !

693
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,250
- Come on, I'm going. 
-Do not go !

694
00:37:21,458 --> 00:37:23,791
-Hey ! You make her dream, huh?

695
00:37:23,958 --> 00:37:27,416
You make him fart point G. 
I'm going. Do not be afraid.

696
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:30,583
-Don't go far, stay behind. 
-I stay here.

697
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,916
If there is a problem, you call me.

698
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:35,583
If it's okay, you sing. 
Do you know any songs?

699
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:39,125
-"Capri is over" ? 
-But to say "It starts".

700
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:41,250
-So, "Capri is starting"?

701
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:43,416
-Okay. I'm behind.

702
00:37:43,625 --> 00:37:45,166
- Don't close! 
-Yes.

703
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:46,625
-Leave a light

704
00:37:46,791 --> 00:37:48,583
in the corridor. I am scared.

705
00:37:48,791 --> 00:37:50,708
(Vero sighs.)

706
00:37:50,875 --> 00:37:52,416
-Oh, Gilbert.

707
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:53,958
Oh, my little Gilbert!

708
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:55,500
My Chick !

709
00:37:55,666 --> 00:37:57,041
Ours !

710
00:37:57,458 --> 00:38:00,000
-Do you prefer that 
we discuss before?

711
00:38:00,166 --> 00:38:01,708
-My ass, yes!

712
00:38:01,875 --> 00:38:04,500
Three years of fallow 
and you want to chat?

713
00:38:04,666 --> 00:38:07,000
Come over here, 
you're gonna get the tractor out

714
00:38:07,166 --> 00:38:08,458
and plow the plot.

715
00:38:08,625 --> 00:38:12,000
-You must plow, Gilbert! 
-Yes, I'm going to stuff it!

716
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:14,375
-I will eat your body.

717
00:38:14,541 --> 00:38:15,666
(He moans.)

718
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,958
-Gilbert, I turn off the light. 
-No !

719
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:25,166
-Yes, thoroughly! 
Come on, put the package.

720
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:27,958
<i>-Capri, it starts!</i>

721
00:38:28,833 --> 00:38:32,250
<i>-And Long live Spain</i>

722
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:34,791
Oh, Ghislaine?

723
00:38:34,958 --> 00:38:36,500
But don't you sleep? 
-Skates.

724
00:38:36,708 --> 00:38:39,458
-Oh, the skates, the skates ... 
(She sighs.)

725
00:38:39,666 --> 00:38:40,625
It's okay ?

726
00:38:40,833 --> 00:38:44,166
-I'm getting the rooster. 
It calms the pain.

727
00:38:44,375 --> 00:38:45,583
So, I love it.

728
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:48,583
-Go ahead, polish! 
After, it will be my turn!

729
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:49,541
(He's laughing.)

730
00:38:51,583 --> 00:38:52,541
-Very funny.

731
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:56,333
-I'm coming back from the hotel, that's it.

732
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,625
Gilbert and Véro, 
he is looking for his G-spot.

733
00:38:58,833 --> 00:39:00,208
-It will take time.

734
00:39:00,375 --> 00:39:01,791
-Why do you say that ?

735
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:04,125
-Because 
you never found mine.

736
00:39:04,291 --> 00:39:06,333
-How did you ever find that?

737
00:39:06,541 --> 00:39:08,125
Didn't you enjoy?

738
00:39:09,708 --> 00:39:11,250
-Titounet?

739
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:14,416
It's mom, my Titounet.

740
00:39:15,541 --> 00:39:16,500
Open up!

741
00:39:16,666 --> 00:39:18,750
-Darling, it struck. 
-It's mom.

742
00:39:18,958 --> 00:39:20,083
(She knocks.)

743
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,375
Titounet?

744
00:39:22,375 --> 00:39:24,291
-You go back to bed!

745
00:39:24,458 --> 00:39:27,291
And you shut up, 
that's how we like you.

746
00:39:27,958 --> 00:39:29,083
Yes ?

747
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,041
All is well, mother-in-law!

748
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:33,125
-Everything is fine ? 
(Relieved sigh)

749
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:34,791
Does it give you pleasure?

750
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:37,833
-Yes, and vice versa. 
Especially for the moment,

751
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,750
but hey ... 
-You find it

752
00:39:39,916 --> 00:39:41,041
good ? 
-Yes.

753
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:42,500
- Size level,

754
00:39:42,666 --> 00:39:43,916
he is normal ? 
-Yes.

755
00:39:44,083 --> 00:39:45,500
-It works ? 
-Yes.

756
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:47,333
-The drawbridge, are you okay?

757
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,750
Say it now.

758
00:39:48,916 --> 00:39:50,791
When you have damaged it,

759
00:39:50,958 --> 00:39:51,958
it will be too late.

760
00:39:52,125 --> 00:39:54,375
Sorry, but I'm going to finish Titounet.

761
00:39:54,541 --> 00:39:56,250
-Is that so ? 
(She shouts.)

762
00:39:57,041 --> 00:40:00,291
Go ahead, Gilbert! 
Give him his race, big thing!

763
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:01,875
<i>Gilbert screams.</i>

764
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,416
-Ghislaine,

765
00:40:04,583 --> 00:40:06,291
if you love me, 
give me a sign.

766
00:40:06,458 --> 00:40:07,583
-And, well!

767
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,125
I'm giving you a sign!

768
00:40:12,583 --> 00:40:14,875
-So you kick me out of my house?

769
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:18,541
-We bought with 
my parents' money , it's my home.

770
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:20,708
-But still ! 
-That's enough !

771
00:40:20,916 --> 00:40:22,250
-the washing machine,

772
00:40:22,416 --> 00:40:25,083
mom paid for it. 
-She does pilling.

773
00:40:25,291 --> 00:40:26,291
-And the garage?

774
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:29,333
Who paid for the wood, the cement, 
the glue?

775
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,583
-It's the town hall! 
-Well, there you go !

776
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,583
If I didn't work at the town hall,

777
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:34,958
we would have paid for it.

778
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:37,750
And the wrought iron gate, 
I did it!

779
00:40:37,916 --> 00:40:38,875
It's my garage.

780
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:42,666
-Thank you. Since that's it, 
go live there, in your garage!

781
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:46,458
-I can take 
part of Lourdes?

782
00:40:46,625 --> 00:40:49,333
-Yes, and don't forget 
the crib that goes with it!

783
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,666
Good night, go to the garage!

784
00:40:57,208 --> 00:41:00,208
-Oh, damn, Christian! 
Christian, you're here!

785
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,541
Oh, Christian, Christian,
Christian, you rae here !

786
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:05,416
-But what is it?

787
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:07,833
-He disappeared ! 
-Who has disappeared ?

788
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,708
-My chick, Titounet!

789
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:11,291
-Titounet disappeared?

790
00:41:11,458 --> 00:41:14,375
-But I tell you! 
We were screaming in the dark ...

791
00:41:14,541 --> 00:41:15,541
you see ? 
-Yes.

792
00:41:15,708 --> 00:41:17,916
-Especially me. 
I was trying to enjoy.

793
00:41:18,083 --> 00:41:19,416
-Yes ! 
-And suddenly,

794
00:41:19,583 --> 00:41:23,833
I dozed off, and nothing! 
When I woke up, he had run away!

795
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,333
-What do you mean ? 
But before, you had ...

796
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,416
-But no !

797
00:41:28,083 --> 00:41:29,125
-I do not believe !

798
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:33,375
A guy who hit the church 
and the paella, he stays to fuck.

799
00:41:33,541 --> 00:41:35,500
After the worst, 
he waits for the best.

800
00:41:36,291 --> 00:41:38,000
Have there been any signs before?

801
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:38,958
-But no.

802
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:40,083
Oh yes !

803
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,416
(Broken glasses)

804
00:41:45,958 --> 00:41:49,083
Yes, you know, he was shaking. 
And he squeaked too.

805
00:41:49,291 --> 00:41:51,875
Like a wet dog 
afraid of the fox.

806
00:41:52,083 --> 00:41:53,625
(Little squeaks)

807
00:41:53,791 --> 00:41:56,625
-You do well the wet dog 
who is afraid.

808
00:41:56,791 --> 00:41:57,750
-And he sang.

809
00:41:57,958 --> 00:42:00,083
<i>Capri is over ! 
</i>-It's normal,

810
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:02,541
I told her to sing, 
it's a code.

811
00:42:03,375 --> 00:42:05,416
Speaking of "It's over",

812
00:42:05,625 --> 00:42:07,833
this is a finished step. 
Are you okay, Michel?

813
00:42:08,041 --> 00:42:10,291
-You have red eyes, 
Vero.

814
00:42:10,458 --> 00:42:11,708
Stops chlorine.

815
00:42:11,875 --> 00:42:13,541
-It's not chlorine!

816
00:42:13,708 --> 00:42:15,833
-It's not chlorine. 
-What's this ?

817
00:42:16,041 --> 00:42:19,375
-Titounet has disappeared. 
He left, he fled.

818
00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:21,916
-Titounet is gone? 
-Yes.

819
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:24,083
-Véro!

820
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:27,083
Don't be afraid, 
we will find you!

821
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:28,708
We will find Titounet!

822
00:42:28,875 --> 00:42:32,166
-The news is not good. 
Ménard and his gang,

823
00:42:32,375 --> 00:42:36,083
they've finished their audit, 
they want to degrease the mammoth.

824
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:37,666
-Degrease the mammoth?

825
00:42:37,875 --> 00:42:40,208
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
Do n't worry, do you know what we're going to do?

826
00:42:40,416 --> 00:42:43,458
I called Paris, 
we're going to organize a movement.

827
00:42:43,666 --> 00:42:46,083
And we will win! 
-And we will win.

828
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:50,625

You said "human son-in-law",

834
00:43:07,125 --> 00:43:08,833
He said "human son-in-law"!

835
00:43:09,041 --> 00:43:10,458
The human race !

836
00:43:10,666 --> 00:43:13,541
-No, it's "son-in-law"!

-Do not hesitate, 
Mr. Mayor.

846
00:43:39,708 --> 00:43:43,375
One clean, precise shot. Paris...

847
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:48,916
Paris supports us. 
We are cutting down on the public service.

848
00:43:49,083 --> 00:43:51,166
Did you see what they did?

849
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:54,666
SNCF, France Telecom ... pfft!

850
00:43:55,125 --> 00:43:58,166
We fire! 
I got a call from the prefecture.

851
00:43:58,583 --> 00:43:59,500
Fire!

852
00:43:59,833 --> 00:44:00,791
Paris...

853
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:03,333
we observe with a magnifying glass.

854
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:05,208
-Never.

855
00:44:06,041 --> 00:44:09,833
-Moreover, it is said 
that your name is circulating in Paris.

856
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,125
Finally, would circulate ...

857
00:44:12,333 --> 00:44:15,000
for a national mission. 
-Is that so ?

858
00:44:15,166 --> 00:44:18,583
-See a national function.

859
00:44:19,833 --> 00:44:20,708
Missiste.

860
00:44:21,166 --> 00:44:22,333
-Menisse?

861
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,541
-Minèstre.

862
00:44:23,708 --> 00:44:25,291
- Minister?

863
00:44:25,458 --> 00:44:26,500
-Minister.

864
00:44:26,666 --> 00:44:30,166
-Minister? 
But we're going to fuck them outside, yes!

865
00:44:30,375 --> 00:44:32,333
How ? Uh, 40?

866
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:36,166
-Thirty. If we start with that, 
we are precursors.

867
00:44:36,333 --> 00:44:40,666
And Paris will thank you. 
Firing people is modern,

868
00:44:40,833 --> 00:44:45,041
You have to put pressure on the employee, make 
him want to leave.

869
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:47,916
Large companies have done this 
successfully.

870
00:44:48,083 --> 00:44:50,583
They rotted the atmosphere, 
result:

871
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:54,166
lots of voluntary departures. 
You have to break them down,

872
00:44:54,375 --> 00:44:57,916
make them psychological rags 
of sub-men,

873
00:44:58,125 --> 00:45:00,000
firmness, Minister.

874
00:45:01,083 --> 00:45:03,000
-Thank you, Mr. Chef de Cabinet!

875
00:45:06,666 --> 00:45:07,833
Yes, Milene?

876
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:09,208
-It's coffee.

877
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:10,958
-Thank you. 
-Mr. The Minister.

878
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:12,208
-Thank you.

879
00:45:16,791 --> 00:45:18,041
She did Sciences Po.

880
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,916
-Yes, 5 years old.

881
00:45:21,416 --> 00:45:23,083
Five times in the 1st year.

882
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:24,750
(Laughs)

883
00:45:24,958 --> 00:45:26,916
- "Your coffee, Mr. Mayor."

884
00:45:27,125 --> 00:45:28,666
-You forget the lips.

885
00:45:28,833 --> 00:45:29,791
-Attends.

886
00:45:30,333 --> 00:45:32,250
-It's for my file.

887
00:45:32,416 --> 00:45:34,625
-The neckline, 
when she leans.

888
00:45:34,791 --> 00:45:35,791
- Must see well.

889
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,708
-Up to the hairs. 
(Laughs)

890
00:45:38,375 --> 00:45:40,666
- Go ahead, call 
me a whore, too.

891
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:41,500
-Of ?

892
00:45:41,666 --> 00:45:42,750
-The stink.

893
00:45:42,916 --> 00:45:44,083
-Why do you say that ?

894
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:46,750
-You will laugh less 
once on the list.

895
00:45:46,916 --> 00:45:49,083
-The list, but which list?

896
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,000
-And my file?

897
00:45:50,375 --> 00:45:51,791
-He is waiting his turn!

898
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:52,958
-I am alone.

899
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:53,791
-THAT'S ENOUGH !

900
00:45:55,333 --> 00:45:57,458
-The list of voluntary departures.

901
00:45:57,625 --> 00:45:59,583
-But from where? 
-Of town hall ?

902
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:00,500
-Of town hall.

903
00:46:00,666 --> 00:46:02,583
- Stop, we're inviting.

904
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:06,666
-They talk about 20 or 30 departures. 
They want to sicken people.

905
00:46:06,833 --> 00:46:09,750
-Wait, Milene, talk, 
we're colleagues!

906
00:46:09,916 --> 00:46:11,916
And we are even friends.

907
00:46:12,083 --> 00:46:15,083
-Is that so ? As I have breasts 
that plic-plic

908
00:46:15,291 --> 00:46:18,833
and the buttocks that plop-ploc, 
I did not quite hear.

909
00:46:21,791 --> 00:46:25,458
(Suspenseful music)

910
00:46:58,291 --> 00:47:01,291
-Do you think he's there? 
-Yes, he loves this corner.

911
00:47:01,458 --> 00:47:03,416
You'll see, he's going to go out.

912
00:47:03,625 --> 00:47:06,416
(He imitates an animal cry.)

913
00:47:09,958 --> 00:47:12,500
(He imitates a crying baby.)

914
00:47:35,625 --> 00:47:38,375
-How, love? Gilbert?

915
00:47:38,958 --> 00:47:42,041
Gilbert, get out of there, 
everyone is worried.

916
00:47:42,208 --> 00:47:43,833
- Get out of there, Gilbert!

917
00:47:44,041 --> 00:47:45,500
I brought couscous.

918
00:47:45,708 --> 00:47:48,416
It's Blackfoot, 
they can't resist it.

919
00:47:48,583 --> 00:47:51,083
-Mmh! Gilbert! 
-Come on, Michel.

920
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:54,291
-It's good, couscous to mom! 
-Come on, Michel.

921
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:57,791
Come, Gilbert! 
Gilbert, get out of there!

922
00:47:59,291 --> 00:48:00,541
-Did you eat his couscous?

923
00:48:00,708 --> 00:48:01,750
-Non.

924
00:48:01,916 --> 00:48:03,291
-Didn't you eat it?

925
00:48:03,458 --> 00:48:04,666
-No why ?

926
00:48:04,833 --> 00:48:06,750
-I dunno. Come on!

927
00:48:06,916 --> 00:48:07,708
Come,

928
00:48:07,875 --> 00:48:08,916
he's going out.

929
00:48:21,875 --> 00:48:23,750
Look at him. Look at him !

930
00:48:23,916 --> 00:48:26,958
Look at him, I told you! 
Look at him.

931
00:48:27,125 --> 00:48:29,833
-It's beautiful. 
It looks like an isard at the stream.

932
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:38,333
Go ahead, my little doe, drink.

933
00:48:42,125 --> 00:48:43,500
-Did you eat couscous?

934
00:48:43,666 --> 00:48:45,333
-Stop, you're painful.

935
00:48:50,625 --> 00:48:51,625
-Look at him.

936
00:48:54,791 --> 00:48:55,958
-She scares me.

937
00:48:56,625 --> 00:49:00,416
-Go, eat your couscous. 
Swallow the seed, swallow.

938
00:49:00,583 --> 00:49:02,041
- Swallow, Titounet.

939
00:49:02,625 --> 00:49:04,166
It's good.

940
00:49:04,333 --> 00:49:07,625
He's a Titounet. 
A Titounet to his dad.

941
00:49:08,083 --> 00:49:09,416
-Usually, mom,

942
00:49:09,583 --> 00:49:11,875
she puts dumplings 
in the couscous.

943
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:14,708
-Well, there, she did not wear one.

944
00:49:15,333 --> 00:49:17,333
-Gilbert, relax.

945
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,166
It's never that a problem

946
00:49:19,333 --> 00:49:21,708
sexual, it gets better, 
it's temporary.

947
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:24,541
-I don't think so. 
A starting couple

948
00:49:24,708 --> 00:49:26,708
to kiss more, 
it fucks more at all.

949
00:49:26,916 --> 00:49:28,750
-No, at one point, it starts again.

950
00:49:28,916 --> 00:49:30,458
-She scares me.

951
00:49:30,666 --> 00:49:34,125
With her big voice, she said, 
"I'm going to eat your body."

952
00:49:34,333 --> 00:49:36,000
We do not say so.

953
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:39,458
-No. 
-No, it does not say, my Titounet.

954
00:49:39,666 --> 00:49:42,541
A part of the body, yes, 
but not the body.

955
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:45,291
-A <span id="divTranslatedText954" contenteditable="true">part</span>, yes. Ah yes, a <span id="divTranslatedText954" contenteditable="true">part</span>!

956
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,916
-Eat, my Titounet.

957
00:49:48,083 --> 00:49:50,000
-A<span id="divTranslatedText954" contenteditable="true">part</span>, yes? 
-Yes.

958
00:49:50,958 --> 00:49:53,000
Calm down, Titounet.

959
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,583
But no, there is nothing.

960
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:59,875
Come on, let's go home, Gilbert.

961
00:50:00,041 --> 00:50:02,666
Come on, let's go back, huh? 
-Okay.

962
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,750
(Soft music)

963
00:50:26,625 --> 00:50:28,375
-People are bastards!

964
00:50:28,583 --> 00:50:30,750
They throw fridges 
anywhere!

965
00:50:30,958 --> 00:50:34,166
-Wait, I'll help you, Michel.

966
00:50:34,375 --> 00:50:35,708
-Go!

967
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:38,833
And Titounet? 
He would not come to help us?

968
00:50:39,041 --> 00:50:40,833
-You saw the night it had,

969
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:41,875
Titounet?

970
00:50:42,083 --> 00:50:44,125
-Yes, Titounet is tired!

971
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:47,208
Huh? Titounet 
is Catherine Deneuve!

972
00:50:47,375 --> 00:50:50,958
-Go, one, two, three ... 
-SUN.

973
00:51:00,583 --> 00:51:03,333
-I like it 
when the job is done.

974
00:51:03,541 --> 00:51:05,250
Thank you, Catherine.

975
00:51:10,041 --> 00:51:13,166
This time again, 
we have preserved the planet well.

976
00:51:13,375 --> 00:51:16,208
- Fortunately, 
there are guys like us.

977
00:51:17,791 --> 00:51:18,916
You see, Gilbert,

978
00:51:19,083 --> 00:51:23,166
the garbage truck has broken down, well 
, we have ideas.

979
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:27,916
-Jean-Mi ?

980
00:51:28,291 --> 00:51:29,375
Jean-Mi ?

981
00:51:31,333 --> 00:51:32,833
<i>Crissements</i>

982
00:51:36,166 --> 00:51:37,125
Jean-Mi ?

983
00:51:39,541 --> 00:51:40,750
Jean-Mi !

984
00:51:41,083 --> 00:51:43,458
-What is happening ? 
-He doesn't look good.

985
00:51:43,625 --> 00:51:47,666
-The tramontana has risen, 
all the leaves are gone.

986
00:51:47,833 --> 00:51:51,458
-It's the relapse, 
he comes to us.

987
00:51:51,625 --> 00:51:53,208
-You say what, Michel?

988
00:51:53,416 --> 00:51:55,458
(Klaxons)
Un burn-out ! Coming out,

989
00:51:55,666 --> 00:51:59,458
is when a homo reveals himself 
to all those who already knew it.

990
00:51:59,625 --> 00:52:00,666
That's it ! 
-Ah yes.

991
00:52:00,875 --> 00:52:03,666
-A burnout, he farted a cable. 
You're not going out

992
00:52:03,833 --> 00:52:07,166
6 months of sick leave like that. 
Not at work.

993
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:09,666
You need 
psychological assistance.

994
00:52:09,875 --> 00:52:11,958
-It would require the shrink of the town hall.

995
00:52:12,125 --> 00:52:15,291
She speaks in his office 
and he snorts.

996
00:52:15,458 --> 00:52:17,791
-How many times 
I said to Ménard:

997
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,875
"Send us 
the town hall psychologist!"

998
00:52:21,041 --> 00:52:22,750
-Wind. It's the wind.

999
00:52:22,916 --> 00:52:24,750
(Horns) 
-Yes, Jean-Mi.

1000
00:52:24,958 --> 00:52:25,833
-In the beginning,

1001
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,875
it advanced 2.43 m, 
then fell 1.43 m.

1002
00:52:29,041 --> 00:52:31,333
-You inflate us with your figures.

1003
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,833
It is painful. 
-He came from the front.

1004
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,875
(Horns and protests) 
The headwind, and there ...

1005
00:52:37,083 --> 00:52:39,375
-Are you moving there? 
(Police sirens)

1006
00:52:43,541 --> 00:52:45,125
-Yes, yes, excuse me!

1007
00:52:45,333 --> 00:52:47,791
(Horns) 
-Oh, that's fine!

1008
00:52:47,958 --> 00:52:49,208
-Jean-Mi relapses.

1009
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:50,875
-We have an emergency too.

1010
00:52:51,041 --> 00:52:54,666
-We are going to Weldom, 
they have planchas at - 28%.

1011
00:52:55,375 --> 00:52:56,750
-Why - 28%?

1012
00:52:57,166 --> 00:52:58,708
-Because we're on the 28th.

1013
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:02,000
- It's stupid that we're not the 35th!

1014
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:06,750
Because there would have been 
more reduction.

1015
00:53:06,958 --> 00:53:09,458
And the 35th of the month, it does not exist.

1016
00:53:11,708 --> 00:53:13,583
If we don't understand the valves ...

1017
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:14,958
It is not serious.

1018
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:15,875
Let's go !

1019
00:53:16,041 --> 00:53:17,083
-Go! 
-Hop!

1020
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:18,208
It goes!

1021
00:53:18,375 --> 00:53:21,583
<i>Sirens
</i> Hop, hop, hop, hop, hop!

1022
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:24,875
(Horns) 
You shine at the bottom, at the bottom!

1023
00:53:25,041 --> 00:53:27,000
It's good, it goes!

1024
00:53:27,166 --> 00:53:29,666
It's good, come on!

1025
00:53:51,333 --> 00:53:52,666
-Mr. the mayor ?

1026
00:53:59,916 --> 00:54:01,041
-I said to myself :

1027
00:54:01,208 --> 00:54:03,916
"This poor woman, 
all alone, who is bored.

1028
00:54:04,083 --> 00:54:06,166
"The mayor can't tolerate this."

1029
00:54:07,375 --> 00:54:09,041
Look, I have two.

1030
00:54:11,125 --> 00:54:12,416
-I love to eat it.

1031
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:14,708
Come in.

1032
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:16,625
-In all honor.

1033
00:54:16,791 --> 00:54:18,000
-Of course.

1034
00:54:26,541 --> 00:54:30,416
-So, Mrs. Véro, what is 
this noise that runs?

1035
00:54:30,583 --> 00:54:33,083
Are there voluntary departures?

1036
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,083
-We're talking about it, yes.

1037
00:54:35,291 --> 00:54:37,750
But we are going to fight, 
the union is there.

1038
00:54:37,916 --> 00:54:39,625
-I hope he's there.

1039
00:54:39,833 --> 00:54:42,750
Since the time he trained, 
the union!

1040
00:54:42,916 --> 00:54:46,666
- Their local paid by the town hall, 
it became a tapas bar.

1041
00:54:46,875 --> 00:54:48,708
And we pay charges.

1042
00:54:48,875 --> 00:54:51,291
-We say that, 
we are in the private sector.

1043
00:54:51,458 --> 00:54:54,625
I only make a living 
if I work, it's different.

1044
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:57,166
When I say win, 
the term is strong,

1045
00:54:57,333 --> 00:54:59,333
this year, we made - 30%. 
-The same.

1046
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:00,291
Minus 30%.

1047
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,458
-For 10 years 
you have been doing - 30% every year.

1048
00:55:03,625 --> 00:55:06,291
Do you continue to work 
for - 300%?

1049
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,583
You like your work, well done!

1050
00:55:10,875 --> 00:55:12,250
-Hello !

1051
00:55:15,875 --> 00:55:17,833
-It's Halloween all year round.

1052
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,625
Do lessons end at 11 am?

1053
00:55:19,791 --> 00:55:22,125
-It's not lessons, 
it's sports.

1054
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,291
-We wonder 
what the teachers are doing.

1055
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:30,750
-They are on vacation 
or they are preparing their vacation.

1056
00:55:30,916 --> 00:55:32,291
(Laughs)

1057
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:36,875
-For you, the private sector, 
are you working?

1058
00:55:37,041 --> 00:55:39,125
Are the officials lazy?

1059
00:55:39,291 --> 00:55:40,416
-I have one.

1060
00:55:40,583 --> 00:55:42,958
This is a teacher who is very sick,

1061
00:55:43,125 --> 00:55:47,041
the doctor said to him: "You only have 
two months to live".

1062
00:55:47,208 --> 00:55:49,291
And the teacher answers:

1063
00:55:49,458 --> 00:55:51,416
"Can I have July and August?"

1064
00:55:52,666 --> 00:55:53,791
-Well I'm leaving.

1065
00:55:53,958 --> 00:55:55,000
-And in fact,

1066
00:55:55,166 --> 00:55:56,083
What do I use you for?

1067
00:55:57,041 --> 00:56:00,750
-What are you serving me? 
You’re useless,

1068
00:56:00,958 --> 00:56:02,083
Solange !

1069
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:06,541
-Marades, the hour is serious.

1070
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:10,208
Yolande, hurry up, 
we have a job.

1071
00:56:10,666 --> 00:56:15,541
I brought down Georges-Paul 
from the national section of the union.

1072
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:18,041
in order to define together 
a strategy

1073
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:21,958
to fight against the oppression 
of the employers who oppress us.

1074
00:56:22,125 --> 00:56:25,291
-I introduce myself, Georges-Paul. 
My parents, already,

1075
00:56:25,458 --> 00:56:27,916
were activists. 
They called me that

1076
00:56:28,083 --> 00:56:32,291
in tribute to Georges Marchais. 
And Paul, for Paul Éluard.

1077
00:56:32,458 --> 00:56:36,208
-Me, they called me Jean-Mi 
in tribute to Jean-Michel Jarre.

1078
00:56:36,958 --> 00:56:38,250
-And me, Jean-Louis.

1079
00:56:38,416 --> 00:56:41,625
In tribute to Jean-Louis David, 
the hairdresser.

1080
00:56:42,333 --> 00:56:45,458
-I'm Gilbert, 
in tribute to Gilbert Bécaud.

1081
00:56:45,666 --> 00:56:48,041
-Me, Michel, 
in tribute to Jacques Brel.

1082
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:49,750
-It does not work.

1083
00:56:49,958 --> 00:56:52,583
-If his parents wanted 
to call him Michel,

1084
00:56:52,791 --> 00:56:55,125
but Michel Brel, 
it ended the same.

1085
00:56:55,291 --> 00:56:57,375
-It's true that it doesn't work

1086
00:56:57,541 --> 00:57:01,291
when it ends the same. 
Céline Dion is not called Marion,

1087
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,125
because Marion Dion,

1088
00:57:03,333 --> 00:57:05,958
it's been boiled, 
we don't understand well.

1089
00:57:06,125 --> 00:57:09,708
-I think the news 
from Paris is disturbing.

1090
00:57:09,916 --> 00:57:10,791
-Very.

1091
00:57:11,375 --> 00:57:15,125
The government has plans 
for dark cuts.

1092
00:57:15,291 --> 00:57:18,750
Especially in the public service. 
To break the official.

1093
00:57:18,916 --> 00:57:22,125
Did you see what they did 
to the SNCF?

1094
00:57:22,291 --> 00:57:25,791
-We are going to organize a fight 
that we hope is historic.

1095
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,416
A struggle that will go down 
in history.

1096
00:57:29,583 --> 00:57:30,416
<i>-It's the fight</i>

1097
00:57:30,583 --> 00:57:31,750
-Not now.

1098
00:57:33,541 --> 00:57:34,458
A struggle

1099
00:57:34,625 --> 00:57:37,625
which will amaze everyone. 
We must be envied.

1100
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,250
The others must say:

1101
00:57:39,458 --> 00:57:42,541
"The municipal authorities of Port-Vendres 
are the strongest."

1102
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:45,708
Make 
the Aude winegrowers dream .

1103
00:57:45,916 --> 00:57:49,583
SNCF will say: "We weren't even hoping 
it could happen."

1104
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:51,500
At Air France,

1105
00:57:51,666 --> 00:57:53,708
who are the best, 
they say to themselves:

1106
00:57:53,916 --> 00:57:56,125
"We 
wouldn't have even imagined it!

1107
00:57:56,291 --> 00:57:58,208
But we are going to do it!

1108
00:57:58,375 --> 00:58:01,083
Everyone will admire us, 
even our women!

1109
00:58:01,291 --> 00:58:04,041
Our women will start to 
admire us!

1110
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:06,583
To say: 
"They are the best!"

1111
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:09,416
They will have surges of desire 
for us.

1112
00:58:09,583 --> 00:58:11,666
Our women will love to 
make love again!

1113
00:58:11,875 --> 00:58:15,916
And we won't have time! 
We will say: "We can't!"

1114
00:58:16,083 --> 00:58:17,750
And then we will go,

1115
00:58:17,916 --> 00:58:20,583
away, with the fight, 
and we'll come back.

1116
00:58:20,791 --> 00:58:22,250
And there we will make love to them.

1117
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:25,708
Yes, we will make love to them, 
we will give them pleasure!

1118
00:58:25,875 --> 00:58:28,666
Gislaine, 
you're going to have fun, Gislaine!

1119
00:58:28,875 --> 00:58:31,000
She will be able to do more!

1120
00:58:31,166 --> 00:58:34,000
Her body will be bloodless ... 
She will be able to do more,

1121
00:58:34,166 --> 00:58:36,583
Ghislaine! 
Hm, excuse me.

1122
00:58:36,791 --> 00:58:41,125
This is an example, it could be 
Françoise, Martine, anyway.

1123
00:58:45,333 --> 00:58:46,208
-Finally...

1124
00:58:46,375 --> 00:58:49,500
we'll see, we don't have 
to sleep, either?

1125
00:58:49,708 --> 00:58:51,208
Finally, we will see, what ...

1126
00:58:51,375 --> 00:58:54,166
-Good, 
I want a historic fight,

1127
00:58:54,375 --> 00:58:57,166
there will be a before 
and after Port-Vendres.

1128
00:58:57,333 --> 00:58:59,375
-After Port-Vendres, it's Banyuls.

1129
00:58:59,875 --> 00:59:00,958
-shush!

1130
00:59:01,166 --> 00:59:03,333
-Wait, 
everyone knows that.

1131
00:59:03,541 --> 00:59:06,208
-It's true, after Port-Vendres, 
it's Banyuls.

1132
00:59:06,375 --> 00:59:09,333
-Are you ready 
for a historic fight?

1133
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,125
-YES. 
-Of course.

1134
00:59:11,291 --> 00:59:14,708
-Someone have something 
to add? It is time.

1135
00:59:14,875 --> 00:59:16,375
-NO.

1136
00:59:16,541 --> 00:59:18,791
-Well. 
I did 12 hours by train ...

1137
00:59:18,958 --> 00:59:20,708
- Shit, strikes,

1138
00:59:20,875 --> 00:59:22,708
by force. 
(To laugh)

1139
00:59:24,458 --> 00:59:28,125
Ah but I said that to mess around! 
It was for...

1140
00:59:30,541 --> 00:59:32,916
-It's for our records. Profile.

1141
00:59:33,875 --> 00:59:35,708
-But it was for fun. 
(Clicks)

1142
00:59:35,875 --> 00:59:37,708
-Me too, it's for fun.

1143
00:59:42,166 --> 00:59:45,833
-Know that there are several 
trends in our section.

1144
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:47,625
-And what about Hamoniste?

1145
00:59:47,791 --> 00:59:49,250
-No, nobody plays it.

1146
00:59:49,416 --> 00:59:50,416
-Gilbert !

1147
00:59:52,625 --> 00:59:54,708
Michel, trendy? 
-I represent

1148
00:59:54,875 --> 00:59:58,875
the left wing, social trend, 
Marxist-Lenin-Melanchonist.

1149
00:59:59,041 --> 01:00:01,291
-No problem. 
-I'm all for it

1150
01:00:01,458 --> 01:00:05,125
a classic class struggle, 
partisan Stalino-Krazuckist.

1151
01:00:05,333 --> 01:00:09,041
In fact, we are syndico-progresso 
Marie-Georges-Buffétistes.

1152
01:00:09,208 --> 01:00:10,916
-Very good. And you are ?

1153
01:00:11,083 --> 01:00:11,875
-New.

1154
01:00:14,875 --> 01:00:15,875
-No, no water,

1155
01:00:16,041 --> 01:00:16,916
thank you.

1156
01:00:22,125 --> 01:00:24,458
(Admiring 
whistles ) -BRAVO.

1157
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:32,708
-Is not national level?

1158
01:00:32,875 --> 01:00:35,375
-But yes, 
but I know, Mr. Morales!

1159
01:00:35,583 --> 01:00:37,833
You've been here eight times.

1160
01:00:38,041 --> 01:00:40,125
Okay, look, look.

1161
01:00:40,333 --> 01:00:43,000
How did you initial? 
-In blue.

1162
01:00:43,166 --> 01:00:44,583
-And you signed?

1163
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:45,833
-Quickly.

1164
01:00:46,041 --> 01:00:47,458
-In black, Mr. Morales.

1165
01:00:47,625 --> 01:00:49,375
You signed in black.

1166
01:00:50,125 --> 01:00:51,125
For the initials

1167
01:00:51,291 --> 01:00:52,750
and the signature,

1168
01:00:52,916 --> 01:00:55,916
you need the same color. 
-I'm going over?

1169
01:00:56,083 --> 01:00:57,333
-Yes, but not here.

1170
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:00,791
You are not going to block my 
customers all morning.

1171
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,833
We already have a colleague who is stopped. 
That's enough !

1172
01:01:04,041 --> 01:01:05,041
-There is nobody.

1173
01:01:05,208 --> 01:01:07,250
-No but it's not possible, that!

1174
01:01:07,458 --> 01:01:09,708
Who is who runs this office?

1175
01:01:09,875 --> 01:01:11,125
Who is it

1176
01:01:11,291 --> 01:01:13,541
Who is it, who knows, here?

1177
01:01:13,708 --> 01:01:15,916
She's the chef. 
As she is stopped,

1178
01:01:16,083 --> 01:01:17,958
the chief is me.

1179
01:01:18,958 --> 01:01:20,916
Where are they, permanently?

1180
01:01:21,125 --> 01:01:22,750
-They are at Ricard.

1181
01:01:22,916 --> 01:01:23,916
-They didn't say anything?

1182
01:01:24,083 --> 01:01:26,041
-Yes. 
Christian wants to fuck his wife.

1183
01:01:26,208 --> 01:01:28,958
-Oh fuck ! 
I see that the strike.

1184
01:01:29,125 --> 01:01:30,083
-A hard strike.

1185
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:31,083
- Very hard.

1186
01:01:31,541 --> 01:01:32,833
And very long.

1187
01:01:33,041 --> 01:01:35,166
-Ghislaine would say to you: "That's enough."

1188
01:01:35,375 --> 01:01:38,291
-Women who do not kiss 
are rascals.

1189
01:01:38,458 --> 01:01:41,000
- They always say: 
"Enough is enough!"

1190
01:01:41,166 --> 01:01:42,208
-"That's enough !"

1191
01:01:42,375 --> 01:01:44,083
-And my file? 
-THAT'S ENOUGH !

1192
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:47,875
-That's what I propose to you, 
the zealous strike.

1193
01:01:48,083 --> 01:01:51,250
I demand a democratic vote 
unanimously.

1194
01:01:54,791 --> 01:01:57,958
-Now that this measure 
has been adopted,

1195
01:01:58,166 --> 01:02:00,166
can we know what it is?

1196
01:02:00,375 --> 01:02:01,958
-Work all the time.

1197
01:02:02,125 --> 01:02:04,458
Work day, night ... 
-HEIN?

1198
01:02:04,625 --> 01:02:07,208
-Engorent work 
by work.

1199
01:02:07,375 --> 01:02:09,750
(Whispers)

1200
01:02:09,916 --> 01:02:14,416
-Georges-Paul, you will understand 
that this measure deserves reflection.

1201
01:02:14,583 --> 01:02:16,041
Can you leave us?

1202
01:02:16,208 --> 01:02:17,625
-OK, I'm going back to Paris.

1203
01:02:17,833 --> 01:02:21,125
I have a Perpignan-Paris 
which goes through Strasbourg-Brest,

1204
01:02:21,333 --> 01:02:22,791
I don't want to miss it.

1205
01:02:22,958 --> 01:02:25,416
I await your position. 
-Michel,

1206
01:02:25,583 --> 01:02:27,541
can you bring him back to the station?

1207
01:02:28,041 --> 01:02:30,083
-I planned, I drank only 5.

1208
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:31,333
-Impeccable.

1209
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:34,500
Uh, what was I going to say? 
All the others,

1210
01:02:34,666 --> 01:02:37,000
meet tonight 
for a conference,

1211
01:02:37,208 --> 01:02:38,333
at the Le France bar.

1212
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:39,583
-Why at the bar?

1213
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:44,041
-If we don't do it at the bar, 
journalists won't come.

1214
01:02:44,208 --> 01:02:46,833
-Ah yes. 
-Think, anyway.

1215
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,708
<i>-</i><i><span id="divTranslatedText1222" contenteditable="true"><i>No more </i></span>fears

1216
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:54,666

1217
01:02:54,833 --> 01:02:57,208
<i>Tomorrow will be another day</i>

1218
01:02:57,416 --> 01:02:59,166
<i>All together</i>

1219
01:02:59,375 --> 01:03:01,916
<i>All together</i>

1220
01:03:02,375 --> 01:03:03,666
Come on, all together!

1221
01:03:03,875 --> 01:03:07,208
<i>No more fears 
and humiliations</i>

1222
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:10,208
<i>No more </i>

1223
01:03:10,833 --> 01:03:14,250
<i>Tomorrow will be another day 
All together</i>

1224
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:17,833
<i>All together</i>

1225
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,916
If someone wants to buy the record, 
we have it.

1226
01:03:21,125 --> 01:03:23,041
-Are you there, France 3? 
-Yes.

1227
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:24,666
-We do the reporting?

1228
01:03:24,833 --> 01:03:26,333
-No, we don't have the equipment.

1229
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:27,666
-What do you mean ?

1230
01:03:27,833 --> 01:03:29,250
- Strike of the guards.

1231
01:03:29,416 --> 01:03:30,875
-Shit ! And you, right?

1232
01:03:31,041 --> 01:03:33,875
-No, we will go on strike 
on Mondays and Thursdays.

1233
01:03:34,083 --> 01:03:37,541
Every two weeks. 
Plus one Tuesday a month.

1234
01:03:37,708 --> 01:03:39,833
-It's complicated to remember.

1235
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,750
-We don't want to hinder the SNCF strike.

1236
01:03:41,916 --> 01:03:43,541
-The railwaymen are holding on?

1237
01:03:43,708 --> 01:03:47,250
-Yes, with the air 
traffic controllers , they make a mess out of it.

1238
01:03:47,416 --> 01:03:50,500
-It's work, 
to fuck a constant mess.

1239
01:03:50,708 --> 01:03:52,625
-Yes, it's work.

1240
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:55,375
-I like debates, like that, 
when it runs.

1241
01:03:55,583 --> 01:03:58,500
-Me too, I fuse. 
I'll eat your body.

1242
01:03:59,875 --> 01:04:02,208
Titounet. 
(He squeaks.)

1243
01:04:02,375 --> 01:04:03,916
(Laughs)

1244
01:04:04,083 --> 01:04:05,833
-Come back soon. 
-Let's not abuse.

1245
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,625
-We can't abuse

1246
01:04:07,791 --> 01:04:09,708
de bonnes choses. Miss Mme?

1247
01:04:09,875 --> 01:04:10,958
Your earring.

1248
01:04:12,875 --> 01:04:14,000
(We knock.) 
Come in!

1249
01:04:23,458 --> 01:04:24,208
Yes, Chouquette?

1250
01:04:24,375 --> 01:04:25,083
-Who is it?

1251
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:26,208
-Who is that ?

1252
01:04:26,375 --> 01:04:27,375
-The syndicate !

1253
01:04:27,541 --> 01:04:28,458
-YES!

1254
01:04:28,625 --> 01:04:29,333
-From Paris...

1255
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:31,500
-BOUH! 
-Wants to impose us

1256
01:04:31,666 --> 01:04:34,250
a new movement, 
the strike of zeal!

1257
01:04:34,458 --> 01:04:37,750
What is 
the zeal strike? Michel!

1258
01:04:37,958 --> 01:04:40,041
Explain to us what it is.

1259
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:41,500
-The strike of zeal,

1260
01:04:41,666 --> 01:04:44,625
is to work day and night, 
to clog everything.

1261
01:04:44,833 --> 01:04:45,958
-I can speak ?

1262
01:04:46,166 --> 01:04:49,541
-Go ahead. 
-I speak or I go in taekwondo.

1263
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:53,125
Do people realize 
what we're getting at?

1264
01:04:53,333 --> 01:04:56,333
We, in our team of 3, 
we have always been 5,

1265
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:58,250
which is normal. 
-YEAH.

1266
01:04:58,458 --> 01:05:00,416
Since September, there are only 4 of us.

1267
01:05:00,583 --> 01:05:03,333
What is the purpose of the government 
and the mayor?

1268
01:05:03,541 --> 01:05:05,625
That we are 3 
for a team of 3?

1269
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:07,833
-And why not a tandem of 2?

1270
01:05:08,041 --> 01:05:10,458
(Clamor) 
-If we go on strike with zeal,

1271
01:05:10,666 --> 01:05:12,583
we will prove that we could be 3.

1272
01:05:12,791 --> 01:05:15,541
And they will put us at 3. 
Is that what we want?

1273
01:05:15,708 --> 01:05:17,750
-NO ! 
-No way !

1274
01:05:17,958 --> 01:05:20,541
-If we work at night, 
they will understand

1275
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:23,875
that we can do it. 
-Thank you ! I propose a vote.

1276
01:05:24,041 --> 01:05:27,000
Who is for this zealous strike

1277
01:05:27,166 --> 01:05:28,625
imposed by Paris?

1278
01:05:28,833 --> 01:05:33,416
This tunnel which will lead nowhere 
and will set a bad example.

1279
01:05:33,583 --> 01:05:36,458
Raise the glass if you are in favor.

1280
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:37,833
Nobody ?

1281
01:05:38,666 --> 01:05:41,250
Anyone else 
to add?

1282
01:05:41,416 --> 01:05:42,958
(Cuckoo clock)

1283
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:46,416
Fuck you!

1284
01:05:47,125 --> 01:05:49,166
(Glass breakage)

1285
01:05:57,041 --> 01:05:58,458
-I will do it to you,

1286
01:05:58,625 --> 01:05:59,708
the zeal strike.

1287
01:05:59,875 --> 01:06:00,958
Tirelessly.

1288
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:04,250
I'm going to disrupt 
the biorhythm.

1289
01:06:04,458 --> 01:06:07,875
-We said we wouldn't do it. 
We voted against.

1290
01:06:08,041 --> 01:06:09,625
-I will eat your body.

1291
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:11,000
-Damned, Véro!

1292
01:06:11,166 --> 01:06:12,708
Have you eaten a dog?

1293
01:06:12,875 --> 01:06:14,250
-I will eat you !

1294
01:06:14,416 --> 01:06:15,500
-Attends !

1295
01:06:15,666 --> 01:06:17,916
Buddies say 
we can't

1296
01:06:18,083 --> 01:06:19,000
eat the body.

1297
01:06:19,166 --> 01:06:21,000
A bit, yes, but not everything.

1298
01:06:21,166 --> 01:06:22,666
(Grunts)

1299
01:06:23,958 --> 01:06:26,333
(He squeaks.)

1300
01:06:33,041 --> 01:06:36,166
-You arrive right 
at the aperitif time! Are you settled?

1301
01:06:36,375 --> 01:06:37,958
-And I don't have a watch.

1302
01:06:38,125 --> 01:06:39,916
-That's the beasts.

1303
01:06:40,083 --> 01:06:43,750
Rhinos always drink 
at the same time, as we do.

1304
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:46,250
It's okay ? Is your wife rolling?

1305
01:06:46,458 --> 01:06:48,500
-By the way, thanks for the doctor.

1306
01:06:48,708 --> 01:06:51,125
-It's a friend, I asked him.

1307
01:06:51,291 --> 01:06:53,875
-I have a certificate: 
"Penile irritation".

1308
01:06:54,541 --> 01:06:55,833
Eight days of rest.

1309
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,500
I feel 
like I left for a month.

1310
01:06:58,666 --> 01:07:02,375
-When you don't fuck, 
it always seems longer.

1311
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:05,208
Is she still asking?

1312
01:07:05,375 --> 01:07:07,208
-What she likes that!

1313
01:07:07,375 --> 01:07:09,333
-She likes it, we can't help it!

1314
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,041
But take it

1315
01:07:11,208 --> 01:07:14,416
not too many, ... 
-No, he told me 5 a day.

1316
01:07:14,583 --> 01:07:16,041
-Yes, but 5 granules.

1317
01:07:16,208 --> 01:07:19,291
-If in doubt, I put 5 tubes. 
You never know.

1318
01:07:19,458 --> 01:07:24,416
What kills me the most 
is his imagination, you know?

1319
01:07:24,583 --> 01:07:27,666
She constantly invented 
new positions.

1320
01:07:27,833 --> 01:07:29,791
-It's not true ? Tell me!

1321
01:07:29,958 --> 01:07:31,791
- One evening, I was watching TV,

1322
01:07:31,958 --> 01:07:36,708
she arrives, she puts on me ... 
but not in a good way.

1323
01:07:38,041 --> 01:07:38,875
Head to ass.

1324
01:07:39,041 --> 01:07:39,833
-Head to ass?

1325
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,375
No kidding ? 
-I heard about it,

1326
01:07:42,541 --> 01:07:44,166
but doing it is different.

1327
01:07:44,333 --> 01:07:48,750
You're used to seeing the same head, 
and suddenly, you're facing Chabal ...

1328
01:07:48,958 --> 01:07:52,916
-Me, if there is Chabal in the fray, 
I do not put the head there!

1329
01:07:53,125 --> 01:07:55,250
-We're stupid. 
-I know well !

1330
01:07:55,416 --> 01:07:59,166
But we are stupid because we drink 
or we drink because we are stupid?

1331
01:07:59,833 --> 01:08:01,958
Can I use one? 
- I don't mind.

1332
01:08:02,125 --> 01:08:06,583
-But Chabal with long hair 
or when he had cut his beard?

1333
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:09,750
- Are you farting your bottle? 
- "Fart." Yes,

1334
01:08:09,958 --> 01:08:11,458
if there is one left.

1335
01:08:11,666 --> 01:08:13,916
Ah! He was there,

1336
01:08:15,125 --> 01:08:16,541
one remains.

1337
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:18,125
-Saved!

1338
01:08:18,291 --> 01:08:20,458
Cheers. 
- Yours, Gilbert.

1339
01:08:20,625 --> 01:08:21,708
(Recoil beeps) 
Ah!

1340
01:08:21,875 --> 01:08:23,666
This is Michel!

1341
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:27,291
-Are you, with your wife, 
sexually okay?

1342
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:29,875
-As soon as she asks, 
I'm there.

1343
01:08:30,041 --> 01:08:31,291
-And she asks?

1344
01:08:31,458 --> 01:08:32,458
-Never.

1345
01:08:32,666 --> 01:08:33,500
More

1346
01:08:33,666 --> 01:08:34,500
I am present.

1347
01:08:34,666 --> 01:08:35,916
-It's essential.

1348
01:08:36,083 --> 01:08:38,458
- Must be present. 
- Must be diligent.

1349
01:08:38,625 --> 01:08:40,791
-Go, Michel, how are you?

1350
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,541
-Hello, Michel.

1351
01:08:45,375 --> 01:08:46,416
Houla !

1352
01:08:46,583 --> 01:08:48,250
There was an emergency.

1353
01:08:51,083 --> 01:08:54,541
-Oh fuck ! 
I was on the reserve.

1354
01:08:56,791 --> 01:08:57,916
I'm not getting used to it.

1355
01:08:59,208 --> 01:09:00,833
They’re going to kick the world,

1356
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,833
30 voluntary departures, 
and we do nothing.

1357
01:09:04,041 --> 01:09:07,458
-Finally, we do nothing, 
we think, already.

1358
01:09:07,916 --> 01:09:10,958
-You Gilbert, you don't know, 
you're too young,

1359
01:09:11,125 --> 01:09:12,750
but the social movement of 2007!

1360
01:09:12,916 --> 01:09:14,333
They wanted to delete

1361
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:16,041
the coffee machine. Huh?

1362
01:09:16,208 --> 01:09:20,250
-We fought. We 
went on a general strike. Hunger-strike.

1363
01:09:20,416 --> 01:09:21,583
-No thirst?

1364
01:09:24,333 --> 01:09:25,500
-We were not far.

1365
01:09:25,666 --> 01:09:26,833
-Yeah.

1366
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:27,833
-And there,

1367
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,708
for 30 people, we do nothing.

1368
01:09:31,375 --> 01:09:33,625
I can't even say.

1369
01:09:33,833 --> 01:09:35,125
I was on the grave

1370
01:09:35,291 --> 01:09:36,250
from Françoise,

1371
01:09:36,416 --> 01:09:38,791
I didn't even dare talk to her about it.

1372
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:42,583
-Here.

1373
01:09:42,791 --> 01:09:44,333
-Well I'm leaving.

1374
01:09:44,541 --> 01:09:48,291
It's the last one, above 5, 
I see lights.

1375
01:09:48,458 --> 01:09:50,416
I drive, 
I'm not dangerous,

1376
01:09:50,583 --> 01:09:51,458
but ... 
-No.

1377
01:09:55,458 --> 01:09:56,958
I see lights.

1378
01:09:57,125 --> 01:09:58,208
Come on!

1379
01:10:00,416 --> 01:10:01,666
And smoke.

1380
01:10:05,083 --> 01:10:06,916
-She is dead, his wife?

1381
01:10:07,083 --> 01:10:09,000
-No, she left.

1382
01:10:09,166 --> 01:10:10,208
-Is that so ?

1383
01:10:10,375 --> 01:10:12,916
-Parisians always carry 
a souvenir.

1384
01:10:13,083 --> 01:10:17,666
They bring wine, olives ... 
and there is one, he brought his wife back.

1385
01:10:17,833 --> 01:10:19,666
He was unhappy, Michel,

1386
01:10:19,833 --> 01:10:23,708
he cried and he had this idea 
of inventing that she was dead.

1387
01:10:23,875 --> 01:10:27,500
Because a woman who left, 
you know why you're crying,

1388
01:10:27,708 --> 01:10:31,000
but a woman who died, 
you know where you cry.

1389
01:10:33,041 --> 01:10:34,416
-Don't you give one?

1390
01:10:34,916 --> 01:10:35,791
-And.

1391
01:10:35,958 --> 01:10:39,458
You know that we can say 
that we supported viticulture.

1392
01:10:39,625 --> 01:10:41,666
-Will you have some olives?

1393
01:10:41,833 --> 01:10:43,541
-I don't want to, it just ...

1394
01:10:43,708 --> 01:10:44,875
-Yes, it does.

1395
01:10:45,041 --> 01:10:48,125
- Wine does nothing to me, 
but the olive makes me sick.

1396
01:10:59,791 --> 01:11:02,166
<i>We have already seen</i>

1397
01:11:02,375 --> 01:11:05,958
<i>Rekindle the fire 
of an ancient volcano</i>

1398
01:11:06,166 --> 01:11:09,583
<i>We thought we were too old
</i> -Is it over?

1399
01:11:09,791 --> 01:11:11,750
<i>-Do not leave me</i>

1400
01:11:11,958 --> 01:11:15,458
<i>Don't leave 
me Don't leave me</i>

1401
01:11:15,666 --> 01:11:17,791
- I'm not leaving you, 
I'm going!

1402
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,625
<i>-I would offer you</i>

1403
01:11:19,791 --> 01:11:24,791
<i>Pearls of rain 
from a country where it does not rain</i>

1404
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,750
-As much to offer me a Twingo!

1405
01:11:26,958 --> 01:11:29,625
Rain pearls, 
it's not practical!

1406
01:11:32,708 --> 01:11:34,166
You do not say anything anymore ?

1407
01:11:34,375 --> 01:11:35,375
<i>-Capri</i>

1408
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:36,541
<i>It's finish !</i>

1409
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:39,833
<i>And to say that it was the city 
Of my first love</i>

1410
01:11:41,333 --> 01:11:42,541
-Minable.

1411
01:11:42,750 --> 01:11:44,166
-Shit, shit, shit!

1412
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:48,625
Do you know what I'm going to do? 
I'm going to blow up your Lake Geneva!

1413
01:11:49,291 --> 01:11:51,000
- Don't touch Lake Geneva!

1414
01:11:51,166 --> 01:11:53,041
It's a thousand hours of work.

1415
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:54,125
Without the pike.

1416
01:11:54,291 --> 01:11:56,166
-It's a dolphin!

1417
01:11:56,333 --> 01:11:58,166
-My pike, a dolphin?

1418
01:11:58,333 --> 01:12:02,000
-Of course, it's Skippy, 
everyone recognized it!

1419
01:12:02,166 --> 01:12:03,291
-Skippy is a kangaroo.

1420
01:12:03,458 --> 01:12:06,125
-You're always right, that's 
the problem.

1421
01:12:06,291 --> 01:12:08,166
-Skippy is a kangaroo!

1422
01:12:08,333 --> 01:12:12,125
-But I do not touch it, 
your lake Geneva shit!

1423
01:12:12,916 --> 01:12:15,125
Damn, it's not true!

1424
01:12:25,791 --> 01:12:26,791
Gilbert,

1425
01:12:26,958 --> 01:12:29,125
from Christian, will you receive me?

1426
01:12:29,291 --> 01:12:32,625
( Crackling ) * - Yes, I receive you,

1427
01:12:32,791 --> 01:12:36,708
but not 5 of 5, I put you 4, 
because of the crackling.

1428
01:12:36,875 --> 01:12:37,791
-Shut up !

1429
01:12:37,958 --> 01:12:39,333
-It's good, there are more.

1430
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:43,708
-All, we will give the top 
for the start of the sweeper

1431
01:12:43,875 --> 01:12:45,666
ecological electric.

1432
01:12:47,208 --> 01:12:48,375
Attention...

1433
01:12:48,541 --> 01:12:50,625
* Top, electric sweeper.

1434
01:12:52,375 --> 01:12:53,583
-Go!

1435
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:57,291
-Top electricity, it works. 
Let's go !

1436
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,875
* -And let's go for the 
ecological electric sweeper .

1437
01:13:06,083 --> 01:13:08,750
<i>Suspenseful music</i>

1438
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:21,666
Whore ! 
(Smash)

1439
01:13:26,166 --> 01:13:29,916
The purpose of this anonymous meeting 
is ...

1440
01:13:30,125 --> 01:13:34,750
stop the action of the town hall, 
which seeks to fire 30 people.

1441
01:13:34,916 --> 01:13:36,458
-IT'S DISGUSTING.

1442
01:13:36,666 --> 01:13:39,708
-So, you noticed, 
we have hoods.

1443
01:13:39,875 --> 01:13:41,791
Why do we have hoods?

1444
01:13:43,791 --> 01:13:46,833
To stay at ... 
-Why?

1445
01:13:47,958 --> 01:13:49,041
-To stay at ...

1446
01:13:49,208 --> 01:13:50,000
-West ?

1447
01:13:50,208 --> 01:13:51,916
-Fashionable ? 
-Inside ?

1448
01:13:52,125 --> 01:13:53,125
-To the left ?

1449
01:13:53,291 --> 01:13:54,583
-To remain anonymous!

1450
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:55,875
(Disappointed sighs)

1451
01:13:56,083 --> 01:13:58,291
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
-I knew it, I didn't dare say it.

1452
01:13:58,458 --> 01:14:01,708
-Good, I'm making the call. Gilbert? 
-Present.

1453
01:14:01,916 --> 01:14:02,791
-Michel? 
-Yes.

1454
01:14:02,958 --> 01:14:04,333
-Yolande? 
-Yes.

1455
01:14:04,541 --> 01:14:05,750
-Jean Louis ? 
-Yes !

1456
01:14:05,958 --> 01:14:06,958
-Bruno? 
-Yes.

1457
01:14:07,125 --> 01:14:08,291
-Jean-Patrice? 
-Yes.

1458
01:14:08,458 --> 01:14:09,208
-Hey!

1459
01:14:09,375 --> 01:14:11,583
- Sorry, Vero, I forgot you.

1460
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:14,125
-It would require holes 
for the mouth.

1461
01:14:14,333 --> 01:14:15,291
-On I thought.

1462
01:14:15,458 --> 01:14:17,833
There are straws. 
Gilbert, pass on,

1463
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,375
you only take one 
per person, we pay them!

1464
01:14:21,541 --> 01:14:25,166
What is the mayor's weak point? 
Everyone knows it,

1465
01:14:25,333 --> 01:14:26,541
it's sex.

1466
01:14:26,708 --> 01:14:28,958
-Of course, it's clear. 
-YES.

1467
01:14:31,083 --> 01:14:32,833
(Someone knocked.)

1468
01:14:35,083 --> 01:14:37,416
(Steps approach.)

1469
01:14:37,791 --> 01:14:39,458
-Uh, Mr. Mayor?

1470
01:14:41,375 --> 01:14:42,208
Mayor?

1471
01:14:42,416 --> 01:14:45,083
- One second, 
I'm on a file.

1472
01:14:46,916 --> 01:14:50,958
"Train Man" in eight letters 
and it starts with an S.

1473
01:14:52,291 --> 01:14:53,708
-Centurion.

1474
01:14:54,375 --> 01:14:55,500
-With an S?

1475
01:14:55,708 --> 01:14:58,250
-Oh no. Yes, uh ... - 
It's a senator!

1476
01:14:58,416 --> 01:15:01,208
Here ! A train of senators.

1477
01:15:01,375 --> 01:15:05,416
-Justly, I come to speak 
to you about the audit of the Court of Auditors.

1478
01:15:05,583 --> 01:15:07,208
-Yes, good, so what?

1479
01:15:07,375 --> 01:15:10,541
-It would concern the management 
of your personal property

1480
01:15:10,708 --> 01:15:11,791
and the use

1481
01:15:11,958 --> 01:15:12,958
that you would

1482
01:15:13,125 --> 01:15:16,375
certain benefits, 
which you would exaggerate.

1483
01:15:17,041 --> 01:15:18,833
-It's a joke ?

1484
01:15:20,166 --> 01:15:23,583
I left my office as a notary 
to be exemplary!

1485
01:15:23,791 --> 01:15:26,000
Because it's true, 
I recognize it,

1486
01:15:26,208 --> 01:15:28,958
when I was a notary, 
I screwed, of the world.

1487
01:15:29,125 --> 01:15:30,208
(Laughs)

1488
01:15:30,375 --> 01:15:33,625
I stuffed myself! 
But beware, legally.

1489
01:15:33,791 --> 01:15:34,583
-Of course.

1490
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:38,666
-Hey ! I was a scoundrel ...

1491
01:15:38,875 --> 01:15:42,541
What a bandit! 
<i>No limit</i> ! But the,

1492
01:15:42,708 --> 01:15:44,208
since I became mayor,

1493
01:15:44,375 --> 01:15:46,125
I never abused my position.

1494
01:15:46,291 --> 01:15:49,625
-I know, but having said that, 
they send an inspector.

1495
01:15:49,791 --> 01:15:51,083
She comes to check

1496
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:53,166
your use of the town hall

1497
01:15:53,333 --> 01:15:57,208
for your personal home. 
-Good, well, that's fine, I risk nothing.

1498
01:15:59,666 --> 01:16:00,833
Huh, Ménard?

1499
01:16:01,375 --> 01:16:03,500
-Ah, "Precarious situation"

1500
01:16:03,666 --> 01:16:04,791
starting with a G,

1501
01:16:04,958 --> 01:16:07,000
8 letters: "Garde à vue (custody)"!

1502
01:16:08,083 --> 01:16:09,125
- Are you having fun?

1503
01:16:09,291 --> 01:16:10,083
-Yes ! No.

1504
01:16:12,041 --> 01:16:13,000
Is ...

1505
01:16:14,333 --> 01:16:16,208
-Ah, well, yes, that's it.

1506
01:16:16,791 --> 01:16:17,625
Yes.

1507
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:18,833
(Someone knocked.)

1508
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:21,916
-We are waiting for someone? 
Go see, Vero!

1509
01:16:23,916 --> 01:16:25,166
-Véro, it's a song!

1510
01:16:25,333 --> 01:16:27,041
-Ah there is a song.

1511
01:16:27,208 --> 01:16:28,708
-A beautiful piece!

1512
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:30,166
-Oh, eh !

1513
01:16:30,583 --> 01:16:33,916
-It's Milene! 
She has revelations for us.

1514
01:16:34,083 --> 01:16:35,000
- Let her come in.

1515
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:39,625
We're listening to you, Milene. 
-Good morning, Christian.

1516
01:16:39,791 --> 01:16:40,875
-Hello.

1517
01:16:41,041 --> 01:16:43,833
-The mayor is a junk. 
-OH THAT !

1518
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,375
-It's not new!

1519
01:16:45,541 --> 01:16:48,833
-We know it. 
-And here is my revelation.

1520
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,250
The mayor has concerns. 
It comes from Paris.

1521
01:16:52,416 --> 01:16:54,541
-When it comes from Paris, 
there is trouble.

1522
01:16:54,708 --> 01:16:57,166
-It's good. 
It comes from a review to you?

1523
01:16:57,333 --> 01:16:59,833
-No, it's from me! 
(Admiring whistles)

1524
01:17:00,041 --> 01:17:01,083
- congrats!

1525
01:17:02,875 --> 01:17:03,875
-You-go, Milène.

1526
01:17:04,041 --> 01:17:07,041
-It is suspected 
of having diverted personnel

1527
01:17:07,208 --> 01:17:11,250
and materials from the town hall 
for the construction of his house.

1528
01:17:11,416 --> 01:17:13,000
-So what ? We all do it.

1529
01:17:13,166 --> 01:17:16,291
-Yes, but we are salaried, 
it's like a bonus.

1530
01:17:16,458 --> 01:17:17,250
-Ah !

1531
01:17:17,416 --> 01:17:18,416
(He chokes.)

1532
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:21,750
-Thank you, Michel.

1533
01:17:21,916 --> 01:17:24,958
-You are in a 
reintegration internship in the suburbs.

1534
01:17:25,166 --> 01:17:28,666
You are the new municipal officials, 
we are counting on you.

1535
01:17:28,875 --> 01:17:29,916
Finis, flights,

1536
01:17:30,083 --> 01:17:33,541
no more robberies, 
a new life begins.

1537
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:37,750
For that, we have tools. 
So there, for example, do you have one?

1538
01:17:38,125 --> 01:17:39,875
-A brush ? 
-Very good !

1539
01:17:40,083 --> 01:17:41,583
And that what is it ?

1540
01:17:41,791 --> 01:17:43,375
-A rake ? 
-Well done !

1541
01:17:43,583 --> 01:17:47,416
And right behind there, do we have one? 
More difficult, that.

1542
01:17:47,625 --> 01:17:50,666
Have you never seen one? 
Okay, it's a wheelbarrow.

1543
01:17:50,875 --> 01:17:53,416
You can't 
know everything on the 1st day.

1544
01:17:53,625 --> 01:17:56,750
So let's get started, 
I'll come back to see you later,

1545
01:17:56,958 --> 01:17:59,416
We are motivated, we believe in it! 
Okay ?

1546
01:17:59,625 --> 01:18:03,666
Go to work, I'll be back. 
Be wise. Come on, kids.

1547
01:18:03,833 --> 01:18:06,375
-Go, go ahead, Jean-Mi, go ahead!

1548
01:18:06,583 --> 01:18:08,458
-Excuse me please.

1549
01:18:08,666 --> 01:18:12,583
I'm the town hall psychologist, 
so let me do it.

1550
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:16,250
-In any case, the 1st time, 
it was 6.43 m.

1551
01:18:16,416 --> 01:18:20,583
-Jean-Michel, you are very strong, 
there is no headwind,

1552
01:18:20,791 --> 01:18:24,041
you control the machine, 
you are stronger than it.

1553
01:18:24,250 --> 01:18:27,541
-Wait, 
from the tree over there, there are 2.43 m.

1554
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:29,625
-Why does he always say 43?

1555
01:18:29,833 --> 01:18:32,750
-It's his size. 
And it measures with the feet.

1556
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:35,916
He took a balloon in the head 
2 years ago, since,

1557
01:18:36,125 --> 01:18:38,375
it counts and it ends up with 43!

1558
01:18:38,583 --> 01:18:41,291
-I will pass you 
in handicap committee.

1559
01:18:41,458 --> 01:18:43,666
He too 
can have the competition.

1560
01:18:43,833 --> 01:18:46,750
-Ah, he will get 
to start the snowblower.

1561
01:18:46,916 --> 01:18:47,875
-Look at them !

1562
01:18:48,041 --> 01:18:50,208
-Go ahead, Jean-Mi, you can do it!

1563
01:18:50,416 --> 01:18:54,291
Yes, Jean-Mi, 
Yes Jean-Mi, it's coming! It's coming !

1564
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:55,708
It's coming, I'm coming!

1565
01:18:55,916 --> 01:18:59,708
No, sorry, excuse me, it's ... 
it's coming, it's coming ...

1566
01:18:59,916 --> 01:19:00,916
It's coming.

1567
01:19:04,333 --> 01:19:07,750
-We are at 142,000 euros 
in materials, Mr. Mayor.

1568
01:19:07,958 --> 01:19:08,833
-How ?

1569
01:19:09,708 --> 01:19:12,000
-142,000 euros. 
-You can avoid

1570
01:19:12,166 --> 01:19:13,250
to speak while chewing?

1571
01:19:13,416 --> 01:19:14,708
-Of course.

1572
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:16,750
-Sure, we have no right?

1573
01:19:16,916 --> 01:19:18,041
-The town hall,

1574
01:19:18,208 --> 01:19:19,333
it's not you.

1575
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:23,125
-It's still great, 
as a concept.

1576
01:19:23,333 --> 01:19:24,708
We would be mayor,

1577
01:19:24,875 --> 01:19:26,916
we would break our ass 
for these rednecks

1578
01:19:27,083 --> 01:19:29,666
and we would have no advantage? 
-Not these.

1579
01:19:29,833 --> 01:19:32,416
-What remains, 
as an advantage, then?

1580
01:19:32,583 --> 01:19:33,666
Kiss gourds?

1581
01:19:33,875 --> 01:19:34,833
-Wine.

1582
01:19:36,250 --> 01:19:37,625
-Ah, Milene!

1583
01:19:38,375 --> 01:19:41,166
Were you there? 
-No, I just arrived.

1584
01:19:41,333 --> 01:19:43,666
-Ah! Well, we were talking about you.

1585
01:19:43,833 --> 01:19:46,125
-Yes, we said good! 
-Is that so ?

1586
01:19:46,291 --> 01:19:49,666
Mr. Mayor, the controller, 
you will receive it ...

1587
01:19:49,833 --> 01:19:52,541
-By side, my little one, 
in the small office.

1588
01:19:52,708 --> 01:19:54,291
And must rot me,

1589
01:19:54,458 --> 01:19:57,541
that it is sad, overloaded, 
that it is pitiful.

1590
01:19:57,708 --> 01:20:00,208
-OK, 
I'm going to go and have a drink.

1591
01:20:00,375 --> 01:20:02,083
-Okay. Thank you, Milène.

1592
01:20:03,541 --> 01:20:05,166
I'll put a hit too.

1593
01:20:05,833 --> 01:20:08,333
-A little bit, Mayor?

1594
01:20:09,250 --> 01:20:10,625
-The commissars, there.

1595
01:20:11,250 --> 01:20:12,125
-Pardon.

1596
01:20:17,625 --> 01:20:19,833
(We strike.) 
-Mr. THE MAYOR ?

1597
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:20,791
-Yes ?

1598
01:20:20,958 --> 01:20:21,875
-Miss Leblanc.

1599
01:20:22,083 --> 01:20:24,541
-Not Leblanc, Legrand! 
Come on, get out of here.

1600
01:20:27,125 --> 01:20:29,625
Hello, man! 
We are going to play.

1601
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:31,916
We're going to have a little game.

1602
01:20:32,083 --> 01:20:34,125
(Laughter) 
I'm showing it to you.

1603
01:20:35,291 --> 01:20:36,250
(She sighs.)

1604
01:20:36,416 --> 01:20:39,333
So wait, ... 
There is a mess in this bag!

1605
01:20:39,541 --> 01:20:43,250
Ah yes, these are the photos 
of the mayor's house.

1606
01:20:43,416 --> 01:20:46,916
Lots of fees. Superb house 
on the heights of Port-Vendres.

1607
01:20:47,083 --> 01:20:48,916
He smashed a mountain.

1608
01:20:49,125 --> 01:20:52,125
Luxury materials: 
marble, stainless steel ...

1609
01:20:52,291 --> 01:20:53,625
Look. Magnificent.

1610
01:20:53,791 --> 01:20:55,333
Huge works!

1611
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:57,666
Everything was blocked in Port-Vendres.

1612
01:20:57,833 --> 01:20:59,958
It can inspire you, 
if you do

1613
01:21:00,125 --> 01:21:00,916
Works.

1614
01:21:01,083 --> 01:21:03,500
Ah! And these are friends of his,

1615
01:21:03,666 --> 01:21:05,000
charming girls.

1616
01:21:05,166 --> 01:21:06,750
You will watch this too.

1617
01:21:08,875 --> 01:21:10,208
Here it is ! The !

1618
01:21:10,375 --> 01:21:12,500
Ah, very important!

1619
01:21:13,375 --> 01:21:15,541
The pencil ! So the pencil ...

1620
01:21:15,708 --> 01:21:16,833
(She sneers.)

1621
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,291
A control without a pencil 
is not a control.

1622
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:21,458
-Ah.

1623
01:21:21,625 --> 01:21:25,750
-You saw, Miss Perec, 
I did not tremble.

1624
01:21:25,958 --> 01:21:28,833
-I saw, Jean-Mi. I saw.

1625
01:21:29,208 --> 01:21:32,166
You turned on the snowblower. 
-Here.

1626
01:21:32,583 --> 01:21:35,791
I approached the sheet, 
I blew it,

1627
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,041
I did not shake.

1628
01:21:37,250 --> 01:21:40,166
-Jean-Mi, 
you have overcome the trauma.

1629
01:21:40,375 --> 01:21:42,541
It's a great moment, 
even for me.

1630
01:21:42,750 --> 01:21:44,000
We're not used to it,

1631
01:21:44,208 --> 01:21:47,083
we psychologists, 
to have results.

1632
01:21:47,291 --> 01:21:48,416
I am touched.

1633
01:21:49,125 --> 01:21:51,250
-But what the hell is she doing?

1634
01:21:51,416 --> 01:21:52,750
But come!

1635
01:21:54,833 --> 01:21:56,208
Look at this.

1636
01:21:57,041 --> 01:21:58,166
So ?

1637
01:21:58,333 --> 01:22:01,583
-We said 10 a.m. and it was minus 4, 
so I was waiting.

1638
01:22:02,125 --> 01:22:04,291
-You don't pretend 
to be stupid.

1639
01:22:04,458 --> 01:22:05,791
-I don't like to pretend.

1640
01:22:05,958 --> 01:22:07,208
-Do you have the equipment?

1641
01:22:07,375 --> 01:22:08,458
-Yes.

1642
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,166
-Menard, what are you doing? 
It's my office.

1643
01:22:14,375 --> 01:22:16,875
-I'm training, sir, 
for the future.

1644
01:22:17,041 --> 01:22:20,083
-Ah yes. Okay, book me 
a table at La Treille.

1645
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:22,166
With a low-end formula,

1646
01:22:22,333 --> 01:22:24,500
like we are poor and we know it.

1647
01:22:24,666 --> 01:22:26,125
-Good. 
-And find me

1648
01:22:26,291 --> 01:22:27,583
an old car.

1649
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:29,708
The rotten Clio. 
-It's mine.

1650
01:22:29,875 --> 01:22:32,250
-Perfect, as 
long as she smells like a dog.

1651
01:22:32,416 --> 01:22:33,333
-The inspector?

1652
01:22:33,791 --> 01:22:35,708
-No, Ménard, the car!

1653
01:22:35,875 --> 01:22:37,208
-Of course !

1654
01:22:38,791 --> 01:22:40,208
-It's expensive.

1655
01:22:41,166 --> 01:22:43,708
We will take two menus at 11 euros.

1656
01:22:43,875 --> 01:22:46,958
You know, at the town hall, 
we have modest means.

1657
01:22:47,125 --> 01:22:48,666
-It's good !

1658
01:22:48,833 --> 01:22:50,625
Good reflex! Miss,

1659
01:22:50,791 --> 01:22:52,375
what do you have in champagne?

1660
01:22:52,541 --> 01:22:53,500
-More ?

1661
01:22:53,666 --> 01:22:56,083
-There is only one. 
People don't drink it.

1662
01:22:56,250 --> 01:22:57,583
Except when the town hall pays.

1663
01:22:57,750 --> 01:23:00,250
So there, when it's the mayor ...

1664
01:23:00,416 --> 01:23:02,125
-So 2 cuts of the best.

1665
01:23:03,875 --> 01:23:04,750
Mr. Baldéli ...

1666
01:23:05,791 --> 01:23:07,083
insiders.

1667
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:08,791
(Evil laugh)

1668
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,291
But I'm kidding!

1669
01:24:00,708 --> 01:24:04,166
-It's weird, these sandwiches 
with bones in it.

1670
01:24:04,375 --> 01:24:05,666
-It's the principle

1671
01:24:05,833 --> 01:24:07,458
from the chop sandwich.

1672
01:24:07,666 --> 01:24:10,791
-Hey ! The trap is set, 
there is more to wait.

1673
01:24:10,958 --> 01:24:12,875
The mayor will fall, I believe.

1674
01:24:13,041 --> 01:24:14,458
Are you better off with Véro?

1675
01:24:14,625 --> 01:24:15,458
-I believe.

1676
01:24:15,625 --> 01:24:17,916
She begins 
to think of something else.

1677
01:24:18,083 --> 01:24:20,250
It passes him, to think that in the ass.

1678
01:24:20,416 --> 01:24:21,333
There, for example,

1679
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:24,333
we leave for Cap d'Agde 
for themed evenings.

1680
01:24:24,541 --> 01:24:25,500
It will be painful.

1681
01:24:25,666 --> 01:24:27,416
-It depends on the themes.

1682
01:24:27,583 --> 01:24:29,333
-As long as it's not ass.

1683
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:32,875
-Yes, at the level of the ass, 
the Cap d'Agde, it is cunning.

1684
01:24:33,625 --> 01:24:34,458
There, there.

1685
01:24:34,666 --> 01:24:37,875
(Mocking laughter)

1686
01:24:39,833 --> 01:24:41,125
-What?

1687
01:24:42,833 --> 01:24:44,416
-The file is heavy,

1688
01:24:44,583 --> 01:24:45,750
very heavy.

1689
01:24:45,916 --> 01:24:47,083
Having said that ...

1690
01:24:47,875 --> 01:24:48,958
-That said?

1691
01:24:49,125 --> 01:24:51,666
-I understand. 
I understand these women

1692
01:24:51,875 --> 01:24:54,500
who in an atmosphere ... 
(She sighs.)

1693
01:24:54,708 --> 01:24:56,208
who breathes love ...

1694
01:24:58,291 --> 01:25:02,458
this moist heat, 
this warmth!

1695
01:25:03,166 --> 01:25:05,625
These smells ... This smell

1696
01:25:05,791 --> 01:25:08,583
which emanates from a body ... 
Your body!

1697
01:25:10,083 --> 01:25:12,208
You are a sleeping tiger.

1698
01:25:12,416 --> 01:25:16,125
You know, we don't enjoy every day 
at the Court of Auditors.

1699
01:25:16,291 --> 01:25:17,708
-Is that so ?

1700
01:25:19,083 --> 01:25:21,708
- Are you looking at me, Tigger?

1701
01:25:21,916 --> 01:25:24,625
Like prey? 
But I am your prey!

1702
01:25:24,791 --> 01:25:25,833
(He roars.)

1703
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,583
-You see what, as an animal?

1704
01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:30,708
-An owl ?

1705
01:25:30,875 --> 01:25:32,666
-No, a gazelle!

1706
01:25:32,833 --> 01:25:34,750
-Ah, I had not seen the horns.

1707
01:25:34,916 --> 01:25:37,833
-A light gazelle, 
which is beautiful, which grazes ...

1708
01:25:38,041 --> 01:25:41,666
a gazelle frolicking! 
A gazelle who sees

1709
01:25:41,833 --> 01:25:43,041
a sleeping tiger.

1710
01:25:43,583 --> 01:25:44,958
(He roars.)

1711
01:25:45,125 --> 01:25:48,833
Him, he dreams of enjoyment! 
His eyes are closed.

1712
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:51,208
He opens them!

1713
01:25:51,375 --> 01:25:52,166
-Ah !

1714
01:25:52,333 --> 01:25:55,541
-He takes it in the face, 
love, wild beast!

1715
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:56,791
But the gazelle

1716
01:25:56,958 --> 01:25:58,958
feels the danger. 
(Moans)

1717
01:25:59,166 --> 01:26:01,666
Her little heart beats a hundred an hour. 
(Clicks)

1718
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,333
(Groans of effort)

1719
01:26:09,833 --> 01:26:11,333
(He sighs.)

1720
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:16,250
(Shout)

1721
01:26:17,041 --> 01:26:18,041
-More...

1722
01:26:18,208 --> 01:26:19,916
what are you doing there?

1723
01:26:20,083 --> 01:26:21,750
-We are there anonymously.

1724
01:26:21,916 --> 01:26:23,375
-Yes, I can see.

1725
01:26:23,541 --> 01:26:26,083
-Gilbert, blow up the slideshow.

1726
01:26:26,291 --> 01:26:27,291
-Let's go !

1727
01:26:29,208 --> 01:26:31,541
(Mocking laughter)

1728
01:26:37,958 --> 01:26:39,333
-Good, OK, it's good!

1729
01:26:41,208 --> 01:26:42,625
What do you want ?

1730
01:26:42,791 --> 01:26:45,750
-Either you stop 
measuring 30 redundancies

1731
01:26:45,958 --> 01:26:48,583
and you integrate 
the suburban trainees,

1732
01:26:48,750 --> 01:26:50,500
either we swing you.

1733
01:26:50,708 --> 01:26:53,583
-Offenders? 
But it is useless!

1734
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:57,375
-Well then, what do we do, Baldéli?

1735
01:26:58,666 --> 01:27:01,708
Oh, Ghislaine? But are you walking? 
-Yes.

1736
01:27:01,875 --> 01:27:04,916
-It's moving to see you in 
front of the Lourdes setting.

1737
01:27:05,083 --> 01:27:08,250
-I'm not leaving anymore. 
Here is our room. Well done.

1738
01:27:08,416 --> 01:27:09,666
I was told everything.

1739
01:27:09,833 --> 01:27:13,166
You're my winner. 
You trapped them, you got the mayor.

1740
01:27:13,333 --> 01:27:16,166
And you know what ? 
My body is thirsty for a winner.

1741
01:27:16,333 --> 01:27:18,083
Come on, come now.

1742
01:27:18,250 --> 01:27:21,083
-In front of the ducks? 
Aren't they too young?

1743
01:27:21,250 --> 01:27:23,583
-But there are lots of old people!

1744
01:27:24,291 --> 01:27:27,291
(Shouts of pleasure)

1745
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:35,833
(Ghislaine screams.)

1746
01:27:43,916 --> 01:27:45,375
(Disco music) 
-Ah!

1747
01:27:45,541 --> 01:27:47,666
-Disco evening! Titounet.

1748
01:28:03,625 --> 01:28:05,625
-A SPEECH ! A SPEECH !

1749
01:28:05,791 --> 01:28:07,625
A SPEECH ! 
-Wait!

1750
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:09,500
In high place,

1751
01:28:09,666 --> 01:28:13,125
we decided to downsize 
the public service.

1752
01:28:13,333 --> 01:28:14,291
(Hoots)

1753
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:18,583
And I was against it!

1754
01:28:18,750 --> 01:28:20,208
-Yeah ...

1755
01:28:20,375 --> 01:28:21,875
-Yes Yes !

1756
01:28:22,458 --> 01:28:23,875
Yes, I told them:

1757
01:28:24,083 --> 01:28:27,666
"No, but you take 
our municipal officials for pawns?

1758
01:28:27,833 --> 01:28:29,125
-We're not pawns.

1759
01:28:29,291 --> 01:28:32,083
- "I take you, I throw you! 
I reject you!

1760
01:28:32,250 --> 01:28:34,625
(Brouhaha) 
-It's human beings!

1761
01:28:34,791 --> 01:28:36,791
- "No, no!

1762
01:28:36,958 --> 01:28:38,541
"They are people.

1763
01:28:38,708 --> 01:28:41,708
"Quite simply people 
from Port-Vendres!

1764
01:28:41,875 --> 01:28:43,666
-YES!

1765
01:28:43,833 --> 01:28:45,791
- "They stay or I leave!

1766
01:28:45,958 --> 01:28:47,916
-You leave ! 
(Laughs)

1767
01:28:48,083 --> 01:28:49,541
- "It's them or me!"

1768
01:28:49,708 --> 01:28:51,791
-YES ! 
-I say "We",

1769
01:28:51,958 --> 01:28:54,541
because I am one of yours.

1770
01:28:54,750 --> 01:28:57,583
We won ! 
Everyone stays!

1771
01:28:57,750 --> 01:28:59,958
(Cheers)

1772
01:29:02,708 --> 01:29:06,125
I even managed to integrate 
our three young people

1773
01:29:06,291 --> 01:29:07,750
at the service of the staff!

1774
01:29:07,958 --> 01:29:09,958
-YES! 
-It's amazing.

1775
01:29:10,125 --> 01:29:13,250
-Three young people from neighborhoods 
who are said to be in difficulty,

1776
01:29:13,458 --> 01:29:17,291
but that I call: 
"In evolutionary movement".

1777
01:29:17,458 --> 01:29:19,333
-YES!

1778
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:20,708
-What, guys?

1779
01:29:21,458 --> 01:29:23,333
(Impressed sighs)

1780
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:25,500
(Acclamations)

1781
01:29:25,666 --> 01:29:28,791
-He Ho ! On the other hand...

1782
01:29:28,958 --> 01:29:30,583
gently the movement there.

1783
01:29:30,750 --> 01:29:32,833
-I scared me!

1784
01:29:36,208 --> 01:29:37,791
-You're a good one.

1785
01:29:39,416 --> 01:29:41,541
-Bah ... Bah, Maurice,

1786
01:29:41,708 --> 01:29:43,750
What's the matter ?

1787
01:29:43,916 --> 01:29:46,166
Do you measure more, Maurice?

1788
01:29:46,333 --> 01:29:49,750
-It's me talking, huh? 
I'm the one speaking.

1789
01:29:50,208 --> 01:29:52,958
(Admiring sighs)

1790
01:29:53,166 --> 01:29:56,958
-MAURITIUS! MAURITIUS! 
MAURITIUS! MAURITIUS!

1791
01:29:57,125 --> 01:29:58,750
MAURITIUS! MAURITIUS!

1792
01:29:58,916 --> 01:30:01,500
MAURITIUS! MAURITIUS! MAURITIUS!

1793
01:30:01,666 --> 01:30:04,541
-I've been 
stupid for 2 years measuring everything.

1794
01:30:04,750 --> 01:30:07,791
Hair like that, 
43 here, 43 there ...

1795
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,208
Now that I have visited

1796
01:30:10,375 --> 01:30:11,708
thanks to the shrink,

1797
01:30:11,875 --> 01:30:14,708
I have 40% disability. 
(Cheers)

1798
01:30:14,875 --> 01:30:17,625
-So, then, then ...

1799
01:30:17,791 --> 01:30:22,833
So I'm not measuring, huh? 
I have my disabled card.

1800
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
(Admiring sighs)

1801
01:30:25,166 --> 01:30:28,666
I 
park where I want and fuck everyone!

1802
01:30:28,833 --> 01:30:32,250
(Acclamations)

1803
01:30:32,416 --> 01:30:35,250
I can not tell you. 
-MAURITIUS! MAURITIUS!

1804
01:30:35,416 --> 01:30:36,958
-Well done ! 
-MAURITIUS!

1805
01:30:39,916 --> 01:30:41,500
-Are you okay, Christian?

1806
01:30:41,708 --> 01:30:43,541
- It's okay, Gilbert, it's okay.

1807
01:30:43,750 --> 01:30:45,833
I am in emotion. 
-Is that so ?

1808
01:30:46,041 --> 01:30:49,416
-And I have admiration 
for what Maurice did.

1809
01:30:49,625 --> 01:30:52,833
Two years of work, 
in silence, of self-denial!

1810
01:30:53,041 --> 01:30:55,500
The objective, to 
obtain the Disability card.

1811
01:30:55,708 --> 01:30:58,125
He works, he says nothing, he gets it.

1812
01:30:58,291 --> 01:30:59,125
Hat.

1813
01:30:59,333 --> 01:31:02,125
-Especially that to be stupid 
all the time,

1814
01:31:02,333 --> 01:31:04,125
never let go. 
-No !

1815
01:31:04,333 --> 01:31:07,125
A permanent idiot 
cannot relax.

1816
01:31:07,333 --> 01:31:09,166
The idiot, he's tired.

1817
01:31:09,333 --> 01:31:11,291
You know, 
idiots sleep a lot.

1818
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:13,458
-Is that so ? 
-Yes, they rest,

1819
01:31:13,666 --> 01:31:15,125
it tires you to be stupid.

1820
01:31:15,333 --> 01:31:18,500
We trained him, 
he arrives at the disability card.

1821
01:31:18,708 --> 01:31:21,000
Hat! 
It's our team from France.

1822
01:31:21,208 --> 01:31:24,333
You want the title, 
you work and you get it.

1823
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:28,208
-Somewhere, 
we are educators.

1824
01:31:28,750 --> 01:31:30,083
Oh it's...

1825
01:31:30,291 --> 01:31:32,791
It moves me. 
And with your wife, how are you?

1826
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,750
- It's okay, 
she understood who was the boss.

1827
01:31:35,958 --> 01:31:39,125
-Be careful, do 
n't give him too much taste for all this,

1828
01:31:39,333 --> 01:31:42,250
because you give them that, 
they take that from you.

1829
01:31:42,458 --> 01:31:45,000
-Are you yours? 
-She scares me.

1830
01:31:45,208 --> 01:31:46,208
(He groans.)

1831
01:31:46,375 --> 01:31:49,583
-In less than 2 minutes, 
I go around the port!

1832
01:31:49,791 --> 01:31:51,500
-Yeah, that's it !

1833
01:31:51,708 --> 01:31:53,750
(Mocking laughter)

1834
01:31:55,666 --> 01:31:56,875
Attention !

1835
01:31:57,083 --> 01:32:00,458
- GO!

1836
01:32:00,666 --> 01:32:01,666
(Klaxon)

1837
01:32:01,875 --> 01:32:05,250
(Cheers) 
-Bravo, Michel!

1838
01:32:05,416 --> 01:32:08,916
(Brouhaha)

1839
01:32:14,083 --> 01:32:15,416
(Klaxons)

1840
01:32:20,333 --> 01:32:21,541
(Tire screeching)

1841
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:23,208
(Shocks) 
(Fall in water)

1842
01:32:36,416 --> 01:32:38,166
-Hey, you see?

1843
01:32:38,375 --> 01:32:41,291
I knew 
it would one day serve the crane.

1844
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:42,791
-Bravo, Mr. Mayor.

1845
01:32:50,083 --> 01:32:52,208
-What are you thinking about, Michel?

1846
01:32:52,416 --> 01:32:55,666
-We are few to think too much, 
and too little to think little.

1847
01:32:55,833 --> 01:32:57,416
-But it's beautiful,

1848
01:32:57,583 --> 01:32:59,666
that, Michel! Who wrote this?

1849
01:32:59,833 --> 01:33:02,416
-Françoise Sagan. 
-French?

1850
01:33:02,625 --> 01:33:03,708
-Françoise Sagan.

1851
01:33:03,916 --> 01:33:05,708
-Sportswoman? 
-Yes I think.

1852
01:33:05,916 --> 01:33:07,916
-She could have made books.

1853
01:33:08,125 --> 01:33:11,666
-She should have made 
books, Françoise Sagan.

1854
01:33:12,333 --> 01:33:14,833
I would still help 
viticulture myself.

1855
01:33:15,041 --> 01:33:16,750
-What we were united!

1856
01:33:16,958 --> 01:33:19,291
-We have always supported 
viticulture.

1857
01:33:19,458 --> 01:33:21,500
We are united! 
-Of course !

1858
01:33:21,708 --> 01:33:23,833
Go, go! Go for it.

1859
01:33:24,333 --> 01:33:25,291
Go for it !

1860
01:33:25,458 --> 01:33:26,291
-Who are you talking to ?

1861
01:33:26,458 --> 01:33:27,791
-For spectators.

1862
01:33:27,958 --> 01:33:29,625
We're done, it's good!

1863
01:33:29,833 --> 01:33:30,791
-Ah yes, but ...

1864
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,875
They are on zealous strike, 
they will not budge.

1865
01:33:34,416 --> 01:33:35,625
-Cheers.

1866
01:33:35,833 --> 01:33:38,541
Do you know what they want? 
We are destabilizing.

1867
01:33:38,750 --> 01:33:39,583
- By not moving?

1868
01:33:39,791 --> 01:33:42,708
-Exact, and so are we well in place.

1869
01:33:42,875 --> 01:33:43,750
- Well in place.

1870
01:33:43,916 --> 01:33:47,041
-We've said enough bullshit. 
-Enough is enough.

1871
01:33:47,208 --> 01:33:48,916
-But too much is too much!

1872
01:33:49,083 --> 01:33:52,666
-It's also beautiful, Michel, 
it could make a headline.

1873
01:33:52,875 --> 01:33:54,875
-What do you mean ? 
-A movie title.

1874
01:33:55,083 --> 01:33:56,958
-Here ! 
-A movie about what?

1875
01:33:57,166 --> 01:33:58,958
-On us. 
-The municipal.

1876
01:33:59,125 --> 01:34:00,625
-The municipal!

1877
01:34:00,791 --> 01:34:02,291
-WHAT ?

1878
01:34:02,458 --> 01:34:04,458
-You caught the big head.

1879
01:34:04,625 --> 01:34:08,291
-Not the big head, the close-up. 
-She takes up the whole screen.

1880
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:11,333
-I will stay. 
Go ahead, we'll see you more.

1881
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:12,791
Everyone sees me.

1882
01:34:12,958 --> 01:34:14,875
Look, show, you're there too.

1883
01:34:15,083 --> 01:34:16,416
Huh, is he there?

1884
01:34:16,583 --> 01:34:18,750
- GO! 
-Go, go, now.

1885
01:34:18,958 --> 01:34:20,250
Be reasonable.

1886
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:23,166
-It's crazy, 
we're going to be late for the aperitif.

1887
01:34:23,375 --> 01:34:24,958
-And the aperitif is sacred!

1888
01:34:25,166 --> 01:34:26,666
It's not unpleasant!

1889
01:34:26,875 --> 01:34:30,333
It is true that close-ups, 
I too, get a taste for it!

1890
01:34:30,541 --> 01:34:33,791
We would be stupid to leave, 
we are good with you.

1891
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,416
It's true that we spent ... 
-But no!

1892
01:34:36,625 --> 01:34:38,208
-If you have a big head.

1893
01:34:38,416 --> 01:34:41,083
-No, we don't have that much, 
the big head.

1894
01:34:41,291 --> 01:34:44,208
-Good, come on! 
Be reasonable, get out of the way.

1895
01:34:44,416 --> 01:34:46,583
-Tell him to cut! 
-It cuts !

1896
01:34:46,791 --> 01:34:48,041
-Go. 
-We're leaving.

1897
01:34:48,250 --> 01:34:52,125
-We get attached, finally. 
We shouldn't, but hey.

1898
01:34:52,333 --> 01:34:55,666
-We get attached to you, hold on. 
-Me too, I'm attached!

1899
01:34:55,875 --> 01:34:57,875
-I don't know where I put my bus.

1900
01:34:58,083 --> 01:34:59,791
-But no, it is in the water.

1901
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,416
-Your bus, 
it fell in the harbor yesterday.

1902
01:35:02,625 --> 01:35:05,458
(Michel laughs) 
Damn, haven't you read the script?

1903
01:35:05,666 --> 01:35:09,166
-It makes you amnesic, you ... 
-Alcohol.

1904
01:35:09,375 --> 01:35:11,125
-But get out!

1905
01:35:11,333 --> 01:35:13,541
-Warning ! 
-Go away !

1906
01:35:14,125 --> 01:35:18,208
It is true they insist. 
-After a while it is painful.

1907
01:35:19,875 --> 01:35:23,125
<i>Standing, the convicts of hunger</i>

1908
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:25,458
(Laughs)

1909
01:35:32,458 --> 01:35:35,250
Excuse me, it shook me. 
- Come on, let's do it again.

1910
01:35:35,458 --> 01:35:36,791
- Go ahead, do it again.

1911
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,500
-It's relapse, 
he is depressed.

1912
01:35:39,708 --> 01:35:43,166
It's relapse, 
there, it makes us depression.

1913
01:35:43,375 --> 01:35:46,625
-Sorry. 
-It's relapse.

1914
01:35:46,833 --> 01:35:49,125
(Laughs)

1915
01:35:49,333 --> 01:35:51,208
Calm down, calm down!

1916
01:35:51,416 --> 01:35:53,958
-I tell myself ... 
-Because I finish the word.

1917
01:35:54,166 --> 01:35:57,958
-Because I start to look: 
"But what is it?"

1918
01:35:58,291 --> 01:36:00,208
-I think I believe it.

1919
01:36:00,416 --> 01:36:02,625
-More ! No, finally!

1920
01:36:03,333 --> 01:36:06,916
Yes ! Huh? Well yes ?

1921
01:36:08,250 --> 01:36:09,625
So yes ?

1922
01:36:09,833 --> 01:36:12,250
-Yes. 
-Well ! So ... Oh?

1923
01:36:12,583 --> 01:36:14,166
In...

1924
01:36:14,375 --> 01:36:16,750
By virtue ... 
(Laughs)

1925
01:36:16,958 --> 01:36:19,291
-You cut before me!

1926
01:36:24,333 --> 01:36:27,583
-I have a Perpignan-Paris 
that goes through Strasbourg,

1927
01:36:27,791 --> 01:36:31,583
with a change towards, 
towards ... towards Orléans.

1928
01:36:31,791 --> 01:36:33,250
I don't want to miss it.

1929
01:36:33,458 --> 01:36:36,041
-Read again the program, because ... 
(Laughs)

1930
01:36:36,375 --> 01:36:38,916
You're not sure to get there.

1931
01:36:39,416 --> 01:36:41,916
-I will eat your body! 
Titounet!

1932
01:36:42,125 --> 01:36:43,458
(He squeaks.)

1933
01:36:43,666 --> 01:36:44,666
-Titounet!

1934
01:36:46,041 --> 01:36:49,125
-Go, have a drink. 
Come on, Titounet!

1935
01:36:49,333 --> 01:36:51,458
(Growl) 
Drink a little!

1936
01:36:51,666 --> 01:36:53,333
(To laugh)

1937
01:36:55,958 --> 01:36:59,250
-Good, are you farting your bottle? 
- "Fart"!

1938
01:36:59,458 --> 01:37:02,083
Yes, but if there is one left! Ah!

1939
01:37:02,291 --> 01:37:03,791
He and you were!

1940
01:37:05,375 --> 01:37:08,250
(A bottle tumbles.)

1941
01:37:08,458 --> 01:37:10,791
-We were lucky, anyway!

1942
01:37:11,708 --> 01:37:13,708
-Are you ready to help us? 
-Yes.

1943
01:37:13,916 --> 01:37:16,833
It's enough to be stupid, 
I also want to be pretty.

1944
01:37:17,041 --> 01:37:19,375
(Laughs)

1945
01:37:20,583 --> 01:37:22,833
-In my opinion, 
no need to do it again.

1946
01:37:23,833 --> 01:37:27,458
- I'm going to take off 
the implants! Grind you the glottis!

1947
01:37:27,666 --> 01:37:30,625
Oh yes ! 
I want a fucking shovel!

1948
01:37:30,833 --> 01:37:33,833
A world champion shovel, 
a sick shovel!

1949
01:37:34,041 --> 01:37:35,958
I'm going to descale you!

1950
01:37:37,208 --> 01:37:40,708
Let me wet the acid for you. 
No that's not it.

1951
01:37:45,291 --> 01:37:47,166
-But Ghislaine, are you walking?

1952
01:37:47,375 --> 01:37:48,250
-Yes !

1953
01:37:48,458 --> 01:37:51,666
-It's moving to see you in 
front of the Lourdes setting.

1954
01:37:51,875 --> 01:37:54,208
-And then I walk ... 
(She stammers.)

1955
01:37:54,416 --> 01:37:55,250
-Of ?

1956
01:37:55,458 --> 01:37:57,541
Now we don't know what you said.

1957
01:37:57,750 --> 01:37:59,416
(He chuckles.)

1958
01:38:00,250 --> 01:38:01,291
Give him a drink.

1959
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:03,750
-Go, drink, my little Titounet.

1960
01:38:03,958 --> 01:38:05,666
- GO!

1961
01:38:05,875 --> 01:38:07,791
(Laughs)

1962
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,708
-He laps well, the Titounet.

1963
01:38:09,916 --> 01:38:12,291
-Wood, my little cushy. 
Come on, drink!

1964
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:14,583
Yes, papa, he will take you for a walk afterwards.

1965
01:38:14,791 --> 01:38:17,833
(Laughs) 
Did you take plastic bags?

1966
01:38:20,333 --> 01:38:22,750
(Cadenced music)

1967
01:39:09,333 --> 01:39:13,333
