1
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,367
Would you still love me
if I couldn't pay for dinner?

2
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,971
Possibly.

3
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,091
Yeah.

4
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,163
What do we do?

5
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,368
I'm thinking.

6
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,364
We could have a big row.

7
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,320
And... and throw some shit.
They might kick us out.

8
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,324
Been done, and it would
draw too much attention.

9
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,241
What are you doing?

10
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,482
- Taking my shoes off.
- Mmm.

11
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,160
I'm going to leave first,

12
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,803
and then when the time is right,
like when the maÃ®tre d's not looking,

13
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,691
you meet me down the street.

14
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,769
Uh, excuse me, sir?

15
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,321
Hey, run! Run, run, run!

16
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,448
Fucker!

17
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,771
Baby!

18
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,082
- Are you OK?
- Oh, I'm dying.

19
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,088
That was so epic!

20
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,282
Well, did we lose him?

21
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,363
I don't know.

22
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,525
Really, did they even chase us?

23
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,884
- Hey.
- What?

24
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,805
Hey, hey, hey, look, look, look.
Look at them.

25
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,362
This is pretty good, isn't it?

26
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,682
Yeah, it is.

27
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,800
<i>Hey-</i>

28
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,564
What?

29
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,006
There's only one heart in this body.

30
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,329
Have mercy on me.

31
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,123
Shut up.

32
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,121
Hey!

33
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,728
Mrs. Ludlow? You ready?

34
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,928
Yep.

35
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,362
- Hey.
- Hi.

36
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,526
Can I... Is it gonna hurt?

37
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,330
No, it's fine.

38
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,610
- Is this all your stuff?
- Mmm-hmm.

39
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,247
Uh.

40
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,765
You sure?

41
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,160
- Nice meeting you.
- Yeah. Have a great day.

42
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,686
Where's Philip?

43
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,486
He's asleep. He's exhausted.

44
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,881
What should I do?

45
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,168
Just put it somewhere.

46
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,327
I closed your wireless account.

47
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,481
Thanks.

48
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,530
What do you want to do about
all your stuff in the city?

49
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,650
You've got some clothes
here in the closet

50
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,200
and I have some more stuff for you
in the attic, if you want.

51
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,687
I'm sure that'll do fine.

52
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,885
It's just like old times.

53
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,645
Hey, Daddy.

54
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,928
So, what happens now?

55
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,924
I'm guessing you give
a speech of some sort.

56
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,560
What do you want to do, El?

57
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,848
Something else.

58
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,961
I'm open to ideas.

59
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,724
You could take some classes.

60
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,730
Could we talk about it later?

61
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,968
What about Conor?

62
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,166
Hey..-

63
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,402
- Auntie Em!
- Hi.

64
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,370
Missed you.

65
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,164
I missed you.

66
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,527
What'd you guys do today, huh?

67
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,648
- Chasing butterflies.
- Mmm.

68
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,083
- I catched one.
- You did?

69
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,363
Let's give her some time
to get settled in, OK, babe?

70
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,841
- Bye, honey.
- Bye.

71
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,368
Do you need anything?

72
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,409
Nope. Thank you.

73
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,121
I'm going into town in a bit
if you want to join, get out?

74
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,284
Yeah. You yell up at me
when you're going?

75
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,642
That's brutal, man.

76
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,370
Maybe she wants you to go after her.

77
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,249
No. She doesn't.

78
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,364
Maybe wait a couple of days,
then go after her?

79
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,807
Stu, don't.

80
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,365
Well, I guess...

81
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,002
- if someone flirts with extinction...
- Shut the fuck up.

82
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,481
OK, I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.
What am I supposed to say?

83
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,211
You don't have to say anything.
Just shut up,

84
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,727
drink and... talk about the weather.

85
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,168
Hey, the dude at table two says he's
gonna kick your ass if he doesn't

86
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,051
- get his chicken satay soon.
- Well, he can suck my balls.

87
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,850
Well, maybe you should
tell him that yourself.

88
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,570
- Table two?
- Mmm-hmm.

89
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,370
I'll deal with it.

90
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,050
Hey, we're out of beer.

91
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,407
What? How can we be out of beer?
We got two boxes back there.

92
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,244
- Go and check...
- Sorry.

93
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,282
You don't throw shit in my place, man.
What's your problem?

94
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,807
- Where's our fucking food, man?
- Listen, don't threaten my chef.

95
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,883
- OK, calm down.
- Don't tell me to fucking calm down.

96
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,690
Hey! If you threaten my chef again,

97
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,604
I will dropkick you
out of the fucking door.

98
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,520
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Hey, come on!

99
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,841
Hey, Stu!

100
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,446
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

101
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,366
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
You are gonna pay.

102
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,522
- Conor, Conor, buddy, you all right?
- Get the fuck out!

103
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,688
- Fuck you!
- Yeah, fuck you, man!

104
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,128
Nice comeback. Very nice.
Get out of here. You, too.

105
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,884
Get out.

106
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,761
You forget your stupid sunglasses,
too, fuckhead?

107
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,280
<i>You</i> have <i>reached</i>
a <i>number that is no longer in service.</i>

108
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,164
<i>- Please check the number...
- Shit.</i>

109
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,288
<i>...and try your call again.
Thank you.</i>

110
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,448
- Hello?
- Mary?

111
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,127
- Yes?
- It's Conor.

112
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,042
Is El there?

113
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,646
Hel...

114
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,006
Hello?

115
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,170
Hello?

116
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,440
<i>Hey-</i>

117
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,764
I thought I could, um...

118
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,960
I thought I could stay here
for a little bit.

119
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,763
Hi, Ralph.

120
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,523
You know where the guest bedroom is.

121
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,205
Yup.

122
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,761
There's towels in a closet
in the hallway.

123
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,809
Not much in the fridge.

124
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,406
Got some Cheerios.

125
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,327
That's fine with me.
I can go get some stuff. That's easy.

126
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,082
Well, I got to get to the restaurant.

127
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,685
- OK.
- Good night.

128
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,444
Night.

129
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,444
Whoa, hey. Hey, El.

130
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,921
<i>Hey-</i>

131
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,651
- Hey, Stu.
- Wow.

132
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,290
How are you?

133
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,209
You remember my dad?

134
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,368
<i>Hey-</i>

135
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,841
- How are you?
- Good, thanks.

136
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,684
You're the chef.

137
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,320
Yeah, I'm the chef.

138
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,960
It's all right.

139
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,491
How is the restaurant?

140
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,721
Good.

141
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,087
Yeah, it's going good.
Going really well.

142
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,242
El, you have to register.

143
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,401
We, we have to head off.

144
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,291
All right, yeah, I got to get this back
to the restaurant, but it's good...

145
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,363
- Good to see you.
- Yeah, you, too.

146
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:52,284
Hey, if you ever want to get, like,
coffee or... or something,

147
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,761
you know, shoot me a text
or call or something.

148
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,922
- OK.
- Good seeing you.

149
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,049
So, Lillian is expecting you.

150
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,645
Mmm-hmm.

151
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,208
She and I were colleagues at NYU.

152
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,771
I know. You told me.

153
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,331
You have...

154
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,280
...pencils and notebooks and all that?

155
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,811
Yes, Dad.

156
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,210
I have class, and...

157
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,408
...then I have patients.

158
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,608
So I guess I'll...

159
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,400
...see you at the house later tonight.

160
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,970
OK.

161
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,450
- El?
- Yeah?

162
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,890
Have a good first day.

163
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,530
I Will.

164
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,321
- How's the weather down there?
- Balmy.

165
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,131
- Do we have an appointment?
- I'm Eleanor Rigby.

166
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,524
That must be tough.

167
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,490
I'm here to talk my way
into your Identity Theory class.

168
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,971
Oh, you're Julian's kid.

169
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,361
I need some caffeine.
You're welcome to walk with me.

170
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,965
OK.

171
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,006
So, was Julian into The Beatles
or something?

172
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,925
- Sort of.
- What do you mean, "sort of"?

173
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:20,883
Um, he met my mom on the street during
one of the Beatles' hoax reunions.

174
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,850
There was a rumor they were gonna
play a show here before Lennon died.

175
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,040
Just like the one they did
on the rooftop in London.

176
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,442
My parents stood next to each other
waiting for the band to never show.

177
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,602
Nostalgists.

178
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,129
That, and my dad's surname is Rigby.

179
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,841
- You must detest the Beatles.
- No, not really.

180
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,842
- Do you want something?
- Uh-uh.

181
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,486
Double espresso, three Splendas, please.

182
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,802
So, why do you want to be in my class?

183
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,167
Your course sounds interesting.

184
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,527
And... look, you're a colleague
of my dad's, so...

185
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,126
Yeah, well, you got to do
better than that.

186
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,884
You want me to make something up?

187
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,008
Well, most people do.

188
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,282
You're just taking classes
just to take classes, right?

189
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,966
- Something like that.
- Well, let me save you some time.

190
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,401
All the perpetual students,
the hedge-fund wives,

191
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,769
and your generation of too many choices,
they usually go to Tim Gunn's class

192
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,048
<i>and listen to him</i> talk about
<i>Project Runway,</i>

193
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,283
or you could take the Art History class
on the advent of color photography

194
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,442
just for good cocktail party
conversation.

195
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,448
My "generation of too many choices"?

196
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,046
Democracy has its drawbacks.

197
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,766
Here's your double espresso,
three Splendas.

198
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,570
Thank you.

199
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,287
You're... teaching classes
just to teach classes, right?

200
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,725
Something like that.

201
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,923
I'm having a month, I'm sorry.

202
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,566
Your father didn't give me much warning
or tell me much about you.

203
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,087
And I'm really not one for nepotism.

204
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,643
I just got the call asking
if I could squeeze you into a class.

205
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,809
So I don't really know who you are.

206
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,644
It's OK.

207
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,049
Neither do I.

208
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,650
You want to help me?

209
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,564
You making chemise?

210
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,405
Mmm-hmm.

211
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,482
With summer vegetables and...
and some basil.

212
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,766
Mmm.

213
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,400
You remember when you
first had them, in Luberon?

214
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,005
- Mmm-mmm
- No?

215
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,364
You were four, and you were so fat.

216
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,408
My mother and I would cook
a big plate of them,

217
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,564
and left it on the kitchen table,
and you would eat

218
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,851
one and one and one and the other
until the plate was completely empty.

219
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,404
You went to nursery school that fall,

220
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,360
and all these women
gave me those weird looks and...

221
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,410
they were wondering
what I was feeding you with.

222
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,681
Well, I was a butterball.

223
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,127
I felt completely stupid.

224
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,921
Like I had no idea what I was doing,
the way those women looked at me.

225
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,411
Did you?

226
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,971
Did I what?

227
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,566
Did you know what you were doing?

228
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,722
I think I didn't realize
I wouldn't be able to retrieve

229
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,850
all the opportunities I threw away then.

230
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,602
You're not the only one who's
done stupid things to herself.

231
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,322
My darling.

232
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,285
I have no clue where she's going.

233
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,890
She turns off her cell phone,
and like that, she's vanished.

234
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,281
And... does that make sense to you?

235
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,204
- No comment.
- Come on, knock it off.

236
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,081
No, no, you know, whatever...
what do you call it, I plead the Fifth.

237
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,971
Like, I tried to be helpful,
I pretended,

238
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,771
but it didn't work out,
so I'm not gonna do that.

239
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,764
All right, look, I realize that
I've been a little off balance lately,

240
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,242
but I think with hindsight,
I'm learning to deal with it better.

241
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,920
A couple of weeks counts as hindsight?

242
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,650
Fuckin' A, Stu.

243
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,926
I got nothing for you.

244
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,408
Come on, come on. Look,
I'm just asking you a simple question.

245
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,404
You don't have to candy-coat it
like you're gonna hurt my feelings,

246
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,449
but... did you see this coming?

247
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,689
Look, with the exception of my dog,
I haven't slept next to the same person

248
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,003
for more than two or three days in a
row, so I don't know what I'm gonna say

249
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,128
that's gonna be relevant
to your situation.

250
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,169
I opened a restaurant for you, asshole.

251
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,130
No, you opened a restaurant
for you, asshole.

252
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,568
And according to the <i>Village</i> Voice,
it's "a bar with uninspired food."

253
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,769
Whatever. Look, I'm simply asking
for my best friend's opinion,

254
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,888
even it is an uninformed piece of crap.

255
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,725
OK. "We are young.

256
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,690
Heartache to heartache, we stand.

257
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,730
No promises, no demands.

258
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,611
Love is a battlefield."
Pat Benatar.

259
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,728
You're a fucking idiot.

260
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,885
Look, I feel like I walk on eggshells
around you.

261
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,647
You know, uh, I tried to talk to you
about this for months...

262
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,486
- I'm not talking about that.
- This is what I'm talking about, man.

263
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,529
I don't know how to be
your friend anymore.

264
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,406
You know, you're no fucking picnic.

265
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,485
Look, I saw her the other day.

266
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,490
- You what?
- I saw her.

267
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,927
- Where?
- Astor Place.

268
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,685
- Did you talk to her?
- No.

269
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,401
- You didn't talk to her?
- No. No. She was, uh, far away.

270
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,927
She was walking away.
She was going to class or something.

271
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,206
Class?

272
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,328
Yeah. She had her book bags
with her or something.

273
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,084
- She was going to class.
- What school?

274
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,402
- Like NYU or Cooper Union or...
- I don't know!

275
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,641
- The New School?
- I don't know.

276
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,643
- It's not hard to find out.
- Why didn't you tell me?

277
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,165
I just did.

278
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,322
What are you guys talking about?

279
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,567
- You.
- Oh.

280
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,764
<i>Hey-</i>

281
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,251
- OK?
- Um...

282
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:42,284
I'm not here to approve or disapprove,
just so you know.

283
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,125
Hmm?

284
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:48,808
Your mother always gave me crap
for never stepping up to the plate.

285
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,567
Uh...

286
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,324
OK. What?

287
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,648
She said I never stepped up.

288
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,849
Uh, I'm sorry, what does that
have to do with anything?

289
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,163
Well... you're a bit like me.

290
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,244
No, I'm fuckin' not.
I stepped up.

291
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,730
OK.

292
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,251
So what else?

293
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,164
Nothing.

294
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,448
Nothing. We don't have to keep talking.

295
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,329
Yeah, but you're the one
who came into the room.

296
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,643
- Yeah, to turn down your stupid music.
- Oh.

297
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:23,169
Every day I do one thing
that makes me happy.

298
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:27,723
All right, one thing.
And that is I listen to my stupid music

299
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,769
while reading the stupid paper.

300
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,080
And that's the best way
I've found to deal with myself.

301
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:36,609
So just go back to the guest room

302
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,808
and count the fuckin' raindrops.

303
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,611
"Count the fuckin' raindrops"?

304
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,607
I was never very good
at this kind of thing.

305
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,410
OK.

306
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:58,442
It isn't your job to investigate
the expansive memory

307
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,244
that's called "the past"

308
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,325
and judge what is right and what isn't.

309
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,649
Seriously, what the fuck
are you talking about?

310
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,800
You shouldn't be interested
in regretting things.

311
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,045
I'm not.

312
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,162
Let's do this.

313
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,122
...intuitive answer
to this question.

314
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,567
At the bottom,
the sense of self corresponds

315
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,121
to that experience of ownership

316
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,243
and impenetrability of one's thoughts,

317
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,927
of one's internal dialogues,

318
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,004
of one's affective states

319
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,084
that many, but not all,

320
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,208
- of us have from infancy.
- Hey.

321
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,931
Can I borrow a piece
of paper and a pen?

322
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,482
- ...solitude is held as constituting...
- Please.

323
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,564
...our sense of personal uniqueness...

324
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,243
Thanks. And... the pen?

325
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,807
- And it's perhaps that very same...
- I'll give it back.

326
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:52,409
...solitude that Descartes had in mind
when he redefined

327
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,530
the concepts of subject
and subjectivity.

328
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,444
You know, ultimately,

329
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,763
being oneself means
that the faculty of knowing...

330
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:08,011
...the faculty of knowing lies
within the subject in his head

331
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,209
and the subject has such a status

332
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,967
by dint of being enclosed
within himself,

333
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,727
- separate and...
- Hi again.

334
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,608
Would you mind passing this
to the girl with the red hair?

335
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,003
Come on, please?

336
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,728
...we say, "What's got into you?"
to express surprise.

337
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,120
Thanks a lot.
Don't forgot your pen.

338
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:38,683
...disapproval of
unexpected and bizarre behavior.

339
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,290
And again...

340
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,411
- doesn't common sense tell us that...
- Red hair. Thank you.

341
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:51,003
...strange behavior is signaled
by tapping one's forehead

342
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,606
with one's forefinger.

343
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,804
Boy, I'm learning something.

344
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:07,050
"Why the Mind ls in the Head" is the
title of one of the lectures delivered

345
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:13,168
- at the 1951 symposium.
- Hey.

346
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:17,803
One of the most authoritative voices
in this chorus is Ken Bergens,

347
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,890
who asked the question:

348
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:25,250
Can we compellingly reinscribe
what it is to be a person...

349
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,767
...in the way that moves us away

350
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,810
from the individualist premise

351
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,850
and toward the relational...

352
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,445
Hey!

353
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,448
- Hey, Rigby.
- What the fuck are you doing?

354
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,809
What? Come on, I barely got a chance
to respond before you went AWOL.

355
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,849
- What did I ask you, Conor?
- Just give me a second to talk.

356
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,968
- What the fuck did I ask you!
- Just give a goddamn second...

357
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,841
I gave you plenty of seconds!
Do me a favor, leave me the fuck alone!

358
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,441
Fine.

359
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,160
Fine, you do what you got to do.
You just keep fuckin' walking...

360
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,531
Conor?

361
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,927
Oh, shit! Conor?

362
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,127
You know this guy?

363
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,408
He's my husband.

364
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,484
Well, that was exciting.

365
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,570
Yeah, it was awesome.

366
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,171
So, you're...

367
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,727
...you're back in school?

368
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,690
I'm taking some classes.

369
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,800
I almost didn't recognize you.

370
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,287
What do you mean?

371
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,886
It's just your hair.

372
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,242
It's really pretty.

373
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,003
Where are you living, El?

374
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,081
None of your business.

375
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,565
Is that what you so desperately
needed to talk to me about?

376
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,085
No.

377
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,681
What is it, then?

378
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,570
I was gonna say something good,

379
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,882
something that would have

380
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,766
solved all our problems
and made everything all better,

381
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,605
but you know what,
I forgot what it was.

382
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,531
- That's too bad.
- Isn't it?

383
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,291
I'm gonna go.

384
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,090
No.

385
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,570
All I want...

386
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,002
...is a chance to just talk it out.

387
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,800
Then after that,
after that you can disappear,

388
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,129
- to wherever it is you disappear to.
- You ready, sir?

389
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,561
Yeah... yeah, I was born ready.

390
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,644
Nice and easy. Watch your step.

391
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,050
I'll see you around.

392
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,929
All right, watch your head coming up.

393
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,730
- You got him?
- I got him.

394
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,281
Now, take it easy.

395
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,765
- Strap in for me.
- OK.

396
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,929
May I keep stalking you?

397
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:00,171
- Are you awake?
- Mm.

398
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,961
- Auntie Em, are you awake?
- No, Philip.

399
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,804
Your eyes are open.

400
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,568
Apparently.

401
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:13,645
Why do you have your shoes on in bed?

402
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,890
Morning, sunshine.

403
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,729
Mom's making French toast.

404
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,729
All right, I'll be right down.

405
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,490
OK.

406
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,245
You came in late last night.

407
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,281
What's with the feast?

408
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,489
We have a special guest star.

409
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,971
Outside.

410
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,369
But it's been hard.
There's a barrier...

411
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,250
Good morning.

412
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,167
- No fucking way.
- El...

413
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,489
You sandbagged me.

414
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,201
He chairs the Psychology Department.

415
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,050
Good for him.

416
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,807
Well, I just thought he'd be
a bit more qualified to...

417
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,404
...to deal with your circumstance.
- What's my circumstance?

418
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,649
He was my grandson.

419
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,763
I lost him, too.

420
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,961
None of us know how to help you.

421
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,441
Well, neither do I.

422
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,249
I'm so glad they delegated
the speech to you.

423
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:12,082
He's not a stranger
that some hospital referred you to.

424
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,368
He's a colleague of mine.

425
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,729
I don't think one session
a week would hurt.

426
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,201
Why can't you talk to me
once a week, Dad?

427
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,488
- Why outsource it?
- I'm not outsourcing it,

428
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,207
and I don't really think you want
to talk to me about it.

429
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,011
I don't need to talk
to another therapist.

430
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,571
Eleanor...

431
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,883
Please, stop reminding me
that something's wrong.

432
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,725
That's... not my intention.

433
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,885
Then... please let me
stop thinking about it.

434
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,166
Tragedy is a foreign country.

435
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,083
We don't know
how to talk to the natives.

436
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,005
What are you talking about?

437
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,527
You know, there's this
really cool thing called chairs.

438
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,047
Yeah, I heard about those.

439
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,965
It's actually not too shabby down here.

440
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,850
You OK?

441
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,571
Sure.

442
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,524
Liar.

443
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,370
Sure.

444
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,564
When's your next class?

445
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,290
It's yours.

446
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,491
Oh.

447
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,921
Do you like hamburgers?

448
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,927
I used to be a vegan.

449
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,448
Mostly 'cause my husband was a vegan.

450
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,685
Not that I don't agree with most
of the tenets of vegan ideology, but...

451
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,286
...he was one
of those reformed socialists

452
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,569
who seemed sexy
before the '60s started to fade.

453
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,563
Does he teach?

454
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:25,202
He won tenure at University of Oregon,
and I got it here.

455
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,681
He went soft, I stayed hard.
That was that.

456
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,603
- You have kids?
- A son.

457
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,127
I'm not sure why people have kids.

458
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,491
You know, first there's
the nine months of agony,

459
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,723
your body hurts, it's hot, it's cold,
you crave pickles,

460
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,282
and there's no words to describe
whatever the fuck labor is.

461
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,771
And then this little stranger comes out,

462
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,763
sucking every bit of life
you have left in you,

463
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,448
and as soon as you're ready to jump out
of a window, all of a sudden he smiles.

464
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,287
Jesus Christ, this is good.

465
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,811
And whatever you do,
however you do it,

466
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,487
however you imagine your child's life,
or what kind of parent you'd be,

467
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,365
29 years later,
he's in some shrink's office

468
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,091
accusing you of some stupid thing
that you said or did

469
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,687
that for the life of you
you can't remember saying or doing.

470
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,728
Tell me at your age, you're not
taking classes out of boredom.

471
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,368
I don't know what the hell I'm doing.

472
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,807
What was before this?

473
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,124
- Life in general.
- Any kids?

474
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,726
Mmm-hmm.

475
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,321
Boy or girl?

476
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,360
- Boy.
- Good luck.

477
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,045
Thanks.

478
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,921
Who's that man who chased you
out of my classroom the other day?

479
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,201
He went soft, I stayed hard.
That was that.

480
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,726
- Well, it's been real, everybody.
- No, it hasn't.

481
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,690
Hey. Goddamn it.

482
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,330
Slow night?

483
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,240
Couple of people came in
to use the bathroom.

484
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,645
How we doing?

485
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,771
Well, aside from being
an endangered species, not so good.

486
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,564
Can you translate that for me, please?

487
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:28,122
Friday night, it's the only night
we're making any money.

488
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,851
I... I've missed some bills,

489
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,480
and we can't cover the overhead.

490
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,122
- I see.
- Yeah.

491
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,328
You got a plan B?

492
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,923
Burger King?

493
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,080
Seriously. Come on,
I want to show you something.

494
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:49,363
- This is the spreadsheet from...
- No, no, I can't. Um...

495
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,691
Oh.

496
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,287
You got protection?

497
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,526
Shh.

498
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,284
- Viagra?
- Please, be quiet.

499
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,930
- Want me to hold your hand?
- Shut your mouth.

500
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,281
- Can I watch?
- Shut up.

501
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,522
Dude, I'm being serious. Shut up.
I believe.

502
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,887
- In what?
- A higher power. Can you hear it?

503
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,769
Not right now.

504
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,564
- Later.
- Bye.

505
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,569
- Bye.
- You guys have fun.

506
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,811
- You know, I got a plan B.
- Oh, yeah?

507
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,089
You know what,
you can get out of here.

508
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,449
I was thinking about getting
my real estate license.

509
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,409
- What?
- Mmm-hmm.

510
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,320
Why would...

511
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,408
Why would you do something like that?

512
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:39,167
Uh, 'cause it seems more impressive
than pouring drinks.

513
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,290
Does it? What happened
to your life in the arts?

514
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:47,480
Oh, that'll probably phase in to a
Sunday afternoon hobby kind of thing.

515
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,165
You?

516
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:52,688
Plus, I think it's kind of indecent
to have things so worked out

517
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,169
that they wind up exactly
like you thought they would.

518
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,041
Oh.

519
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,009
Are you gonna be OK?

520
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,045
Probably.

521
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,682
We live in a world full of probablys.

522
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,650
Well...

523
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,564
I'm a decent listener...

524
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:20,169
if you ever want to talk about,
you know... whatever.

525
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,486
Talking about whatever's overrated.
I prefer just to, you know,

526
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,086
let things stew inside of me,
then have a violent out...

527
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,760
What'd you do that for?

528
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,484
It just seemed like the next
interesting thing to do.

529
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,409
I'm kind of married.

530
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,602
Yeah, I don't mind.

531
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,643
I kind of do.

532
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,600
- Uh, there's nobody looking.
- You know, in another life, I...

533
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,043
Mmm, we shouldn't even...

534
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:08,170
When's the last time that
you got laid properly?

535
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,489
Oh, fuck, I can already
taste the regret.

536
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,325
Well, stop thinking,
because it's not healthy for you.

537
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,130
- Alexis?
- Yes?

538
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,169
Tomorrow's gonna be awkward.

539
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,049
Probably.

540
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,011
Oh.

541
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,288
What the...

542
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,370
I'm sorry.

543
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,851
I wasn't expecting you.

544
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,240
No, no, no.

545
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:57,967
No, I wasn't expecting me,
either, so...

546
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:00,841
- Hi.
- Hey.

547
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,845
Is she here?

548
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,650
No.

549
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,568
Is she living here?

550
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,723
Do you want to come in for a second?

551
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,684
Would that be all right?

552
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,882
Yeah, come in.

553
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,326
OK.

554
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,527
Can I ask how she's doing?

555
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,446
I don't know, to be completely honest.

556
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,528
As good as she can be.

557
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,927
Do I seem like
a different person to you?

558
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,646
Do you feel like a different person?

559
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,565
Kind of.

560
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,843
You look the same to me.

561
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:11,725
You know I didn't like you when Eleanor
first brought you out here for dinner.

562
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,568
However long ago it was.

563
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:16,881
How long ago was it?

564
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,485
Seven years.

565
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,807
- Seven years?
- Yeah.

566
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:28,405
You sat there in the exact same spot
seven years ago,

567
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:32,485
with a glass of water because you were
afraid to have a drink in front of me.

568
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,807
This obnoxiously perfect kid who walked
off with my daughter's attention.

569
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,890
You grew on me, though.

570
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,565
Oh, well...

571
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,330
It's true.

572
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,250
Look, I...

573
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,722
I don't want to interfere
with your life,

574
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,009
or whatever she has to do,

575
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:04,370
but I can't...
I can't just chalk this up to destiny.

576
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,721
I walked on with my life because...

577
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,043
moving forward was the only way to go.

578
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,971
I guess people grieve differently.

579
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:22,124
I wish there was some appropriate,
articulate thing to say,

580
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:26,126
but I just wanted the mundane
daily bullshit back.

581
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,601
I think Eleanor wanted something else.

582
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,964
And I think that, um...

583
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:40,167
...there was nothing appropriate
about any of this.

584
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,009
Hey.

585
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,605
Guess what?

586
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:21,921
What?

587
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,367
I got asked out on a date.

588
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,201
I feel fat.

589
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:35,521
Katy, shut up.

590
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,611
You're not fat.

591
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:06,890
That's gorgeous.

592
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,566
Goddamn it!

593
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,526
Uh, excuse me?

594
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,523
Hey, come in here.

595
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,724
What was that?

596
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,406
This keeps breaking off.

597
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,325
OK, but we don't say that, lovey.

598
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,084
Why?

599
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,449
'Cause it's not a nice thing to say.

600
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,200
Are you sure that you're OK
to watch him?

601
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,726
Mom and Dad should be back pretty soon.

602
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,370
He's here.

603
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,204
Are you sure?

604
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,488
Yes, I'm positive.

605
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,728
- Change.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

606
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,043
So, what do you want to do?

607
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,764
What do you want to do?

608
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,530
Can I get electrocuted
by lightning bugs?

609
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,570
No, they're harmless.

610
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,762
This song is horrible.

611
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,607
- It's not good.
- It's not.

612
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:28,048
I think that bad music turns you on.

613
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,406
Seriously.

614
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:33,440
Oh, oh, oh, car, car, car, car. Do the
thing! Do the thing! Do the thing!

615
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,887
Do the... Shh. Shh.

616
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:38,646
I don't want them
to see your ta-tas.

617
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:41,925
We're good, we're good.

618
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,644
- Help me.
- What?

619
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,007
You know what you're doing.

620
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,288
Stop it.

621
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,525
- There you go. Should I do it?
- Yeah.

622
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,967
OK, this is kind of counter-intuitive.

623
00:51:56,120 --> 00:52:01,490
I think I'm instinctually wired
not to be able to do this.

624
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,329
There we go.

625
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:07,603
Three, two, one.

626
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,888
Just like that.

627
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,202
- You look good.
- Very impressed.

628
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,409
We have to listen to this?

629
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,681
Hey!

630
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,763
You want it? You want it?

631
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,486
- Top 40?
- No.

632
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,563
- Country?
- No.

633
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,446
Can I have some?

634
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,160
- Baby?
- Mmm-hmm.

635
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:47,450
- As comfortable as this is...
- Mmm-hmm.

636
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:50,689
...I'm losing circulation in my legs.

637
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:53,207
- What are you trying to say?
- That you're fat.

638
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,449
And I love every pound of you.

639
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,726
Come here.

640
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,086
Mmm.

641
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,929
Did you see where my shirt went?

642
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,690
Try the backseat.

643
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,885
- Where are you going?
- Out here.

644
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,364
You coming?

645
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,602
Yeah.

646
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,444
Where are we?

647
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,489
Someplace good.

648
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,803
- Amazing.
- I know.

649
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,769
It went that badly?

650
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,280
I could've given him
a normal kiss good night

651
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:23,762
instead of jamming
my tongue down his throat.

652
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,004
So he's cool?

653
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,606
I am so fucked.

654
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,607
You have a little to drink tonight?

655
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,410
Yeah.

656
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,049
What's that?

657
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,727
Philip gave it to me so I won't
be afraid of the dark.

658
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,962
You still having trouble with that?

659
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:07,122
Yeah, guess so. Come on.

660
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:14,171
Were you OK with him?

661
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,651
Yeah.

662
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,609
Oh, I don't mean...

663
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:21,047
That's not what I was...

664
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,166
I just...

665
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:25,964
I'm OK.

666
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,485
Is it OK to be OK?

667
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:30,007
Yeah, be OK all you want.

668
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,046
Are you really OK?

669
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:43,324
I can pretend.

670
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,171
All of a sudden, I kind of miss him.

671
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,011
Who?

672
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,766
Conor.

673
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,568
He came by the house the other day.

674
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,961
He talked with mom,

675
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:26,249
and she told me not to tell you.

676
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,645
I'm sorry, Katy.

677
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,084
What for?

678
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,402
I feel like I just dropped in
on you guys,

679
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,608
and I sucked all the air
out of the room.

680
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,683
You are kind of a selfish bitch.

681
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,444
<i>Hey-</i>

682
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,967
You don't have to be so honest.

683
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:56,685
No.

684
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,444
I was really mad at you.

685
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,364
I know.

686
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,490
- I'm still really mad at you.
- I know.

687
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:11,365
And you pulled the floorboards
out from under Conor.

688
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:21,364
He threw Cody's stuff into the closet.

689
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:27,285
And then ten minutes later,
he ordered Chinese from Madame Wu's.

690
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:34,848
I tried for six months.

691
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,443
We were a million miles away
in the same room, and...

692
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,209
...I started to think thoughts
I never thought I'd have.

693
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:00,086
How have you and mom made it this far?

694
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:02,810
I'm not sure.

695
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,442
Endurance.

696
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:17,729
Everyone starts out thinking,
"This is forever."

697
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:22,451
But then things get hard,

698
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,888
at some point or another.

699
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:32,369
And then other things don't pan out
the way you thought they would.

700
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:46,247
I suppose the trick is
not running for the hills,

701
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:49,404
even when you think it's
the most rational thing to do.

702
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,209
I don't know.

703
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:10,367
- I hate this room.
- I've seen worse.

704
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:18,211
- Where?
- Huh?

705
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,328
Where have you seen worse?

706
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,404
- NYU, Yale...
- Oh, Yale's butt ugly.

707
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:26,171
New Haven's butt ugly.

708
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,850
Did you attend any
of those fine institutions?

709
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,526
NYU, and then I grew up at Yale
when my dad was there.

710
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:36,524
- Oh, of course, you're a faculty brat.
- Mmm-hmm.

711
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,930
You and my son would
get along like hotcakes.

712
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,526
Not that I'm trying to set you up
or anything.

713
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,648
He lives in Washington, the state.

714
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:49,725
He's been pretending to write a novel
there for the last four years.

715
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:54,691
Learn anything interesting at NYU?

716
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,451
I abandoned a dissertation.

717
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,125
- Mmm, bold!
- Mmm-hmm.

718
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,682
- What department?
- Anthropology.

719
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,490
Mmm, social? Linguistic?

720
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:06,887
I was writing an ethnography
on the social world

721
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:11,728
of performance artists in Paris.
Musicians, dancers, actors, et cetera.

722
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,644
Why?

723
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:20,968
I don't know. My mom is a musician
and she's French, so...

724
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:24,169
No, I mean why did you abandon it?

725
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,886
Don't tell me something stupid
like love.

726
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:35,886
You're very talkative.

727
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:40,011
- It's more fun listening to you.
- You'll get over that.

728
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:45,360
I got pregnant.

729
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,282
Ah, that.

730
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:24,410
Come on, wake up.

731
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:34,124
Wake up.

732
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:02,241
What?

733
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,084
I went into your room
to check about you,

734
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:05,765
and you were gone
and the car was gone.

735
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:09,130
Yeah, I went for a drive.

736
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:11,408
Well, don't ever do it again.

737
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:14,764
Why were you checking on me?

738
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:17,287
I've always checked on you.

739
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,609
You feeling a bit dramatic today?

740
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,489
No, why?

741
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:32,286
OK.

742
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:49,127
I played second violin on this.

743
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,042
Boston Symphony. ltzhak Perlman.

744
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,043
I haven't forgotten.

745
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,044
No, I was just reminding myself.

746
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:18,924
What?

747
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,205
I never wanted to be a mother.

748
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,641
Not much you can do about that now.

749
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:35,129
Yeah. It's too late.

750
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,603
I was too young when I had you.

751
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,091
I was the baby.

752
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,049
Why are you telling me this?

753
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,089
I'm telling you this because...

754
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,089
I don't want to lie to you.

755
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:50,204
I don't want you to take
our relationship too personally.

756
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:54,488
I don't.

757
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:00,126
- No.
- Give... No, give me my wine.

758
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:01,725
Give me my wine.

759
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:04,321
Why didn't you tell me Conor came
by the house the other day?

760
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,648
Run for your life, El.

761
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:12,081
What is that supposed to mean?

762
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:15,483
Well, this is all too realistic.
Run away for a while.

763
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,364
You sure you're not projecting?

764
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:20,131
Yes, yes, I'm sure I'm not projecting.

765
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:21,884
You liked your semester in Paris,

766
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:24,884
so why don't you go back there
and finish your dissertation?

767
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:29,284
You could write in cafes,
read Le <i>Monde et</i> Les lnrocks.

768
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:33,365
Eat bread, make eyes at strangers.

769
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,090
Yeah, I could.

770
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,448
So why are you still here?

771
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:43,164
I don't know.

772
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:47,924
I don't get it, man.

773
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:49,605
What don't you get?

774
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:54,761
Well, your dad is, like,
the, like, a culinary maverick.

775
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:57,002
He's, like, the Mick Jagger
of the restaurant game.

776
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:59,891
All you got to do is make one phone call
and it saves our asses,

777
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:02,566
but instead you want us to drown,

778
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:05,530
like 90 percent
of the other restaurants in the city.

779
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,409
- I don't get it.
- Stu, Stu...

780
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,050
Well, I... What did he do?

781
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,690
What do you mean, "What did he do?"

782
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:11,921
Your dad, what did he do?

783
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:13,969
I mean, at least take a page out
of his book. What did he do?

784
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,685
- He married my mom.
- What does that mean?

785
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:17,444
That means he married my mom.

786
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:19,807
She gave him all the money
that her family left her,

787
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:21,246
and he opened the restaurant.

788
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,402
It was a big success and then
he dropped her like a bad habit.

789
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:24,846
So, you know what?

790
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:28,010
Why don't you go and find yourself
some lonely loaded old lady

791
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,000
- and then we can take it from there.
- Well...

792
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:33,084
You know what, I'd rather fail
catastrophically than, you know,

793
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:35,641
give him the satisfaction of thinking
he handed me my life on a platter.

794
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:38,610
That is the stupidest thing
in the history of stupid things

795
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:40,808
- to say.
- Whoa, why is that stupid?

796
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:43,361
You know what's stupid? You think I'm
gonna call my dad, and he's gonna go,

797
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:46,404
"Hey, son, why don't you come and bring
your friends, they can work here, too."

798
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:48,722
- Yeah!
- It's not a fucking slumber party.

799
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,644
It's not a slumber party,
it's a job.

800
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:53,770
- Stu, as decent a cook as you are...
- I'm a chef.

801
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:57,686
All right, chef, you don't exactly
cut it in those kitchens.

802
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:00,525
Oh, relax. You don't want
to have this conversation.

803
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:03,400
No, let's talk about it. When's
the last time you julienned a carrot?

804
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:04,891
- All right.
- Seriously.

805
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:08,926
When's the last time you cooked an egg
and you didn't blanch the yolk?

806
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:11,651
You know, in those kinds of kitchens,
in that world...

807
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:14,161
- I've been pulling my weight fine.
- ...you would be a busboy.

808
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:16,402
- You fuckhead. Fucking failure.
- Yeah, no. I'm telling you.

809
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:19,962
- Those glasses need picking up.
- You're Spencer Ludlow's son. Fuck you.

810
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:24,130
- You like that? Fucking asshole.
- Wait! Whoa!

811
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:25,725
You hit me with fucking kale?

812
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:30,128
That all you got? Come on.

813
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:31,645
Oh, God! Jesus.

814
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:32,961
Ow.

815
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:35,681
Ow.

816
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:39,128
Ow, ow, oh.

817
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:45,564
OK, OK, yeah, yeah.
This is what you want?

818
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:53,128
- Is that a joke?
- No, they're really going at it.

819
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:56,204
- That doesn't sound so good to me.
- We're not quite open yet.

820
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:04,048
I was third in my class at the New York
Academy of Culinary Arts, you fuckhead.

821
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,884
I know that, asshole.

822
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,682
Then cut the shit.

823
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:13,485
<i>Hey-</i>

824
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:16,291
I love our little set-up here.

825
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:18,124
I do.

826
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,922
But the lease has gotten
prohibitively expensive,

827
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:24,964
and unless you want
to camp out in the kitchen...

828
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:29,324
Yeah. I'll bring the sleeping bags.

829
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:34,451
Just... time to let go.

830
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:38,444
Time to grow up.

831
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:40,443
I am grown up.

832
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:42,927
- I am.
- Fine.

833
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:49,168
When do we call it quits?

834
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:51,846
End of next week.

835
01:08:57,760 --> 01:09:01,367
Can we have one last banger
before we close shop?

836
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,045
Yeah.

837
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:06,569
Can we abuse some heavy narcotics?

838
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:09,246
- Whatever tickles your thing.
- Good.

839
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,641
I'm sorry.

840
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:14,041
- Blow me.
- OK.

841
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:23,440
Yeah, it's amazing.
So you're well?

842
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:25,369
I'm OK.

843
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:27,210
- Good.
- Yeah.

844
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:31,888
I'm just painting and here,
you know, that same stuff.

845
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:33,485
- Eat me.
- Hey, hey, hey.

846
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:35,608
Sorry.

847
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:39,287
Holy Shatner.

848
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:41,408
Nice to see you, too, Stuart.

849
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:48,444
Well, this is nice.
Like old times, reconnecting and all.

850
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,568
- I'm gonna go to the kitchen.
- Yeah.

851
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,921
I will join you.

852
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:23,561
Shirley Temple?

853
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:26,321
Please.

854
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:41,967
What do I owe you?

855
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,442
Your money's no good here.
You know that.

856
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:46,641
OK.

857
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:52,005
Business is good?

858
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:53,491
It's great.

859
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:57,881
We're closing.

860
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:03,366
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

861
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,643
Yeah, me, too.

862
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:17,165
So, what's next?

863
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:18,731
I don't know.

864
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:24,600
I thought I might...
develop some interests in things

865
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:27,121
that people actually take
an interest in.

866
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:29,442
You gonna work with your dad?

867
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:32,722
Hmm?

868
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:39,926
You know, before you,
I had no idea who I was.

869
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:44,083
Then when we were together,

870
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:47,687
I thought I had it all figured out.

871
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,607
Now I'm just back to wondering again.

872
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:59,731
Well, when you figure it out,
tell me how, OK?

873
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:02,724
OK.

874
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:07,923
- Let's get out of here.
- What?

875
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:09,206
Let's go.

876
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:12,204
- Right now?
- Yeah. That's the idea.

877
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:15,841
OK.

878
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,206
Yeah, uh...

879
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,684
Don't forget to fill it up
before you drop it off.

880
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,205
You got it.

881
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,004
- That.
- What are you doing?

882
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:21,562
Do you want to listen to that?

883
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:25,122
Yeah. Suck it up, Ludlow.

884
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:38,410
Is it gonna rain?

885
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,922
Fuck me!

886
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:53,646
Ah...

887
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:58,121
Of course, we get the car
with the retarded wipers.

888
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:01,284
We could just wait it out.

889
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:05,448
What are we doing here?

890
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:10,001
You tell me. You're the one who said
that we needed to talk.

891
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:12,731
You stalked me,
you went to my parents' house.

892
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:13,881
What are we doing here?

893
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:17,328
Just recently, like an hour ago,
you walked into my bar

894
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:21,610
and you suggested we drive aimlessly
into the perfect fucking storm here.

895
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:25,889
This is funny.

896
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,883
Yeah.

897
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:31,567
Yeah, it's fucking hilarious.

898
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:50,800
You know, for a while there,
I thought we'd actually pieced together

899
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:52,245
a pretty decent life.

900
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:02,771
I have to move everything
out of the apartment next week.

901
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,770
Do you want me to
keep anything for you?

902
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:10,810
Where will you move to?

903
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:12,724
I don't know.

904
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:15,281
I could stay with my dad
for a little while,

905
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:18,569
- until I get things figured out.
- How is he?

906
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:20,965
Oh...

907
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:23,891
I'm pretty certain he's losing his mind.

908
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:27,726
- Fernanda left him. Yeah.
- Oh.

909
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:33,760
He's getting all talkative.
Waxing philosophical.

910
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:37,322
Same shit he pulls every time
he's between significant others.

911
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:40,324
I think it's probably more than that.

912
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:43,730
Yeah, maybe.

913
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:47,651
- At least you guys are talking.
- Yeah.

914
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:50,840
What did you tell your parents about us?

915
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:54,960
What would I say?

916
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:57,521
That we're fabulous.

917
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:06,526
I feel like we're living
some dreadful disaster clichÃ©.

918
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:08,523
We are.

919
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:16,043
You're sopping wet.

920
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:18,885
Oh, you noticed? Thank you.

921
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:52,926
- Wait...
- No, no, no, no.

922
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:55,242
No, wait, wait.
Just a second, wait.

923
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:56,686
Shh.

924
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,530
Shit.

925
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:06,088
I slept with someone else.

926
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:15,562
I'm sorry.

927
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:24,642
It doesn't matter.

928
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:28,249
What do you mean, it doesn't matter?

929
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,084
Get off me.

930
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:31,287
Don't, El...

931
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:32,885
- Come on.
- Get off.

932
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:36,442
What do you mean, it doesn't matter?

933
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:39,001
Get over yourself, Conor.

934
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:44,648
- You don't care?
- No.

935
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:47,929
That's bullshit. I know you care.

936
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:51,765
El, you're supposed to say,
"What the fuck are you thinking, Conor?"

937
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:54,160
You're supposed to say,
"You're a selfish piece of shit."

938
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:55,685
No.

939
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,922
We're past that.

940
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:00,890
And you just said it for me.

941
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:02,929
Come on, let's go back to the city.

942
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:28,724
I'm gonna get out of here.

943
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,089
- Ma'am?
- Yes?

944
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:34,605
You're a dick.

945
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,090
And you look like ass.

946
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:41,208
Thank you.

947
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,010
Where were you last night?

948
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:49,560
Do you want to take a load off?

949
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:56,969
I come here on breaks.

950
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:02,009
One of the librarians
advocates a whole nap philosophy.

951
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:05,927
Nap philosophy?

952
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:10,722
Yeah, naps throughout the day, like,
help with productivity and stuff.

953
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:12,727
Mmm.

954
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:18,162
If you want to read this.

955
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:24,245
What?

956
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:30,281
I was hoping you could read my mind.

957
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:33,603
Wouldn't that be nice?

958
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,243
You want to do something stupid
this weekend?

959
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:53,280
Yeah. I'm the queen
of doing something stupid.

960
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:55,807
What are you thinking?

961
01:20:55,960 --> 01:21:01,490
Get bent, take a train into the city,
save the world.

962
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:05,322
When did you become an idealist?

963
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:07,244
A couple seconds ago.

964
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:12,486
I have a date
with the dentist this weekend.

965
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:15,570
It's OK. He can be our third wheel.

966
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:26,769
- You like drinks?
- Yeah.

967
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:28,046
Yeah, I'll have a drink.

968
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:30,242
- Should we get, like...
- A shot?

969
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:32,482
- Three shots?
- Tequila.

970
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:35,685
A round of tequila.

971
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:55,802
I feel old!

972
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:58,122
- What?
- I feel...

973
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:00,567
I feel old!

974
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:02,882
Me, too!

975
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:07,124
Cheers.

976
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:40,529
What's your name?

977
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:42,921
I'm good, thanks.

978
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:48,851
Oh, wait.

979
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:36,642
Wait... No, wait, wait, wait.

980
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,643
- What? What?
- Wait.

981
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:41,731
What is it?

982
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:44,611
Uh...

983
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:46,685
Did I hurt you?

984
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:48,968
No, no.

985
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:51,407
What is it?

986
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,169
You're a stranger.

987
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:58,005
So are you.

988
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:03,001
You ever have that moment where you
know you're doing something stupid,

989
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:04,889
but you do it anyway?

990
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,769
Yeah, every day.

991
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:10,604
What? Come on.

992
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:12,046
- No.
- Come on.

993
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:13,929
Stay there.

994
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:16,481
- I'm gonna go.
- No, don't go.

995
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:20,202
- Don't.
- Oh, Jesus.

996
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:22,567
Just stay for a minute.

997
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:25,725
Really?

998
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:31,249
Sorry.

999
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:57,131
Where to?

1000
01:24:57,320 --> 01:24:59,129
Uh...

1001
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:02,210
Just make a loop around the city.

1002
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:04,203
Got a destination?

1003
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:06,806
Eventually.

1004
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:28,041
Hey, Phoebe.

1005
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:29,929
- Hey, how are you?
- How are you?

1006
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:32,321
Good. Your hair got long.

1007
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:33,851
- Not really.
- Yeah.

1008
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,082
He's in his spot.

1009
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:01,401
You could make this place your own,
if you want.

1010
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:03,722
Do what you like with it.

1011
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:05,450
Seriously, I...

1012
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:08,326
I'm done.

1013
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:13,442
Used to be pretty cool,
once upon a time.

1014
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:17,366
Some of the same faces still show up,
except more wrinkled.

1015
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:19,443
Some of them less so.

1016
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:22,604
The Stones were in last week
after playing the Garden,

1017
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:27,527
but... mostly people
are just fading away.

1018
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:32,722
I've been doing this way too long.

1019
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:35,008
I think you've done pretty good.

1020
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:41,002
Yeah, well... complacency scares
the shit out of me.

1021
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,763
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

1022
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:45,365
Then how's this?

1023
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:48,569
I forfeited the loan the bank gave me,

1024
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:50,210
I'm losing the lease on my bar,

1025
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:55,648
Eleanor's gone with the fucking wind.

1026
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:59,328
I'm 33 years old,

1027
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:02,528
and my life's a fucking boat wreck.

1028
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:07,529
I'm in my 60s.

1029
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:12,481
I lost a grandson this year that
I'm basically forbidden to talk about.

1030
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:15,211
My third wife just walked out on me,

1031
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:19,888
and I come here every afternoon to this
restaurant named after your mother.

1032
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:26,445
It's time to shoot the crow.

1033
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:30,486
Where are you gonna go?
You gonna fly off to Never-Never Land?

1034
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:33,001
Become a Buddhist?

1035
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:35,767
What are you doing here, anyway?

1036
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:40,162
I was...
I was just in the neighborhood.

1037
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:46,240
"Just in the neighborhood."

1038
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:49,563
What is it?

1039
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:58,008
Do you ever wonder why we fall in love
with a specific person?

1040
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,604
Not really.

1041
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:05,403
I think to myself,

1042
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:10,168
"Something's wrong here, but I can't
quite put my finger on what it is."

1043
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:16,203
There's always one that haunts us.

1044
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:18,647
So give her time.

1045
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:25,760
It's the right thing to do,
given the circumstances.

1046
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:30,725
- Circumstances suck.
- Yeah.

1047
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:40,365
I really forbid you
from talking about him?

1048
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:42,685
Uh-huh.

1049
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:49,281
What the fuck are you gonna say to me?

1050
01:28:57,240 --> 01:28:59,049
Ever since he...

1051
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:06,851
Ever since what happened happened,
any thought or memory of him

1052
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:10,049
has been something just to run my mind
as far as fuck away from as I can get,

1053
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:11,651
and...

1054
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:25,169
A shooting star only lasts a second,

1055
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:32,491
but... aren't you glad
to at least have seen it?

1056
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:41,285
That's nice.

1057
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:47,800
It's a little Hallmark,
but it's nice.

1058
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:50,889
I mean it, it's nice.

1059
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:53,361
You have a delicate soul, Dad.

1060
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:55,284
Oh, nobody ever said that to me before.

1061
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:59,046
You know, we're in imminent danger
of sappiness.

1062
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:01,328
- Oh, we can't have that, can we?
- Mmm-mmm.

1063
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:05,487
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

1064
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:08,041
- I'll fix you something up.
- OK.

1065
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:29,203
"All the lonely people,
where do they all come from?"

1066
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:30,761
Hmm?

1067
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:33,280
That's the Beatles song
you were named after.

1068
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:35,000
Ah...

1069
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:36,645
Three Splendas.

1070
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:39,406
Wow, full service.

1071
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:43,401
Want me to come down there
or you want to join me in here?

1072
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:56,087
I think I'm gonna leave your class.

1073
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:07,962
You're breaking up with me.

1074
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:16,766
So this is what heartbreak feels like.

1075
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:19,321
You never had your heart broken?

1076
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:21,528
Only read about it in books.

1077
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:24,289
Liar.

1078
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:26,488
Sure.

1079
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:36,326
You know, you don't have to tell me
this. You could've just not shown up.

1080
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:46,365
I just got to get out of here.

1081
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:49,531
"Here"?

1082
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:53,128
- The tri-state area.
- Oh.

1083
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:58,810
You know, they say
that if you walk away from things,

1084
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:02,567
then you'll just keep walking away.

1085
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:07,730
Start a whole history of walk-aways.

1086
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:16,006
Did that sound
as lame as I thought it did?

1087
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:17,764
No.

1088
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:21,686
Good, 'cause I don't have a fucking clue
as to how life should be lived.

1089
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:24,969
Well, could you refer me
to someone who does, please?

1090
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:30,806
Yeah.

1091
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:33,923
I had a dog... Miles.

1092
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:36,481
I got him from a pound.

1093
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:37,926
He did it pretty well.

1094
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:41,163
Lived every day
like he won the lottery.

1095
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:43,243
Where's Miles when we need him?

1096
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:45,289
Somewhere in Pennsylvania.

1097
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:49,365
<i>Took him on</i> a <i>road trip,</i>
trying <i>to be</i> all <i>Travels with Charley.</i>

1098
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:52,524
As soon as we hit the open countryside,

1099
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:55,126
he starts jumping up and down
like he picked up a scent

1100
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:58,682
or found something
he'd always been looking for.

1101
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:01,280
Let him out.

1102
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:05,729
He hightails it,
chasing the sun to nowhere.

1103
01:33:08,640 --> 01:33:09,721
He ran away?

1104
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:11,251
Mmm-hmm.

1105
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:13,927
I imagine he's happy
wherever he wound up.

1106
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:15,889
Hooked up with some Amish people.

1107
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:17,246
Lives on a dairy farm.

1108
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:19,209
It's possible.

1109
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:28,846
I have a colleague at NYU.

1110
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:32,283
From my days of working
with your dad there.

1111
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:36,884
Teaches anthropology at the
American University in Paris,

1112
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:40,362
does some work
at the Musee du Quai Branly.

1113
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:43,288
I can make a phone call.

1114
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:46,410
Send him that dissertation
you started on.

1115
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:54,211
Want half a bagel?

1116
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,004
No, I'm good, I'm good.

1117
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:57,525
You getting enough to eat?

1118
01:33:57,680 --> 01:33:59,967
You're starting to sound maternal.

1119
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:02,407
Oh, that would be a first.

1120
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:06,840
When's the last time you got
to talk to your son?

1121
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,844
Some holiday too long ago.

1122
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:15,084
Is it sad that I don't remember?

1123
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:17,083
Probably.

1124
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:20,362
I should call, shouldn't I?

1125
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:23,804
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1126
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:28,682
Now you sound maternal.

1127
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:48,446
Hello?

1128
01:35:50,040 --> 01:35:51,724
Hello?

1129
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:55,609
Hello?

1130
01:41:57,560 --> 01:41:58,925
<i>Hey-</i>

1131
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:07,607
Do I seem like
a different person to you?

1132
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,207
You look the same to me.

1133
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:23,569
I'm sorry.

1134
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:28,121
For what?

1135
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:33,248
For disappearing.

1136
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:52,770
We'll never get to where we were.

1137
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:58,321
Where was that?

1138
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:08,087
Someplace good.

1139
01:43:09,960 --> 01:43:11,564
Yeah.

1140
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:21,001
Tell me what you're thinking.

1141
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:35,611
I forgot what he looked like.

1142
01:43:42,440 --> 01:43:45,887
Sometimes I'll get a glimpse
of his eyes or...

1143
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:56,083
...the way he'd smile at me
from his crib.

1144
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:03,890
But then he'll vanish.

1145
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:08,967
I can't picture his face.

1146
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:14,286
I can't picture his face anymore.

1147
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:30,528
He was pale.

1148
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:38,847
He frowned a lot.

1149
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:44,809
He had your eyes, he had your nose,
he had your... your lips,

1150
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:49,010
he had your cheeks.
El, he was all you.

1151
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:56,610
He was the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1152
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:14,889
I wasn't prepared
for what this feels like.

1153
01:45:18,440 --> 01:45:21,011
I know. Neither was I.

1154
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:18,809
I love you.

1155
01:46:22,680 --> 01:46:24,762
I know.

1156
01:47:06,240 --> 01:47:08,766
- How's it coming?
- It's coming.

1157
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:15,611
There's a great cafe
called Le Cafe

1158
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:21,244
at the Rue Tiquetonne that
a lot of artsy fartsies go to.

1159
01:47:21,400 --> 01:47:24,165
Your mother and I used to go there
when we visited her parents.

1160
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:28,006
I met Jean-Marie Le Clezio there once,
before he won his Nobel.

1161
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:30,206
Cool.

1162
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:32,681
And you should get

1163
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:35,690
some of those big French macaroons

1164
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:39,561
at Laduree

1165
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:42,246
in Saint-Germain.

1166
01:47:44,360 --> 01:47:46,442
Call me when you do...

1167
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:51,370
...and I will live
vicariously through you.

1168
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:54,528
I will. Thanks.

1169
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:07,450
I lost you in the ocean once.

1170
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:09,602
What?

1171
01:48:13,400 --> 01:48:15,323
I lost you in the ocean once.

1172
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:23,082
We had rented a house
at Ditch Plains Beach on Montauk,

1173
01:48:23,240 --> 01:48:26,210
when you could afford Montauk.

1174
01:48:26,360 --> 01:48:28,761
You were about two.

1175
01:48:30,160 --> 01:48:32,925
Your mother was pregnant with Katy,

1176
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:37,802
and I took you down swimming

1177
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:39,405
one afternoon.

1178
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:43,127
Not a lot of people down there.

1179
01:48:45,040 --> 01:48:46,087
I...

1180
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:50,643
I waded out...

1181
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:53,370
...holding you.

1182
01:48:54,920 --> 01:48:58,003
Thinking, at one point,
"This might not be the best idea."

1183
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:02,803
But you were game.

1184
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:09,448
Or I imagined that you were game
because you never, ever seemed scared.

1185
01:49:11,680 --> 01:49:13,330
Of anything.

1186
01:49:15,160 --> 01:49:17,083
The Atlantic is moody,

1187
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:20,363
and a big set of waves snuck in.

1188
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:24,923
We made it under the first one.

1189
01:49:27,240 --> 01:49:29,322
You were clinging to my neck.

1190
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:32,768
But we got caught
in front of the second.

1191
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:38,608
And I came up without you.

1192
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:45,809
I have never felt anything like that.

1193
01:49:48,120 --> 01:49:52,170
The throes of that
stupid couple seconds,

1194
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:55,328
treading the white water.

1195
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:02,683
And then, miraculously, I...

1196
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:07,927
...felt you at my feet.

1197
01:50:10,840 --> 01:50:12,842
I never told your mother.

1198
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:15,247
I never told anyone.

1199
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:19,883
That was the worst
and the best moment of my life.

1200
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:41,731
OK.

1201
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:45,441
- Is this ready?
- Yeah.

1202
01:50:47,400 --> 01:50:50,131
- I'll be downstairs in a bit.
- OK.

1203
01:51:53,480 --> 01:51:54,845
What have you got?

1204
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,490
Chardonnay.

1205
01:52:02,360 --> 01:52:03,885
- It's good? Hmm?
- Hmm.

1206
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:07,286
Mmm.

1207
01:52:08,040 --> 01:52:10,520
You know I'm full of shit, right?

1208
01:52:10,680 --> 01:52:12,569
Depends on the day.

1209
01:52:14,480 --> 01:52:16,323
But you know that I love you, hmm?

1210
01:52:24,160 --> 01:52:25,844
Say good-bye to Auntie Em, OK?

1211
01:52:26,720 --> 01:52:27,881
OK.

1212
01:52:28,040 --> 01:52:30,725
Good-bye, chickadee.
You make sure that they behave, OK?

1213
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:33,087
- OK.
- OK, kiss.

1214
01:52:35,720 --> 01:52:37,802
What time is it in France?

1215
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:40,201
Um, it is past your bedtime.

1216
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:41,811
Why?

1217
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:47,530
Don't be a stranger.

1218
01:52:49,600 --> 01:52:50,931
I won't.

1219
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:55,245
I don't want to go to bed.
It's still light out.

1220
01:52:55,400 --> 01:52:57,607
You don't have to go to bed, sweetie.

1221
01:52:57,760 --> 01:52:59,091
Be good, OK? I'll be back.

1222
01:52:59,240 --> 01:53:01,322
When is Auntie Em coming back?

1223
01:53:01,480 --> 01:53:03,369
She'll be back next summer.

1224
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:51,687
Hey, guys, I'm gonna go take a stroll
before the rush, OK?

1225
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:53,444
- OK.
- OK.

1226
01:53:54,600 --> 01:53:56,682
Aren't you worried about
these 15 people in that section?

1227
01:53:56,840 --> 01:53:58,251
What are we going to do with them?

1228
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:00,760
Um, you know what we do is we
open up this back room here...
