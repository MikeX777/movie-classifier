I know. The wall's
a bit obsessive.

889
00:57:20,915 --> 00:57:23,309
You feelin' okay?

890
00:57:23,352 --> 00:57:26,399
- Why... Where am I? What's...
- You're at my place.

891
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,706
You're safe.
You, you were drugged.

892
00:57:28,749 --> 00:57:30,664
I checked your glass. Rohypnol.

893
00:57:30,708 --> 00:57:32,753
Heavy dosage.

894
00:57:32,797 --> 00:57:33,841
Someone wanted you out cold

895
00:57:33,885 --> 00:57:35,277
so you'd... peew,

896
00:57:35,321 --> 00:57:37,497
sink to the bottom
of that murky lake.

897
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:40,544
Fortunately, good Samaritan
happen by.

898
00:57:40,587 --> 00:57:42,328
Saved your life.

899
00:57:43,677 --> 00:57:45,462
You're welcome.

900
00:57:45,505 --> 00:57:48,508
- What is all this?
- It's okay, you can trust me.

901
00:57:48,552 --> 00:57:50,336
- Let me just grab...
- What's there to trust you?

902
00:57:50,379 --> 00:57:52,730
I can't... I don't even know
what you were doing

903
00:57:52,773 --> 00:57:54,340
at that house.

904
00:58:03,871 --> 00:58:05,438
He was working for me.

905
00:58:10,443 --> 00:58:12,532
I tried to warn you, dummy.

906
00:58:12,576 --> 00:58:16,405
Didn't you see the signals
on your cocktail napkins?

907
00:58:16,449 --> 00:58:18,103
Told you, they were too vague.

908
00:58:19,147 --> 00:58:20,888
I'm your yin.

909
00:58:20,932 --> 00:58:22,455
And I'm your yang.

910
00:58:36,208 --> 00:58:38,819
You faked your own suicide?

911
00:58:38,863 --> 00:58:40,865
Rachel...

912
00:58:40,908 --> 00:58:42,257
do you have any idea

913
00:58:42,301 --> 00:58:43,607
how serious this is?

914
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:44,999
I'm sorry.

915
00:58:47,088 --> 00:58:48,829
I can only imagine what I put

916
00:58:48,873 --> 00:58:50,309
you and mom through.

917
00:58:51,615 --> 00:58:52,616
How is she?

918
00:58:54,008 --> 00:58:55,444
How is she?

919
00:58:57,011 --> 00:58:59,579
Rachel, she thinks
that your dead.

920
00:58:59,623 --> 00:59:01,102
We all thought

921
00:59:01,146 --> 00:59:02,713
that you were dead.

922
00:59:02,756 --> 00:59:06,499
We had a memorial service
for you. We...

923
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:07,892
We have to call her.
We have to...

924
00:59:07,935 --> 00:59:09,937
No, this is important.

925
00:59:09,981 --> 00:59:12,984
You cannot tell mom. Not yet.

926
00:59:14,333 --> 00:59:15,987
Not until this is all finished.

927
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:18,642
You want me to wait

928
00:59:18,685 --> 00:59:21,514
to tell our mother
that you're still alive?

929
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:26,345
Do you have any idea
what you've put her through?

930
00:59:26,388 --> 00:59:28,086
Do you have any clue?

931
00:59:28,129 --> 00:59:30,044
We've been digging
through your journal

932
00:59:30,088 --> 00:59:31,437
to try to figure
this whole thing out.

933
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:32,786
There's these-these pages

934
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:34,135
that are torn out at the end...

935
00:59:34,179 --> 00:59:36,181
That's because
I ripped them out.

936
00:59:37,486 --> 00:59:39,663
I started to get paranoid
that he'd learned

937
00:59:39,706 --> 00:59:40,794
I was writing it all down.

938
00:59:40,838 --> 00:59:43,492
"He" who? Richie?

939
00:59:43,536 --> 00:59:45,277
Mickey.

940
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:47,888
It looks like her confused face.

941
00:59:47,932 --> 00:59:51,979
Why don't I pick up where
the pages left off?

942
00:59:52,023 --> 00:59:54,068
Yeah, I think
that's a good idea.

943
00:59:58,725 --> 01:00:01,162
"I never wanted to know
the truth about what Mickey

944
01:00:01,206 --> 01:00:02,990
was doing with Richie.

945
01:00:03,034 --> 01:00:05,036
But I had my suspicions
when Richie sent

946
01:00:05,079 --> 01:00:07,386
his right-hand man,
Larry, to pick me up

947
01:00:07,429 --> 01:00:11,129
and bring me over
to his after-party.

948
01:00:11,172 --> 01:00:13,479
I went along.
No questions asked.

949
01:00:13,522 --> 01:00:17,526
I played dumb, kept quiet.

950
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:20,442
I was paid a lot of money
to party with Richie.

951
01:00:21,966 --> 01:00:24,577
I'll admit it,
the money was extraordinary

952
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:27,885
and that first night
in the house,

953
01:00:27,928 --> 01:00:29,234
we...

954
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:34,413
I knew he was married

955
01:00:34,456 --> 01:00:36,763
and that I was insane

956
01:00:36,807 --> 01:00:38,809
and that it was insane.

957
01:00:38,852 --> 01:00:40,985
But there I was.

958
01:00:41,028 --> 01:00:43,596
I've never done anything
like that before.

959
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,772
Ever.

960
01:00:45,816 --> 01:00:47,513
But I kept going back.

961
01:00:52,083 --> 01:00:54,128
I kept getting paid.

962
01:00:55,173 --> 01:00:56,609
And I kept quiet.

963
01:01:02,267 --> 01:01:03,529
Even though Richie tried to keep

964
01:01:03,572 --> 01:01:05,052
what he was doing away from me

965
01:01:05,096 --> 01:01:07,054
I saw things,

966
01:01:07,098 --> 01:01:09,056
but I never asked him about it.

967
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:11,711
The money was too good."

968
01:01:11,755 --> 01:01:14,888
I had something to tell you.
What was it?

969
01:01:14,932 --> 01:01:16,498
I, uh...

970
01:01:16,542 --> 01:01:18,587
"Then one day
he told me he loved me."

971
01:01:18,631 --> 01:01:20,415
I love you.

972
01:01:20,459 --> 01:01:21,895
"And I believed him."

973
01:01:21,939 --> 01:01:24,158
I love you, too.

974
01:01:24,202 --> 01:01:25,377
"Like a fool.

975
01:01:26,247 --> 01:01:27,858
Because I did love him."

976
01:01:27,901 --> 01:01:28,859
Gentlemen...

977
01:01:32,297 --> 01:01:33,994
I was with Richie now.

978
01:01:34,038 --> 01:01:35,387
I was his girl.

979
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:37,302
I wasn't getting paid anymore

980
01:01:37,345 --> 01:01:40,435
but the parties at his house
continued.

981
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:43,221
And I kept quiet.

982
01:01:43,264 --> 01:01:44,744
Mickey kept bringing
new bottle girls

983
01:01:44,788 --> 01:01:46,746
to Richie's house.

984
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:49,531
They were lied to,
they were told

985
01:01:49,575 --> 01:01:52,143
this was the way
to a modeling career.

986
01:01:54,928 --> 01:01:58,758
Once they were in, they had
no reason to get out.

987
01:01:58,802 --> 01:02:00,673
The money was too good.

988
01:02:02,806 --> 01:02:06,070
Which is how these men were
able to get the girls high.

989
01:02:06,113 --> 01:02:08,246
Made them vulnerable.

990
01:02:08,289 --> 01:02:10,248
But still, I stayed quiet.

991
01:02:10,291 --> 01:02:12,250
I stayed quiet
even when I found out

992
01:02:12,293 --> 01:02:14,426
Lolo wasn't just a promoter.

993
01:02:14,469 --> 01:02:16,428
He had a side deal with Mickey.

994
01:02:16,471 --> 01:02:18,256
He brought girls in
from all over.

995
01:02:18,299 --> 01:02:21,128
Russia, Mexico, Ukraine.

996
01:02:21,172 --> 01:02:23,740
Mickey got them to work
as bottle girls at first.

997
01:02:23,783 --> 01:02:26,786
That kept it legit.
He promised them a better life.

998
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:28,919
But Mickey was just weeding out
the vulnerable ones.

999
01:02:28,962 --> 01:02:32,009
The desperate ones. The ones
hardest up for money.

1000
01:02:32,052 --> 01:02:34,881
Those are the ones
that he brought to the house.

1001
01:02:34,925 --> 01:02:36,143
And then we come into this house

1002
01:02:36,187 --> 01:02:37,405
and they were selecting
the girls

1003
01:02:37,449 --> 01:02:39,712
like fruit
from the grocery store.

1004
01:02:41,366 --> 01:02:43,803
They were paying him
for the girls.

1005
01:02:43,847 --> 01:02:45,370
They were paying Richie.

1006
01:02:47,589 --> 01:02:50,201
Most of them were drugged.

1007
01:02:50,244 --> 01:02:52,290
The guys didn't care.

1008
01:02:53,726 --> 01:02:56,294
God, it was disgusting.
It was so vile.

1009
01:02:57,556 --> 01:03:00,777
And this man that
I thought that I loved...

1010
01:03:02,909 --> 01:03:03,954
he was...

1011
01:03:06,391 --> 01:03:08,393
he was in charge of all of it.

1012
01:03:10,874 --> 01:03:13,528
When I finally confronted
Richie about it,

1013
01:03:13,572 --> 01:03:16,662
he lost his mind. I thought
he was going to kill me.

1014
01:03:16,705 --> 01:03:18,838
And he told me that he would
if I told anybody.

1015
01:03:18,882 --> 01:03:22,973
And then, when I told
him I was leaving him,

1016
01:03:23,016 --> 01:03:25,845
he said, "No, you're not.

1017
01:03:25,889 --> 01:03:28,282
You can't leave.
You're my girl.

1018
01:03:28,326 --> 01:03:29,762
You're not going anywhere."

1019
01:03:31,111 --> 01:03:32,765
Later that night, Larry,

1020
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:35,202
who had started feeling bad
for me pulled me aside.

1021
01:03:35,246 --> 01:03:38,379
You see, I had been journaling
everything I was seeing.

1022
01:03:38,423 --> 01:03:40,468
Everything.
And Mickey found out.

1023
01:03:40,512 --> 01:03:42,906
So, of course, he told Richie.

1024
01:03:46,039 --> 01:03:48,868
Which meant I'd become
a problem for Richie.

1025
01:03:48,912 --> 01:03:52,002
Larry warned me that Richie
was going to kill me

1026
01:03:52,045 --> 01:03:53,351
that very night.

1027
01:03:53,394 --> 01:03:55,396
He told me I had to run

1028
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:58,051
as soon as I could.

1029
01:03:58,095 --> 01:04:00,140
Of course, had Richie found
out Larry was texting me

1030
01:04:00,184 --> 01:04:02,751
all that info,
he would have killed us both.

1031
01:04:04,449 --> 01:04:05,624
I was terrified, Zoe.

1032
01:04:05,667 --> 01:04:07,278
I've never been that scared.

1033
01:04:07,321 --> 01:04:08,757
I was desperate.

1034
01:04:13,023 --> 01:04:14,676
I needed a miracle.

1035
01:04:16,504 --> 01:04:18,593
That's when I heard
somebody coming.

1036
01:04:18,637 --> 01:04:20,073
I thought it was Richie.

1037
01:04:20,117 --> 01:04:21,422
It wasn't.

1038
01:04:41,965 --> 01:04:43,314
Poor girl.

1039
01:04:44,141 --> 01:04:45,403
She overdosed.

1040
01:04:45,446 --> 01:04:47,448
It was horrible.

1041
01:04:47,492 --> 01:04:48,797
She was from Columbia, I think.

1042
01:04:48,841 --> 01:04:50,887
Died right there,
in front of me.

1043
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,114
I knew Richie
would come for me soon.

1044
01:05:01,158 --> 01:05:02,724

01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:25,041
She saved my life.

1068
01:07:27,826 --> 01:07:29,436
It's only a matter of time
before they discovered

1069
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:34,267
that that body wasn't mine.
Do dental records or something.

1070
01:07:34,311 --> 01:07:38,619
And it's like a ticking clock.
That's why I hired Vince.

1071
01:07:38,663 --> 01:07:41,361
He was one of my clients.

1072
01:07:41,405 --> 01:07:42,667
A unicorn.

1073
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:45,365
Um, I know what that is now.

1074
01:07:45,409 --> 01:07:48,629
You're some kind of
private eye investigator.

1075
01:07:48,673 --> 01:07:50,718
Uh, not "Some kind of."

1076
01:07:50,762 --> 01:07:52,633
I was doing recon at the club,

1077
01:07:52,677 --> 01:07:55,984
trying to get Rachel's
phone back from the house.

1078
01:07:56,028 --> 01:07:57,029
Rachel's phone.

1079
01:07:58,770 --> 01:08:00,293
Yeah, Larry and I
had been texting

1080
01:08:00,337 --> 01:08:01,425
those last few days.

1081
01:08:02,991 --> 01:08:05,864
And he confirmed everything
about Richie.

1082
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:15,613
Since he could track me
with the phone

1083
01:08:15,656 --> 01:08:16,962
I stashed it...

1084
01:08:19,182 --> 01:08:20,748
and ran.

1085
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:23,490
It's all the evidence we need

1086
01:08:23,534 --> 01:08:25,536
to show what
Richie's been doing.

1087
01:08:25,579 --> 01:08:26,928
Isn't it all on the cloud?

1088
01:08:26,972 --> 01:08:29,061
You don't need
the actual device?

1089
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,497
Richie got me that phone.

1090
01:08:30,541 --> 01:08:31,585
It's all in his account

1091
01:08:31,629 --> 01:08:32,847
and only a few select people

1092
01:08:32,891 --> 01:08:35,285
in a circle had that number.

1093
01:08:35,328 --> 01:08:36,851
Larry was one of them.

1094
01:08:36,895 --> 01:08:38,549
Which is how Richie found out

1095
01:08:38,592 --> 01:08:40,464
Larry was talking
to you and your mom

1096
01:08:40,507 --> 01:08:44,032
and Rachel, he read the texts.

1097
01:08:44,076 --> 01:08:47,166
So then, Richie really did
kill Larry.

1098
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:49,560
Actually, it was his goon
that killed Larry.

1099
01:08:49,603 --> 01:08:51,518
Held his head under water.

1100
01:08:51,562 --> 01:08:53,477
Richie just watched.

1101
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:56,871
Zoe, we have to get
that phone back.

1102
01:08:56,915 --> 01:08:59,135
It's what we need

1103
01:08:59,178 --> 01:09:00,440
to take them down

1104
01:09:00,484 --> 01:09:01,789
Yes, it does.

1105
01:09:01,833 --> 01:09:03,269
I just worked my way
in the house last night

1106
01:09:03,313 --> 01:09:05,880
to get it, when you showed up
to take a dip.

1107
01:09:05,924 --> 01:09:09,884
So, I have to break
in there, tonight.

1108
01:09:09,928 --> 01:09:12,060
Oh, my God, this is...

1109
01:09:12,104 --> 01:09:14,062
Wow, this... I'm sorry,
but this is

1110
01:09:14,106 --> 01:09:16,326
such a Michael Connelly story.

1111
01:09:16,369 --> 01:09:17,544
- Uh...
- Who?

1112
01:09:17,588 --> 01:09:19,198
Michael Connelly, the...

1113
01:09:19,242 --> 01:09:20,808
the crime novels
that I've been sending you

1114
01:09:20,852 --> 01:09:22,375
that you haven't been reading.

1115
01:09:22,419 --> 01:09:26,510
Sorry, I've been busy
in Atlanta's seedy underworld.

1116
01:09:26,553 --> 01:09:30,383
Right, okay. So then,
what's the plan?

1117
01:09:30,427 --> 01:09:33,038
What... When are we
gonna head to his house?

1118
01:09:33,908 --> 01:09:35,345
- We?
- What?

1119
01:09:35,388 --> 01:09:38,304
You-you thought
you were gonna do this alone?

1120
01:09:38,348 --> 01:09:40,045
- Yeah.
- Come on.

1121
01:09:40,088 --> 01:09:41,394
You've been to Richie's house.

1122
01:09:41,438 --> 01:09:43,091
It's like a, a hexagon, uhh..

1123
01:09:43,135 --> 01:09:44,702
And there's, you know,
the rooms.

1124
01:09:44,745 --> 01:09:45,920
You're never
gonna be able to find

1125
01:09:45,964 --> 01:09:47,748
his bedroom without wasting time

1126
01:09:47,792 --> 01:09:49,663
and you're gonna
risk getting caught.

1127
01:09:49,707 --> 01:09:50,969
I mean, Rachel,
I mean, she knows

1128
01:09:51,012 --> 01:09:53,406
where Richie's bedroom is,
but she's dead.

1129
01:09:53,450 --> 01:09:55,365
So that just leaves me.

1130
01:09:55,408 --> 01:09:57,018
They think you're dead, too.

1131
01:09:58,281 --> 01:10:00,718
I'm really sorry,
I'm not like you.

1132
01:10:03,329 --> 01:10:04,896
I'm going with you.

1133
01:10:11,337 --> 01:10:12,643
Mom?

1134
01:10:29,790 --> 01:10:31,227
Mom.

1135
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:32,837
Zoe.

1136
01:10:34,317 --> 01:10:35,970
Oh, thank God.

1137
01:10:36,710 --> 01:10:37,885
Oh.

1138
01:10:40,148 --> 01:10:42,107
I had the worst dream.

1139
01:10:42,150 --> 01:10:44,805
I thought you left me all alone.

1140
01:10:44,849 --> 01:10:47,721
Mom, I'm, I'm here. It's okay.

1141
01:10:47,765 --> 01:10:51,072
I'm sorry.

1142
01:10:51,116 --> 01:10:53,771
I'm just so scared
I'm gonna lose you, too.

1143
01:10:53,814 --> 01:10:56,948
You're not. Mom, you're not
gonna lose me.

1144
01:10:58,689 --> 01:11:00,343
And I never should have left.

1145
01:11:00,386 --> 01:11:03,433
I never should've left
you and Rachel and I'm sorry.

1146
01:11:03,476 --> 01:11:05,609
Oh, no. Shh. That was my fault.

1147
01:11:05,652 --> 01:11:07,741
I was unhappy
and I took it out on you

1148
01:11:07,785 --> 01:11:09,830
and that's just not fair.

1149
01:11:11,789 --> 01:11:14,052
I think that we're all
gonna be okay.

1150
01:11:15,488 --> 01:11:16,707
I do.

1151
01:11:23,061 --> 01:11:24,323
Try and stay quiet.

1152
01:11:24,367 --> 01:11:25,672
Last night,
I left the back door open.

1153
01:11:25,716 --> 01:11:27,195
Get in, get the phone, get out.

1154
01:11:27,239 --> 01:11:29,285
Yeah, I know, I know.
I got it.

1155
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:33,941
Shh!
Just find the phone.

1156
01:11:33,985 --> 01:11:36,509
Okay, here.
This is Richie's bedroom.

1157
01:11:36,553 --> 01:11:38,294
Okay, Rachel said
it was behind the bed.

1158
01:11:38,337 --> 01:11:41,471
I'm gonna look
under the mattress. Here.

1159
01:11:41,514 --> 01:11:43,037
You start with
the master bedroom.

1160
01:11:43,081 --> 01:11:44,996
It's just down the hall
to the right.

1161
01:11:45,039 --> 01:11:46,911
Hurry it up, please.

1162
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:12,284
I was wondering until
you're done...

1163
01:12:16,723 --> 01:12:18,508
Where'd you find this?

1164
01:12:18,551 --> 01:12:21,467
♪ ♪

1165
01:13:00,637 --> 01:13:02,769
- Had we not gone to you...
- You knew there was a chance...

1166
01:13:02,813 --> 01:13:04,118
that the phone
wouldn't be there,

1167
01:13:04,162 --> 01:13:05,250
that they would've
already taken it.

1168
01:13:05,293 --> 01:13:06,382
That's why there was a plan B.

1169
01:13:06,425 --> 01:13:07,948
- You knew that.
- Plan B sucks.

1170
01:13:07,992 --> 01:13:10,777
Wait, whoa, what's plan B?

1171
01:13:10,821 --> 01:13:11,996
You might as well tell her,
I mean,

1172
01:13:12,039 --> 01:13:13,998
she's obviously
part of the team now.

1173
01:13:15,347 --> 01:13:16,783
Percy is plan B.

1174
01:13:16,827 --> 01:13:19,699
Percy? P-Percy,
the owner of the club?

1175
01:13:19,743 --> 01:13:22,223
She has no idea what
Mickey's up to.

1176
01:13:24,008 --> 01:13:25,444
And Percy would never
get mixed up

1177
01:13:25,488 --> 01:13:28,447
in something like that,
and she's worked too hard

1178
01:13:28,491 --> 01:13:29,579
to make that club her own.

1179
01:13:29,622 --> 01:13:31,189
Yes, but she's
not gonna believe me.

1180
01:13:31,232 --> 01:13:32,886
She has no reason to.

1181
01:13:32,930 --> 01:13:34,497
Right. So that's why
that plan sucks. Okay.

1182
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:35,976
Oh, no, that's not why it sucks.

1183
01:13:36,020 --> 01:13:37,891
Well, guess what?
She will believe her if...

1184
01:13:37,935 --> 01:13:40,981
If we can get our hands
on Mickey's ledger.

1185
01:13:41,025 --> 01:13:44,071
He records notes, names,

1186
01:13:44,115 --> 01:13:45,856
all his business dealings
in there.

1187
01:13:45,899 --> 01:13:47,466
And it's enough information
to put him

1188
01:13:47,510 --> 01:13:48,641
and Richie away for life.

1189
01:13:48,685 --> 01:13:50,469
And that's why plan B sucks.

1190
01:13:50,513 --> 01:13:52,993
Wait, I don't know why, why does
that suck? That doesn't suck.

1191
01:13:53,037 --> 01:13:55,126
That's a classic
crime novel McGuffin.

1192
01:13:55,169 --> 01:13:56,475
A ledger with
all the incriminating evidence?

1193
01:13:56,519 --> 01:13:58,216
- I mean, come on!
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1194
01:13:58,259 --> 01:13:59,609
Except this isn't like some
novel of you download

1195
01:13:59,652 --> 01:14:01,132
on your Kindle to read
during your summer break

1196
01:14:01,175 --> 01:14:02,655
from your real job as a teacher.

1197
01:14:02,699 --> 01:14:04,614
Easy, Vince.

1198
01:14:04,657 --> 01:14:06,267
Easy? You want me...

1199
01:14:06,311 --> 01:14:08,182
You want me
to take it easy, Rachel?

1200
01:14:08,226 --> 01:14:09,749
Mickey's not gonna just
hand us the ledger,

1201
01:14:09,793 --> 01:14:11,664
which means we have
to physically take it from him.

1202
01:14:11,708 --> 01:14:13,710
Hence, plan B sucks.

1203
01:14:13,753 --> 01:14:16,974
What is your problem? Seriously!

1204
01:14:17,017 --> 01:14:18,976
I-I don't know
why you're doing this.

1205
01:14:19,019 --> 01:14:20,456
I know why we're doing this,
but I don't know

1206
01:14:20,499 --> 01:14:22,022
why you're doing this, and if
you have some kind

1207
01:14:22,066 --> 01:14:24,329
of problem just go, okay?
We got this.

1208
01:14:24,372 --> 01:14:26,766
- This is personal for us.
- Zoey...

1209
01:14:26,810 --> 01:14:30,901
Vincent's sister got wrapped up
in this world last year.

1210
01:14:30,944 --> 01:14:33,338
Different club.

1211
01:14:33,381 --> 01:14:38,038
She got involved with the wrong
guys, then ended up for sale.

1212
01:14:38,082 --> 01:14:39,866
He hadn't heard from her
in a while so

1213
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:42,782
he went to her apartment and...

1214
01:14:42,826 --> 01:14:45,132
found her body,
she had overdosed.

1215
01:14:50,311 --> 01:14:53,532
So, um, this is personal
for me, too.

1216
01:14:55,665 --> 01:15:00,278
So, are we good?
Are we, uh, gonna do this?

1217
01:15:01,105 --> 01:15:02,193
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

1218
01:15:02,236 --> 01:15:04,630
So, what we do know is

1219
01:15:04,674 --> 01:15:06,893
Mickey never parts ways
with that ledger.

1220
01:15:06,937 --> 01:15:08,895
So, that's a good thing
because then we always know

1221
01:15:08,939 --> 01:15:10,288
where it is at all times.

1222
01:15:10,331 --> 01:15:11,942
And if we can pull this off
tonight

1223
01:15:11,985 --> 01:15:13,291
it would be a two-fer.

1224
01:15:13,334 --> 01:15:15,249
Richie's at the club on Fridays.

1225
01:15:15,293 --> 01:15:17,251
We can take them
both down tonight.

1226
01:15:17,295 --> 01:15:19,776
Yeah, the tricky part's going
to be getting into the club.
