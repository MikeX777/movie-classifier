1
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,331
I remember the day
I defended my thesis.

2
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,126
It was late June.
Genoa was sweltering.

3
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,927
But the board was captivated
by what I was saying.

4
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,645
Genoa lost again.

5
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,602
As always.

6
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,170
My whole family was there

7
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,725
My dad, Michele Vernia,

8
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,684
marshal with the Tax Police,

9
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,803
born down south near Bari.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,968
He'd been waiting for this day.

11
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,687
Aunt Vittoria, his sister,
who raised me like a mother.

12
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,927
And this

13
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,688
This...

14
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,640
is Uncle Duilio.

15
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,525
A true Genoan,
a real bundle of energy.

16
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,611
They won't make him read meters?

17
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,723
Does an engineer read meters?!

18
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,800
My thesis had
fascinated everyone.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,048
They were all struck by it.

20
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,203
What's up?

21
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,561
Congratulations!

22
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,250
It's been a long time

23
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,967
since we heard
such a finely argued defense.

24
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,767
I hereby award you a master's
in electronic engineering,

25
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,206
accompanied by the academic kiss.

26
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,081
- Please, don't bother.
- No...

27
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,482
I insist. You deserve it.

28
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,481
Regards to the Marshal.

29
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,607
I'd heard those words before.

30
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,691
That watch...

31
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,764
I'd seen it before too.

32
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,846
Put these fakes in the van
and have them destroyed.

33
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,044
Corporal, you can go.
I'll see to this.

34
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,730
We can handle it, sir.

35
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,442
Corporal, I gave you an order!

36
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,881
I said I'll see to it.
Is that clear?

37
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,842
The body of Christ.

38
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,202
Father, I never went to catechism.

39
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,451
That's OK, you'll do it later.

40
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,801
Regards to the Marshal.

41
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,689
Regards to the Marshal.

42
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,321
Vernia...

43
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,165
You're in a real fix.

44
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,247
Me?

45
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,565
With your degenerative
chronic asthma...

46
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,046
I don't have asthma!

47
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,766
You do. You're unfit for service.

48
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,770
Regards to the Marshal.

49
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,130
Enough with the watches, Dad!
It's corruption!

50
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,410
Calm down, young man.

51
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,241
It would be if they were real
but since they're fake...

52
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,885
it's a polite gesture.

53
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,842
Auntie?

54
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,405
Call it added value.

55
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,206
Enough of your tax shoptalk, OK!

56
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,164
Where's your brother Jonny?

57
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,766
The only one missing.

58
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,610
Yo, bros, where's the can?

59
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,928
- Upstairs!
- Thanks, bro.

60
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,681
My brother is kind of special.

61
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,247
He's always been crazy about music.

62
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,767
We could never figure out why.

63
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,002
With age, it's gotten worse.

64
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,322
- What're you drinking?
- Soda pop.

65
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,965
Can I have soda pop?

66
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,601
He was such a fan of John Travolta,

67
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,610
we all started calling him Jonny.

68
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,006
YOU'RE AWESOME, BRO!

69
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,608
Milan! The New York of Italy.

70
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,009
Where a graduate
makes his dreams come true.

71
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,488
Milan never sleeps.
Milan has jobs for everyone!

72
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,842
Thanks, but we're not hiring.

73
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,086
Thanks, but we're not hiring.

74
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,770
OK. Goodbye.

75
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,642
Thanks, but you're not hiring.

76
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,807
Goodbye.

77
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,926
But, in Milan, a highly qualified
electronic engineer

78
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,646
always ends up with a top-notch job.

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,161
I'm the printer guy.

80
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,409
Follow me, I'll show you.

81
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,841
How do we sell this alarm clock?
Take my breath away.

82
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,409
We have some really original ideas.

83
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,886
The printer guy...

84
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,003
That's the third one so far.

85
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,123
One that works would be nice.

86
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,165
- Yes, sir.
- Where were we?

87
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,206
We have some pretty original ideas,

88
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,845
pretty effective ones...

89
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,686
Here's the first.

90
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,765
His is the first.

91
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,966
"Wake up, guys!"

92
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,643
Shit happens...
Let's hear the other genius.

93
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,929
"It's time for the future!"

94
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,481
You think I'm dumb?

95
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,160
I knew it

96
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,242
He knew it!

97
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,046
- What's so funny?
- It's nothing serious.

98
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,007
The paper's blocked.
You don't need a technician.

99
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,050
OK, genius,
since you're such hot stuff,

100
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,480
give us your idea.

101
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,243
- Me?
- Yes, you.

102
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,526
When he set the alarm clock,
my dad always said,

103
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,202
"Being first is a matter of seconds."

104
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,602
Being first is a matter of seconds...

105
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,571
- That's beautiful!
- Really beautiful.

106
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,969
You guys won't even understand
in 20 years.

107
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,525
He's good, huh?

108
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,205
Really good!

109
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,045
Some time later

110
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,724
- Hello?
- Giovanni?

111
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,081
Who is it?

112
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,402
Who do you think? Your father!

113
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,042
Dad, what's up? It's 6:30 AM

114
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,925
Were you sleeping?

115
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,326
No, I wasn’t.

116
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,320
You're getting sloppy in Milan, son,
sleeping so late!

117
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,090
Listen to your dad.

118
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,363
I'm trying
to get your layabout brother hired.

119
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,725
I asked a friend,

120
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,763
Marshal Vincenzo Di Prima,

121
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,406
to get him into the Tax Police.

122
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,250
You remember Di Prima?

123
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,411
Sure, we played with his son as kids.

124
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,731
What's that music?

125
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,689
What?

126
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,611
You play music
while talking to your dad?!

127
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,841
Anyhow, as I was saying,
Marshal Di Prima pulled strings

128
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,601
and got him through the written exam.

129
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,325
Now he has the oral.

130
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,169
Do I care?

131
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,562
You should.

132
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,120
Your brother's oral

133
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,168
is in Milan.

134
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,242
No, Dad.

135
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,324
Can't we sleep around here?

136
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,681
You can't do this!

137
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,521
I can. You only need to put him up
for a week.

138
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,562
But when?

139
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,127
Who knows? Your brother's unpredictable.
Like the IRS.

140
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,766
Aren't you getting the entry phone?

141
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,929
Enough!

142
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,929
- Who is it?
- Tax Police!

143
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,807
Come up, jerk!

144
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,850
He just got there!
Be nice to him

145
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,201
I'm wasting my breath!

146
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,209
OK, Dad, I have to go.

147
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,484
Remember, I only want good news.

148
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,320
What's this racket?

149
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,364
There, that's settled.

150
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,527
Who is it?

151
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,841
Federica... My brother.

152
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,171
Hey, sister!

153
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,641
Number one, bro!

154
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,042
Who's this?

155
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,123
My girlfriend, Federica.

156
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,728
Awesome...

157
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,369
- Thanks.
- No, the fish pool.

158
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,927
- You like fish?
- Yeah, it's wild when they roar!

159
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,561
They're my babies.

160
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,447
Hungry? I'll get you breakfast.

161
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,246
Be good now.

162
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,680
Francesca's nuts.

163
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,729
Federica.

164
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,166
Same difference.

165
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,691
I'll get your food.

166
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,608
OK, I need breakfast, bro.

167
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,920
Why didn't you warn me?

168
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,442
He turned up unannounced
if you didn't notice.

169
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,605
You're really alike.

170
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,251
We're twins. Know what twins are?
Two identical people.

171
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,761
Yeah, but he's nice.

172
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,561
Got any soda pop?

173
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,250
Wild pizza!

174
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,927
Mr. Berman, you have a great product.

175
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,567
As sales director,
after talking to our chairman...

176
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,206
Her dad.

177
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,483
...We've decided to give
the full campaign

178
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,806
to our very own

179
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,766
Giovanni Vernia.

180
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,126
Her boyfriend.

181
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,163
OK, I've made fantastic pizza.

182
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,681
You make fantastic slogan.

183
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,641
Now try Crazy Pizza.

184
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,251
I already ate.

185
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,204
- Try Crazy Pizza!
- I'm OK.

186
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,287
Eat Crazy Pizza!

187
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,767
I know it's good. After lunch maybe

188
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,042
- You eat.
- Eat it, Giovanni.

189
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,003
I'm eating.

190
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,921
Yes, it must be really good because...

191
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,600
Salami and candy, a heavenly match.

192
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,530
We'll soon find a slogan.

193
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,249
They'll go crazy in Naples!
They'll be fighting over it!

194
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,767
Come on...

195
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,363
"Teliot" ---

196
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,211
Lorylipsum,

197
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,961
the new show from DJ TV
that uses the Net's top videos

198
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,369
and makes them into stories
by Matteo Curti.

199
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,811
Lorylipsum, every day at 8 PM

200
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,445
on DJ TV.

201
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,890
Hi, bros.

202
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,649
Whatcha lookin' at?

203
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,125
You guys still hungry? OK, I get it.

204
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,130
Uncle Jonny'll get your chow

205
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,525
Not Auntie Francesca's stuff.

206
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,530
This is way better.

207
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,565
Let's see what records they have

208
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,923
Dyer Straights, Boot Springstring,
Zucchero,

209
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,685
Roby Williams,

210
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,451
Frank Sinatra...

211
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,851
Maybe this one...

212
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,608
Guanito Mirabal, sabor DE Cuba...

213
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,368
Latin American... Disgustin'!
Get it off a me!

214
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,207
It's Albertino. Meet me tonight

215
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,768
at Milan's legendary Gilez club
for a wild party!

216
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,850
If you're into house music, be there!

217
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,611
Right on, bro, thanks for the invite.

218
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,607
Little bros, whassup with you?

219
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,923
You don't dig the cereal?

220
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,842
Breathe, little bros, breathe.

221
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,446
1001,1002,100s...

222
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,769
1001,1002,100s...

223
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,284
1001,1002,100s...

224
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,130
They're not breathin'!

225
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,361
Common...

226
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,247
Mega-bummer!

227
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,370
Sparkling or still?

228
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,561
Slightly sparkling,

229
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,650
in a closed bottle unlike usual.

230
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,927
I was wondering...
This seafood salad, what's in it?

231
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,687
Seafood. Octopus, calamari, tuna...

232
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,564
Fresh tuna or...

233
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,807
Fresh from the sea.

234
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,408
Caught in Maratea this morning.

235
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,251
South of Naples?
And it's here already?

236
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,291
It ?ew straight from the driftnet

237
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,050
Sorry, but Europe has banned
the use of driftnets.

238
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,770
Europe isn't Maratea.

239
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,645
They do what they want down there

240
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,641
Fuck them

241
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,490
- Good one, Peppi.
- Thanks, Toni.

242
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,847
OK, one seafood salad
that does what it wants!

243
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,011
Right on!

244
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,446
Four seafood salads, four coffees,
one slightly sparkling water...

245
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,531
Wow... "Propaedeutics
of Perceptive Psychology

246
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,604
- Who studies that?
- I do.

247
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,004
It's called psychology.

248
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,569
48 euros.

249
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,410
48 euros?!

250
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,251
That's including the tuna's ?ight?

251
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,850
You're so beautiful.
You know I'm crazy about you?

252
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,044
You bet, when a guy
acts as dumb as you do.

253
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,607
I act dumb but I'm a nice guy.

254
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,089
Just kidding.

255
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:10,962
I know.

256
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,047
See you around maybe...

257
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,407
- He's had his eye on you a while
- Who, Camilla?

258
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,003
Him. He likes you. I know men.

259
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,851
Even if it were true, it's a bad time.

260
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:31,929
Come dancing tonight.

261
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,169
No, not tonight,
I have to study for an exam.

262
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,604
Always studying!
Live la vida local

263
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,326
You're so silly.

264
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,967
Get back in here
before you frighten the customers!

265
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,608
Says Mr. Dreamboat...

266
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,570
That's more great news from Radio DJ.

267
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,929
Back with the non-stop beat
after the break!

268
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,811
Great number, huh?

269
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,606
Excellent. Fresh and lively...

270
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,645
What's that noise?

271
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,802
Hiya, Al! You're awesome!

272
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,081
Thanks for the invite!

273
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,410
I'll be there tonight!
You're the best!

274
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,803
Thanks.

275
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,124
See you, bro.

276
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,842
Ginger, call security
There's a madman outside.

277
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,121
This year's designs...
I really don't like them much.

278
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,927
Have you seen this, countess?
Rania of Jordan wears it.

279
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,727
No good then.

280
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,205
Maybe an animal print?

281
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,250
Let's see. This is cute.

282
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,446
Won't it broaden my hips?

283
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,687
Absolutely not.

284
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,281
All right, let's try it. Come.

285
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,847
Beautiful. How much, bro?

286
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,611
- 3,500 euros.
- Ugly, ugly.

287
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,520
Awesome!

288
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,120
Can I try them on?

289
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,048
Sure.

290
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,207
The sitting room?

291
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,564
The fitting room's to the right.

292
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,527
That way!

293
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,960
Thanks, bro.

294
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,006
Sold!

295
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,121
Where have the boys gone?
Call them for me.

296
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,723
Bros, get in here!

297
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,285
The old dame wants you!

298
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,442
Shit job, bro.

299
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,604
- The ball!
- Got it, bros!

300
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,925
Little bros...

301
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,648
Right on!

302
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,689
Passin' you...

303
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,847
Passin' you...

304
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,806
Passed you.

305
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,368
Hi, Jonny.

306
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,966
Where are you going?

307
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,770
Dancin' at Gilez, bro.

308
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,850
Sorry, feet off the table, please.
Thank you.

309
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,321
I couldn't find any soda pop...

310
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,682
but I got lots of goodies.

311
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,010
But first

312
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,844
let's feed the ?shies!

313
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,648
Common, let's feed the fishes.

314
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,285
Don't be silly.

315
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,448
I know you love feeding the

316
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,081
That's a duck!

317
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,042
I know.

318
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,163
Where did you put the fish?

319
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,088
Giovanni!

320
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,930
I'll find them.

321
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,044
Come on, calm down. I'm here.

322
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,366
Don't touch me!

323
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,321
We can work this out.

324
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,284
Just shut up!

325
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,606
DIDN’T MEAN TWO!

326
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,925
Comin' to Gilez?

327
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,201
Get rid of him!

328
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,450
Common, bro, it's late.

329
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,650
OK, let's go.

330
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,527
You're awesome.

331
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,571
Darling, I'll take him and come back.

332
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,250
Fuck off!

333
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,208
Isn't this place wild, bro?

334
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,888
We're gonna have a blast here.

335
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,881
Excuse me...

336
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:30,888
For parking?

337
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,321
Leave keys in car. I see to it.

338
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,602
- It's double-parked!
- No prob.

339
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,724
See you inside.
I'll wait in the line.

340
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,005
- How much?
- 10 euros.

341
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,123
10? I only have a 20.

I give you your change later.
Have fun.

343
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,288
Bro, whatcha you doin'?

344
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,847
Leave the jacket or pay the cloakroom.

345
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,251
You're right.
Just a second... May I?

346
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,846
What a loser...

347
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,930
Goin' clubbin' with a jacket on.

348
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,600
Sony, bro.

349
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,851

Scuse me, I have an invite

00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,407
Excuse me, I have an invitation.
But I can wait too.

00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,529
- You?
- I have to go in

355
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,131
Invitation only.

356
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,129
- So I can't go in?
- No!

357
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,209
I don't get it, bro.

358
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,767
Who are you?

359
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,531
What's up? You grabbed my hand!

360
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,767
Stand aside!

- Three.

364
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,446
Who's with you?

Go on in.

366
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,604
It's invitation only, OK.
Do you have one?

367
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:58,843
Yeah.

368
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,441
- Who invited you?
- DJ Albertino.

369
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,000
Get outta here.

370
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,366
I came to Gilez for this.

371
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,040
Albertino will be mad not to see me.

372
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,561
He won't be happy. I know him, see.

373
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,446
Jonny?

374
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:16,889
Jonny me?

375
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,688
You know me?

376
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,850
Yes, come on
or we'll get into trouble.

377
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,521
I don't believe this. Jonny...
How are you?

378
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,210
Ace. But who are you?

379
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,087
You remember

380
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,848
your friend Ugo from Genoa,
the Marshal's son?

381
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,921
Sure, but it's ages since I saw him.

382
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,690
Awesome! Where is he?

383
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,524
Look at me carefully.
Who do you think I am?

384
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,922
Ugo's gin!
Awesome! I met Ugo's gin!

385
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,201
Awesome!

386
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,289
Priscilla, Raffaella... Jonny.

387
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,051
Hi, sisters. Hey, is Ugo here too?

388
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,320
More or less.

389
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,448
What's so funny?

390
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,762
Ignore them, they're idiots!

391
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,607
OK, sisters, I'm goin' dancin'.
Tell Ugo.

392
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,123
I dance house,
not that commercial stuff,

393
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,322
not even if they roast me...

394
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,602
or toast me.

395
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,767
I don't do it.

396
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,371
House is this way.

397
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,528
- Thanks, sister.
- See you later.

398
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,291
Awesome, Ugo's gin. Who'd believe it?

399
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,847
I come to Milan in Tuscany and meet her!

400
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,801
Common, guys, let's go.
Dance with Chico!

401
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,847
We won't let you out until 6 AM

402
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,681
Gilez, Italy's sexiest club!

403
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,811
Al, here I am!
I'll look round and come back!

404
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,365
You're the best!

405
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,246
Who's that idiot following me around?

406
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,287
Hi. One.

407
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:27,802
Fifty-

408
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,601
Fifty euros? Who's playing, U2?

409
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,526
Damn, I left my wallet in the car.

410
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,166
It's in my jacket, see, in the car.

411
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,840
The valet has the keys.
Can you call him?

412
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,486
Over your earpiece maybe?

413
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,211
Fran chino

414
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,847
Have we ever had valet parking?

415
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,761
Excuse me!

416
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,166
They stole my car!

417
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,011
Lucky you, I never had one

418
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,841
Let's make the night last forever
at Gilezl

419
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,765
Kevin Pasquanelli
from "Guys and Babes"

420
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,369
You're awesome, bro!
Can I take a photo?

421
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,124
Stand up, dude!

422
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,049
Step to the side.

423
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,651
Thanks, bro, that chair's a blast!

424
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,171
Let's see your hands in the air,

425
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,691
Gilezl

426
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,767
OK, girls!

427
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,928
High, low...

428
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,646
middle and down the hatch!

429
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,365
We go with the first guy we see!

430
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,927
The Latin American room
is full of hunks.

431
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,607
- See my blackheads?
- No, you're good.

432
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,684
Alice! Come on.

433
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,123
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Gilezl

434
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,610
On the tables tonight,

435
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,848
DJ Albertino!

436
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,206
Only here at Gilezl

437
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,007
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to house heaven!

438
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,844
This is house heaven!

439
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,328
And who's at the heart of it?

440
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,366
We are, we are, we are heaven!

441
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,128
Let's go!

442
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,926
That guy's wild.

443
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,966
- What's your name, genius?
- Jonny.

444
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,288
You're wild, Jonny.

445
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,840
He's hot stuff

446
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,446
We are, we are, we are heaven!

447
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,131
We are...

448
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,847
Signor Silvano, why isn't the emcee
announcing me?

449
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,008
Sony, but why should she?

450
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,282
I need to say hi to my fans!

451
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,927
What fans? You have fans?

452
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,521
But I brought my throne from home.

453
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,371
- You're Pasquinelli, right?
- Right.

454
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,210
You see that guy?

455
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,448
He's setting the place on fire
and he paid to get in.

456
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,008
You want 5 grand
but no one gives a shit about you!

457
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,521
Pisquonelli, go fuck yourself!

458
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,768
Just go sit on your throne.

459
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,041
- Had a good time?
- No, Fede...

460
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,527
I guess so, you're home so late.

461
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,245
It's your brother's fault.

462
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,967
After everything that's happened
you should be ashamed.

463
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,970
You could at least
say something sweet.

464
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,284
They stole your car.

465
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,728
I can't stand you two any more!

466
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,845
- I'll take the couch?
- Yes!

467
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,406
Awesome!

468
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,726
Hey, sister, this is the man's room.

469
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:02,447
Since you don't understand,
I'll make you understand.

470
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,608
You really don't recognize me?

471
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,128
- I'm Ugo!
- Ugo?

472
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,243
Ugo, Marshal Di Prima's son.

473
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,966
I used to come over
to play with Barbies.

474
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,131
The wooden puppet with the long nose!

475
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,731
I always lost.

476
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:22,042
Ugo... Who'd've believed it?!

477
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,208
You've changed massive!

478
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,004
- You're hot now.
- Really?

479
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,329
The dental braces
never suited you, bro.

480
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,605
You're still the same.
It's great to see you again.

481
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,365
Don't trust this guy.

482
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,803
First he takes your hand,
then he dumps you.

483
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,125
Your go-go guy's here.

484
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,802
Good luck.

485
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:50,963
A croissant.

486
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,209
- Cream or chocolate?
- Chocolate.

487
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,722
"We are, we are..."

488
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,046
I'd never have guessed.

489
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,089
What?

490
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,560
You always seem so conventional but...

491
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:05,929
But?

492
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,569
Don't play dumb.
We waved to each other last night.

493
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,167
- Last night?
- At Gilez.

494
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,965
Gilez, right!
Yes, I was at Gilez last night.

495
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,128
So hows it go, Jonny?

496
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,643
"We are, we are..."

497
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,528
There's a mistake.

498
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,289
You were the only good thing
the whole evening.

499
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,090
Tell her the truth

500
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,124
or you're a worm.

501
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,244
Sorry, you talked about a mistake?

502
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,365
A mistake

503
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,042
in the hand movements.

504
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,210
In the dance you're doing,

505
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,924
the hands go like this.

506
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,290
Like this, see.

507
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,767
That's it.

508
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,530
The cow-print pants...

509
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,960
Where did you get them?

510
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,965
Where did I get them?

511
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,646
Good question.

512
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,491
Where did I get those pants?

513
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,884
Where did I get them?

514
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,646
How should I know?

515
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,531
But why talk about the place?

516
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,644
What remains
isn't the memory of a place.

517
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,241
What remains are the scents,

518
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,805
the atmospheres,

519
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,481
the emotions.

520
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,167
I remember

521
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,405
the horses, galloping horses,
the dust

522
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,961
and that little kitten

523
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,001
mewing on a myrtle branch

524
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,843
and I knew then and there

525
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,487
that the little girl's dad
wasn't her dad.

526
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,287
Imagine...

527
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,006
the drama of such emotions...

528
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,283
Imagine the feelings
that I experienced...

529
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:51,770
We don't understand a damn word
and we have work to do.

530
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,881
I thought of something like,
"Crazy Pizza...

531
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,970
"Take a bite of America."

532
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,686
But I didn't like it.

533
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,486
Thank God.

534
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,721
Instead, I'd go for something like...

535
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:19,290
But not "do it", "do eat".
Get it?

536
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,641
Is there a problem?

537
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,322
No, the paper tray's jammed.

538
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,682
In that case, if it's jammed...

539
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,649
- You take your case...
- It's OK.

540
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,571
Off you go. The door's that way.

541
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,205
Goodbye, thank you.

542
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,042
All right.

543
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,009
Where was I?

544
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,811
You were at "eat".

545
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,922
Eat...

546
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,651
Dad lent us his car.
Sweet, isn't he?

547
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,810
Yes, really sweet, as usual.

548
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,931
- Shit!
- Giovanni, I was thinking...

549
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,724
- Where are you?
- Here.

550
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,524
- What's wrong?
- Shit, this is a beautiful door.

551
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,926
- It is?
- You bet.

552
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,805
I already have a headache,
so out it out.

553
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,486
- Let's go.
- Now'?

554
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,727
When else?

555
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,810
Where's the handle?

556
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,448
Look, interior carpeting!

557
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,962
Of course, it's a car.

558
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,729
Your cell's ringing

559
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,361
Answer it.

560
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,125
"Blocked number".
Blocked numbers are a drag.

561
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,802
Why? I always use a blocked number.
Answer it.

562
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,728
- Hello?
- Tax Police.

563
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,605
Jonny, out the crap.

564
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,009
Hi, bro!
I'm goin' back to Gilez tonight.

565
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,170
I'm in love.
Come too and I'll introduce you.

566
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,850
No, not tonight.

567
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,283
I want to stay in tonight and relax.

568
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,802
I'm tired, OK.

569
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,962
He hung up.

570
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,288
So you're staying in tonight?

571
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,486
To relax.

572
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,086
What day is it?

573
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,487
- What day is it?
- Wednesday.

574
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,211
Cuban music is emotion, vibration,

575
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,410
feeling...

576
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,001
Live it to the full.

577
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,051
Like life itself.

578
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,406
Sure he's Cuban?

579
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,525
- Totally Cuban.
- Yeah?

580
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,121
Something bothering you, Jovani?

581
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,400
No, this is fun.

582
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,322
Come on then! Butt tight...

583
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,041
And your eyes in your nice's eyes

584
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,486
to pass the heat on to her.

585
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,291
I'll pass that on, thanks.

586
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,451
Watch the moves, OK,
I have my eye on you!

587
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,610
Don't let me down!

588
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,964
Cute!

589
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,721
'Scuse me, I'm way up the list!

590
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:00,809
Hi, sister!

591
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,810
Hi, Jonny!

592
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,490
Jonny, hi!

593
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,730
The phenomenon's back!

594
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,131
Jonny, getup here!

595
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,129
People, Jenny's back!

596
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,369
All together now...
We are, we are...

597
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,491
And now it's time to listen
to my master,

598
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,724
Guanito Mirabal.

599
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,529
You have the record I lent you?

600
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,687
Paquito has it.

601
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,287
Put it on, Paquito.

602
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,601
- Ain't workin'.
- Plug it in!

603
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,771
Wow, that's central Havana dialect.

604
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,489
Look.

605
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,131
Guanito's record...

606
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,124
What's the problem?

607
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,090
What the fuck?

608
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,761
Thanks, bros!

609
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,644
I've worked in a lot of clubs
in Rome,

610
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,763
Ibiza, London...

611
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,009
- Bravo, you're something else.
- Thanks.

612
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,804
- What's your name?
- Jonny.

613
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,684
Good, Jimmy, I like you.

614
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,370
- Want a drink?
- Please.

615
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,210
What? Jack'n'lemon?

616
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,368
No thanks.

617
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,768
- A Mautau?
- I don't drink that.

618
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,882
Sky'n'water?

619
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,282
A goulash?

620
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,170
Who drinks goulash?

621
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,407
- Have a drink. Whatsit it be?
- Soda pop.

622
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,249
Soda POP?

623
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,761
Like Tony Manero.

624
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:48,010
Two soda pops.
One for him, one for his friend Tony.

625
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,090
Remember, this place is your home now,

626
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,361
tu casa, mi casa.

627
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,562
Do what you want. Come dance

628
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,524
have fun, you, everyone.

629
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,007
Silvano, we don't have any soda pop.

630
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,326
So find some.

631
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,885
Where, at this hour?

632
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:05,289
How should I know.
You get it, it's your job!

633
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,842
A nice cold soda pop coming up

634
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,930
- Thanks, bro. Can I dance after?
- You have to!

635
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:16,249
You have dancing in the blood!

636
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,091
- Off you go, Puppi
- Thanks, bro.

637
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,850
That Puppi is hot.

638
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,203
- I was a dancer.
- Who gives a damn!

639
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,401
He's nothing but trouble.

640
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,127
First my aquarium, then my car,

641
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,209
Pepe's record smashed to bits...

642
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,687
He's the biggest moron ever.

643
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,884
You're right, Fede, what can I say?

644
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,683
I never even spoke about him.

645
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,964
He's our black sheep.

646
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,481
How can I have a brother like him?

647
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,411
We're so different.

648
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,968
You want to know the truth?

649
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,364
I'm ashamed of him.

650
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,562
Don't be so upset, Giovanni.

651
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,368
At least he's out of our hair.

652
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,650
It's just you and me, ducklin' sister.

653
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,841
I didn't give you a name yet.

654
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,644
How about Lady Gaga?

655
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,810
You look like her too.

656
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,762
I love you, Lady Gaga.

657
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,691
Say you love me
and you'll never leave me.

658
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,130
Thanks, sister.

659
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,009
We'll be like a family

660
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,370
You and me,
we'll always be together.

661
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,807
Even Lady Gaga doesn't love me.

662
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,407
Fine, Dad, Jenny's studying.

663
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,882
OK, let me speak to him.

664
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,440
He's studying.

665
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,246
Don't disturb him,
he's studying for once.

666
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,091
When your dad says do something,
you do it!

667
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,644
OK. Jonny...

668
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,411
Dad wants a quick word with you.

669
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,369
Comin'.

670
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,211
Hi, bro Dad.

671
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,282
Everythin's cool.

672
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:22,051
Hows your brother treating you?

673
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,123
Good.

674
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,882
Awesome!
His girl's awesome too.

675
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,003
You should see how awesome!

676
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,645
Your aunt's here too.

677
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,565
She wants to say hi.
Here you go.

678
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,488
Hello?

679
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,364
Hi, sisterAuntie.

680
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,327
Giovanni, out it out.
Put your brother on now.

681
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,608
Hi, Auntie, you recognized me?

682
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,442
I wanted to ask you something.

683
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:50,327
Will you do me a favor?
Tomorrow can you

684
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,646
take Jonny to the exam?
If he goes to a club tonight

685
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,366
he'll forget and your dad'll be mad.

686
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,849
- Can we go? We're late.
- Sure.

687
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,168
Is that Princess Sissi?

688
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:03,522
It's Federica.

689
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,728
"Can we go? It's late."

690
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,291
- You have to leave her...
- Give me the phone!

691
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,970
I don't like her.

692
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,209
The storeowner's niece was perfect.

693
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,404
She was crazy about you. Crazy!

694
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,127
Understand?

695
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,602
I can't really hear, Auntie.

696
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,090
Giovanni, she's a bitch!

697
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,520
Gimme the damn phone!

698
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,284
OK, bye, Auntie.

699
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,642
- She says hi.
- Can we go now'?

700
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,762
Can't I even have a quick word
with my nephew?

701
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,645
- He's more my son than your nephew!
- Your son!

702
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,524
Can't I get some peace here?

703
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,564
Move it or I'll give you peace!

704
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,888
Can't I have a little nap?

705
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:51,448
No, you're always yelling,
yelling all the time,

706
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:55,850
and I can't get a wink,
not a damn wink!

707
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,485
Not a damn wink...

708
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,891
He's not ashamed of you,
he was just saying that.

709
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,560
No, he really said it.

710
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,411
My dad said the same:
"You won't live that way here."

711
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,645
You've been here 10 years now.

712
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,366
And no one's ever come looking for you.

713
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,486
He's different.
His brother loves him.

714
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,240
He does, sweetheart.

715
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,841
Awesome! Whose clothes are they?

716
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,802
They're our costumes
for the drag shows we do.

717
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,286
I'm Pink Panther.

718
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,686
I'm Lady Queen.

719
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,245
And I'm Maya the Bee.

720
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,841
Why don't you wear them to Gilez?

721
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,566
We can't work dressed like that.

722
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,841
Why not, sisters?

723
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,964
There's only one place for us
at Gilez...

724
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,650
The kitchen!

725
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,201
Useless...

726
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,644
Tonight, Insomnia is taking you
to the legendary Gilez club

727
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:29,887
to meet...

728
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,011
To the cry of "We are",
let's meet...

729
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,725
That sucks.

730
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,969
...The legendary Jonny Groove!

731
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,362
Look at him...

732
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:04,685
We're going to interview
Jonny Groove.

733
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:05,881
I found him.

734
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,322
I invented Jerry Grug.

735
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,726
Jonny.

736
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,606
As the king of Gilez,
you have loads of female admirers?

737
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,007
Sure, but I have a girl, sister.

738
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,404
Breaking news: he has a girl!

739
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,045
That's quite a scoop!

740
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,526
What's her name?

741
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,324
I don't know.

742
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,967
- I call her One Night
- Like the perfume.

743
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,764
I never thought of that.

744
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:31,169
Why One Night, Jonny?

745
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,522
Because I saw her one night only.

746
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:37,602
She waved to me like this
and I knew she was my girl.

747
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:38,687
Great!

748
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,487
We're really curious now.
Tell us what she's like.

749
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,011
Beautiful.

750
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,367
Her eyes?

751
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,403
Beautiful.

752
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,443
- Her hair?
- Beautiful.

753
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,210
- You know her?
- No.

754
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,766
Why can't I find her?

755
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,564
Let me take care of it.

756
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,771
If the gin with beautiful eyes

757
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,849
and beautiful hair

758
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,451
is watching this,

759
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:04,689
come down here,
Jonny Groove's waiting for you!

760
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:05,449
At Gilez.

761
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,449
Beautiful...

762
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:08,926
Cut it out, Camilla.

763
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:11,647
A phenomenon!

764
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,362
I have to thank Jerry Grups.

765
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,403
Jonny.

766
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,445
Same difference.
Start with my close-up

767
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,042
then slowly reveal the place,

768
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:24,722
show the atmosphere here...
Then swish pan

769
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:27,651
and track in on the key area
of the club.

770
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,684
Soda pop is the real new thing here!

771
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,360
And it's all down to this guy

772
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:37,088
who's changed the rules of the game!

773
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,046
- Jolly Groove!
- Jonny. He's as thick as a brick!

774
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,686
He said something really important.

775
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,770
Jonny, let's send a message
to young clubbers.

776
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,769
Sure, gimme the number.

777
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,931
No, not like that.
Let's say something.

778
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:54,487
OK. Bros, this is important.

779
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,361
Go dancing, have fun,
have a blast every night!

780
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,882
But when you leave the club, bros,

781
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:04,084
keep your wits about you
and do what I do!

782
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,931
Get your hand-stamp
or you can't get back in!

783
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:16,450
Get your hand-stamp...
The guy's too much.

784
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,082
Fuck this!

785
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:27,208
You're listening to Radio DJ
Nicola who's hot, hot, hot

786
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:31,041
on this hot summer day.

787
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,208
Good morning.

788
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,045
- Hows it going?
- Fine.

789
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:41,491
You got your hand-stamp last night?

790
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,489
What hand-stamp?

791
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:48,281
Ah, the hand-stamp!
You saw me on TV last night?

792
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,324
Yeah, I was clowning around as usual.

793
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,727
You know the way I am now.

794
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:58,084
You see me in this suit
but it's not a suit, it's a shell.

795
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,001
This tie

796
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:03,762
is a noose that imprisons my instinct.

797
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:08,045
My instinct that wants to ?y free
like a falcon in Wyoming.

798
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,644
But I'm forced to be here.
Why the strange look?

799
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,490
You think I'm mad?

800
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,331
But I'm not mad. I'm a free spirit.

801
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:19,410
If I don't want to go to the office,
I don't.

802
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,002
Yes, that's the way I am.

803
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,721
When I want to do something, I do it.

804
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,127
Too bad you have to work, Alice,

805
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:29,926
or I'd take you...
Where would you like to go?

806
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,323
To the sea.

807
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,364
I'd take you to the sea
but you have to work.

808
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:37,286
It's OK, I can hold the fort here.

809
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:40,165
What are your bosses going to say?

810
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:41,691
They're not here.

811
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:43,521
They'll be back.

812
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,326
They're in Rome,
auditioning for Big Brother.

813
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,085
Big Brother?

814
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,042
Until tomorrow.

815
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,567
- They're here all year...
- But not today!

816
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:56,646
What an incredible coincidence...

817
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:57,922
It's beautiful.

818
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:02,442
So, if we wanted,
you and I could take off

819
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,722
just like that.

820
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,768
So let's do it!

821
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:17,324
Who needs a bill?
This is between you and me.

822
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,204
Out?ow and in?ow...

823
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,562
We don't discuss this over the phone.

824
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,603
Yes, that's fine.

825
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,371
What a loser, that guy...

826
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,771
Talking of losers, where's your guy?

827
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,242
Give him a minute, Dad.

828
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:35,444
I want his Crazy Pizza campaign.
Where is he?

829
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,849
He was working all night.
He's totally committed.

830
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,884
He'll soon be here
with a big surprise.

831
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:46,131
What surprise?
We're not selling Kinder eggs.

832
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,244
We're selling pizza, OK!

833
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:51,444
Pizza isn't the same as...

834
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,045
Are you listening?

835
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,442
Is it that cold?

836
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,842
Hi, Fede...

837
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:09,328
I had to come to Genoa.
My aunt was taken ill.

838
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,000
I'm in this really grim hospital...

839
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,282
Coconut!

840
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,283
- Coconut.
- Streptococcus, the doctor says...

841
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,529
- Thanks, doctor.
- Coconut!

842
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:22,049
Sorry...

843
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:25,164
I'm coming, doctor.
Sorry, I have to go.

844
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,005
He took her to the sea.

845
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,364
He took her to the sea!

846
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,206
- How do I look?
- Great.

847
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,845
- A swim?
- Sure.

848
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,448
It's freezing!

849
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:00,446
Giovanni, come on, it's beautiful!

850
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,808
A shark!

851
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,207
Screw you, moron!

852
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,843
- What a great day.
- Better than the bar.

853
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:27,851
Know who you remind me 01'?

854
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,246
- Who?
- My granddad.

855
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:30,607
Your granddad?

856
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,280
He brought me to the sea as a girl.

857
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,080
I thought you meant physically.

858
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,044
No, he was more handsome.

859
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,844
I'm kidding!

860
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:41,724
There are no men like him now.

861
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,651
Every guy I've ever met was a shit.

862
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:46,251
Especially my ex.

863
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,364
- Why?
- Because he was cheating on me!

864
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,321
"If there's someone else, tell me!

865
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,409
"You're so slimy, tell me!"

866
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:57,161
My only regret is that I didn't

867
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,930
kick him hard in the balls.

868
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,203
Giovanni, are you OK?

869
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,283
I'm suffering for that guy.

870
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,528
You see how he's using his fist?

871
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:12,243
He'll break it that way.
I was a junior judo champ.

872
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:15,002
- I don't believe you.
- You don't?

873
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,811
I'll show you then.

874
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:17,603
I'll show you?

875
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:22,484
I'll show you then.
You don't believe me? I'll show you.

876
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:26,881
layout strike like this,
you'll break your wrist.

877
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:30,527
You need to twist your body,
torso straight,

878
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,923
nice and loose,
eye on the barycenter right here...

879
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,728
When you're powered up,

880
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,763
let all hell loose!

881
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,487
- Oh, God!
- Damn, what a blow!

882
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,644
I thought you were the ball.

883
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:50,161
A little ice will ease the pain.
Bye!

884
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,441
A little ice...

885
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:54,246
Hold on a second.

886
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,802
I'll give you a little ice!

887
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:04,723
Faster!

888
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,446
Damn, I'll get you!

889
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,521
He's gone...

890
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,968
- You're really funny.
- Why?

891
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,481
I don't know but you make me laugh.

892
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:31,048
You'll laugh
if that Minotaur finds me here.

893
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,525
Anyhow, he's gone.

894
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,281
So what do we do now?

895
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:44,244
Ask the crocodile.
You know how'?

896
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,851
It's not easy for me to trust a guy.

897
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,769
I don't know...

898
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:03,128
What would Jonny say now'?

899
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,929
Right now,
Jonny would probably say...

900
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:10,364
Jonny... Oh God, Jonny.

901
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,006
Oh no, bummer!

902
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,043
The exam!

903
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,331
Where did you sleep?

904
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,648
I'm not talkin' to you, I'm mad.

905
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,090
Sorry, I've been a real

906
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,204
Shit.
You said you were ashamed of me!

907
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,768
I was wrong, I'm sorry.
I was wrong.

908
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:57,521
I was wrong about everything.
My life here's wrong.

909
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:01,361
Should I be working for a guy
who weekends in Monte Carlo?

910
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,847
Or Federica nagging me
about staying in...

911
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,565
She busts my balls

912
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,762
over that Latin American shit

913
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,564
You said "Latin American"!

914
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,604
I'm an engineer
but I work in advertising!

915
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:15,201
I have to sell that gross pizza.

916
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:19,121
They want to launch it?
I'd launch it right out the window!

917
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,446
That's howl like to see you.
Truce?

918
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,642
OK, bro, truce.

919
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:28,249
Did you study for this?
It's important for Dad.

920
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,363
No, I'll copy from someone.

921
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:32,722
Copy? It's an oral!

922
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,329
That's what I forgot

923
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:39,047
Take the next right,
then pull up outside the barracks.

924
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,686
What's an oral?

925
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,810
Here I go, bro.

926
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:48,965
You can't got to an exam like that.

927
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,970
I didn't have time
for the tannin' salon.

928
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,685
Tanning salon...

929
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,882
Just put this on, OK.

930
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:56,928
Nice!

931
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:59,043
OK, Jonny, remember.

932
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:02,722
Focus and blow them away.
You can be number one.

933
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:05,328
So nice.

934
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:08,649
Come back after.
Don't go out on the town.

935
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,682
What if the fish gin gets mad?

936
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:14,963
If she does, don't worry,
I'll handle her.

937
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:17,891
- Know what?
- What?

938
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:20,161
You're awesome, bro!

939
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:27,368
The barracks is the other way.

940
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:31,806
I'm confused.

941
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:35,170
Seventy and seven in.

942
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,362
Scuse me, bros, can I come in?

943
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,806
I put down cards, we're even.

944
00:58:58,520 --> 00:58:59,646
Vemia?

945
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,202
Hello. Come in.

946
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,125
- Hi, bros.
- Have a seat.

947
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:07,003
Hi, bro.

948
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,441
Friendly kid, huh?

949
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:12,970
I'm Marshal Di Prima.

950
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,486
I'm Marshal Di Prima.

951
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:16,763
The primer?

952
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,565
He has a sense of humor!

953
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,728
The force needs new blood.

954
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:24,365
- Right.
- Absolutely.

955
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,050
All right then...

956
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:29,080
I feel like changing how we do this

957
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:33,126
After all, it's obvious
this young man has studied

958
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:34,721
So...

959
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:39,208
Do you smoke?

960
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:42,847
He said he doesn't smoke.

961
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:46,203
Leave the cap alone, Jonny.
Leave it alone.

962
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,441
Jonny, do you drink?

963
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:52,324
No. Only soda pop.

964
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:54,807
He only drinks soda pop.

965
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:58,881
Leave the cap alone.
It breaks otherwise.

966
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:02,642
You broke it.
I'll have to get it stitched back on.

967
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:04,449
Nice and easy...

968
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,129
I would say that'll do.

969
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,846
What more do we want to know?

970
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:15,125
We need healthy elements on the force.

971
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,084
You know the Tax Police?

972
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,884
You bet I do, bro.

973
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:21,970
They live in the woods,
have a blast...

974
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,640
We build fires, go into the woods...

975
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:27,923
- How's it going in here?
- Very well.

976
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,122
A total blast, bro.

977
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,323
We've finished with him

978
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:35,410
and it all went beautifully.

979
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,647
Are these yours?

980
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:38,251
- You bet, bro.
- Fake.

981
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:39,601
You bet, bro!

982
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:43,009
I never buy originals.
This pair cost 5 euros.

983
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,771
They're 200 in stores.
Are you nuts?

984
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:48,930
The boy knows a bargain, he's smart.

985
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:51,646
Smart, economical... Bravo.

986
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:52,807
Can I ask a question?

987
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:54,401
Why?

988
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,090
Why ask another question?

989
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:59,329
We have other applicants.
I'd dismiss Jonny.

990
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,086
Jonny?

991
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:03,968
His first name? You know him?

992
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,764
He mentioned a primer

993
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:07,485
but he never gave me one.

994
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,609
What a sense of humor.

995
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:15,644
I'm Marshal Di Prima.
Get the joke?

996
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,842
Marshal Di Primal
I know who you are, bro.

997
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:24,611
You're my dad's friend.
He told me,

998
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,371
"Take the exam,
he'll pass you for sure."

999
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:28,966
You know his father?

1000
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:32,528
He's just kidding.
I met him once or twice.

1001
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,803
No, he was always at our place.

1002
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,206
He stuck like glue.

1003
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:40,882
All right,
let's ask this friendly guy

1004
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:43,128
a really simple question.

1005
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:44,446
- Come on.
- Let's.

1006
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,049
What is the Personal Income Tax rate?

1007
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,126
That's a tough one.

1008
01:01:57,120 --> 01:02:00,044
- We don't know.
- After all, there were times

1009
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:02,720
when I didn't know it myself.

1010
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:05,685
It happens.
A simpler question then.

1011
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,564
Much simpler.

1012
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:12,571
What does 730 call to mind?

1013
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:13,882
What?

1014
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:17,091
What's 7 and 30?

1015
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,009
When...

1016
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,689
When? What does 7 and 30
mean to you?

1017
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:24,971
7 and 30?

1018
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,201
I know!

1019
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,323
- He knows!
- I know.

1020
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:33,046
OK, bros, 7:30

1021
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:35,322
is the happy hour.
But don't go then.

1022
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:38,763
No one goes at 7:30.
Go at 8:30

1023
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,291
with the hot babes.

1024
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,928
What do hot babes have to do with it?

1025
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:45,168
Hot babes are always involved.

1026
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:48,170
You don't know 730,
you don't know tax rates...

1027
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:50,328
What about IVA (=VAT)?

1028
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:52,204
- You know her?
- Who?

1029
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,971
- Iva, his son.
- What do you mean?

1030
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:58,562
Look, we shot this last night
at his place.

1031
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:06,248
I can't see without my glasses.

1032
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:07,771
Don't look.

1033
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:11,806
If your dad could see you.
Marshal Di Prima...

1034
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:15,767
That's Iva. She used to be Ugo.

1035
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:20,006
The one with the red hair?

1036
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:21,884
- Yes.
- Beautiful.

1037
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:34,201
Come back here!

1038
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,004
Stop, you son of a bitch!

1039
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,282
I know him...

1040
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,130
I just want to say hello!

1041
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:46,964
Sorry, bro, I didn't mean to.

1042
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:51,007
Didn't mean to.

1043
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:54,727
That guy started yellin' at me
and I panicked.

1044
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,440
I'm goin', OK.

1045
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,126
Thanks, bros.

1046
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:15,890
This'll blow you away!

1047
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:23,126
You win.

1048
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:39,603
Fede?

1049
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:41,643
So hows Auntie?

1050
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:43,524
She's feeling better

1051
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:46,121
but she gave us a real fright.

1052
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,048
I can imagine.

1053
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:50,810
You know, I was so upset...

1054
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:54,809
I thought about calling your father.

1055
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:59,004
But I didn't.

1056
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:02,251
I thought maybe you needed
to be together.

1057
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:06,044
But now she's better...

1058
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:09,520
we can focus on the Americans, right?

1059
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,324
And after the Americans,

1060
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:14,363
things will change here.

1061
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:17,040
So many things will change.

1062
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:20,525
They won't change that much...

1063
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,121
They will.

1064
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,645
They'll change.

1065
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:26,286
Believe me.

1066
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,490
- Yes?
- Tax Police.

1067
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,284
Come on up, jerk.

1068
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:35,121
- Who is it?
- Jonny.

1069
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,847
What's Jonny doing here?

1070
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:41,289
I said he could come back.
He slept rough.

1071
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:44,524
You're certainly taking
the initiative lately

1072
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,128
I don't understand your tone

1073
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:49,402
- Tone? What tone?
- You seem...

1074
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:52,685
On edge?
I'm not at all on edge...

1075
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,810
You just seemed...

1076
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,129
- Come on in.
- Giovanni Vernia?

1077
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:04,527
I'm the "jerk".
You're under arrest.

1078
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:07,691
Gangway, move along!

1079
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:08,767
Where are you going?

1080
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,680
No idea! Call my dad, it's a mistake!

1081
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:13,844
We have the Americans tomorrow!

1082
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:15,724
So call my father!

1083
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:18,847
Don't mention my aunt or he'll worry.

1084
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:19,882
Move it.

1085
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:25,448
You'll pay for this!

1086
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:52,883
Hello?

1087
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,045
Signor Michele?

1088
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:56,887
It's Federica.

1089
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:59,287
What does she want at this hour?

1090
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:00,481
I don't know!

1091
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:03,081
Federica dear, lovely to hear you.

1092
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:04,926
What's wrong?

1093
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:08,727
Sony to call so late
but I have some important news.

1094
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:13,726
It's important she says.
They must have set a date.

1095
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:16,082
Don't even joke about that.

1096
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:19,844
So let's hear the great news, Federica.

1097
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,845
They arrested Giovanni.

1098
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:26,087
Michele!

1099
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:27,611
Someone knocked?

1100
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:30,121
Duilio, give me a hand here.

1101
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:40,442
Vemia, this jacket...

1102
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:42,121
Is it yours?

1103
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:46,286
Yes, it's mine.

1104
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:47,811
Note that then.

1105
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,289
The jacket belongs to the accused.

1106
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:53,447
What accused?

1107
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:55,324
Shut up! You're dead meat!

1108
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:57,761
You try to blowup a barracks

1109
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:01,203
then dump your jacket and papers
in the trash?

1110
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:03,767
- I never dumped...
- Einstein's in the building!

1111
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:06,210
- I did nothing.
- Vernia...

1112
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:09,008
Are you screwing with me?

1113
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,044
- Never!
- You're screwing with me!

1114
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:13,049
- I swear I'm not.
- Write...

1115
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:14,287
"The criminal..."

1116
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,609
- What criminal?
- Quiet!

1117
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:19,724
"The criminal is misleading
the investigation."

1118
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,366
What investigation? I did nothing!

1119
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:25,040
Fetch Marshal Di Prima.
He works here.

1120
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:27,049
We're family friends.

1121
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:29,125
- Marshal Di Prima?
- Yes.

1122
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:31,243
Marshal Di Prima is in the ICU.

1123
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:33,401
What happened?

1124
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:35,689
You ask me that? He asks me!

1125
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:40,961
Gimme the cell keys!

1126
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:05,370
Drink this herb tea,
it'll buck you up.

1127
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:09,447
Get me 20 more watches.

1128
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,281
Michele,

1129
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,802
you're losing your marbles.

1130
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,207
Don't cry like that, Michele.

1131
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:20,209
Come on, don't cry.

1132
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,971
It'll all work out, don't worry.

1133
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:27,283
Such a tragedy in our home...

1134
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:42,169
Federica, where are you?
The Americans are here.

1135
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:45,486
What do I say?
I don't speak English.

1136
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:46,886
Actually, Giovanni...

1137
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:49,527
Yeah, sure, I know. Just move it!

1138
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:53,526
...Got arrested.

1139
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,288
Milan traffic. The automobile show.

1140
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:00,403
<i>Big mess.</i>

1141
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:04,762
Know the one
about the three carabinieri

1142
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:07,486
and the Polish American?

1143
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:10,207
A quick coffee?

1144
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:18,041
Hi, little bros.

1145
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:21,451
Missed me?
I missed you too, real bad.

1146
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,127
What are you doing here?

1147
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:26,249
Giovanni told me to come back.

1148
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:29,125
Just get lost.
I don't care what he said

1149
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:31,891
This is my home, you understand?

1150
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:34,205
I understand.

1151
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:36,087
So get out!

1152
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:39,285
Why do you hate me?
What did I do to you?

1153
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:40,362
What?

1154
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:45,487
You mined my life
and Giovanni's too!

1155
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:48,686
I thought
I was with someone different.

1156
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:49,961
Understand?

1157
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:54,688
Sure, you two are
as dumb as each other!

1158
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:57,284
You betcha, we're twins.

1159
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:02,201
That's true...

1160
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:05,404
You're twins. Identical twins!

1161
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:10,127
That's perfect! Come with me...

1162
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,287
She's wacko!

1163
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:18,966
Good morning.

1164
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:22,565
Hold this.
I'll take these.

1165
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:24,046
Beautiful here.

1166
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:28,361
Don't take any initiatives.
Just do as I tell you.

1167
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:30,167
Let's go.

1168
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:33,922
Say hello.

1169
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:35,963
- Hi, bro.
- No. Say "good morning".

1170
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:39,728
Jonny, remember, we can do this.

1171
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:42,287
Stop doing that!

1172
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:47,124
When I go like this,
you go like this.

1173
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:49,971
When I go like this,
you go like this.

1174
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:51,446
So what do I do?

1175
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,527
Good morning everyone.

1176
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:00,803
Sony we're late.
You know how the traffic is

1177
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:03,567
We had it all this morning, sir.

1178
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:06,366
Come on, Giovanni.
Sit down here.

1179
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:09,961
You a singer?

1180
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:15,763
We're very excited
about this campaign.

1181
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:18,486
So, Giovanni, let's hear your ideas.

1182
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:21,650
A fabulous idea.
I'll run through it for you.

1183
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:24,601
You dubbing him?
Can't he speak?

1184
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:25,962
You can't speak?

1185
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:28,367
He went to the dentist.

1186
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:30,967
You went to the dentist, right?

1187
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:32,844
The poor thing, Dad... sir.

1188
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,281
It's because he saw the dentist.

1189
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:37,370
Awesome!

1190
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:43,929
That's the reaction we want
from Italy to Crazy Pizza.

1191
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:47,691
A quick coffee?

1192
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:49,882
No more quick coffees.

1193
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:53,044
Come on, Giovanni,
how will you launch

1194
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:56,130
our Crazy Pizzas in Italy?

1195
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:00,640
What did they give him?

1196
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:06,370
They want to launch it?
I'd launch it right out the window.

1197
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:19,563
Crazy Pizza.
The pizza to eat on the ?y!

1198
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:39,291
The pizza to eat on the ?y!

1199
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:44,328
What did I do, bro?

1200
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:51,369
Kids today...

1201
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:54,086
All's well that ends well.

1202
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:57,602
If ever you're in Genoa,
stop by to see us.

1203
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,290
I will, Vernia.

1204
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:02,006
You too,
on the Adriatic in August.

1205
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:04,011
If only...

1206
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:06,884
Goodbye and all the best.

1207
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:08,923
Thank you for everything.

1208
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:11,487
You gave him a gold watch too?

1209
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:13,682
The watches are his babies.

1210
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:15,484
Without my babies,

1211
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:18,923
Mr. Engineer would be locked up
like a treasury bond!

1212
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:22,522
Michele, don't mess up our heads
with your taxes again.

1213
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:25,041
I need to call Federica.
Excuse me.

1214
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:27,322
Sure, call the princess.

1215
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,922
- Michele...
- I have to sort things out for Jonny.

1216
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:34,567
He's the bane of my life,
like guys who don't issue receipts.

1217
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:39,849
They let me go, I'm on my way.

1218
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:43,601
Don't bother. Your brother
landed the US contract.

1219
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:45,165
He's a genius!

1220
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:46,887
My brother? Jonny?

1221
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:49,248
Believe me, he's a genius.

1222
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:50,930
We're celebrating at the villa.

1223
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:52,810
Bring everyone.

1224
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,844
It's going to be unforgettable.

1225
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:12,531
Come on, call him back!

1226
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,004
I tried three times.
His phone's always off.

1227
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:17,884
It'll make me look desperate.

1228
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:20,686
- I'll call him then.
- No, Camilla!

1229
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:23,008
I'll call him one last time.

1230
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,848
- It's ringing!
- Told you so.

1231
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:39,290
Sorry, I called a lot.

1232
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:43,446
Sony I didn't call you back,
I'm working all the time.

1233
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:46,007
I'm still at the office now.

1234
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,530
When can you see him?

1235
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,240
I was thinking...

1236
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:52,444
When can I see you?

1237
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,244
When can you see me?

1238
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:57,611
I don't know...
Are you free tomorrow evening?

1239
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:00,330
Am I free tomorrow evening?

1240
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:02,171
- Totally!
- Yes, I'm free.

1241
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:04,001
I'll call you.

1242
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:05,043
Call me!

1243
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,682
Bye, kiss you...

1244
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:13,360
See, easy. Just wait till tomorrow...

1245
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:15,926
Cut it out!

1246
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:18,566
Want us to put a slow number on?

1247
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:19,522
Move it!

1248
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:22,246
I told you to hire foreigners instead.

1249
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:26,242
Here, on the left. Move it!

1250
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:32,610
I have a recipe
for a really good one...

1251
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:34,086
- Giovanni!
- Hows it going?

1252
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:37,208
Everything's just fine.

1253
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:40,927
Auntie's happy if you're happy.

1254
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,330
You're happy, right?

1255
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:45,010
Good evening, signora.

1256
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:47,127
Lovely to see you.

1257
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:50,011
You're so elegant.

1258
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:53,249
Who are you this evening?
Princess Sissi?

1259
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:55,565
You're very elegant too.

1260
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:58,440
You like it?
Then I'm happy.

1261
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:02,927
Congratulations,
this place is really beautiful.

1262
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:05,283
Yes, we're fond of it.

1263
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:08,291
Really beautiful.

1264
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:11,842
The beautiful pall's still to come

1265
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:14,242
I'll see you later.

1266
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:17,844
Sure, get lost.

1267
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:20,762
What a slut!

1268
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:23,531
- Auntie!
- She's a slut. What can I do?

1269
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:28,441
How do I have to put it?

1270
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,530
I can't stomach her.

1271
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:31,887
You get it?

1272
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:35,926
I get it. 
Try another canape then.

1273
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:38,165
I'll see you later.

1274
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:39,725
The poor boy's crazy!

1275
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,246
Vanished!

1276
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:43,607
Everything OK?

1277
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:47,247
Wonderful, he's telling me
some great stories.

1278
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:49,090
What were you saying?

1279
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:51,203
You're sworn to secrecy.

1280
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:54,210
This villa...
It's beautiful, right?

1281
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:58,450
Well, it doesn't exist
where the tax service is concerned

1282
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:01,325
It doesn't exist. It's a miracle!

1283
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:02,721
Let's have a drink.

1284
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:05,287
No, I'm interested in this.
Go on.

1285
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:08,529
I'm talking to your dad.
It belongs to a company

1286
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:12,008
that's part of another company
based in Antigua,

1287
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:14,680
which doesn't exist
because it's a palm tree

1288
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:16,848
A dead palm tree!

1289
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:19,008
Hear that, the palm tree died!

1290
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:21,363
I heard. It died. Let's go.

1291
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:24,723
No, the dead palm interests me.
Go on.

1292
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:26,126
He's interested.

1293
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:29,449
- Let's talk about the Maserati.
- All right.

1294
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:32,564
- Got a minute?
- I love these stories.

1295
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:35,684
It's in my uncle's name.
And where's my uncle?

1296
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:37,723
- I don't know.
- Where is he?

1297
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,160
- He's dead.
- He's dead, Dad.

1298
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:41,567
- Like the palm tree.
- Under the palm tree.

1299
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:45,606
Get it, Giovanni?
This guy's a fiscal ghost!

1300
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:47,848
You're something else!

1301
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:50,328
Did I mention the Filipino maid?

1302
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,728
- Something to drink?
- No thanks.

1303
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:56,402
Why're you here?

1304
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:58,770
I'm working.And you?

1305
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:03,847
Me too. It's a party for the agency.
All these people...

1306
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:06,566
I saw your colleagues.
Your boss too.

1307
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:08,282
You saw her?

1308
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:10,810
Yes, she was around earlier.

1309
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:15,524
You spoke to her?

1310
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:18,082
To say what?

1311
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:20,207
Nothing.

1312
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:25,963
Since we're both here,

1313
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:28,606
why not go back to the city together?

1314
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:31,130
After? Me and you?

1315
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:36,841
Great idea.

1316
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:39,884
Excuse me, may I have
your attention, please?

1317
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:42,006
Giovanni...

1318
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:44,089
Can you come up here?

1319
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:45,770
What does she want now'?

1320
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:49,124
All my boss ever thinks about
is work.

1321
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:50,560
What a drag. Sorry.

1322
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,769
- Off you go.
- I won't be long

1323
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:55,407
Good evening.

1324
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:57,609
- What is it?
- Come on.

1325
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:03,364
Forgive the interruption
but I have some important news.

1326
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:05,246
All right...

1327
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:07,851
Giovanni and I,

1328
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:11,328
after two years
of a long and happy engagement

1329
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:13,330
have decided to marry.

1330
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,767
Someone doesn't seem too happy.

1331
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:32,881
Speech!

1332
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:37,244
You want a speech?

1333
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:39,881
I'll give you one.

1334
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:44,727
Mr. Berman, let me start with you.

1335
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:48,322
I've wanted to say this
for a long time now.

1336
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:50,364
Mr. Berman, your Crazy Pizza

1337
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:52,324
is a piece of shit!

1338
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:53,767
Enough.

1339
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:57,169
No. You want a speech,
you're getting one.

1340
01:20:57,560 --> 01:21:00,370
Federica, I'm sick
of the advertising agency,

1341
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:03,131
your dad, the ?shies, Cuban salsa...

1342
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:05,129
Don't take it personally.

1343
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:07,288
Federica, I'm sick of you!

1344
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:10,922
What the hell is that idiot saying?
He's an idiot!

1345
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:15,087
How could you imagine marriage?

1346
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:17,044
How could you think of it?

1347
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:20,364
I don't want to many you.
I don't love you!

1348
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:21,686
I love someone else.

1349
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:27,009
That's Auntie's little Giovanni!
Bravo!

1350
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:32,046
You love someone else?

1351
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:35,609
Then get the hell out of here,
right now! Understand?

1352
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:39,366
- Go.
- I go?

1353
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:43,282
Just go, Giovanni.
You get the message!

1354
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:46,927
Dump the Milanese bitch,
she fooled y'all

1355
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:50,602
but she couldn't fool me,
I saw her true colors!

1356
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:53,883
Know what?
She can keep all this shit!

1357
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:57,402
The villa, the grounds
and the whole shebang!

1358
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:01,121
Sorry.

1359
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:03,801
I get carried away now and then.

1360
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:09,247
Don't cry.

1361
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:13,045
No, baby... Don't cry!

1362
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:15,766
You're lucky.
You're rid of that jerk!

1363
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:18,361
You're a failure! A loser!

1364
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:20,085
You'll never get ahead

1365
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:21,601
without us!

1366
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:23,768
- Who's the failure?
- He is!

1367
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:25,450
MY $On?
- Exactly!

1368
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:27,768
Let's see who's the failure now.

1369
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:32,041
Marshal Michele Vernia,
special officer with the Tax Police

1370
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:36,968
- Not the Tax Police...
- Yes, the Tax Police.

1371
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:39,481
- It's not fair...
- No, it's fair.

1372
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:42,288
Alice, stop!

1373
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:45,165
You're a bastard like the others!

1374
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:47,085
- Let me explain.
- Drop dead!

1375
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:51,684
We're gonna have a blast tonight!

1376
01:22:56,360 --> 01:22:58,840
Let me explain, Alice!

1377
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:02,243
One Night?

1378
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:03,323
Alice!

1379
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:05,401
One Night?

1380
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:10,447
Oh, my God...

1381
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:11,841
She fainted.

1382
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:13,041
Poor dear.

1383
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:20,242
What did you do to my gin?

1384
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:22,329
She doesn't even know you!

1385
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:24,807
We waved to each other at Gilez.

1386
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,525
What do you know?

1387
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,525
She's not in love with you.

1388
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:30,768
She fell for me,
thinking I was you.

1389
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:34,526
I played along to make her love me.

1390
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:35,648
Get it?

1391
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:36,727
So she loves me?

1392
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:38,410
No, she loves me!

1393
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,170
- No, she loves me!
- No, me!

1394
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:41,640
Enough!

1395
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:44,524
We'll let her decide.

1396
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:46,122
OK, bro.

1397
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:52,683
Which one of you is Giovanni?

1398
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:58,407
I am.

1399
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:09,400
He is, he is.

1400
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:14,166
Some time later

1401
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:17,083
So that was that.
Jonny arrived

1402
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,760
and changed my life in a ?ash.

1403
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:22,361
I returned to electronic engineering...

1404
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:26,167
Giovanni, the new personnel manager
wants to see you.

1405
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,082
Federica changed lives too.

1406
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:33,888
- All right, Cuban music is...
- Emotion!

1407
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:34,922
- It's...
- Vibration!

1408
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:37,528
- It's...
- Feeling!

1409
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:40,203
The music!

1410
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:41,890
Paquito, put the music on!

1411
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:45,847
Dance!

1412
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:53,641
I love you, baby.

1413
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:56,049
Keep that butt tight!

1414
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:59,001
Someone's dancing at the agency too.

1415
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:03,525
That's 2004 finished,
now let's move on to 2005

1416
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:05,643
Can't we tum a blind eye?

1417
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:06,921
Sure...

1418
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:10,329
Let's turn a blind eye,
two eyes, the mouth, both ears

1419
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:13,888
and shut down the whole company!

1420
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:15,570
Not the company...

1421
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:19,162
My friend, remember this:
the Tax Police...

1422
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:21,405
no peace.

1423
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:26,524
Jonny tumed up and everything changed,
fortunately.

1424
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:28,291
How's the love of my life?

1425
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:31,167
The love of your life is fine.

1426
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:34,161
Want to say hi to Dad, sweetheart?

1427
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:39,846
She says you're awesome.

1428
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,882
Keep her away from Jonny...

1429
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:44,765
All right.

1430
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:46,764
Come on in, Vernia!

1431
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:47,927
I have to go.

1432
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:49,082
OK, bye.

1433
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:50,441
Love you.

1434
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:58,891
You're doing a great job, Vernia,
with excellent results.

1435
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:01,447
I have some good news for you.

1436
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:04,211
I see you're from Genoa, by the way.

1437
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:07,722
I'm in love with Genoa.
Such a beautiful city.

1438
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:10,685
There's a great restaurant
by the harbor...

1439
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:12,848
- What's it called?
- There are a few.

1440
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:14,929
This one has a sea view.

1441
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:16,681
It's by the harbor...

1442
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:18,325
Enough small talk...

1443
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:22,651
You're the new section head
for your department.

1444
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:24,247
Happy?

1445
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:28,162
Very happy-

1446
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:32,131
In this company, you soon pick out

1447
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:34,648
the people of merit from the rest.

1448
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:36,765
- Right?
- No way!

1449
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,764
What are you doing?

1450
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:43,328
I've had it!
I've had it with these goddam watches!

1451
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:45,005
Enough!

1452
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:48,204
I want to get ahead on my own!
Is that clear?

1453
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:50,050
What have you done?

1454
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:53,084
You destroyed the birthday gift
from my wife!

1455
01:26:57,880 --> 01:26:59,564
Go, Vernia.

1456
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:01,246
Just go.

1457
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:05,321
Was the restaurant Gino's?

1458
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:06,723
Out!

1459
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:13,247
Only Jonny is still the same.

1460
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:15,807
No doubt about it,
Rome's beautiful.

1461
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,446
- It's wonderful.
- Fantastic.

1462
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:20,682
Fantastic but shabby.

1463
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:23,565
Look, that place is full of holes,
a ruin.

1464
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:27,242
Why don't they knock it down
and build a great club?

1465
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:30,922
That's Italy.

1466
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:33,448
The guys in power don't give a damn.

1467
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:42,810
To my mother

1468
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:13,008
I know him,
I want to say hello!

1469
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:16,010
- Sure.
- Let go of me!

1470
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:20,331
Where are you?
Wait till I get you...

1471
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:23,887
They took everything.
I'm poor.

1472
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:25,730
Join the club, pal.

1473
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:27,445
Know where to put the roses?

1474
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:30,604
This'll blow you away!

1475
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:37,200
Damn, if I catch you...

1476
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:41,401
Crazy Pizza, the pizza
to eat on the ?y!

1477
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,011
You're totally nuts.

1478
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:52,524
Holy Madonna!

1479
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:56,088
Vote to decide
who joins the house,

1480
01:28:56,280 --> 01:28:57,691
Tonino or Peppino!

1481
01:28:57,880 --> 01:28:59,530
Phone in your votes guys.

1482
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:03,644
I'll give you ice
if I catch you!

1483
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:10,447
Sony, pal.

1484
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:12,051
Regards to the Marshal.

1485
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:15,604
How come our scene isn't here?

1486
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:18,451
- Did you plug it in?
- Oh, right.

1487
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:21,168
Not that, the web cam.

1488
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:23,010
What the fuck

1489
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:54,169
Paquito, put that awesome
number on.

1490
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:58,324
That's what I call music!

1491
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:02,411
We are, we are,
we are heaven...

1492
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:11,564
We're vanishing!

1493
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:13,444
The movie's over!

1494
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:15,931
Awesome!
