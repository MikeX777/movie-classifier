1
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:59,140
Naoko.

2
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,690
A small island floating in the sea of Japan,
Namikirijima.

3
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,600
That summer, I left Tokyo,

4
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,990
in order to treat my asthma at a quiet place.

5
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,990
I apologise for making you
give us a ride in your boat.

6
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,770
We haven't been fully paid back for last time yet.

7
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,410
We haven't yet... Money.

8
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,500
Ah, no problem!
We don't accept money from island visitors.

9
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,380
That's right, we won't accept any.

10
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,060
You're not entitled to say that!

11
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,040
I'm sorry, thank you very much.

12
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,740
I'm sorry, thank you very much.

13
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,450
Can you fish Girella punctata* in this environment?

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,389
* smallscale blackfish

15
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:53,700
Girella punctata?

16
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,250
Yes.

17
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,300
- Ah! You're talking about the Kuro!

18
00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:00,470
Ah, Kuro! Yes you can fish a lot around here.

19
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,450
He's still running!

20
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,180
What?

21
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,460
Your son.

22
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,250
Like father, like son.

23
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,820
Like father?

24
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:53,010
He was a marathon relay runner.

25
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,210
He was really fast.

26
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,510
He was called "The Wind of Japan's Sea".

27
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,950
That was back in the day.

28
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,200
He looks fast as well.

29
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,490
What's his name?

30
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,900
Yusuke.

31
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,490
Yusuke?

32
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,560
Running Yusuke was really fascinating.

33
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:38,370
I couldn't gaze after him.

34
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:46,310
At that moment,
I was still in a much darker place.

35
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,620
Naoko!

36
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:38,970
Help!

37
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,140
Help!

38
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,630
Help!

39
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,220
Help!!

40
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,530
Help!

41
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,870
Help!

42
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,850
Naoko!

43
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,630
Here, here.

44
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,630
Come on, a little more!

45
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,260
Stretch out your hand!

46
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,760
Got her!

47
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,760
Help me...

48
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:20,960
Does it hurt anywhere?

49
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,230
Are you OK?

50
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,120
She's OK, thank you so much.

51
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,400
Does it hurt anywhere?

52
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,380
You startled me.

53
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,050
You startled me, you startled me!

54
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,020
Kensuke-san, catch this!

55
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,830
No need, no need.

56
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,640
It took me by surprise all of a sudden.

57
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,910
Everything is fine now.

58
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,880
It's OK.

59
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,620
Are you OK? Everything is fine.

60
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,980
Shit...!

61
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,450
In the water!

62
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,490
Kensuke-san, Kensuke-san!

63
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,690
Kensuke!

64
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,170
Kensuke!

65
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,620
Kensuke, Kensuke!

66
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,390
He's not on my side, what about you?

67
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,720
He's not here either.

68
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:36,200
Kensuke-san!

69
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,950
What's the matter? Are you OK?

70
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,670
Keep breathing.

71
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,780
Keep breathing slowly.

72
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:52,520
Keep breathing.

73
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,330
Slowly, slowly...

74
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:00,600
There is nothing in the sea
apart from my floating white hat.

75
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:08,200
The form of Yusuke's father
was nowhere to be seen.

76
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:22,160
Naoko

77
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,570
You went running again, didn't you?

78
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,610
I only made a few rounds in this area.

79
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:23,040
If you're not careful your
asthma will attack again.

80
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,570
I know.

81
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,670
I still disagree with you
being in the athletic club.

82
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,900
What?
Isn't today your day off?

83
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,620
It's the athletic club again.

84
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,260
What was it? For the record
meeting of the accepted runners.

85
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,980
Eh? Naoko will be there?

86
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,480
I'm only helping.

87
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,080
Shall we eat then?

88
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,070
Yes.

89
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,380
Excuse me, hasn't he arrived yet?

90
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,310
No, he hasn't yet...

91
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,220
What is he doing? This guy is really..

92
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,090
Please wait a little more.

93
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,320
Everybody's counting on him.

94
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,190
It's nothing.

95
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,390
I will search for him.

96
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,420
I'm already finished.

97
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:35,480
Ah, that would be a great help,
thank you very much.

98
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,240
It's him, Iki Yusuke.

99
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,360
Iki Yusuke.

100
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,270
I'm home!

101
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,330
Didn't I tell you to enter through the front door?

102
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,140
Say hello.

103
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,430
Mom, that's her.

104
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,040
Come in.

105
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,360
It's that girl's fault.

106
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,330
Don't say anything and put down your backpack.

107
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,890
Give my Dad back.

108
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,960
Give my Dad back!

109
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,050
Give him back right now!

110
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:45,920
Yusuke!

111
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:50,170
Wait, give my dad back!

112
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,210
Let me go, give my Dad back!

113
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,290
Yusuke!

114
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,010
Quit it! Apologize to Naoko-Chan.

115
00:10:59,060 --> 00:10:59,730
No!

116
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,820
Yusuke.

117
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,770
Excuse me, are you Iki Yusuke,
the runner who is enlisted for the 100m sprint?

118
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,040
Ah, the receptionist?

119
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,100
Wait a minute, it's the best part now.

120
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:16,670
The one in red,
he will get ahead of the others at the next curve.

121
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,610
See!

122
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,270
Thanks for letting me know.

123
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,580
I'm Shinomiya Naoko.

124
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:52,160
When I was in the 6th year of elementary school,
your father saved me.

125
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:05,810
I've already forgotten about it.

126
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,240
I'm not blaming anyone for it.

127
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,480
Ready,

128
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:54,320
I couldn't tear my eyes away from Yusuke running.

129
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:01,030
This time, without closing my eyes.

130
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,890
What's your next goal?

131
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,440
You probably want to participate
in the Olympic Games in the future?

132
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:34,830
The next goal is the marathon relay of Kyushu.

133
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,720
Marathon relay?

134
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:39,250
Our Senior High School participates each year.

135
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,940
So you're putting aside
plans for short distance races?

136
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,440
Such a waste.

137
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,310
Iki-kun is the raising star of 100m races!

138
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,040
She said I'm the raising star of 100m races!

139
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:56,750
Weren't you the one who said you
wanted to participate in a marathon relay?

140
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,950
Why the marathon?

141
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:07,690
Because I've always wanted to participate
in one. It's been my wish since I was a child.

142
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,810
I want to see Yusuke running.

143
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,600
I'm fine with watching him from afar.

144
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:49,200
At that moment,
I only had this intention in my head.

145
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,490
10 seconds to go!

146
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,990
Get set..

147
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,060
This was the starting shot.

148
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:29,500
Here are the senior high school student.
The participants of the Kyushu marathon 2007.

149
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:34,340
The 42.1 km marathon with 30 runners has begun.

150
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,170
Ah, someone has fallen!

151
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:55,190
Seems like it's runner Okuda from
Namikirijima Senior High School.

152
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,050
The Namikirijima Senior High
School which attracted public attention

153
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,890
due to Iki Yusuke's decision
to participate in this marathon.

154
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,920
He was successfully running though.

155
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,880
Okuda-kun can't get up!

156
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,880
Maybe it's a cramp.

157
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,690
Seems like he's fine.

158
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,520
He stands up and... he's running again!

159
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,250
The majority of the runners are quite ahead,

160
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,840
I think at about 200m.

161
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,310
We hope he will do his best!

162
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,360
The race has just started!

163
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,960
Excuse me...

164
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:52,900
Yes?

165
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:57,210
Could you tell me where Iki Yusuke's section is?

166
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,910
It's the last section, so...

167
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,680
It's at the next lap.

168
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,490
About 3 km away, I guess.

169
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,490
Thank you.

170
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,330
I don't want it.

171
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,410
I said I don't want it!

172
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:01,530
Got it, I'll drink it.

173
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,970
Do your best...

174
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:13,800
Do you best, do your best

175
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:25,010
As expected Shin Kuroda is leading...

176
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,920
Wait, it seems like there is
a runner who is catching up!

177
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,780
Senior high school student
from Namikirijima: Iki Yusuke.

178
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,920
Within 3 minutes he has caught up 8 runners!

179
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,090
Get ready!

180
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,480
Runner Kuroda has arrived!

181
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:51,430
Runner Kuroda, take the water!

182
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,530
I'm sorry.

183
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,610
I'm sorry...

184
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,330
Nagazaki Todai.

185
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,620
Daiyu Denki.

186
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,590
Do your best!

187
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,040
I can't do this on my own.

188
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:47,270
Nagazaki Todai in second place and Daiyu Denki in third
place, both seem to have accepted the water bottle.

189
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:51,450
Information: Seems like a
candidate in white is drawing near!

190
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,230
Iki Yusuke of Narikimijima is arriving.

191
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,920
He will soon reach the
station where he'll get water.

192
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:57,930
Excuse me...

193
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,160
Yes?

194
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,820
I have a favour to ask of you.

195
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,890
Uhm, I don't know if I can do this...

196
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:16,560
I'm begging you... We don't have a
lot of assistants in our athletic club.

197
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,170
I'm the only one who can fill this vacancy.

198
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,260
And I'm also the only one distributing the water.

199
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:23,590
But...

200
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,000
It's fine. If I fail,

201
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,530
you have to hand it over.

202
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,060
If you fail too, it would be terrible for Yusuke.

203
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:39,250
Do your best.

204
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,570
I understand.

205
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,850
Take the cap off and hold out the bottle.

206
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,590
Hold it at the top.

207
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,880
It's fine... you're okay, Yusuke, aren't you?

208
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,240
Yusuke!

209
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,170
Yusuke!

210
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:57,120
Iki-kun?

211
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:01,130
I'm surprised... I thought there would
have been a difference of 2 minutes.

212
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,880
He's fallen, the contender Yusuke has fallen.

213
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:34,130
He suddenly collapsed to the
ground... ahh he's not moving.

214
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:39,660
According to the information we received, the water
distribution wasn't successful. Was it dehydration?

215
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:43,200
The judge stopped.

216
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,750
The assistants are taking
care of Yusuke for the moment.

217
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,800
This is really worrying.

218
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:53,100
Later we will have more
information on the details of the race.

219
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:05,740
I've heard that the water distribution failed.

220
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:08,890
You failed?

221
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,290
It's my fault.

222
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,490
You are...?

223
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,750
The race...?

224
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:45,140
Kuroda won.

225
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,590
His school won the first prize as expected.

226
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,650
He was really fast.

227
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,720
Good to see you're awake, I was really worried.

228
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,800
You were sleeping, weren't you?

229
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:02,200
Of course not,
I was just thinking about something.

230
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:05,390
Liar, you were definitely sleeping,
you definitely were.

231
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,600
I'm sorry.

232
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,940
Why didn't you take the water bottle?

233
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,420
It's my fault.

234
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,950
You can come in. He's finally woken up.

235
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,960
I'm sorry.

236
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:56,570
Suddenly I...

237
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,430
I've heard the whole story.

238
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,840
What happened to your Dad...

239
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,360
About what happened in Tokyo.

240
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,810
The person who brought you together again is me.

241
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,840
I know it's sudden.

242
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,510
And I understand your feelings very well.

243
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,660
The water this girl held out..

244
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:23,400
She truly wanted to give you the water.

245
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:25,760
That's the truth.

246
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,000
But you refused it.

247
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:37,270
This means, at the same time, that you
have also refused any help from other people.

248
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,050
No, it doesn't!

249
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:44,600
It's the same thing! It's the same, Yusuke.

250
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,180
Look at this once you're on the plane.

251
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:46,850
When you're home,
I want you to pass this on to your parents.

252
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:13,180
I hope you can forgive me for
passing you this letter so suddenly.

253
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:18,860
I'm the coach of Narikirijima Senior High
School's athletic club: Nishiyura Tenzen.

254
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,330
Iki-san, who passed away saving Naoko,

255
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:28,610
was in the same senior high
school athletic club as I was.

256
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,470
I know about the incident very well.

257
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:38,040
Maybe he floated to the east?

258
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:41,770
I participated in the search the next morning.

259
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,010
I also remember about Naoko-san very well.

260
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:58,390
She answered the questions of the marine safety
crew very specifically. She was very serious.

261
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:18,330
I thought I have to take responsibility.

262
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,340
I have assumed the role of father
in order to take care of Yusuke.

263
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:35,070
But it has always been my own desire.

264
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,500
Yusuke's time hasn't moved forward since then.

265
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:51,720
I felt that it's the same for Naoko-san.

266
00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:00,850
If it's possible,
I would like to move forward both of their times.

267
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,760
Watch out for the pace!

268
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,320
3 min 30 seconds.

269
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,320
Yes!

270
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:14,390
Good, good, let's run like this, that's fine.

271
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:21,480
Hey, don't force yourself.

272
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:22,570
I'm fine already!

273
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:28,090
During this year's summer vacation,
the athletic club will have a training camp.

274
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:33,990
Our goal is to participate in the
marathon relay in September in Nagasaki.

275
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:37,630
I'm not going to beat about the bush,
I'll tell you what I think.

276
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,660
During the training camp this summer,
I'd like Naoko-san to help us.

277
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:47,090
I know very well that it's an unreasonable favour.

278
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,010
I want to go.

279
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,330
For what?

280
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,020
What can you do?

281
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,520
Naoko...

282
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,750
In this world,

283
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,590
there are unchangeable things.

284
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,280
Unchangeable things...

285
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:33,530
can't be changed.

286
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,940
Madam,

287
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:51,900
It was Naoko's own decision, right?

288
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:58,410
If that's so,

289
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,570
then leave the rest to me.

290
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,590
Nishiyura-san,
why are you so concerned about my daughter?

291
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:14,160
Because this summer has to be different.

292
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:20,180
It's my selfishness.

293
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,470
Ey! Ey!

294
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:05,640
What?!

295
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:07,870
This..we are sorry to make you clean the room

296
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,310
but stop digging! You're a girl.

297
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,700
If you're like this, Shinomiya will be shocked.

298
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,100
That's why I told you to clean up!

299
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,910
What are you doing.. Are you stupid or what?

300
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,680
Ah, it's so dirty!

301
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,160
She's here already.

302
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,120
Here, here, come on in.

303
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,290
I'll clean the room right away.

304
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,540
Listen Shinomiya, your bed is here.

305
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:35,040
Ah,
you don't have to help... it's gonna be tidy soon!

306
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:39,170
Hey, introduce yourself.

307
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:42,480
My name is Yuuki Yoshizawa,
I'm the manager of the athletic club.

308
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,480
If you have any questions, feel free to ask me.

309
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:47,730
Ah yes, do you want to live at my place?
It's impossible to live with "that man"!

310
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:52,190
How dare you call your own teacher "that man"...?!

311
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,640
Because you are "that man".

312
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:55,890
Hey, Yusuke, say something.

313
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,160
Well you are "that man".

314
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,960
You don't have to worry, nothing will happen.

315
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:02,000
I'll clean this room.

316
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:03,210
Hurry up!

317
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,350
You don't have to.

318
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,310
You don't have to help, you really don't..

319
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,310
Yuuki, hurry.

320
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,060
It's OK, I'll do it.

321
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:19,270
The coach said we're going to school now.

322
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,410
You should get ready.

323
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,460
What are you doing?

324
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:12,390
You scared me!

325
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,190
They wrote about us.

326
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:25,560
What? It's only about Yusuke.

327
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:28,230
They also write about you, look here.

328
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,940
3rd year student of Namikirijima
Senior High School: Okuda.

329
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:34,170
Combat: Will he be able to run
without falling in the next race?

330
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:36,500
Make sure not to lose your shoes!

331
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:40,870
Oh wait... it's only my imagination!

332
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:42,450
There's nothing like that written in there.

333
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,840
You bastard! Saying such a thing!

334
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:45,710
Wait!

335
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:57,650
Can't help it, that Yusuke.

336
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,560
Now we can finally joke about it,

337
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:01,860
about the fact that Okuda fell.

338
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:02,660
True.

339
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:06,560
But in fact it's your fault the other time!

340
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:09,250
Because you have failed
to take the bottle of water!

341
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,410
I'm sorry!

342
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,560
Is this all you can say?!

343
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,400
It's all about Yusuke.

344
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:22,230
I'm going to buy some juice.

345
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,620
Who is this girl?

346
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:42,100
Hey, everyone look here.

347
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:44,600
I'd like to present...

348
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,350
Hey, Okuda, turn around.

349
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:48,860
Okuda, you're talking the most!

350
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:50,080
Eh, a short introduction

351
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:51,890
Shinomiya is from Tokyo.

352
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,810
From the training camp until the marathon,
she will participate as the manager.

353
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,590
She's our manager.

354
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,720
She's our manager, he said.

355
00:43:57,990 --> 00:43:59,030
She's from Tokyo.

356
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,980
It doesn't matter if she's from Tokyo or not.

357
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:01,850
Oi, Miyazaki.

358
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:02,640
Yes.

359
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:03,480
Greet her properly!

360
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:04,180
Yes.

361
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:05,520
Hurry up with the greeting!

362
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:07,320
Nice to meet you

363
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,600
Nice to meet you too.

364
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:10,190
That's it.

365
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:10,820
What?

366
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:12,510
What is your relationship?

367
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:14,200
Uhm..she's a relative.

368
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:15,650
A relative?

369
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:16,880
Liar!

370
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:17,730
She's from Tokyo!

371
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:21,070
Liar! Liar!

372
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:23,340
She doesn't resemble you at all!

373
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:26,250
Impossible!

374
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:43,800
You were playing weren't you?

375
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:44,550
I wasn't.

376
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:51,890
Listen!

377
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:53,930
Calm down.

378
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:56,430
Calm down I said!

379
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:03,130
This time,
in the National Senior High School Marathon Relay,

380
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:07,500
from today on, we're aiming straight for the top.

381
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:13,970
Up 'til now,
you've always called me "The Smiling Nishiyura".

382
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:14,960
We don't.

383
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,870
But during the training camp,

384
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,960
I'm turning into "The Devil Nishiyura".

385
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:27,490
Starting today,
each day you will run 5 times to Oohama and back.

386
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:28,350
5 times?

387
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:30,450
It's about 50km.

388
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:37,150
Then towards the sea,
you'll run 10 times, there and back.

389
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:41,870
This is the 3 weeks training camp.

390
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:44,660
You're at it again!

391
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,240
You gotta be kidding us.

392
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:48,740
Start the warm up!

393
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,310
Sekikawa!

394
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,040
Yes.

395
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:54,390
OK, split up.

396
00:45:58,060 --> 00:45:59,400
Crouch first.

397
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:04,880
1 2 3 4

398
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:06,390
Louder!

399
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,330
Yes.

400
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:11,810
1 2 3 4

401
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:13,380
5 6 7 8

402
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,480
1 2 3 4

403
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:16,890
5 6 7 8

404
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,980
Louder, even louder!

405
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,550
1 2 3 4

406
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,920
5 6 7 8

407
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:24,040
More!

408
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:25,730
2 2 3 4

409
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:27,660
5 6 7 8

410
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:29,520
Other direction.

411
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,620
1 2 3 4

412
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,150
1km, 3min 40sec.

413
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,070
Yusuke, keep up this pace.

414
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:41,770
It's not working out like that.

415
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:45,250
This isn't enough.

416
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:50,610
Yusuke, accelerate!

417
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,100
Increase speed, 10sec per kilometer!

418
00:46:57,370 --> 00:46:58,120
Yes.

419
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:01,500
We're going to speed up!

420
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:05,580
10sec per kilometer!

421
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:08,780
Run the last 5km!

422
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,000
Within 3 minutes!

423
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:12,510
Yes!

424
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,190
Keep up the speed up for a good pace!

425
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,150
Follow Yusuke!

426
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:24,450
Yoshizaki, what are you doing?

427
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:29,110
You're a pain in the ass for everyone, idiot!

428
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,280
Hurry!

429
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,200
Yes!

430
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:36,400
Don't think you can relax because
you're not an official runner!

431
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:40,010
Run you "vacancy filler"! Otherwise
we don't need you anymore!

432
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:41,580
Run, idiot!

433
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:44,730
Yoshizaki, breathe slowly.

434
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:48,570
Run faster, got it?

435
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:50,140
Yes!

436
00:48:08,730 --> 00:48:11,990
Ahh... why are you guys falling?
You're not allowed to fall yet.

437
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:16,010
Didn't I tell you to train more often
in order to strengthen your muscles?

438
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,570
Did you fall?

439
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:24,110
What's with that face?

440
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,590
Why can't you keep the pace?

441
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:31,450
Always there to rebel.

442
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:36,690
Didn't I tell you to run the last
5 km within 3 minutes, idiot?!

443
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:38,880
Why did you violate my rule?

444
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:41,290
What's up with you?

445
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,600
How are you talking to me?

446
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:49,270
It's impossible.

447
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:51,810
5km within 3 minutes is definitely impossible.

448
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:55,270
You can't run?

449
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:59,370
Do you think you're the only one who can run,
so all the others won't be able to follow?

450
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:01,850
Are you worried about Yoshizaki?

451
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:05,230
Yoshizaki, he underestimates you!

452
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:08,440
He's making fun of you!

453
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,350
When did I make fun of him?

454
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:16,080
That's because you don't trust him,
you're going easy on him.

455
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:16,890
Isn't it like that?

456
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,920
That's proof that you're making fun of him.

457
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:20,610
That's not true.

458
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:37,270
You'll run along the sand beach another 100 times.

459
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:41,820
OK, the others can end their training now.

460
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:45,840
You guys recover, I'll go home.

461
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:47,300
Shinomiya.

462
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:47,850
Yes.

463
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:48,930
Put away the water.

464
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:52,310
Hurry!

465
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:52,860
Yes.

466
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,340
Hurry up!

467
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:12,280
70.

468
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:26,560
71.

469
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:48,520
Ahh... I want to go fishing.

470
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:52,890
Go on, no one will stop you.

471
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,960
But I can't move my body.

472
00:50:57,950 --> 00:51:00,170
Besides, how can I go fishing?

473
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:03,610
I'd be killed, killed I say, if I went.

474
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:11,000
The coach doesn't stop screaming,
"Yusuke, Yusuke".

475
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:13,970
It's not like Yusuke is the only one in the team.

476
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,450
Don't you think so?

477
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:29,820
Are we just here to accompany Yusuke?

478
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:33,720
How is that possible?

479
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:35,060
Yes.

480
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,020
Let go.

481
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:33,670
I can't do this anymore.

482
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:36,110
It's not impossible.

483
00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:38,380
It is.

484
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:40,330
How can you suddenly think like that?

485
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:45,980
You wouldn't understand it anyway.

486
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:00,460
Say something.

487
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,600
Let him go, Yusuke.

488
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,260
I think the same.

489
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:22,250
Captain, what do you think?

490
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:33,550
I think Yoshizaki is at his limit.

491
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:39,550
What are you saying? You really let him go?

492
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,100
Don't act so cool.

493
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:45,990
It's you who doesn't understand the situation.

494
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:56,270
Good morning, everyone.

495
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,850
Yoshizaki is at his limit.

496
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:14,330
That's why we let him go.

497
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,130
Why can't you understand this?

498
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:18,760
Yoshizaki is still able to run.

499
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,810
You really think that?

500
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:48,930
Ey, are you ready?

501
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:22,720
3 km, Yusuke go ahead.

502
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:36,870
Yoshizaki! How many times do I have to tell you?

503
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,730
I told you not to "sway" your upper body!

504
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:40,600
Yes!

505
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,990
But you are! You're not addressing that problem!

506
00:55:44,270 --> 00:55:44,800
I understand.

507
00:55:56,330 --> 00:55:57,030
Yusuke!

508
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:05,300
Why did you stop? You guys too..

509
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:11,540
Why do you go that far? Being that strict.

510
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:14,970
Because I think everyone can run.

511
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,590
Everyone can run fast.

512
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:18,470
Liar!

513
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:20,800
I don't lie, I believe in it.

514
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:24,580
Yoshizaki will definitely be able to run,
I'm absolutely sure about this.

515
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:35,170
I don't have any choice
other than to believe in it.

516
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:36,930
That's the marathon relay.

517
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:41,890
Because you can't do this, you're too weak.

518
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:50,040
Shinomiya!

519
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:07,690
OK, let's go!

520
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:14,160
Go!

521
00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:15,650
Yes.

522
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:02,390
Where are you going?

523
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:09,560
To the seaside,
to listen to the sound of the boats.

524
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:13,290
I'll go too.

525
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:19,580
You can't. You won't make it in time.

526
01:00:57,390 --> 01:00:58,670
Don't force yourself.

527
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:00,130
Go home.

528
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:12,070
I can still run.

529
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:32,630
We're almost there.

530
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:34,440
Do your best.

531
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:47,080
Soon we can hear it!

532
01:01:50,810 --> 01:01:51,330
See?

533
01:02:46,610 --> 01:02:47,600
Thank you.

534
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:51,510
For what?

535
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,740
For believing in my ability to run.

536
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:43,620
See you...

537
01:03:46,730 --> 01:03:49,640
Yes... See you tomorrow.

538
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:08,640
Coach, coach!

539
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:14,290
Coach!

540
01:04:14,990 --> 01:04:19,320
Call the doc-...The do-

541
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:20,830
Call the doctor.

542
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,330
Hold on, coach!

543
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:49,760
What is it? It's me! It's gonna be fine..

544
01:04:50,870 --> 01:04:52,440
Say what you want...

545
01:04:53,030 --> 01:04:54,830
It's fine.

546
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:01,660
It's too late.

547
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:08,630
If it's affected even there...

548
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:16,850
This means that there is
no need to fight the cancer.

549
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:23,580
It's not guaranteed that using these
products will help against the pain.

550
01:05:27,510 --> 01:05:28,560
OK, I understand.

551
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:36,830
Can't help it. I see...

552
01:05:48,370 --> 01:05:49,070
Senpai.

553
01:05:57,450 --> 01:05:58,740
2 Bananas for each.

554
01:05:58,790 --> 01:05:59,430
Yes.

555
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:03,800
Captain.

556
01:06:04,270 --> 01:06:04,690
Yes, yes.

557
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:05,430
OK.

558
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:10,850
Then... Enjoy your meal!

559
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:17,780
I have to tell you guys something.

560
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:19,240
Yes, yes.

561
01:06:19,770 --> 01:06:23,440
Because of some school projects, Coach Nishiyura
will be leaving team training as of today.

562
01:06:24,130 --> 01:06:31,680
Ahh, good to hear! We can
lighten our training schedule..

563
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:39,510
No! We have to keep on doing it!

564
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:45,920
Keep on? Definitely not...

565
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:47,990
The training schedule has changed a bit.

566
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:50,880
The route to Oohama and back
has been reduced to 3 times.

567
01:06:50,930 --> 01:06:56,520
Awesome!

568
01:06:58,100 --> 01:06:58,600
What?

569
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:01,650
You're the captain aren't you?
You should set a good example.

570
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:09,530
So as compensation for it,
increase the speed to 20 km/h.

571
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:11,260
20 km?

572
01:07:11,550 --> 01:07:12,950
What the hell?!

573
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:17,390
The training comes to an end. How can you relax!

574
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:18,190
That's right.

575
01:07:28,330 --> 01:07:30,490
Yusuke, where are you going to?

576
01:07:46,450 --> 01:07:49,720
Yusuke! You're too fast!

577
01:07:49,770 --> 01:07:51,810
Slow down your pace.

578
01:07:55,830 --> 01:07:57,280
What's wrong with him?!

579
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:07,590
Total 16min 48sec.

580
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:10,740
Last km, time used: 3 min 20 sec.

581
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:12,720
20 sec too late.

582
01:08:12,890 --> 01:08:16,680
Walk around a little,
otherwise you'll get even worse later.

583
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:20,820
Come on, stand up!

584
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:24,550
Hurry, walk.

585
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:27,520
Everyone, let's do our best.

586
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:35,440
Come on, it will get worse later.

587
01:08:38,820 --> 01:08:39,540
Walk around a bit.

588
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:44,990
Takuji-senpai,

589
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:47,790
when you run your body is too soft.

590
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:52,510
Don't be so soft, you have to run firmly.

591
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:54,230
Yes.

592
01:08:57,170 --> 01:09:02,990
Mokusen senpai, you have to raise your chin more,
please pay attention to it.

593
01:09:16,390 --> 01:09:18,780
Okuda senpai, stand up, just walk around a little.

594
01:09:20,530 --> 01:09:27,690
Okuda senpai, your elbow, you should be ruthless,
like you're beating a drum "tong tong tong".

595
01:09:29,150 --> 01:09:30,900
Shut up! I know!

596
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:34,120
That the elbow is my weakpoint...
But you think it's easy to change?!

597
01:09:36,310 --> 01:09:37,650
Then please work on it!

598
01:09:37,890 --> 01:09:39,630
What? You bastard...

599
01:09:39,690 --> 01:09:42,610
Wait, wait.

600
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:44,470
You guys, let me go!

601
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:47,440
I just want to win!

602
01:09:47,670 --> 01:09:50,000
I want to win too! Isn't that obvious?

603
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:59,790
If you do what I say, then we'll win.

604
01:10:00,550 --> 01:10:02,590
What did you say?

605
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:05,790
Calm down.

606
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:25,130
Yusuke.

607
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:32,590
Are we...

608
01:10:37,710 --> 01:10:41,620
Are we only small pieces that
have to pass you the baton?

609
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:14,410
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10...

610
01:11:14,530 --> 01:11:17,150
OK, finish!

611
01:11:20,470 --> 01:11:22,080
It's OK. Good job.

612
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:25,770
Why are you so glad about it?

613
01:11:27,110 --> 01:11:28,990
Ouch, ouch, ouch...

614
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:31,310
Drink, are you OK?

615
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:34,510
You only have a 5 minute break.

616
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:36,140
Only 5 minutes!

617
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:36,960
Why?

618
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:22,570
What shall I do?

619
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:25,250
I don't know.

620
01:13:55,250 --> 01:13:56,710
What are you doing?

621
01:13:58,570 --> 01:13:59,560
Can't you see?

622
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:02,650
I'm swimming!

623
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:16,810
Ey, don't stop, walk around!

624
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:18,790
Walk around a little!

625
01:14:35,970 --> 01:14:36,850
You guys...

626
01:14:37,550 --> 01:14:39,880
You look like a bear in the zoo.

627
01:14:39,990 --> 01:14:40,870
What's this?

628
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:43,140
OK, gather!

629
01:14:43,430 --> 01:14:44,590
Yes...

630
01:14:50,540 --> 01:14:52,540
Congratulations to all for following the training.

631
01:14:53,570 --> 01:14:55,200
Today I have great news for you!

632
01:14:57,180 --> 01:14:58,470
Don't be surprised.

633
01:14:58,520 --> 01:14:59,980
Barbeque!

634
01:15:03,470 --> 01:15:04,630
You're not happy?

635
01:15:08,590 --> 01:15:10,580
Look.

636
01:15:11,450 --> 01:15:12,670
A lot of meat!

637
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:23,620
Meat!

638
01:15:24,850 --> 01:15:29,450
As an exchange,
tomorrow you will have to train even more, got it?

639
01:15:29,570 --> 01:15:30,910
Yes.

640
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,120
Today, let's enjoy ourselves!

641
01:15:34,230 --> 01:15:36,910
Don't push me!

642
01:15:54,270 --> 01:15:55,550
What are you doing?

643
01:15:56,650 --> 01:15:57,880
You're not allowed to drink!

644
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:00,850
Don't be such a puritan!

645
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:07,550
The wind is fresh, the sea is beautiful.

646
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:13,020
My beloved guys are here.

647
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:17,510
And even more my beloved beer.

648
01:16:18,910 --> 01:16:22,640
A gathering like this... I
guess it's the last time.

649
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:40,580
I want to be a cloud.

650
01:16:42,790 --> 01:16:45,650
Become a very large, very large cloud

651
01:16:47,390 --> 01:16:49,080
so I can watch over you guys forever.

652
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:53,860
Yusuke.

653
01:16:57,180 --> 01:16:58,930
During the next competition,

654
01:17:02,190 --> 01:17:05,630
you don't have to think about me!

655
01:17:08,710 --> 01:17:11,280
You run all together.

656
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:13,140
That's the marathon relay.

657
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:19,030
No matter what you say.

658
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:23,510
I'll run for you!

659
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:26,130
I'll win for you!

660
01:17:32,070 --> 01:17:34,460
Do you really think it'll turn out this good?

661
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:34,700
What happened?

662
01:18:36,740 --> 01:18:37,670
Nothing.

663
01:18:39,070 --> 01:18:40,230
Too stupid.

664
01:20:26,310 --> 01:20:28,040
Coach...

665
01:20:33,170 --> 01:20:35,550
Do you have a moment?

666
01:20:36,740 --> 01:20:39,450
Sure, come on in.

667
01:20:57,830 --> 01:20:59,520
Everyone is breaking apart?

668
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:01,760
Yes.

669
01:21:07,670 --> 01:21:09,420
I can't do anything,

670
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:13,500
but watch over it.

671
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:22,290
It's the same for me.

672
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:27,540
Things aren't going that well..

673
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:31,500
Seems like there are only
hopeless things out there.

674
01:21:35,980 --> 01:21:37,730
What shall we do?

675
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:44,960
Hopeless things will stay hopeless after all?

676
01:21:49,090 --> 01:21:50,290
Shinomiya,

677
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:55,520
what are we running for?

678
01:22:00,660 --> 01:22:03,450
I often ask this question myself.

679
01:22:17,530 --> 01:22:18,550
10 seconds to go!

680
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:23,810
Get set,

681
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:37,570
Do your best, come on!

682
01:22:49,510 --> 01:22:53,570
Today the Nagasaki Student High
School Marathon Relay has finally started.

683
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:57,500
Starting at the port,
bypassing the surrounding hills,

684
01:22:57,550 --> 01:23:03,540
then passing through the nearby village, and finally passing
the bridge and returning to the start; it's a round trip.

685
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:11,420
At this moment the runners are
entering the first part of the race.

686
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:14,020
It's a sharp ascent.

687
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:17,390
Because of the different levels of the runners,
the gaps will be created here.

688
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:19,440
This is one of the most cruel passage of the race.

689
01:23:24,130 --> 01:23:26,570
There are currently 15 runners
who entered this passage,

690
01:23:26,620 --> 01:23:29,550
their differences aren't that large.

691
01:23:30,970 --> 01:23:34,630
But as the last of the bunch remains the runner
of Namikirijima Senior High School, Yoshizaki.

692
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:36,830
He's still a 1st year student.

693
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:39,480
Looks like it's painful for him.

694
01:23:39,660 --> 01:23:43,270
Because he is a 1st year student,
might this passage be too hard for him?

695
01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:44,980
The pace is really fast.

696
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:03,340
See?

697
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:08,090
It's impossible for me!

698
01:24:27,310 --> 01:24:29,870
Look carefully at Yusuke's back,

699
01:24:30,210 --> 01:24:32,180
How can you win seeing Yusuke's back, that way?

700
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:35,630
Never forget about this!

701
01:24:40,060 --> 01:24:42,030
Go and take a close-up look at his back!

702
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:43,810
Go!

703
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:06,630
I can run...

704
01:25:07,850 --> 01:25:09,780
I can run!

705
01:25:10,530 --> 01:25:13,390
Yusuke, wait for me!

706
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:32,320
Behind him is 1st year student
Yoshizaki from Namikirijima.

707
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:34,530
He's showing incredible strength

708
01:25:34,590 --> 01:25:36,340
on the hill road.

709
01:25:36,690 --> 01:25:39,250
He managed to join the troupe.

710
01:25:42,690 --> 01:25:43,450
Damn it.

711
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:49,270
The first race is for Yoshizaki.

712
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:52,590
I was pissed.

713
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:58,650
For this section it wasn't me..nor Miyazaki,
who were chosen.

714
01:25:59,180 --> 01:26:01,000
Why is it Yoshizaki?

715
01:26:03,310 --> 01:26:05,760
But after seeing his running, I'm satisfied.

716
01:26:08,030 --> 01:26:11,060
This guy in incredible.

717
01:26:31,330 --> 01:26:32,550
Yusuke.

718
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:36,690
I hate you.

719
01:26:40,770 --> 01:26:44,090
You run faster than everyone
and you're a nice guy.

720
01:26:46,010 --> 01:26:49,740
But what I hate even more
is that I'm jealous of you.

721
01:26:53,820 --> 01:26:55,390
I hate myself the most.

722
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:20,260
Here, here

723
01:27:25,450 --> 01:27:26,560
Yoshizaki!

724
01:27:50,090 --> 01:27:51,080
Yusuke,

725
01:27:54,050 --> 01:27:58,420
I did a good race.

726
01:28:00,870 --> 01:28:03,610
Yes, I know.

727
01:28:04,890 --> 01:28:09,610
Usually you'd ask "Did I do good??"

728
01:28:18,050 --> 01:28:19,280
I

729
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:25,280
did a good race.

730
01:28:40,070 --> 01:28:43,860
After the bridge of Megami we will
leave Nagasaki city for the moment,

731
01:28:44,030 --> 01:28:47,650
We are entering the second passage of the race,
which requires a lot of speed.

732
01:28:49,510 --> 01:28:54,110
Do your best!

733
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:56,450
Like the elbows beating a drum..

734
01:28:56,500 --> 01:29:02,520
Tong tong tong...

735
01:29:08,470 --> 01:29:09,560
I can do it.

736
01:29:09,610 --> 01:29:10,480
Do your best!

737
01:29:19,390 --> 01:29:22,370
Okuda of Namikirijima Senior
High School is really fast!

738
01:29:22,660 --> 01:29:24,810
He's surpassed a runner of
the famous Izagaya school.

739
01:29:24,990 --> 01:29:26,560
He has taken the lead in a short time.

740
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:30,520
His current running is over
the average pace of the race.

741
01:29:31,630 --> 01:29:33,610
Ahh... he's too fast!

742
01:29:37,050 --> 01:29:39,490
Ah! Runner Okuda fell!

743
01:29:49,630 --> 01:29:52,020
Damn, I did it again.

744
01:29:59,820 --> 01:30:00,580
Damn it.

745
01:30:19,510 --> 01:30:23,530
Do your best!

746
01:30:23,590 --> 01:30:26,390
I...

747
01:30:34,950 --> 01:30:35,710
Good.

748
01:30:38,970 --> 01:30:40,540
Coach, are you OK?

749
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:43,280
It's nothing, nothing. It's over soon.

750
01:30:56,790 --> 01:31:00,930
Halfway down the downhill section,
we can see the following runners.

751
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:06,700
Oh, Okuda of Namikirijima.

752
01:31:06,990 --> 01:31:10,080
Oh, he's holding his right shoulder,
seems like he's in pain.

753
01:31:10,130 --> 01:31:11,890
Perhaps he got injured when he fell a while ago.

754
01:31:11,940 --> 01:31:13,510
Looks like it's painful for him.

755
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:17,190
Because of his fall,
he was in the twelfth position.

756
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:19,630
But currently he's in the tenth position.

757
01:31:27,490 --> 01:31:29,720
It is not known whether he can complete his route.

758
01:31:29,770 --> 01:31:32,770
But runner Okuda seems to suffer a
lot and he falls behind the forerunners.

759
01:31:34,300 --> 01:31:38,490
He can't move his arm but his
speed continues to accelerate.

760
01:31:38,540 --> 01:31:41,920
But runner Okuda doesn't give up!

761
01:31:48,410 --> 01:31:49,750
Such a mess...

762
01:31:53,530 --> 01:31:55,280
Third runner, get ready!

763
01:31:58,490 --> 01:32:04,540
Do your best!

764
01:32:05,590 --> 01:32:07,050
It's the end here!

765
01:32:11,590 --> 01:32:13,220
I'm counting on you!

766
01:32:18,580 --> 01:32:23,590
Senpai, are you OK?

767
01:32:35,540 --> 01:32:37,170
What should we do?

768
01:32:37,570 --> 01:32:40,140
It hurts, it hurts...

769
01:32:51,850 --> 01:32:52,840
Senpai!

770
01:32:56,160 --> 01:32:57,320
Goto?

771
01:33:01,110 --> 01:33:04,600
When we return to the island, let's go fishing!

772
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:09,440
What are you talking about at such a moment?

773
01:33:18,530 --> 01:33:22,550
This time, we will go for sure!

774
01:33:31,050 --> 01:33:32,450
Fujimoto!

775
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:34,720
Wait!

776
01:33:37,750 --> 01:33:38,630
Okuda!

777
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:39,590
Senpai Okuda!

778
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:40,200
Do your best!

779
01:33:40,260 --> 01:33:42,180
Be careful, lower your head!

780
01:33:42,230 --> 01:33:43,990
It's fine. It hurts, uncle!

781
01:33:45,030 --> 01:33:46,150
Lower your head!

782
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:46,730
Do your best!

783
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:47,940
It hurts, it hurts!

784
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:11,650
It's team member Heiso,

785
01:34:11,770 --> 01:34:13,460
We don't see this often in a marathon.

786
01:34:13,630 --> 01:34:15,850
Though it oughtn't to be encouraged..

787
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:20,160
However, Fujimoto of Namikirijima has recovered.

788
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:22,610
He's currently in the ninth position!

789
01:34:24,940 --> 01:34:30,530
Yoshizaki, don't you want to meet everyone?

790
01:34:33,030 --> 01:34:35,650
Yes, I want to.

791
01:34:39,850 --> 01:34:41,600
Everyone breaking apart...

792
01:34:43,990 --> 01:34:45,710
In order meet again at the end of the race.

793
01:34:49,010 --> 01:34:50,840
This race is really weird.

794
01:34:56,370 --> 01:34:57,790
A weird race.

795
01:35:24,590 --> 01:35:28,370
Yusuke, Yusuke...

796
01:35:29,070 --> 01:35:30,410
Yusuke!

797
01:35:41,540 --> 01:35:44,220
Sasagi, it's the finish spurt! Do your best!

798
01:35:48,060 --> 01:35:49,350
Pass it to Yusuke!

799
01:35:54,060 --> 01:35:57,500
Pass it to Yusuke!

800
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:02,030
Even the names of classmates
of a team are sent to the relay.

801
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:03,790
This is the fun side of the relays.

802
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:07,010
The last runner who must get
prepared now is Namikirijima's Iki Yusuke.

803
01:36:07,060 --> 01:36:08,940
He seems to be very important for Namikirijima.

804
01:36:17,190 --> 01:36:20,980
Shinomiya, please go to cheer on Yusuke.

805
01:36:22,900 --> 01:36:24,070
And you, Coach?

806
01:36:26,630 --> 01:36:28,090
My stomach hurts a bit.

807
01:36:28,730 --> 01:36:30,530
I want to rest here a little more.

808
01:36:37,290 --> 01:36:39,500
When you go to Yusuke...

809
01:36:41,370 --> 01:36:43,640
I don't know what you can do either, but...

810
01:36:45,850 --> 01:36:47,600
But since his father's death,

811
01:36:49,410 --> 01:36:52,200
you're the one who ran
the same distance as he did.

812
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:56,750
No matter how...

813
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:02,400
There are things only you can do.

814
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,110
Please.

815
01:38:05,190 --> 01:38:07,820
Currently, the leader is from Izagaya High School.

816
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:11,140
Second is Gotou High and the third is..

817
01:38:11,190 --> 01:38:12,130
Are you ready?

818
01:38:13,330 --> 01:38:13,830
Yes!

819
01:38:13,980 --> 01:38:17,490
Are you OK?

820
01:38:17,540 --> 01:38:20,570
The runner for Namikirijima is
slowly catching up with the troupe!

821
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:22,850
Currently it's the captain,
Miyazaki, who is catching up.

822
01:38:22,900 --> 01:38:26,570
He's in the seventh position right now.

823
01:38:26,980 --> 01:38:29,310
Miyazaki accelerates his steps.

824
01:38:29,540 --> 01:38:31,240
He's doing his best for the remaining term.

825
01:38:31,290 --> 01:38:35,250
He's gritting his teeth,
his facial expression look serious.

826
01:38:35,430 --> 01:38:38,570
Is there a chance of winning
something for the Namikirijima team?

827
01:38:39,510 --> 01:38:43,580
If we're able to pass it to Yusuke,
we may have a chance to win!

828
01:38:51,160 --> 01:39:19,120
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10...

829
01:39:19,580 --> 01:39:20,520
Stop, good job.

830
01:39:36,590 --> 01:39:39,510
OK, let's go!

831
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:47,550
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10...

832
01:40:00,830 --> 01:40:01,640
Yusuke.

833
01:40:11,370 --> 01:40:12,360
I'm scared.

834
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:18,480
It's the first time..

835
01:40:52,150 --> 01:41:01,760
Pass it to Yusuke, pass it Yusuke...

836
01:41:03,860 --> 01:41:05,620
We were waiting for you!

837
01:41:05,670 --> 01:41:08,410
Pass it to Yusuke, pass it to Yusuke...

838
01:41:08,460 --> 01:41:09,870
You definitely have to pass it to Yusuke!

839
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:10,620
YES!

840
01:41:10,910 --> 01:41:11,900
Gooo!

841
01:41:16,210 --> 01:41:17,960
Very well done, Miyazaki!

842
01:41:21,740 --> 01:41:22,560
Captain.

843
01:41:25,700 --> 01:41:28,560
I'm the captain you know, wait a little..

844
01:41:37,700 --> 01:41:39,740
Are you OK? Just throw up.

845
01:41:50,290 --> 01:41:51,340
Captain.

846
01:42:12,770 --> 01:42:16,210
Yusuke, Yusuke, so annoying.

847
01:42:18,190 --> 01:42:22,500
I'm doing my best too!

848
01:42:36,250 --> 01:42:37,300
Uehara!

849
01:42:38,930 --> 01:42:39,570
Yusuke?

850
01:42:41,550 --> 01:42:43,820
You're almost finished! Take off the sash!

851
01:42:46,620 --> 01:42:48,170
Yusuke.

852
01:42:54,260 --> 01:42:55,500
Yusuke!

853
01:43:06,310 --> 01:43:09,570
Bastard, don't you dare lose!

854
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:23,200
Do your best, do your best!

855
01:43:55,590 --> 01:43:58,630
Yusuke Iki is running as fast as the wind.

856
01:43:58,680 --> 01:44:00,550
When he received the cloth sash,
he was in the seventh position.

857
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:02,530
He has already overtaken two runners,
he's in the 5th position now.

858
01:44:02,580 --> 01:44:03,570
Outdistanced.

859
01:44:04,330 --> 01:44:05,390
Outdistanced again.

860
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:07,660
He climbed up to the third position!

861
01:44:07,710 --> 01:44:09,460
This is the technique for short distance races.

862
01:44:09,510 --> 01:44:10,850
Can he keep it up until the end?

863
01:44:11,030 --> 01:44:17,500
If he can keep it up, then he'll be
able to catch up to runner Shin Kuroda.

864
01:44:27,340 --> 01:44:47,730
Come on.

865
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:04,510
Kuroda, Kuroda, Kuroda...

866
01:45:17,210 --> 01:45:18,140
You caught up.

867
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:19,450
Yes.

868
01:45:19,710 --> 01:45:21,630
Fine then, let's go!

869
01:45:28,450 --> 01:45:29,910
The first runner is arriving!

870
01:45:29,960 --> 01:45:30,900
Get the water ready.

871
01:45:32,580 --> 01:45:33,990
The second is arriving as well.

872
01:45:34,040 --> 01:45:34,840
Get the water ready.

873
01:45:51,110 --> 01:45:52,680
Mom, mom!

874
01:46:22,740 --> 01:46:24,900
Do your best!

875
01:47:34,510 --> 01:47:36,670
I have money for everyone.

876
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:45,400
Let's go!

877
01:47:47,330 --> 01:47:48,780
Paying 5 tickets!

878
01:47:56,530 --> 01:47:58,570
Yusuke obviously seems to suffer.

879
01:47:58,860 --> 01:48:02,430
He's tottering and his upper body is swaying.

880
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:04,050
Is he already at his limits?

881
01:48:04,510 --> 01:48:06,900
Will the cloth sash stop here?

882
01:48:08,360 --> 01:48:09,580
Yusuke.

883
01:48:15,810 --> 01:48:16,510
Yusuke.

884
01:48:45,290 --> 01:48:47,500
Why is it so resistant?

885
01:48:59,620 --> 01:49:01,660
I want to return to the
island as soon as possible.

886
01:49:10,630 --> 01:49:15,700
Dad, why am I running?

887
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:18,610
Dad..

888
01:49:33,990 --> 01:49:34,860
Yusuke!

889
01:49:43,830 --> 01:49:45,000
Yusuke!

890
01:49:56,240 --> 01:50:00,150
You... Were you running all the way along?

891
01:50:12,610 --> 01:50:13,600
I'm going.

892
01:50:23,100 --> 01:50:24,550
Yusuke!

893
01:50:25,490 --> 01:50:27,470
You have to win!

894
01:50:33,320 --> 01:50:35,510
You definitely have to win!

895
01:50:46,750 --> 01:50:54,550
Shin Kuroda, Shin Kuroda...

896
01:51:00,550 --> 01:51:06,730
Come on, do your best!

897
01:51:17,560 --> 01:51:19,720
It's Naoko, Naoko!

898
01:51:20,240 --> 01:51:20,940
Shinomiya!

899
01:51:23,100 --> 01:51:24,260
Shinomiya!

900
01:51:27,820 --> 01:51:28,630
Get in the car!

901
01:51:44,650 --> 01:51:46,460
Shout together to encourage them.

902
01:51:46,630 --> 01:51:51,820
Go, Go, Go...

903
01:51:52,170 --> 01:51:53,050
Is he coming?

904
01:51:53,100 --> 01:51:53,920
Not yet.

905
01:52:02,190 --> 01:52:03,000
He's coming!

906
01:52:15,820 --> 01:52:18,790
He's coming, he's coming.

907
01:52:19,660 --> 01:52:23,450
Yusuke, Yusuke, Yusuke...

908
01:52:30,950 --> 01:52:36,440
Yusuke, Yusuke, Yusuke...

909
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:39,590
Everyone.

910
01:52:47,510 --> 01:52:49,660
Yusuke, do your best!

911
01:53:03,880 --> 01:53:07,610
Yusuke, Yusuke...

912
01:53:13,610 --> 01:53:18,560
Yusuke, amazing, we won! We won!

913
01:53:18,670 --> 01:53:20,540
You were great!

914
01:53:20,710 --> 01:53:23,340
You were so awesome!

915
01:53:23,570 --> 01:53:25,320
We did it! We did it!

916
01:53:25,370 --> 01:53:27,120
Here, have some water.

917
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:29,510
Say something, Yusuke.

918
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:33,180
Coach... Where is the coach?

919
01:53:38,130 --> 01:53:39,180
Where have you been?

920
01:53:41,390 --> 01:53:44,660
I've been watching you... I've been watching you!

921
01:53:46,990 --> 01:53:48,270
We did it!

922
01:53:51,650 --> 01:53:53,450
I've been watching all of you closely!

923
01:53:56,420 --> 01:53:58,580
Close to you, I have not left!

924
01:54:10,170 --> 01:54:13,670
We won. We won.

925
01:54:17,570 --> 01:54:21,010
Good job, good job, boy!

926
01:54:33,880 --> 01:54:34,700
Thank you!

927
01:54:41,030 --> 01:55:00,270
We did it! We did it!

928
01:55:38,190 --> 01:55:40,170
Two month after the competition.

929
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:43,490
Coach Nishiyura has passed away.

930
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:49,840
Everyone in the athletic club is still running.

931
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:56,720
Of course, Yusuke too.
