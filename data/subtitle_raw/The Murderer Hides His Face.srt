6
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:16,957
She was lying in the rain the whole night.

7
00:04:18,367 --> 00:04:20,039
- Who found her?
- I did.

8
00:04:21,447 --> 00:04:23,199
Bureš.

9
00:04:23,247 --> 00:04:26,637
Actually, it was Rex that found her.
He dragged me here as if he was mad.

10
00:04:26,687 --> 00:04:28,564
- When was that?
- This morning.

11
00:04:28,607 --> 00:04:31,246
- When exactly?
- After eight.

12
00:04:33,247 --> 00:04:36,364
Fracture of the skull,
cerebral hemorrhage presumably.

13
00:04:37,007 --> 00:04:40,443
Death occured probably yesterday,
around the evening.

14
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:43,636
- Did you get her identity?
- Marcela Brychová.

15
00:04:43,687 --> 00:04:46,042
She worked as a nurse
at the health centre in town.

16
00:04:46,087 --> 00:04:49,716
- It's a second case already.
- Similar to the one three months ago.

17
00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:53,247
- That Menšíková rape.
- Right, laceration of the head again.

18
00:04:53,282 --> 00:04:54,999
Probably with a stone.

19
00:04:55,847 --> 00:04:59,476
We found one button here
and another one nearby.

20
00:04:59,527 --> 00:05:04,647
- They probably tore off as he dragged her over here.
- She might have just as well crawled here herself.

21
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:16,600
- Is that all she had with her?
- Yes, Comrade Major.

22
00:05:19,127 --> 00:05:22,802
- Where had you found Menšíková back then?
- Here in these woods as well.

23
00:05:22,847 --> 00:05:25,486
About fifteen minutes from here,
right by the road.

24
00:05:25,527 --> 00:05:29,156
When going home from work, she would always go
through here to the neighboring village.

25
00:05:33,007 --> 00:05:34,565
That trail?

26
00:05:34,647 --> 00:05:37,366
It leads to the gamekeeper's cottage
and to the weekend houses.

27
00:05:37,927 --> 00:05:42,717
Then it goes on to the highway to Prague.
It's a shortcut.

28
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,082
- I don't think so.
- What?

29
00:05:46,687 --> 00:05:50,919
- That this was also sexually motivated.
- And what about the way she was killed?

30
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:55,116
- With a stone...
- That might have served to deceive us.

31
00:05:56,047 --> 00:05:59,835
- Yes, but...
- Anyone could have used the murder as a cover.

32
00:06:17,487 --> 00:06:21,082
He could have found out about that Menšíková's
regular route and wait for her here.

33
00:06:21,127 --> 00:06:22,799
But what about this one?

34
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:26,081
- Would she often go through here?
- Hardly.

35
00:06:27,447 --> 00:06:30,086
Yesterday was Sunday,
what was she possibly looking for here?

36
00:06:30,127 --> 00:06:31,922
- A date?
- Well, her husband's serving in the military.

37
00:06:31,923 --> 00:06:32,682
I haven't seen him around in a while.

38
00:06:32,687 --> 00:06:36,396
- She lived with his parents.
- Was she cheating on him?

39
00:07:37,887 --> 00:07:40,401
That's all she had when she married him.

40
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:44,720
She didn't even have her own sheets.
The furniture is my son's as well.

41
00:07:46,487 --> 00:07:48,239
Does he know already?

42
00:07:49,327 --> 00:07:51,397
My husband is on his way to get him.

43
00:07:52,047 --> 00:07:55,357
When was the last time he was here?
Your son.

44
00:07:57,367 --> 00:08:00,803
It's been almost half a year.

45
00:08:01,407 --> 00:08:06,322
Didn't Marcela tell you where she was
going yesterday?

46
00:08:08,807 --> 00:08:11,241
No...

47
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:15,677
And didn't you think it was strange
when she didn't return in the evening?

48
00:08:16,727 --> 00:08:22,518
Well, my husband and I were thinking
that perhaps she stayed with a friend over night.

49
00:08:23,687 --> 00:08:25,678
What friend, for instance?

50
00:08:26,927 --> 00:08:31,443
- She had several.
- Since you didn't think it was strange,

51
00:08:32,607 --> 00:08:35,440
you must have been thinking of one specific friend,
haven't you?

52
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:40,117
Do you really not remember?

53
00:08:41,007 --> 00:08:44,079
Mrs. Brychová,
and what about Tána Válková?

54
00:08:44,647 --> 00:08:47,605
The one who married that engineer from Prague.

55
00:08:48,247 --> 00:08:50,966
Marcela used to hang out with her
around here, didn't she?

56
00:08:51,247 --> 00:08:54,603
- Sometimes.
- They have a weekend house in the woods.

57
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:58,162
- Others have weekend houses too.
- Who, for example?

58
00:08:59,567 --> 00:09:01,558
Doctor from the health centre.

59
00:09:02,247 --> 00:09:05,842
- The one Marcela worked for?
- Doctor Winter, yes.

60
00:09:05,887 --> 00:09:07,559
His office is in the small castle.

61
00:09:29,005 --> 00:09:31,377

63
00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:29,077
Tereza Menšíková,
and now Marcela.

64
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,123
It's like a bad dream.

65
00:10:36,767 --> 00:10:40,680
- Do you think that the same person did it?
- We don't know yet.

66
00:10:41,967 --> 00:10:46,483
But perhaps you could tell us what was she
doing in the woods yesterday. Where was she going?

67
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,556
I'm sorry, I don't know. Please.

68
00:10:54,327 --> 00:10:56,477
- Is that her desk?
- Yes.

69
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:04,045
Since when did
Mrs. Brychová work for you?

70
00:11:04,447 --> 00:11:06,199
Since the beginning of the year.

71
00:11:06,447 --> 00:11:10,406
I knew her more or less only from the office.

72
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,921
And did you know her more or less?

73
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:17,123
I knew her normally.

74
00:11:18,207 --> 00:11:20,880
Is it true that you have a weekend house
by those woods?

75
00:11:22,327 --> 00:11:25,603
- Yes.
- Did you happen to be there yesterday afternoon?

76
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,598
- I did.
- By yourself?

77
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:31,917
Mr. Král was with me.
He's our repairman.

78
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:35,960
He's been repairing my roof, so I went
to take a look in the afternoon.

79
00:11:36,007 --> 00:11:37,725
Did you go together?

80
00:11:38,087 --> 00:11:40,840
No. He had been working since morning.

81
00:11:43,247 --> 00:11:47,001
- He wasn't finished yet, so...
- You went back by yourself.

82
00:11:47,127 --> 00:11:49,243
- Yes, but...
- What time approximately?

83
00:11:50,207 --> 00:11:53,563
Around five.
But I'm not sure.

84
00:11:54,487 --> 00:11:57,797
- And didn't you see anyone on your way back?
- No.

85
00:11:59,847 --> 00:12:03,522
- Does that repairman live in this building?
- Yes. On the second floor.

86
00:12:07,647 --> 00:12:10,081
- Do you think he's home now?
- I'll go take a look.

87
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:17,519
What is it, Radka?

88
00:12:18,327 --> 00:12:20,443
Is your Daddy home? Wait.

89
00:12:26,327 --> 00:12:28,443
What was it?

90
00:12:30,087 --> 00:12:34,638
Didn't Mrs. Brychová confide in you
something we should know about?

91
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,245
Well...

92
00:12:36,887 --> 00:12:41,563
She was a bit testy lately.
Probably because of her husband's long absence.

93
00:12:41,647 --> 00:12:43,717
- He's...
- Yes, I know.

94
00:12:44,567 --> 00:12:48,446
- Was anyone interested in her?
- I don't know.

95
00:12:49,487 --> 00:12:52,240
- Are you married?
- Divorced.

96
00:12:53,687 --> 00:12:55,962
Is that important?

97
00:12:57,367 --> 00:13:01,406
Repairman?
I'm more of a housekeeper here.

98
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:05,565
- When did you leave the Doctor's house yesterday?
- Yesterday?

99
00:13:05,687 --> 00:13:09,885
'Round the evening. It started raining,
so I went to the state farm.

100
00:13:10,807 --> 00:13:13,162
My brother's in charge there.

101
00:13:13,207 --> 00:13:16,358
- Was there anyone else around the weekend houses?
- No.

102
00:13:17,727 --> 00:13:20,958
Wait a second...
Michal was there.

103
00:13:21,007 --> 00:13:24,397
A boy from the farm. He's a little...

104
00:13:24,447 --> 00:13:28,156
- He always tends horses by the woods.
- And when did Doctor leave?

105
00:13:28,727 --> 00:13:31,082
Doctor... doctor...

106
00:13:31,447 --> 00:13:35,804
I don't know the exact time.
It was before the sunset.

107
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:40,323
But he's got nothing to do with this.

108
00:13:41,847 --> 00:13:46,716
- Did you see Brychová?
- Or the gamekeeper? - No.

109
00:13:47,807 --> 00:13:49,843
- Radka, what is it?
- Lunch.

110
00:13:51,127 --> 00:13:53,118
OK.

111
00:13:53,407 --> 00:13:56,240
- We don't want to hold you. Enjoy your meal.
- Enjoy your meal.

112
00:13:56,327 --> 00:13:58,238
Hm.

113
00:14:03,647 --> 00:14:06,480
- How old is that girl?
- Radka? Sixteen.

114
00:14:07,007 --> 00:14:10,158
- Sixteen... she looks older.
- She does.

115
00:14:11,407 --> 00:14:15,446
She's not his daughter. He married her mom
when the girl was two years old.

116
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,443
But they say he's a good dad.

117
00:14:17,687 --> 00:14:19,359
And what about Válková?

118
00:14:20,007 --> 00:14:22,475
Well, they've known each other since they
were little.

119
00:14:23,767 --> 00:14:29,603
When they would come from Prague, Marcela would
be at her weekend house all the time.

120
00:14:33,407 --> 00:14:36,205
Would anyone else come visit Brychová here?

121
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,759
There was also...
Wait a second, what was her name?

122
00:14:42,807 --> 00:14:45,082
- Kveta Kramárová.
- Who is she?

123
00:14:45,687 --> 00:14:47,678
She's an accountant at the state farm.

124
00:14:53,087 --> 00:14:58,078
STATE FARM POLNÁ

125
00:15:37,647 --> 00:15:39,558
Jerk!

126
00:15:59,527 --> 00:16:01,245
Let's see.

127
00:16:02,767 --> 00:16:04,883
Can you hit that bottle?

128
00:16:07,247 --> 00:16:09,044
Huh?

129
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,965
Nice.

130
00:16:24,327 --> 00:16:26,238
You're Michal, aren't you?

131
00:16:28,127 --> 00:16:30,197
You were tending horses
by the woods yesterday, weren't you?

132
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:33,359
I don't know anything.

133
00:16:33,927 --> 00:16:35,645
What's wrong?

134
00:16:36,807 --> 00:16:38,525
Michal!

135
00:16:39,567 --> 00:16:42,127
Oh no, you're not going to get anything
out of him.

136
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:46,957
He's kind of nuts,
but otherwise harmless.

137
00:16:47,247 --> 00:16:50,045
We're only keeping him here
because of that granny of his.

138
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,599
This is Major Kalaš.

139
00:16:53,127 --> 00:16:54,879
My name is Král.

140
00:16:55,687 --> 00:16:59,202
We were asking the comrade when was
his brother here yesterday.

141
00:16:59,247 --> 00:17:02,045
Why, he was here. He came around seven.

142
00:17:03,327 --> 00:17:05,477
Did you come here just to ask that?

143
00:17:05,887 --> 00:17:10,597
- Would you call your accountant over here?
- Kramárová?

144
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:14,000
She's away on a leave,
left about ten days ago.

145
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:16,806
- Her mom in Prague is sick.
- When is she coming back?

146
00:17:16,887 --> 00:17:18,559
In time for paychecks, for sure.

147
00:17:18,927 --> 00:17:21,999
- Can I be of any help in the meantime?
- I doubt that.

148
00:17:22,487 --> 00:17:25,843
- I don't suppose you were friends with Brychová.
- No.

149
00:17:27,207 --> 00:17:29,243
- Have you found out anything yet?
- No. Do you know anything?

150
00:17:29,767 --> 00:17:31,598
Well...

151
00:17:32,527 --> 00:17:34,677
Don't you have anything to do?

152
00:17:39,607 --> 00:17:41,563
- You see...
- Thank you.

153
00:17:42,167 --> 00:17:45,716
- I saw her yesterday.
- Brychová? - Yeah.

154
00:17:45,887 --> 00:17:50,403
I was driving on the highway when I saw her.
She was just coming out of the woods.

155
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:52,796
- By herself?
- No. - With whom?

156
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:56,840
- With a man.
- Did you recognize him?

157
00:17:57,567 --> 00:18:01,924
It was already getting dark, but I could
swear that he was wearing a uniform.

158
00:19:01,687 --> 00:19:04,121
The autopsy findings, Comrade Major.

159
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:08,521
DISTRICT POLICE STATION

160
00:19:15,047 --> 00:19:17,720
Please, Comrade Major,
consider yourself at home.

161
00:19:21,447 --> 00:19:23,358
Coffee?

162
00:19:32,887 --> 00:19:38,086
Brychová's autopsy findings.
No signs of sexual violence.

163
00:19:41,407 --> 00:19:43,159
Interesting.

164
00:19:44,607 --> 00:19:50,398
I think this is something different
than the Menšíková case.

165
00:19:52,407 --> 00:19:55,444
Wait a second.
She was three months pregnant?

166
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:57,318
Exactly.

167
00:19:57,927 --> 00:20:00,122
I see.

168
00:20:00,647 --> 00:20:02,877
It's starting to become more clear.

169
00:20:03,647 --> 00:20:07,162
Husband is in the military for a year,
she is pregnant...

170
00:20:07,927 --> 00:20:10,725
If that guy who was walking with her...

171
00:20:37,447 --> 00:20:39,403
Down.

172
00:20:51,727 --> 00:20:53,763
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

173
00:20:56,487 --> 00:20:59,763
Oh God, as if what's already
happened wasn't enough.

174
00:21:00,367 --> 00:21:02,247
We don't want to make things
more difficult for you.

175
00:21:02,282 --> 00:21:05,683
We just need to talk with your son.
Please.

176
00:21:12,687 --> 00:21:14,598
Look, Mr. Brych,

177
00:21:16,447 --> 00:21:18,358
we know how you must feel,

178
00:21:19,567 --> 00:21:24,482
but you'll have to tell us
when was the last time you saw your wife.

179
00:21:24,607 --> 00:21:26,438
About half a year ago.

180
00:21:26,847 --> 00:21:28,565
Are you sure?

181
00:21:29,487 --> 00:21:31,205
Yes.

182
00:21:31,407 --> 00:21:33,523
Where were you last Sunday?

183
00:21:36,567 --> 00:21:39,365
In the barracks, as usual.
Where else would I be?

184
00:21:39,447 --> 00:21:43,360
You see, we've just called your unit.

185
00:21:45,087 --> 00:21:47,043
So what really happened?

186
00:21:52,567 --> 00:21:54,364
- My mother had written to me.
- What did she write?

187
00:21:56,767 --> 00:21:58,644
She wrote that...

188
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:02,325
She wrote that Marcela was seeing someone.

189
00:22:02,847 --> 00:22:06,522
And you secretly came on Sunday
to see for yourself.

190
00:22:06,647 --> 00:22:11,084
- Yes, but everything cleared up in the end.
- How? In the woods?

191
00:22:11,207 --> 00:22:18,204
No, before that. Then she just saw me off
to the highway. She hitched a car for me.

192
00:22:18,407 --> 00:22:21,843
- What time it was?
- Around five.

193
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:25,556
Do you remember what car it was?

194
00:22:26,527 --> 00:22:30,202
Blue Octavia, Prague license plate. AC.

195
00:22:31,727 --> 00:22:34,764
Two sevens in the license number, I think.

196
00:22:37,407 --> 00:22:40,365
The driver works in Glass-export, I think.

197
00:22:41,607 --> 00:22:45,680
Did your wife tell you that
she was pregnant?

198
00:22:46,367 --> 00:22:49,723
No, after all I wasn't here for five months.

199
00:22:51,607 --> 00:22:54,167
What did your mother write to you?

200
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:56,317
Mr. Brych.

201
00:22:56,927 --> 00:23:01,637
She wrote that Marcela might be seeing
that doctor.

202
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:05,678
But she was going to the weekend houses
only to see her friend.

203
00:23:06,887 --> 00:23:09,003
She gave me her word.

204
00:23:09,207 --> 00:23:11,004
To see that Válková?

205
00:23:11,487 --> 00:23:13,478
Yes.

206
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:48,165
Hey, Michal!
Who let you cut the small trees?

207
00:23:48,247 --> 00:23:49,760
Just you wait, we will settle this!

208
00:23:49,807 --> 00:23:54,244
If I see you doing that again,
I'll break your arms!

209
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:04,441
- Look at that fool.
- Let him be,

210
00:24:04,567 --> 00:24:08,116
people are stealing away your wood anyway,
and you don't even know.

211
00:24:14,807 --> 00:24:18,925
- Early morning and you are already so cross.
- Can you blame me? That rascal...

212
00:24:19,047 --> 00:24:23,882
- His head is empty, but he's bright enough to make trouble.
- I heard he tended horses here on Sunday.

213
00:24:24,487 --> 00:24:26,364
That's possible.

214
00:24:27,127 --> 00:24:32,076
You mean because of that Brychová?
Oh no, it wasn't Michal.

215
00:24:32,247 --> 00:24:37,247
He might just look at women, he would barely touch them.
He wouldn't dare to do more than that.

216
00:24:37,282 --> 00:24:40,239
After twenty years here, I already know
a good deal about people.

217
00:24:40,927 --> 00:24:46,479
- How old are you anyway, Mr. Bureš?
- Years, you mean? I'll be 50 soon.

218
00:24:46,567 --> 00:24:49,161
- Why?
- Really? You look more like 40.

219
00:24:49,927 --> 00:24:54,000
- I mean, looking at your hair.
- What did you want with me anyway?

220
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:57,563
Is that Válek's weekend house?

221
00:24:57,847 --> 00:25:00,645
Yeah, but they're probably not there now.

222
00:25:02,527 --> 00:25:05,599
And where does that doctor from the health
centre has his house?

223
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:09,238
Nearby, behind the trees.
But you can't see it from here.

224
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:11,682
Has he ever brought a girl with him?

225
00:25:11,807 --> 00:25:15,356
- Well, you know, he's alone...
- Or someone's wife.

226
00:25:15,927 --> 00:25:18,805
- Brychová, for instance.
- I'm not a voyeur.

227
00:25:19,327 --> 00:25:22,637
Tell us the truth, you know what's going on
around here, don't you?

228
00:25:23,807 --> 00:25:27,197
I don't want to do damage to anyone, but...

229
00:25:28,807 --> 00:25:32,038
She mostly came here,
to the Váleks.

230
00:25:33,527 --> 00:25:36,246
To see Mrs. Válková, huh?

231
00:25:36,887 --> 00:25:42,757
Just about a month ago I saw Marcela here
with some hunk a few times.

232
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:46,197
- Always around the evening.
- Wasn't that engineer Válek?

233
00:25:46,247 --> 00:25:50,718
He doesn't come here, the old fart.
People were wondering why Tána married him.

234
00:25:50,767 --> 00:25:54,919
- And what about that hunk, do you know him?
- No, he's definitely not from Drahovice.

235
00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:56,805
What does he look like?

236
00:25:57,487 --> 00:26:01,162
He's big,
looks kind of like a boxer.

237
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:06,876
I had caught a glimpse of him earlier
in the spring. He was cutting roots in the bushes.

238
00:26:06,967 --> 00:26:08,878
- Roots? What for?
- Decoration?

239
00:26:10,327 --> 00:26:14,036
- And wasn't he here last Sunday?
- I don't know.

240
00:26:46,927 --> 00:26:51,443
- I'm sorry, I wasn't expecting a visit this early in the morning.
- I'm not going to hold you for long, Mrs. Válková.

241
00:26:51,567 --> 00:26:56,038
- I only need to know a few things.
- Something uncomfortable?

242
00:26:56,767 --> 00:26:59,235
- Shall we sit?
- Please.

243
00:27:04,847 --> 00:27:06,803
Isn't your husband home?

244
00:27:08,047 --> 00:27:10,641
- No, he went to Brno on official duty.
- When?

245
00:27:11,407 --> 00:27:13,125
On Friday.

246
00:27:13,327 --> 00:27:14,999
Hm.

247
00:27:15,887 --> 00:27:19,675
- You have a weekend house somewhere, correct?
- Yes, in Drahovice. Why?

248
00:27:21,087 --> 00:27:27,037
- Do you and your husband go there often?
- I do, by myself mostly, my husband is usually too busy.

249
00:27:27,367 --> 00:27:29,562
Were you there last Sunday?

250
00:27:31,127 --> 00:27:33,243
Last Sunday? No.

251
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:37,200
And didn't you lend anyone the keys from the house?

252
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:39,637
A family member or someone.

253
00:27:39,927 --> 00:27:41,963
- No.
- No?

254
00:27:43,087 --> 00:27:46,966
In that case everything's alright.
I'm sorry for troubling you.

255
00:27:47,007 --> 00:27:48,599
Don't worry about it.

256
00:27:48,727 --> 00:27:50,365
And that is all?

257
00:27:50,487 --> 00:27:52,159
For now.

258
00:27:54,607 --> 00:27:56,245
Is that your husband?

259
00:27:56,567 --> 00:27:58,239
Yes.

260
00:27:58,487 --> 00:28:00,637
That's nice. May I?

261
00:28:02,327 --> 00:28:04,204
I collect these as well.

262
00:28:05,407 --> 00:28:07,204
Well...

263
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:11,476
Do you know Mrs. Marcela Brychová?

264
00:28:12,047 --> 00:28:17,360
Of course, we went to school in Drahovice
together. What about her?

265
00:28:17,407 --> 00:28:22,435
On Sunday we found her near
your weekend house... murdered.

266
00:29:54,927 --> 00:29:56,963
Waiter! Two coffees.

267
00:29:57,927 --> 00:29:59,724
Make it three.

268
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,804
May I?

269
00:30:03,767 --> 00:30:05,644
I have time, Mr. Kyncl.

270
00:30:07,927 --> 00:30:11,124
But if you want, we can call in witnesses.

271
00:30:12,127 --> 00:30:13,879
So?

272
00:30:15,207 --> 00:30:18,119
Well, if you have witnesses.

273
00:30:21,127 --> 00:30:24,483
- I was there a couple of times with Marcela.
- There you go.

274
00:30:25,207 --> 00:30:28,597
And did Mrs. Válková give the keys
from the house to you?

275
00:30:28,847 --> 00:30:30,883
- No, to Marcela.
- Well.

276
00:30:32,007 --> 00:30:35,443
And for how long did you and Brychová
have an affair?

277
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:39,443
- An affair?
- Or did you go there to pick mushrooms?

278
00:30:39,847 --> 00:30:42,805
Wood decorations.
And there was no affair.

279
00:30:43,087 --> 00:30:44,998
What, then?

280
00:30:47,247 --> 00:30:51,525
- I assume that you two are men as well.
- We hope we are. So what?

281
00:30:52,607 --> 00:30:55,724
Well, there are times when a man
is in love,

282
00:30:55,767 --> 00:30:58,042
and then there are times when he just
needs an outlet.

283
00:30:58,127 --> 00:31:02,882
And when he meets a woman of the same mind,
they don't have to make up names for it.

284
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:05,521
It simply goes on until it's over.

285
00:31:05,607 --> 00:31:08,917
- Ours was over a month ago.
- When did it start?

286
00:31:09,087 --> 00:31:11,647
About three months ago in Prague.

287
00:31:12,847 --> 00:31:16,362
- How?
- In the Chamber Theatre.

288
00:31:16,927 --> 00:31:20,078
- She was there with Mrs. Válková, I was...
- Of course.

289
00:31:20,647 --> 00:31:23,207
After that, Mrs. Válková gives you her
weekend house at your disposal,

290
00:31:23,247 --> 00:31:27,035
and for two months you and Brychová are
secretly looking for outlets there,

291
00:31:27,727 --> 00:31:32,562
and all of a sudden we find her murdered
near that house. Isn't that interesting?

292
00:31:34,087 --> 00:31:37,841
And based on that you think
that I killed her.

293
00:31:38,527 --> 00:31:40,836
When was the last time you saw her?

294
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:44,240
A month ago,
when we broke up.

295
00:31:44,487 --> 00:31:46,762
And where were you last Sunday?

296
00:31:48,447 --> 00:31:50,403
- At home.
- Do you have any witnesses?

297
00:31:52,447 --> 00:31:55,120
I was home by myself,
I was working,

298
00:31:58,647 --> 00:32:03,038
so you'll first have to prove that I killed her,
gentlemen.

299
00:32:03,127 --> 00:32:06,244
Well, that goes without saying.

300
00:32:40,247 --> 00:32:42,238
After you.

301
00:32:57,807 --> 00:33:02,927
Would you tell me what's all this about?
I thought I told you just about everything.

302
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:05,117
Just about?

303
00:33:38,847 --> 00:33:43,159
So who was here on Sunday?
Here's a Saturday evening newspaper.

304
00:33:44,047 --> 00:33:45,878
Marcela probably.

305
00:33:46,647 --> 00:33:48,683
- She must have been here.
- By herself?

306
00:33:49,447 --> 00:33:51,199
Men's swimsuit.

307
00:33:52,127 --> 00:33:54,322
And it's still a little wet.

308
00:33:57,687 --> 00:34:01,077
Who was the weatherproof man?
Mr. Kyncl?

309
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:04,484
How should I know?

310
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:08,642
Mrs. Válková,
you didn't know anything before either.

311
00:34:10,087 --> 00:34:12,123
That was about Marcela.

312
00:34:12,607 --> 00:34:18,477
- Because of her husband I didn't want to...
- Yes. But now it's about Mr. Kyncl.

313
00:34:21,247 --> 00:34:23,203
Why should it be about him?

314
00:34:24,167 --> 00:34:26,601
This wasn't the first murder here.

315
00:34:26,727 --> 00:34:29,525
- That Menšíková...
- That was murder out of lust.

316
00:34:29,647 --> 00:34:32,923
As for your friend, it looks like someone
wanted to get rid of her.

317
00:34:34,527 --> 00:34:37,519
- You don't think that Kyncl...
- Kyncl?

318
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:43,646
Mr. Kyncl doesn't have an alibi. He claims
he was home by himself on Sunday.

319
00:34:48,247 --> 00:34:50,078
He has an alibi.

320
00:34:52,727 --> 00:34:55,002
He was here with me on Sunday.

321
00:34:59,207 --> 00:35:01,880
Was he seeing both Brychová and you?

322
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,198
No.

323
00:35:05,647 --> 00:35:08,207
He started seeing me only after he broke up with her.

324
00:35:08,327 --> 00:35:10,238
The two of you didn't see her on Sunday?

325
00:35:10,527 --> 00:35:12,199
- No.
- Are you sure?

326
00:35:12,887 --> 00:35:14,718
We didn't.

327
00:35:15,247 --> 00:35:17,158
I don't know what else do you want.

328
00:35:24,447 --> 00:35:26,244
Please.

329
00:35:38,007 --> 00:35:39,918
Mrs. Válková.

330
00:35:52,807 --> 00:35:54,525
Please.

331
00:35:58,967 --> 00:36:04,360
Kyncl Jirí, advertising arranger,
no permanent employment. Correct?

332
00:36:05,927 --> 00:36:09,681
- Yes.
- Do you know Mrs. Válková well?

333
00:36:12,247 --> 00:36:13,919
Yes.

334
00:36:13,967 --> 00:36:16,925
Have the two of you established mutual trust?

335
00:36:18,007 --> 00:36:20,840
- Sure.
- Do you agree Mrs. Válková?

336
00:36:22,887 --> 00:36:28,519
Or are there any questions that you would
prefer not to answer in front of Mrs. Válková?

337
00:36:29,447 --> 00:36:31,199
- No.
- Excellent.

338
00:36:33,007 --> 00:36:35,567
When was the last time you saw Brychová?

339
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:38,236
I've told you already, a month ago.

340
00:36:38,807 --> 00:36:40,559
Are you sure that's correct?

341
00:36:41,927 --> 00:36:45,124
- Yes.
- Where does your wife live?

342
00:36:49,327 --> 00:36:54,242
- My ex-wife? In Brno.
- What do you mean, ex-wife?

343
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:58,156
As far as we know you haven't been divorced yet.

344
00:37:00,967 --> 00:37:04,846
Divorce... that's just a question of time.

345
00:37:06,247 --> 00:37:10,525
I think that divorce is divorce, right?
And to get ahead of yourself like this is a fraud.

346
00:37:11,087 --> 00:37:14,204
You're already paying alimony to
two women, correct?

347
00:37:18,927 --> 00:37:20,804
Excuse me, but...

348
00:37:22,167 --> 00:37:24,237
isn't this inappropriate?

349
00:37:24,687 --> 00:37:26,439
I had asked your permission earlier.

350
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:30,956
You also have debts,
of pretty high value too.

351
00:37:31,927 --> 00:37:36,045
And now more trouble.
You're seeing Brychová,

352
00:37:37,487 --> 00:37:40,126
and all of a sudden, she's pregnant.

353
00:37:40,527 --> 00:37:44,805
- I'm hearing about this for the first time.
- Jirí! Tell them already.

354
00:37:46,447 --> 00:37:49,086
What are you talking about?
What should I tell them?

355
00:37:50,047 --> 00:37:53,596
- Did you drag me here all the way from Prague
for this gossip? - Don't talk anymore please.

356
00:37:58,927 --> 00:38:01,043
Go have a smoke.

357
00:38:09,527 --> 00:38:12,485
Tána, I'll explain everything.

358
00:38:18,727 --> 00:38:20,365
Please.

359
00:38:29,487 --> 00:38:31,364
He must have known.

360
00:38:31,447 --> 00:38:33,324
What do you mean?

361
00:38:34,647 --> 00:38:38,845
She came to see him on Sunday,
while we were at the weekend house,

362
00:38:40,087 --> 00:38:42,965
- that she must speak with him.
- And Kyncl?

363
00:38:44,767 --> 00:38:46,837
He went with her in the woods.

364
00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:53,204
Marcela wanted to see him face to face.

365
00:38:54,367 --> 00:38:56,358
He came back upset,

366
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:02,396
so we immediately returned to Prague.

367
00:39:02,527 --> 00:39:04,438
Did he explain?

368
00:39:05,807 --> 00:39:08,924
He said she flipped out
because of me.

369
00:39:11,047 --> 00:39:12,560
That's so horrible.

370
00:39:17,807 --> 00:39:19,843
Thank you.

371
00:39:25,647 --> 00:39:27,683
Come on, let's go.

372
00:39:37,407 --> 00:39:41,525
Send everyhting he was wearing on Sunday
to forensics.

373
00:39:45,247 --> 00:39:46,965
Some deep trouble he's in, huh?

374
00:39:49,567 --> 00:39:52,001
Sure, but what about Brych?

375
00:39:53,527 --> 00:39:55,324
He's all clear.

376
00:39:56,687 --> 00:39:59,485
They found the driver who had given him
the ride to Prague.

377
00:40:01,727 --> 00:40:04,685
He saw him with Brychová,
he identified her from a picture.

378
00:40:08,687 --> 00:40:11,645
- He's lucky.
- Well, he's got good memory.

379
00:40:12,967 --> 00:40:16,676
- The only number I remember is 097.
- What is it for?

380
00:40:18,007 --> 00:40:19,884
Oh, I forgot that already.

381
00:40:23,247 --> 00:40:25,158
Hello.

382
00:40:25,327 --> 00:40:26,999
Speaking.

383
00:40:27,927 --> 00:40:29,645
What accountant?

384
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:32,079
Kramárová?

385
00:40:33,247 --> 00:40:35,317
OK, we're on our way.

386
00:41:02,087 --> 00:41:05,159
- You said she went to her mother's.
- She said that,

387
00:41:05,247 --> 00:41:08,000
but a telegram has just arrived,
asking where she is.

388
00:41:25,447 --> 00:41:27,165
Here.

389
00:41:30,047 --> 00:41:32,402
She took her keys with her.

390
00:42:17,007 --> 00:42:18,679
Is that her?

391
00:42:18,807 --> 00:42:22,322
Yeah.
There has to be an explanation, right?

392
00:42:23,447 --> 00:42:26,086
- What? - Maybe she made an excuse
that she was going to see her mom,

393
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:27,560
when in fact she went to see a boyfriend.

394
00:42:27,607 --> 00:42:30,758
- When did she leave?
- On Saturday, it's been ten days.

395
00:42:31,887 --> 00:42:35,562
- What time exactly?
- I don't know, around the evening.

396
00:42:36,207 --> 00:42:41,565
- There's no bus from Drahovice on Saturday evening.
- She went hitchhiking on the highway.

397
00:42:41,847 --> 00:42:43,678
She always travels like that.

398
00:42:44,527 --> 00:42:46,245
What was she wearing?

399
00:42:47,647 --> 00:42:51,003
Gray dress, white purse...

400
00:42:52,887 --> 00:42:55,845
- And a light-colored suitcase.
- Is anything missing from here?

401
00:42:57,727 --> 00:43:01,242
- Hmm, I don't know.
- Did she take any money with her?

402
00:43:02,127 --> 00:43:03,879
- Yeah.
- Do you know how much?

403
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:07,802
She asked me for an advance payment
of 1000 crowns, but I don't know.

404
00:43:11,967 --> 00:43:14,322
- Is anyone else living here?
- Me.

405
00:43:27,407 --> 00:43:31,878
There's an arched room behind that door.
Kitchen and bedroom are in the back.

406
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:43,922
What next?
What if she doesn't come back?

407
00:43:44,127 --> 00:43:45,879
Should I keep waiting?

408
00:43:46,007 --> 00:43:49,363
- Keep waiting for now. - Easy for you to say,
but who's going to take care of the paychecks?

409
00:43:49,687 --> 00:43:52,724
Someone is watching us
with binoculars from that barn.

410
00:43:52,807 --> 00:43:56,163
That's Michal, our nutcase. He's got himself
a telescope and now he's always watching others.

411
00:43:57,087 --> 00:44:00,841
Hey, tell that rascal of yours that
if he keeps watching people from up there in the barn

412
00:44:00,887 --> 00:44:03,640
I'll push him off.

413
00:44:04,887 --> 00:44:06,684
That's his grandma.

414
00:44:07,327 --> 00:44:10,399
Do you think I should get a substitute
for the time being?

415
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:13,325
She may come back,
but the paychecks, you know...

416
00:44:13,447 --> 00:44:17,725
You might. Did she have to go
through the woods to get to the highway?

417
00:44:17,807 --> 00:44:19,365
Yeah.

418
00:44:20,487 --> 00:44:22,239
Thank you. Go.

419
00:44:36,127 --> 00:44:38,721
Through Christ, our Lord.

420
00:44:38,887 --> 00:44:40,525
Amen.

421
00:44:40,647 --> 00:44:43,241
Give her eternal rest, oh Lord.

422
00:44:43,807 --> 00:44:46,116
And let an eternal light shine for her.

423
00:44:46,567 --> 00:44:49,843
May she rest in peace.
Amen.

424
00:47:51,487 --> 00:47:53,478
Nothing, Comrade Major.

425
00:48:28,247 --> 00:48:30,397
She would have come to the surface already.

426
00:48:31,247 --> 00:48:32,965
Should we keep looking?

427
00:48:33,127 --> 00:48:35,925
Yeah, down through Duby
all the way to the highway.

428
00:48:36,207 --> 00:48:41,235
Duby? Is that the trail
where Brychová was attacked?

429
00:48:41,887 --> 00:48:43,639
Yes. In the woods.

430
00:48:44,447 --> 00:48:48,486
That Kramárová must have passed
Válek's weekend house, right?

431
00:48:48,607 --> 00:48:51,644
If she really went to the highway,
then yes.

432
00:48:54,327 --> 00:48:57,763
Wait a second... that hunk from Prague
must have seen her then.

433
00:48:58,247 --> 00:49:00,920
He was definitely here on Saturday
two weeks ago.

434
00:49:03,567 --> 00:49:06,400
I was there, but I didn't see her.

435
00:49:09,767 --> 00:49:12,406
Where do you know Kramárová from anyway?

436
00:49:14,247 --> 00:49:17,683
She went to see Marcela a few times,
that's all I know.

437
00:49:18,807 --> 00:49:22,720
She must have passed Válek's weekend house
on Saturday two weeks ago.

438
00:49:22,767 --> 00:49:24,325
You were there then.

439
00:49:24,367 --> 00:49:28,121
You were even sitting outside
between four and six.

440
00:49:29,727 --> 00:49:34,437
Look, I could have told you
that I was asleep or something.

441
00:49:34,607 --> 00:49:37,519
But I was outside and she didn't
pass the house.

442
00:49:39,607 --> 00:49:42,326
Do you want me to plead guilty
just because of your beautiful eyes?

443
00:49:42,367 --> 00:49:44,961
After all, you had
also tried to deny Brychová.

444
00:49:46,247 --> 00:49:49,956
If you weren't a fuzz you would
have done the same thing in my spot.

445
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:55,481
If they found a woman dead in the woods
half an hour after you talked...

446
00:49:57,007 --> 00:50:01,444
...after you talked with her, you would
try anything to avoid them pinning it on you.

447
00:50:01,527 --> 00:50:03,245
She was pregnant with your child.

448
00:50:03,487 --> 00:50:05,921
- She hadn't told me that until that talk in the woods.
- And how did you react?

449
00:50:06,607 --> 00:50:11,727
I've already told you for Christ's sake!
I promised her that I would take care of it in Prague.

450
00:50:12,047 --> 00:50:14,402
And where did you accompany her afterwards?

451
00:50:14,847 --> 00:50:17,805
Nowhere!
We joined hands and then she went off.

452
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:20,963
For how long have you been coming here?

453
00:50:22,407 --> 00:50:24,443
Since spring, right?

454
00:50:24,807 --> 00:50:28,356
I see, you'll pin that Menšíková
on me as well.

455
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:33,718
- Now you'll pin everything on me, won't you?
- Watch your mouth!

456
00:50:33,847 --> 00:50:38,045
What about that teen with binoculars
who's pretending to tend horses while eyeing every woman?

457
00:50:38,087 --> 00:50:41,966
Or that gamekeeper whose wife is one
foot in grave, but he keeps dying his hair?

458
00:50:42,007 --> 00:50:44,760
- He does it for the squirrels, I suppose?
- Watch it.

459
00:50:44,807 --> 00:50:48,197
You wish.
While some hooligan is out there killing women,

460
00:50:48,247 --> 00:50:50,442
you'd have me quietly wait here
until you're finished sewing a rope for me.

461
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,725
You can go now, Mr. Kyncl.

462
00:50:53,407 --> 00:50:55,125
Go ahead.

463
00:51:01,807 --> 00:51:03,525
What is it?

464
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:08,245
The analysis of Kyncl's clothes.
No traces of blood.

465
00:51:14,007 --> 00:51:18,125
That might be just luck, right?
Brychová didn't bleed much.

466
00:51:18,887 --> 00:51:23,483
I know, you would love to pin
it on Kyncl and go home, huh?

467
00:51:24,807 --> 00:51:27,162
But why Kyncl of all people?

468
00:51:28,447 --> 00:51:31,757
With Brychová he kind of had
a reason to do it.

469
00:51:32,447 --> 00:51:34,358
Think about it please.

470
00:51:34,727 --> 00:51:38,927
Brychová comes to see him at the weekend house on Sunday.
She leaves with him in front of Válková to the woods

471
00:51:38,962 --> 00:51:40,085
and he comes back by himself.

472
00:51:40,367 --> 00:51:42,961
Would you murder so stupidly?
Thank you.

473
00:51:43,087 --> 00:51:44,998
And what about the other two women?

474
00:51:46,367 --> 00:51:50,360
Why would he attack them?
He can have all the women he wants.

475
00:51:50,447 --> 00:51:52,403
Unlike us.

476
00:51:53,807 --> 00:51:58,244
I suggest that you speak for yourselves
gentlemen.

477
00:52:03,807 --> 00:52:05,479
Hello.

478
00:52:05,887 --> 00:52:07,525
Yes.

479
00:52:07,967 --> 00:52:09,719
Yes?

480
00:52:09,807 --> 00:52:11,160
Comrade Major.

481
00:52:24,327 --> 00:52:26,204
It was buried in a haystack.

482
00:52:30,567 --> 00:52:32,364
It's hers.

483
00:52:32,647 --> 00:52:34,877
But... she also had a suitcase.

484
00:52:47,887 --> 00:52:50,082
We'll have to comb it through here again.

485
00:52:51,447 --> 00:52:53,642
Did you find anything else in the haystack?

486
00:52:55,407 --> 00:52:57,602
What about that convertor?

487
00:52:58,047 --> 00:53:00,197
Have them try to break it open.

488
00:53:03,367 --> 00:53:05,358
He could have buried her in the ground.

489
00:53:05,687 --> 00:53:08,963
He would have needed more time for that.
And tools.

490
00:53:09,087 --> 00:53:14,161
Menšíková had been found lying in the ditch under
the bridge. He had simply dragged her there.

491
00:53:15,927 --> 00:53:19,681
- Who knew about the advance payment?
- She came to see me

492
00:53:19,727 --> 00:53:23,322
- one time when I was in the barn.
- Who was there at the time?

493
00:53:23,727 --> 00:53:30,838
Wait a second, there were Ferdyš, Bauerová,
Mlejnková and... Michal.

494
00:53:30,887 --> 00:53:33,845
Hey! Comrade Major!
Come here!

495
00:53:54,647 --> 00:53:56,339
DISSECTING ROOM

496
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:29,039
- So what do you make out of it?
- It's perfectly clear, young men.

497
00:54:29,687 --> 00:54:34,158
Death occured about 11 days ago,
and it's virtually same as with Menšíková.

498
00:54:34,847 --> 00:54:37,680
Clear signs of sexual assault,

499
00:54:37,807 --> 00:54:41,686
deadly blow to a temple,
from behind,

500
00:54:42,647 --> 00:54:44,877
with a stone or something of that kind.

501
00:54:45,167 --> 00:54:46,964
Interesting.

502
00:54:47,407 --> 00:54:51,685
Are you surprised?
It's starting to look like it was the same guy.

503
00:54:51,807 --> 00:54:55,800
Only based on the way they were killed,
other than that it doesn't really fit.

504
00:54:56,607 --> 00:55:00,998
For example, Menšíková was raped,
Kramárová as well,

505
00:55:02,247 --> 00:55:04,841
- but Brychová wasn't.
- Wait a second.

506
00:55:05,607 --> 00:55:09,520
You said something about a storm with the last one.
Perhaps it distracted him.

507
00:55:09,727 --> 00:55:11,445
Storm?

508
00:55:12,687 --> 00:55:14,439
I doubt that.

509
00:55:15,167 --> 00:55:17,237
Also, Kramárová was robbed.

510
00:55:17,327 --> 00:55:19,477
- That doesn't rule out...
- But it muddles it.

511
00:55:20,047 --> 00:55:25,201
After all, Menšíková had more than 200 crowns with her.
He could have taken Brychová's golden watch and ring,

512
00:55:25,327 --> 00:55:27,318
but he didn't. Why?

513
00:55:28,127 --> 00:55:30,482
I wouldn't want your job.

514
00:55:31,207 --> 00:55:33,926
Likewise, Doctor, likewise.

515
00:55:51,647 --> 00:55:53,365
Drive to the farm.

516
00:55:54,167 --> 00:55:55,885
What there?

517
00:55:56,047 --> 00:55:57,958
The boy with binoculars.

518
00:55:58,447 --> 00:56:00,244
Where did he get them?

519
00:56:01,527 --> 00:56:03,245
He could have bought them.

520
00:56:04,007 --> 00:56:05,884
Does he make that much money?

521
00:56:06,487 --> 00:56:08,079
If so, I'm going to tend horses from now on.

522
00:56:23,167 --> 00:56:25,123
You're going to look around
here again?

523
00:56:25,247 --> 00:56:28,398
You've been here for almost a week,
and it doesn't seem to do any good.

524
00:56:28,527 --> 00:56:31,678
You can join us,
we need capable people.

525
00:56:31,727 --> 00:56:34,446
Seriously, it's been too much already.

526
00:56:34,487 --> 00:56:39,083
Ever since that thing with the accountant happened,
I have my female workers running away from their jobs.

527
00:56:39,127 --> 00:56:43,405
One of them is down with fever.
The doctor from the health centre is with her just now.

528
00:56:44,007 --> 00:56:45,679
Did you want anything?

529
00:56:47,367 --> 00:56:49,198
Is that boy here now?

530
00:56:50,047 --> 00:56:52,322
Michal?

531
00:56:53,687 --> 00:56:55,564
He's just got back, why?

532
00:56:56,927 --> 00:56:59,441
Can we see his grandmother?

533
00:56:59,487 --> 00:57:02,524
But no fuss,
we don't want to scare anyone.

534
00:57:02,647 --> 00:57:04,365
- I'll be on my way.
- Yep.

535
00:57:04,727 --> 00:57:06,399
Good afternoon.

536
00:57:13,687 --> 00:57:18,397
The binoculars? He hasn't had them
for more than 3 days, not before Monday.

537
00:57:18,527 --> 00:57:23,647
- Do you know where he bought them?
- Bought them? His grandma takes

538
00:57:23,727 --> 00:57:25,957
the few crowns he makes right away.

539
00:57:26,727 --> 00:57:31,881
Do you think it was him
who killed Kramárová?

540
00:57:33,047 --> 00:57:36,517
You were there when we found her -
she didn't have the money on her.

541
00:57:37,047 --> 00:57:39,038
Oh my god.

542
00:58:20,007 --> 00:58:21,565
We're no thieves.

543
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,964
What do you think?

544
00:58:28,327 --> 00:58:32,366
I've never taken anything.
And neither has Míša.

545
00:58:34,207 --> 00:58:37,802
We're not suspecting you,
Mrs. Horáková.

546
00:58:39,167 --> 00:58:43,319
- But you might know where did Michal get
the binoculars from. - How should I know.

547
00:58:47,487 --> 00:58:49,239
He said he'd found them.

548
00:58:50,367 --> 00:58:52,835
- Found them? Where?
- He didn't say.

549
00:58:54,247 --> 00:58:56,602
I don't know what's so strange
about that.

550
00:59:09,407 --> 00:59:11,796
- Is Michal here?
- No.

551
00:59:14,967 --> 00:59:17,083
Sometimes he sleeps here.

552
00:59:42,607 --> 00:59:44,916
- Is this your boy's?
- Yeah.

553
00:59:46,407 --> 00:59:48,443
What are you looking for anyway?

554
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:50,924
Money, matron.

555
00:59:50,967 --> 00:59:54,243
Maybe he's hiding it somewhere,
and you don't even know.

556
00:59:54,327 --> 00:59:57,876
He doesn't have any. I put away what he
earns on to his deposit book.

557
01:00:37,607 --> 01:00:39,643
Get that boy.

558
01:00:47,327 --> 01:00:49,887
- What is it? Do you want anything?
- Me? No.

559
01:00:51,127 --> 01:00:55,837
- Do you know where did Michal get the binoculars from?
- I don't know.

560
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:00,763
If I were in charge I would have
thrown him out long ago, the fucker.

561
01:01:02,927 --> 01:01:05,725
I knew it was going to end
like that one day.

562
01:01:23,687 --> 01:01:25,040
Hey!

563
01:01:46,607 --> 01:01:49,326
When I came here,
he was already lying here.

564
01:02:03,607 --> 01:02:07,805
Maybe he can still come around.
Should I go get the doctor?

565
01:02:12,247 --> 01:02:17,367
That can't be.
His hands are still warm.

566
01:02:22,247 --> 01:02:24,363
How could this happen?

567
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:31,599
- I told him not to climb up there.
- You promised him you'd push him off.

568
01:02:31,727 --> 01:02:34,321
Me? God, I would...

569
01:02:34,887 --> 01:02:36,878
- Damn.
- Is anything up there?

570
01:02:37,447 --> 01:02:39,119
Nothing.

571
01:02:44,807 --> 01:02:46,923
- May I...
- Go ahead.

572
01:02:49,647 --> 01:02:51,797
And not a word to anyone yet.

573
01:02:55,207 --> 01:02:57,323
You can see inside the barn from
up there.

574
01:02:58,967 --> 01:03:01,879
He probably realized he was in trouble,

575
01:03:02,207 --> 01:03:04,926
so he wanted to get away quickly,

576
01:03:05,447 --> 01:03:07,438
and fell down.

577
01:03:22,687 --> 01:03:25,804
Damn, I think I should ask for a transfer.

578
01:03:27,087 --> 01:03:30,363
Three murders,
and now the mess with Michal.

579
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:35,957
What are we going to say to those people?

580
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:38,517
That it was him who'd done
those women in?

581
01:03:40,487 --> 01:03:42,603
We'll wait for the old-timer.

582
01:03:45,687 --> 01:03:47,837
Good morning.

583
01:03:48,567 --> 01:03:50,603
I almost overslept.

584
01:03:53,047 --> 01:03:56,562
It's been a while since
I laid on a bed this lousy.

585
01:03:56,687 --> 01:03:58,325
What's going on?

586
01:03:58,447 --> 01:04:00,358
Nothing, Comrade Major.

587
01:04:01,127 --> 01:04:04,961
We interrogated people from the farm
almost until the morning, and...

588
01:04:05,127 --> 01:04:08,597
no one knows anything.
Nothing about the binoculars either.

589
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:13,645
And we haven't found
anything in the barn.

590
01:04:14,367 --> 01:04:18,360
- It looks like he really did fall by himself.
- Are those the autopsy findings?

591
01:04:18,647 --> 01:04:21,923
Yeah. Broken spine and spinal cord...

592
01:04:22,847 --> 01:04:25,600
Death by a fall from a great height.

593
01:04:29,047 --> 01:04:32,039
- Did you find Kramárová's suitcase?
- No.

594
01:04:33,247 --> 01:04:35,886
But I have people still working there.

595
01:04:37,607 --> 01:04:40,167
Could you get us coffee?

596
01:04:53,407 --> 01:04:56,558
I didn't take the boy into account.

597
01:04:57,447 --> 01:05:00,120
We should have been interested in him sooner.

598
01:05:01,127 --> 01:05:05,006
It's always better to convict
a murderer alive.

599
01:05:05,647 --> 01:05:10,357
He would've confessed only after
we found that money anyway.

600
01:05:10,487 --> 01:05:13,763
- Where could have he hidden that suitcase?
- Where?

601
01:05:14,847 --> 01:05:16,963
Shouldn't we ask 'why' instead?

602
01:05:17,127 --> 01:05:20,247
Why did he clear away Kramárová's things
so meticulously

603
01:05:20,282 --> 01:05:23,444
and left Brychová with her
purse spilled?

604
01:05:25,847 --> 01:05:29,806
- You can't expect a nutter to have a system.
- He had one.

605
01:05:30,647 --> 01:05:32,717
He was killing in the same way.

606
01:05:35,167 --> 01:05:37,237
It's strange.

607
01:05:38,647 --> 01:05:41,207
Everyone at the farm was suspicious of the boy.

608
01:05:42,367 --> 01:05:45,359
Why didn't Král throw him out long ago?

609
01:05:47,887 --> 01:05:49,639
You're right.

610
01:05:52,167 --> 01:05:54,317
The supervisor is a great man.

611
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:58,316
If it wasn't for him
Míša and I wouldn't be here long ago.

612
01:05:58,927 --> 01:06:00,963
He would always stand up for us.

613
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:08,715
Now that Míša's dead,
it doesn't matter anymore.

614
01:06:12,167 --> 01:06:15,762
Have you known Král for long, Mrs. Horáková?

615
01:06:18,887 --> 01:06:21,765
Ever since he's become the supervisor here.

616
01:06:23,327 --> 01:06:25,363
It's been almost 8 years.

617
01:06:26,047 --> 01:06:31,838
- Sometimes I wash his clothes and cook for him...
- Why would Král stand up for you?

618
01:06:32,447 --> 01:06:34,199
What?

619
01:06:34,687 --> 01:06:37,121
For Míša,

620
01:06:38,487 --> 01:06:40,239
when they called him names.

621
01:06:40,407 --> 01:06:42,318
Did he like him that much?

622
01:06:42,727 --> 01:06:48,484
I... don't know, but he couldn't stand
the others blaming Míša.

623
01:06:49,407 --> 01:06:51,318
Like what?

624
01:06:51,447 --> 01:06:54,245
Why, he never hurt anyone.

625
01:06:55,927 --> 01:06:57,997
Not even that Radka.

626
01:06:58,367 --> 01:07:00,039
Radka?

627
01:07:01,367 --> 01:07:03,085
The one from the castle?

628
01:07:03,487 --> 01:07:08,800
Someone punched her in the head in the woods,
and he thought it was Míša who did it.

629
01:07:09,207 --> 01:07:10,879
When did that happen?

630
01:07:11,047 --> 01:07:17,600
- Last year, but no one knows.
- And how do you know?

631
01:07:18,407 --> 01:07:20,159
From the supervisor.

632
01:07:20,887 --> 01:07:24,800
He came to me then and said
that it must have been Míša.

633
01:07:26,887 --> 01:07:28,718
And how did it end?

634
01:07:28,847 --> 01:07:32,396
I was afraid, that he was
really going to do something to him.

635
01:07:35,247 --> 01:07:37,761
Was Míša home when that happened?

636
01:07:38,127 --> 01:07:43,724
He came later, but he swore
that he didn't even see the girl.

637
01:07:54,607 --> 01:07:56,643
Call Král.

638
01:07:58,927 --> 01:08:01,077
The old woman probably doesn't have a clue.

639
01:08:01,687 --> 01:08:04,406
That boy must have started this
last year already.

640
01:08:04,447 --> 01:08:06,199
And Král kept quiet.

641
01:08:11,887 --> 01:08:14,685
Here. Just behind the little cross.

642
01:08:17,127 --> 01:08:20,915
- What happened?
- Well... I've told you.

643
01:08:22,247 --> 01:08:26,035
She came by in the evening,
I gave her a bag of eggs, and she left.

644
01:08:26,127 --> 01:08:30,359
I was on the yard getting my motorbike
into the outhouse,

645
01:08:30,527 --> 01:08:36,477
when I heard screaming. I ran here,
and she was lying there on the ground.

646
01:08:36,527 --> 01:08:39,519
I heard someone running towards
the quarry.

647
01:08:39,567 --> 01:08:41,478
Did you recognize him?

648
01:08:41,687 --> 01:08:44,520
I was only concerned about her at that moment.

649
01:08:44,847 --> 01:08:47,600
- Was she unconscious?
- She couldn't speak.

650
01:08:47,967 --> 01:08:52,722
She was just shaking and crying from shock.
She had only a scratch.

651
01:08:52,927 --> 01:08:54,804
And you're telling us now?

652
01:08:54,847 --> 01:09:00,160
- Why didn't you report it right away?
- You'd say that it's rubbish, I know how it works.

653
01:09:01,447 --> 01:09:05,235
- How can you know?
- How? Imagine what would happen.

654
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:09,919
Radka was already so agitated,
and with all the protocols...

655
01:09:10,047 --> 01:09:15,599
You know how people are, everyone would make up
this and that, and the girl could never even marry.

656
01:09:15,727 --> 01:09:18,082
Yes. Someone kills three women with a stone

657
01:09:18,127 --> 01:09:21,676
and you don't even think of bringing
Michal forward.

658
01:09:21,727 --> 01:09:26,403
I thought about it only after Kramárová was found.
It had not occured to me with Brychová.

659
01:09:26,447 --> 01:09:31,077
And then I was afraid that you would
go after me for reporting it late.

660
01:09:31,127 --> 01:09:34,676
- But...
- Wait a second. Did Radka identify Michal?

661
01:09:35,527 --> 01:09:37,518
He jumped on her from behind, rascal.

662
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:40,516
It couldn't have been anyone else anyway.

663
01:09:41,167 --> 01:09:43,044
Thank you.

664
01:09:51,767 --> 01:09:54,679
He must like that Radka.
Why isn't he married?

665
01:09:54,727 --> 01:09:56,683
Did he have an affair with Kramárová?

666
01:09:57,127 --> 01:10:01,598
He was always around her at first,
but I don't if there was anything more.

667
01:10:01,647 --> 01:10:05,401
I asked the people at the farm,
but can you expect them to tell you anything?

668
01:10:05,447 --> 01:10:07,244
They're all scared shitless.

669
01:10:15,487 --> 01:10:17,318
Are you here to see me?

670
01:10:24,487 --> 01:10:26,239
We're always troubling you, aren't we?

671
01:10:27,247 --> 01:10:29,442
You're here because of Radka, I know.

672
01:10:29,487 --> 01:10:32,047
- My brother has already called me.
- Really?

673
01:10:32,887 --> 01:10:37,483
Who could have known back then?
It didn't seem like a big deal.

674
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:40,206
You don't rush to a police station
with that sort of thing.

675
01:10:40,767 --> 01:10:46,205
It would have only made my brother trouble
for keeping a delinquent.

676
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:51,641
- Could we speak with her?
- She wouldn't tell you anything.

677
01:10:51,687 --> 01:10:55,043
Is she sitting outside all the time?
Won't she catch a cold?

678
01:10:55,407 --> 01:11:01,243
We've been telling her to go out for a walk,
but she likes to sit next to her room the best.

679
01:11:01,367 --> 01:11:03,722
- That's my wife.
- Good afternoon.

680
01:11:05,247 --> 01:11:07,203
- Králová.
- Good afternoon.

681
01:11:07,367 --> 01:11:10,120
These are the gentlemen from Prague
who are investigating here.

682
01:11:10,367 --> 01:11:14,246
They came here because of Radka, they want
to talk with her. About that thing...

683
01:11:15,367 --> 01:11:17,164
What do you want with her?

684
01:11:17,487 --> 01:11:20,206
- We would only ask her a few questions,
if we may. - I've told them

685
01:11:20,247 --> 01:11:22,203
that they're not going to get anything
from her.

686
01:11:22,567 --> 01:11:24,523
We could try, couldn't we?

687
01:11:25,327 --> 01:11:27,363
Go ahead.

688
01:11:36,887 --> 01:11:38,923
- Doctor.
- Yes?

689
01:11:40,727 --> 01:11:43,082
Could you please tell me

690
01:11:44,487 --> 01:11:46,318
what time it is?

691
01:11:48,127 --> 01:11:50,482
- Half past five.
- Half past?

692
01:11:51,407 --> 01:11:53,477
Yes.

693
01:11:53,887 --> 01:11:55,878
Thank you. Good night.

694
01:12:03,247 --> 01:12:05,238
Radka?

695
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:09,317
Radka, open the door.

696
01:12:11,247 --> 01:12:13,238
Can you hear me?

697
01:12:13,927 --> 01:12:16,077
Come on and open the door, Radka.

698
01:12:19,927 --> 01:12:21,918
Radka!

699
01:12:23,647 --> 01:12:26,161
Open the door.

700
01:12:35,167 --> 01:12:37,397
She locks her room all the time.

701
01:12:39,487 --> 01:12:41,842
Would you leave us with her
for a moment?

702
01:12:42,567 --> 01:12:44,762
Can't we stay?

703
01:12:45,687 --> 01:12:47,723
We're not going to hurt her.

704
01:12:47,887 --> 01:12:50,162
- But...
- Please.

705
01:13:07,847 --> 01:13:11,317
- Why should you be afraid, Radka?
- Go away.

706
01:13:16,007 --> 01:13:19,636
Look,
we came here to ask for your help.

707
01:13:21,487 --> 01:13:23,557
Will you?

708
01:13:24,447 --> 01:13:27,644
Can you remember what happened
that time

709
01:13:27,767 --> 01:13:30,725
when you went home from your
uncle's by yourself?

710
01:13:32,607 --> 01:13:34,598
You know what I'm talking about.

711
01:13:35,127 --> 01:13:42,238
He doesn't remember exactly,
but perhaps you could? Huh?

712
01:13:44,047 --> 01:13:47,084
Someone wanted to hurt you.
Correct?

713
01:13:51,007 --> 01:13:52,963
Are you sure they didn't?

714
01:13:56,687 --> 01:13:59,406
Come on, who was it?

715
01:14:02,647 --> 01:14:04,638
Did you see him?

716
01:14:07,127 --> 01:14:09,402
Was it Michal from the farm?

717
01:14:11,567 --> 01:14:13,842
Well?

718
01:14:14,607 --> 01:14:17,963
Look if it wasn't him,
then this is the last thing

719
01:14:18,087 --> 01:14:20,362
you can do for him.

720
01:14:21,167 --> 01:14:23,317
Was it him?

721
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:18,563
There's something wrong with that girl.

722
01:15:20,167 --> 01:15:23,079
Why is she glued to that balcony
like that?

723
01:15:24,567 --> 01:15:27,320
- The boy passed away, so...
- Exactly.

724
01:15:28,447 --> 01:15:30,563
What is she afraid of?

725
01:16:11,887 --> 01:16:15,038
- Where did they find it?
- It was buried in a pile of stones.

726
01:16:48,047 --> 01:16:50,003
Thousand crowns.

727
01:16:50,447 --> 01:16:53,007
- The advance payment for the road.
- How can that be?

728
01:16:54,887 --> 01:16:58,596
- Why, it was Michal...
- He had nothing to do with Kramárová.

729
01:16:59,087 --> 01:17:01,123
He'd gotten the money from somewhere else.

730
01:17:04,727 --> 01:17:07,844
But then, maybe he didn't
fall from the ladder...

731
01:17:08,167 --> 01:17:10,806
And what if it wasn't him who attacked Radka?

732
01:17:13,447 --> 01:17:16,041
Wait a second, the girl knows who's the killer.

733
01:17:48,207 --> 01:17:50,198
Comrade Major.

734
01:17:59,207 --> 01:18:01,004
Is Radka home?

735
01:18:01,687 --> 01:18:05,043
- I'm just on my way to go shopping.
- Answer the question, is she home?

736
01:18:05,127 --> 01:18:07,243
- Yes, she's in her room, but...
- Is she alone?

737
01:18:07,367 --> 01:18:10,200
Yeah, my husband went out.
Did something happen?

738
01:18:10,247 --> 01:18:13,159
No, but it might.
Did anyone ask to see Radka?

739
01:18:13,207 --> 01:18:17,041
- Did anyone ask to talk with her?
- Not that I know of.

740
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:18,759
- Radka!
- Don't call her!

741
01:19:01,727 --> 01:19:06,164
Anyone could have got inside.
The door on the first floor can't be locked.

742
01:19:06,247 --> 01:19:09,637
We've never locked our doors.
This is crazy.

743
01:19:10,247 --> 01:19:12,715
- Have someone keep a guard on Radka.
No one is to go in. - Sure.

744
01:19:13,967 --> 01:19:15,685
Who came here today?

745
01:19:15,767 --> 01:19:18,645
Here? Just the gamekeeper
before you came here.

746
01:19:18,767 --> 01:19:21,201
- He brought my wife a hare.
- And after us?

747
01:19:21,807 --> 01:19:25,959
Just the doctor from the health centre.
He forgot his keys in the office.

748
01:19:27,047 --> 01:19:29,083
And wasn't your brother here as well?

749
01:19:29,407 --> 01:19:31,875
Yeah, I forgot about that.

750
01:19:39,087 --> 01:19:41,442
So what happened?

751
01:19:43,887 --> 01:19:47,800
Two days ago, just as we start looking
for Michal at the farm,

752
01:19:47,927 --> 01:19:50,839
he falls off a ladder.

753
01:19:52,247 --> 01:19:55,364
Yesterday we first started to be concerned
with Radka,

754
01:19:57,887 --> 01:20:00,242
and it has nearly cost her her life.

755
01:20:01,647 --> 01:20:05,242
Perhaps someone really did
push Michal off?

756
01:20:05,527 --> 01:20:07,677
Wait a second.

757
01:20:08,687 --> 01:20:13,238
Suppose that he didn't take
the money from Kramárová,

758
01:20:13,727 --> 01:20:16,639
- but that someone had given it to him.
- For what?

759
01:20:17,727 --> 01:20:19,638
For what?

760
01:20:19,887 --> 01:20:21,798
Perhaps for keeping quiet.

761
01:20:21,967 --> 01:20:23,923
And what about the murders?

762
01:20:24,407 --> 01:20:26,477
That's exactly it.

763
01:20:27,407 --> 01:20:31,082
It confused us that there were three similar murders
and three different motives.

764
01:20:31,167 --> 01:20:33,920
First, a sexual one, then a robbery,...

765
01:20:34,407 --> 01:20:36,363
and finally, both.

766
01:20:37,367 --> 01:20:39,437
That's true.

767
01:20:39,687 --> 01:20:46,604
Kramárová wasn't robbed, which leaves
just a rape, as with Menšíková.

768
01:20:46,727 --> 01:20:48,763
And what about Brychová?

769
01:20:49,447 --> 01:20:54,646
Doctor from the dissecting room said that
the perpetrator might have been distracted by a storm.

770
01:20:55,047 --> 01:20:59,757
But what if it was something else
that distracted him?

771
01:21:02,407 --> 01:21:04,477
The boy from the farm.

772
01:21:05,047 --> 01:21:07,515
- Damn.
- He was always around,

773
01:21:09,607 --> 01:21:14,442
so suppose that he saw what happened.
What could the killer do?

774
01:21:14,567 --> 01:21:18,082
He leaves Brychová lying on the ground
and runs after the boy.

775
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:23,246
Brychová crawls in the bushes
where she succumbs to her injuries,

776
01:21:24,007 --> 01:21:29,559
the killer returns, but he can't
find her in the rain and the dark.

777
01:21:30,247 --> 01:21:33,045
And would he have let the boy go?

778
01:21:34,087 --> 01:21:37,124
There's killing and then there's killing.

779
01:21:38,367 --> 01:21:40,881
He could have killed the women
in a state of trance,

780
01:21:40,927 --> 01:21:44,317
but he'd had to kill Michal
with a clear head.

781
01:21:44,447 --> 01:21:47,519
One doesn't easily find courage
to do that.

782
01:21:47,847 --> 01:21:49,917
Wait a second.

783
01:21:50,527 --> 01:21:52,677
That murder happened on Sunday.

784
01:21:53,087 --> 01:21:57,399
On Monday, Michal gets the binoculars
and perhaps even the money.

785
01:21:58,247 --> 01:22:00,203
That could've worked.

786
01:22:01,407 --> 01:22:04,479
But those things could have kept him
quiet only for so long.

787
01:22:04,527 --> 01:22:08,236
Then he saw us coming in the barn,
so he made sure that Michal would be quiet for good.

788
01:22:08,327 --> 01:22:11,364
Who knew that you were looking for Michal?

789
01:22:11,487 --> 01:22:16,800
- The Král brothers, the gamekeeper...
- The doctor from the health centre?

790
01:22:17,647 --> 01:22:19,683
It could have been anyone.

791
01:22:20,007 --> 01:22:22,601
He could have hidden there and hear us.

792
01:22:22,727 --> 01:22:26,402
Do you think it was the same person
the whole time?

793
01:22:28,247 --> 01:22:30,238
Looks like it.

794
01:22:30,447 --> 01:22:33,007
- And what about Radka?
- I consider her case separately.

795
01:22:33,527 --> 01:22:35,483
It might be where everything had started.

796
01:22:37,247 --> 01:22:42,247
The attack on the girl might have been
his first attempt.

797
01:22:42,282 --> 01:22:44,477
Of course, I'm only a psychiatrist.

798
01:22:44,607 --> 01:22:46,643
That's why we came for your advice.

799
01:22:47,567 --> 01:22:51,685
The following cases show

800
01:22:51,847 --> 01:22:56,796
that the killer's sexual drive was stronger
than the fear from being exposed.

801
01:22:56,967 --> 01:22:59,640
Perhaps he hadn't had sufficient
opportunities for an intercourse.

802
01:22:59,767 --> 01:23:05,444
And the stereotypical way of killing
suggests that he is a habitual offender.

803
01:23:05,487 --> 01:23:08,365
Such cases are, unfortunately, not that rare.

804
01:23:10,247 --> 01:23:15,241
And could you conjure up an
image of the perpetrator?

805
01:23:15,327 --> 01:23:19,639
Perhaps a mental one, but I doubt
that would be of much use to you.

806
01:23:19,927 --> 01:23:22,077
Why? On the contrary.

807
01:23:24,487 --> 01:23:26,523
Well.

808
01:23:28,367 --> 01:23:33,395
Based on the way he killed,
I would guess that he's a man with no imagination.

809
01:23:33,647 --> 01:23:35,603
A primitive.

810
01:23:38,207 --> 01:23:42,564
And based on who he killed,
I would say that he's an older person,

811
01:23:42,607 --> 01:23:44,404
a person of a flawed character.

812
01:23:45,047 --> 01:23:49,677
He may be aware that his victims
would reject him under normal circumstances.

813
01:23:50,567 --> 01:23:54,242
He might be in his fifties,
a widower,

814
01:23:55,647 --> 01:23:58,559
a husband of a woman who had aged prematurely...

815
01:24:00,767 --> 01:24:03,327
That's probably all I can tell you.

816
01:24:05,567 --> 01:24:12,040
Thank you, doctor.
I think it's starting to look more clear.

817
01:24:13,647 --> 01:24:15,956
And as for the girl...

818
01:24:16,247 --> 01:24:21,241
If she was the first victim, she's the only one
who survived the killer's attack.

819
01:24:21,327 --> 01:24:22,885
Why doesn't she talk, then?

820
01:24:24,207 --> 01:24:26,357
That's hard to say.

821
01:24:28,767 --> 01:24:31,884
It's mutism as a result of a great shock.

822
01:24:32,127 --> 01:24:36,166
Fear of men.
It's a trauma, perhaps for life.

823
01:24:36,247 --> 01:24:38,920
Is there any way to get her out of it?

824
01:24:40,007 --> 01:24:44,046
If it was that easy, I would have already
suggested a way.

825
01:24:44,127 --> 01:24:46,436
But it's too risky.

826
01:24:46,727 --> 01:24:51,642
Doctor, there have been four murders already
and others may follow.

827
01:24:51,767 --> 01:24:53,758
Isn't that risky?

828
01:25:38,367 --> 01:25:42,042
Make the people go about their own business,
we don't want any drama here.

829
01:25:43,527 --> 01:25:45,757
The snow is just what we needed.

830
01:25:49,327 --> 01:25:51,079
- Listen...
- What is it?

831
01:25:52,047 --> 01:25:54,641
Could you tell me what good will this do?

832
01:25:55,047 --> 01:25:57,766
Do you want that girl to become
even more insane?

833
01:25:57,847 --> 01:26:00,042
Leave that up to us, Mr. Král.

834
01:26:06,647 --> 01:26:09,115
Excuse me, but why have you dragged me here?

835
01:26:09,767 --> 01:26:11,439
Because of some fallen balcony?

836
01:26:11,887 --> 01:26:16,324
Look, doctor, sometimes we do things
that are beyond all understanding,

837
01:26:16,647 --> 01:26:18,842
forgive us for that.

838
01:26:19,567 --> 01:26:23,242
That's all, comrade major, I'm taking
three of my people with me, is that enough?

839
01:26:23,407 --> 01:26:25,238
That depends on them.

840
01:26:25,407 --> 01:26:29,685
- What is this all about anyway?
- I don't know, they want you here.

841
01:27:17,807 --> 01:27:21,436
Come this way please.

842
01:27:35,247 --> 01:27:39,126
Don't be afraid of anything, Radka,
we're going to do what we talked about.

843
01:27:39,167 --> 01:27:42,716
You'll be walking like a year ago, okay?
You were returning from your uncle's,

844
01:27:42,767 --> 01:27:45,839
you're holding a bag...
Is that how it was?

845
01:27:46,847 --> 01:27:51,557
And now go.
Walk just as you did that time.

846
01:27:52,327 --> 01:27:55,000
And you'll show us where it happened, okay?

847
01:27:55,047 --> 01:27:58,722
Nothing can happen to you,
look how many of us are here.

848
01:27:59,767 --> 01:28:02,565
Relax, Radka. Walk slowly...

849
01:28:07,127 --> 01:28:09,436
Don't turn around, we're here.

850
01:28:45,807 --> 01:28:48,685
No, Dad, I don't want to!
I don't want to...

851
01:28:48,727 --> 01:28:50,957
I don't want to. I don't want to...

852
01:29:00,887 --> 01:29:02,605
Stop!

853
01:29:03,767 --> 01:29:05,723
Stop!

854
01:29:41,207 --> 01:29:44,597
Stop! Hold it!
You can't get away!

855
01:30:25,247 --> 01:30:26,805
Jirka!

856
01:30:27,447 --> 01:30:29,403
Stop it!

857
01:30:36,407 --> 01:30:37,840
Watch it!

858
01:31:15,887 --> 01:31:17,923
You knew.

859
01:31:18,407 --> 01:31:20,477
Yes.

860
01:31:25,007 --> 01:31:26,759
I know.

861
01:32:02,687 --> 01:32:06,559
THE END
