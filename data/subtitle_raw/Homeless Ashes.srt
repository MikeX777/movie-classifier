1
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,310
- Today's story ends.

2
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,520
It was all over the news,

3
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,270
It says Frankie Moore was troubled.

4
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,310
All that most people saw
was a homeless kid wandering

5
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:55,250
the streets.

6
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,080
A Killer on the run.

7
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,180
The truth as always is
far more complicated.

8
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,040
Frankie was just one of
the many dispossessed,

9
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,350
ignored, hated

10
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,170
but I knew him.

11
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,250
I was there at the beginning.

12
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:19,940
And I was there at the end.

13
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,600
- No batteries?

14
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,950
- It's not battery powered.

15
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,710
- How does it work then?

16
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,760
- Why do you want to know?

17
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,500
- I'm curious.

18
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,800
- Are you?

19
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,630
- Okay, bored.

20
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,170
- I built something
called a Stirling engine-

21
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,000
- Mm-hmm.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,620
You're a clever one.

23
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,450
- I don't know

24
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:05,280
about that.

25
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,560
- Do you want to work for
my dad when you're older?

26
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,440
- An inventor.

27
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,500
Nowadays he says he's a philanthropist.

28
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,020
- What's that?

29
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,720
- If people build things
for him, he makes them rich,

30
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,170
that's what he says.

31
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,440
- Where is he now?

32
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,270
- In a meeting.

33
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:30,920
- He tells you you know?

34
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,130
- What's he going to do?

35
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,110
Run me over?

36
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,680
Come on,

37
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,580
Show me the rest of your town big guy.

38
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,620
- My name's Frankie.

39
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:48,060
- I'm Nicole not Nikki, or Nick or Nicola.

40
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,830
Don't you dare call me Nicola.

41
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,360
- You're funny.

42
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,310
Do you think fish have dreams?

43
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:23,620
- No fish are just fish.

44
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,200
- You don't reckon they

45
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,280
at the surface.

46
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,220
Everything looks so
different for them though.

47
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,980
- You know, I thought i met some

48
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,310
seaweed boys in my time but you.

49
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,720
Hey, daddy.

50
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,110
This is a pity you left.

51
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,360
But

52
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,140
fine.

53
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:02,400
I'm coming.

54
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:06,640
He's mad at me.

55
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,310
- Where's he now?

56
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,700
You know it?

57
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:37,910
- Just remember that my offer
does have an expiry date.

58
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,790
Mr. Langford.

59
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,020
- Frankie?

60
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:41,910
- Hi Mr. Langford.

61
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,940
- He is a nice chap Frankie.

62
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,680
- So why did you fry your start?

63
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:51,360
- Mr. Langford this is
my daughter, Nicole.

64
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,140
She's very much like me.

65
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:58,040
Once an idea occurs she
pursues it regardless of cost

66
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:04,410
It's our calling, helping
people build their ideas into

67
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,490
reality,

68
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:09,120
- As I said, I will
certainly consider your offer

69
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,950
Mr.

70
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,280
- We must be getting back to the city.

71
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,670
It's soon night after all.

72
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,040
- See you fish boy.

73
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,090
- My name is Frankie.

74
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,150
- So, how is your dad doing?

75
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:27,940
- He's fine Mr. Langford.

76
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,290
We're fine.

77
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,760
- Hi,

78
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,740
- I was playing with a
girl from out of town.

79
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,550
- Oh yeah.

80
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:07,320
- Why isn't anything like
that mum

81
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,860
- Franklin, we've talked
about that before.

82
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,570
Dad and I don't want you
hanging around there anymore.

83
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,490
- So, what's cooking?

84
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,340
- You're cooking mate.

85
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,340
- I thought was cooking.

86
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,890
Fish and peas

87
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,470
and of course I love fish and peas.

88
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,460
- Hey,

89
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,840
- Lot's of ketchup.

90
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,960
- It's great food love.

91
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:18,810
- Thanks.

92
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,090
It makes a nice difference
to fish fingers and peas

93
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,340
in front of the TV right?

94
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,300
- I love fish fingers.

95
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,140
- You can have them tomorrow.

96
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,670
brain food fishes.

97
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,510
- You looking forward to
going back to school Frankie?

98
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,340
- I guess.

99
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,100
- Remember what Miss Simon said?

100
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,030
You're right boy.

101
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,340
Don't you let your mind wander out.

102
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,950
- I reckon these teachers
are just jealous.

103
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,770
Probably wish that they had
as big an imagination as you.

104
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,940
- Just try to teach the
boy to be pragmatic Abbie.

105
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,770
- I'm sorry.

106
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,270
How'd it go at the

107
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,890
- How many times have I got
to tell you the day out there

108
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:19,720
is bloody slow?

109
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,260
- Yeah, well, Sunday for a
little while isn't it you know

110
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:25,070
what once we've got some more
money you can get a computer

111
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:28,950
or something and then or what
then then you can spend all

112
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,260
day looking for work.

113
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,170
- Don't you think that's
what I'm doing now?

114
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:35,630
- I didn't mean it like that.

115
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,870
- Maybe I don't have a
vivid enough imagination.

116
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,860
Sit down Franklin.

117
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,540
- Please may I go upstairs?

118
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,410
- What?

119
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,720
You don't want any dessert?

120
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,720
I will get you all some strawberries.

121
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:53,810
- Sure, okay.

122
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,090
- Why don't I do the washing
up and you get going on

123
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,800
to

124
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,200
- I love what you're thinking Mrs. Moore.

125
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,950
- Do you mind folding up the chairs?

126
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,390
- Eat nicely Frankie, no one wants a pig.

127
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,620
- Now leave him alone, he's a growing boy.

128
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,620
- He's growing into a pig.

129
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,530
- I

130
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,080
They are looking for engineers.

131
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,200
- I'm not an engineer.

132
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,060
I was never was an engineer.

133
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,060
- Yeah, I know but Langford-

134
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,150
- Langford was a shipbuilder.

135
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:16,350
Me I took the
Kansas and boathouse.

136
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,130
I wasn't a fucking engineer.

137
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,480
- I'm sorry I didn't think.

138
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,690
- No you didn't think.

139
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:28,700
And I don't want about work
no more again tonight, right?

140
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,160
- Now follow me.

141
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,990
- Aye, aye captain.

142
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,500
- Let me try to help.

143
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,150
- You can't help him.

144
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,860
And if you start talking about work,

145
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,790
think before open your mouth.

146
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:52,770
Allright?

147
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,580
I'm trying to think
practically about things

148
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,840
and all you're doing is fill
Frankie's head with nonsense.

149
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,400
You can go and rant it
jerky place.

150
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,730
You mollycoddled him all his life

151
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,220
and now he knows more
about things

152
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,980
than he does normal life.

153
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,430
- Are yoU ashamed of our son?

154
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,490
- Don't go putting words in my mouth.

155
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,360
Stop giving me shit.

156
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,950
I'm thinking practically
about these things.

157
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:22,090
You pat him on the head for
being a dreamer that is on you.

158
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,020
- Frankie,

159
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,680
why don't you go up to bed?

160
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,630
Hey, I will tuck you in
at night

161
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,690
- That is pathetic.

162
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,440
You are going to go up
upstairs and tuck him in like

163
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,310
he's a toddler.

164
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:47,010
- I hope you are happy with yourself.

165
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,730
- Do you?

166
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,500
- Our son has gifts.

167
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,580
And you are letting him down.

168
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,730
- I'm letting him down.

169
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,830
I'm fucking letting him down.

170
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,490
Allright, is that what you said?

171
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,850
This is your fault.

172
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,680
This is what you made me do.

173
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,160
- Not nice.

174
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,080
It's not right.

175
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,250
- Sometimes grownups fight Frankie.

176
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,810
Just like children.

177
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,840
- That wasn't a fight.

178
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,530
- One day I'll take you way far away.

179
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,500
When my boat full sized.

180
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,550
- That's nice.

181
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,960
This is the real life Frankie.

182
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,830
And he needs me,

183
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,040
The world is a cruel place Frankie,

184
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,890
I'm sorry for teaching you different.

185
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,630
And a cruel world it

186
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,880
can get in people's head
and make more wrong.

187
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,590
- Doesn't matter who he is.

188
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,280
I think a lot is what he does.

189
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,970
- I know that's quite clever.

190
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,150
But have I ever told you

191
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,010
how smart you are?

192
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,300
- All the time.

193
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,070
- Yeah just like granddad Charlie.

194
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:57,550
He was a one and
a dreamer and just like you.

195
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,110
I have to tell you, he gave me this.

196
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,840
- Yeah

197
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,780
- Yeah, he gave me this.

198
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,240
When you were born,

199
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,000
- Can you tell me please?

200
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:24,790
- Come here,

201
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,690
why don't you hold on to that?

202
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,850
Till the world becomes a better place.

203
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,560
Oh Frankie.

204
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:41,820
- Do you know where
your son is Mrs. Moore?

205
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,240
Mrs. Moore do you know where your son is?

206
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:28,680
- Right, just grab it and run
fast enough that I don't catch

207
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,510
up, slow enough that
the dog will snort you.

208
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,540
I will just need to
get distracted a while.

209
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,240
I need time to get in there.

210
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,210
- Just be quick about it okay?

211
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,710
- That's it boy, there you go.

212
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:02,810
- Hey, you plan on paying paying for that?

213
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,260
- I'm sorry I-

214
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,220
- Stealing off me?

215
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:14,760
- Please, you don't have any
problems of a little grill?

216
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,220
Sometimes it won't turn on.

217
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:21,650
- And your point is?

218
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:25,240
- You need to replace switch.

219
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,070
I can fix it.

220
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,310
- But in exchange for that
I'm going to give you popcorn.

221
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,630
Well come on then.

222
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,660
- You should have run faster.

223
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,890
That girl in the wheelchair, get her bag.

224
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:18,850
- Why?

225
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:22,960
Sick people have pills,
painkillers, stuff to sell.

226
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,790
Go.

227
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,420
- Frankie, stop.

228
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,410
It's you, isn't it?

229
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:02,450
- Yeah.

230
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:04,630
So, it's good to see you, Nicole.

231
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,100
- Frankie, is it true?

232
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:09,150
Frankie?

233
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,010
- He was hurting my mum.

234
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:15,340
- Meet me at front
entrance, tomorrow, okay.

235
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,660
Have you been sleeping on the streets?

236
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,490
- Yes.

237
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,580
- You are just a kid.

238
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,830
- Yeah and I'm like two
years younger than you.

239
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:07,990
- Exactly, I sleep in a penthouse.

240
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:08,820
- That's hard to believe.

241
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,000
- Frankie, you can't stay out here.

242
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,030
- I can't go home.

243
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,680
- So if you're in hiding,

244
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,780
why would you come on a busy playground?

245
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,140
- Where's the bag,

246
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,390
- Thief.

247
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:28,300
- Leave him alone.

248
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:36,410
- Either you swipe to or you didn't.

249
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:39,910
If you want to stay at
our place, come to me.

250
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:41,470
- I will call the police.

251
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,460
- Hey my little princess.

252
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,300
None of your business.

253
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:49,300
- Police

254
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,610
- Shit.

255
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:28,290
- Get yourself some
better friends fish boy.

256
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,580
- I better go.

257
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:32,800
I'm sorry

258
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,990
- Stay safe, okay?

259
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,910
I haven't seen you around
for a couple of weeks.

260
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,690
- Yeah,

261
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:19,520
They kicked us out of the old church.

262
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,350
- What?

263
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,640
- I barely had even the
time to gather my tools.

264
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,290
- You are still
parlor of yours

265
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:30,740
- Yeah, to the
riverside apparently there's

266
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,750
some safe place to stay.

267
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:36,070
- Or you could be sensible
and go to the hospital.

268
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,000
- Hungry?

269
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,240
- Look, this is why it's
going to work, right?

270
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,220
- I'm going to pretend there's
a problem with the grill.

271
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,710
You're going to fix it and then
I'm going to give you a hot

272
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,940
dog, we just skipped the ritual this time.

273
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,650
Boom

274
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,150
- Thanks man.

275
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:09,510
- Don't worry about it.

276
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,340
Just remember it's my birthday

277
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,180
next month.

278
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,260
- Get you a card?

279
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,280
- Never mind the card.

280
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,530
You just sort that hair out.

281
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:16,420
It's ridiculous.

282
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,440
- Piss off.

283
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:27,970
- Stay away from me.

284
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:29,070
All right.

285
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:29,910
I mean it.

286
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:31,860
I'm warning you.

287
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,510
- I'm just like you
I'm just like you.

288
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,340
Are you like me?

289
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,440
You know nothing about me.

290
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,000
Okay, I need this.

291
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:41,520
I need it.

292
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:43,810
- Go on look in the case.

293
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:57,090
- These are just tools.

294
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:59,950
What do you want me to do with them?

295
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:00,850
I need money.

296
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:06,890
Seriously, I need money.

297
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:08,390
- It's all I have.

298
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,440
- It's a doggy dog world mate.

299
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,830
Being nice will get you killed.

300
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,350
- I know you.

301
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,550
You used to run with Viv.

302
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,080
- Just calm down, man.

303
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,920
Calm down.

304
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,660
- Hey, babe

305
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,520
- Hey Nicole.

306
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,710
- Are you at yours?

307
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,850
- Yes, come over.

308
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,140
- Can I yeah, I'm not
feeling all that right now.

309
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:34,540
- Yeah, I just need
something to help me relax.

310
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:56,430
- Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

311
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:57,600
- I was just practicing.

312
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,250
- I wish I could dance like that.

313
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,930
- I'm I doing this?

314
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:13,930
Hey, let me show you some moves.

315
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:14,920
- Really?

316
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:19,330
Not ready to trust for that.

317
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:20,370
- It's all right.

318
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:21,220
What's your name?

319
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:25,290
Frankie Moore.

320
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:28,050
- All right.

321
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:29,470
I'm Jess.

322
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:33,000
Allright so have you ever danced before?

323
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,560
No.

324
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,280
Okay, so put your feet
together just like that.

325
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:43,280
And let's make the round
arms, round with further down.

326
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,720
- That really lifted my low.

327
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,520
I was just being chased before this.

328
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,590
Thank you Jess.

329
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,300
- Who are you running from?

330
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,490
- Those are different people.

331
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,060
Doesn't matter.

332
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,110
Happens all the time.

333
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:52,510
- That's not really an answer.

334
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,620
- It was better dancing than running.

335
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,860
- You must be hungry from all the running.

336
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,730
- No, no, no, no, it's okay.

337
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:12,140
- Come on it's just
and carrots.

338
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,940
- I'd love some carrots.

339
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,770
- Yes.

340
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:18,600
- Okay.

341
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,210
It's beautiful.

342
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:37,270
- Yeah, it's my favorite spot.

343
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,170
- Do you want one?

344
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:45,230
- Yeah.

345
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,890
- Nicole it's me.

346
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:38,320
- Frankie Moore,

347
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:45,810
and now I'm going to
leave you with nothing.

348
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,160
I want to hurt you

349
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,310
Take all of his clothes off.

350
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:58,310
all of them.

351
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,100
Take them off now, take them off.

352
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,310
- Off you bitch.

353
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:03,640
- Take them off.

354
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:56,610
- You need help my friend.

355
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,900
Come on.

356
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,650
You want to be more careful yeah.

357
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,020
- Hey

358
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:54,860
Frankie

359
00:37:55,930 --> 00:38:00,540
get a burger and a hot dog or
whatever processed sludge meat

360
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,590
your friend gave you.

361
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:04,800
I'm just kidding you.

362
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,070
Your friend he's a nice man.

363
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:10,980
His food isn't worth a shit.

364
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:11,980
He's a nice fella

365
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:18,470
Nice tires over here out of
the way I might burn one later.

366
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:24,820
I used that that foil
wrapper and battery trick you

367
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,330
taught me.

368
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:27,890
A clever one I'll give you that.

369
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:29,860
Me I'm the handsome one

370
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:36,890
Shit Frankie, what the hell happened?

371
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:37,720
What happened?

372
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,740
No no no no no.

373
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,930
Talk to me.

374
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:41,760
- It's just Viv.

375
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,180
- Viv?

376
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,770
Did she violate you?

377
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:52,270
- No, it's okay.

378
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:55,600
- But we've got to do something.

379
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,600
In fact we need to call the cops on her.

380
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:01,450
- No

381
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:03,050
- we have got to do something I mean what-

382
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:03,970
- No, nothing.

383
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:09,350
- What else is it Frankie?

384
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:14,180
No, there's something else happening.

385
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:17,510
- Just saw

386
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,340
- Who?

387
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:29,970
Well, if you want to talk
I've got no place to go.

388
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,750
Put too much wood in there.

389
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,890
There's a tire in the bottom.

390
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:43,250
It might burn all night.

391
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,560
- Sounds allright.

392
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,480
- Sure is.

393
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,720
- Come on, come on friends.

394
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,480
One man's trash is another man's

395
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,860
treasure as they say, right buddy.

396
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,350
Point is ladies and gentlemen,
what you've been looking

397
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:09,370
for is right at your bedside.

398
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:12,580
And my good associate here
Frankie has repurposed

399
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:16,710
reconditioned and recycled
everything that you in fact need.

400
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,340
We have it right here.

401
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:21,630
Take a look take a gander
find what you're looking for.

402
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:24,680
Now everything looks like
a normal everyday item

403
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,840
But in fact, they've all
been reconditioned to fit in

404
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,540
your household very uniquely.

405
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:33,290
Something you won't find it
your department stores, no.

406
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:36,410
Something of very modern fashion.

407
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:39,490
It looks like an ordinary
camera at some point it made

408
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:43,020
memories but in fact,
it's been repurposed to a-

409
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,030
- Radio.

410
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:44,860
- What?

411
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,250
- Radio.

412
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:49,280
- It has been repurposed
to also be a radio.

413
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,740
So that while you're making
memories, you can play your

414
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,500
favorite melody.

415
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:59,530
Why in my day, we call
this in fact a slingshot.

416
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:03,020
It was quite used to take
down the occasional squirrel

417
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:03,850
for dinner.

418
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:07,420
Mark Twain, I think that'll
serve you quite well.

419
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,440
That's just one pound now.

420
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,390
Oh, thank you.

421
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:12,000
Bless you, ma'am.

422
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Bless you.

423
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
- Thank you.

424
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
- All right.

425
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,530
Well, just remember one
man's trash is another man's

426
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:17,360
treasure.

427
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:19,530
Pretty good day.

428
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:21,880
- I enjoyed it thank you.

429
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,000
Sounds

430
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,850
- I suppose I do.

431
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:29,290
I always liked when I was a
little kid going to the circus

432
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:31,690
and seeing that guy down
the middle of the ring.

433
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,750
I guess I'm just a showman at heart.

434
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:36,670
- You are good at it.

435
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:41,070
- The main thing is we got
enough to replenish our supplies.

436
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,220
Get some real food.

437
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,620
I'm going to go have a look.

438
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,240
- Right back up.

439
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:02,900
- Strawberries.

440
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:07,820
- Chico, is that

441
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,260
I haven't seen him since last winter.

442
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:15,260
Chico

443
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:17,150
- I will be damned.

444
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,760
Prince.

445
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,350
You old rascal.

446
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:26,680
I haven't seen you in years.

447
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:31,950
Man play that song.

448
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:37,160
Oh, yeah.

449
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,440
What's wrong with these people?

450
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,850
Frankie, come on?

451
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:46,620
Come say hi to Prince.

452
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:40,910
Bless you

453
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:42,030
Thank you.

454
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:43,430
We will appreciate you ma'am.

455
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:45,090
Allright, thank you.

456
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:49,640
Hey not bad.

457
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,470
- Oh my God-

458
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:51,670
- Not bad at all.

459
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,770
- Oh my God, is this money?

460
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:54,960
- It's all yours.

461
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:57,860
- 30 years I have been doing this shit.

462
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,560
I couldn't make a coffee sometime.

463
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,460
And you come along, dance like an idiot.

464
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:06,000
And making me some money

465
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
- I aim to please.

466
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,200
Good to see you brother.

467
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,300
- Good to see you bro.

468
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,460
Frankie is still hanging
around with this old brat?

469
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:17,230
- Yeah, well, you know Chico,
it's always entertaining

470
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,180
friends.

471
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:21,020
- Who are two friends here?

472
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:21,930
- Man.

473
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:22,980
Let me introduce you.

474
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,400
Eva.

475
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,400
- Hi.

476
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,750
- She came to this country
looking for a better life.

477
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:28,560
And a friend Al.

478
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,260
He just left the army.

479
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:31,380
- Good to meet you.

480
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,800
- We been sleeping in
some abandoned buildings.

481
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,800
Not too far from here.

482
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,240
- Yeah?

483
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,240
- At the edge of the Industrial Estate.

484
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,060
- Frankie and I were
thinking about heading

485
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:41,060
to the waterfront.

486
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:43,020
They got some places down there we hear.

487
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:44,690
- My brother from

488
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:46,560
another mother
- Brother from another

489
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,580
mother man.

490
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:49,080
- If I don't see you
tomorrow, hello today.

491
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,500
- You got it going on dude,
you got the dancing going on

492
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,460
man.

493
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:53,860
You need some lessons, dude.

494
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:56,240
Frankie, pleasure man.

495
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:16,980
- This feels weird.

496
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,910
I don't exactly have my sea legs

497
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:27,720
- I always pictured myself
sailing away on one of these

498
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,820
things, you know leaving it all behind it.

499
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,280
- Really?

500
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:39,120
Is it possible to be seasick
if you're technically

501
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,980
still on land?

502
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:45,270
- Jeez, Frankie.

503
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,430
I mean, I know your fascination

504
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:51,040
with machines, but I've
never known you had interest

505
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,650
in boats.

506
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:54,170
- Yeah.

507
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:55,190
I made a promise.

508
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,960
- Promise is a promise.

509
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:11,640
- You allright?

510
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:12,470
- Yeah.

511
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:15,890
- Nice digs.

512
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:38,650
- You should go home mate.

513
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:40,200
- It's nothing.

514
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,960
It's just a tickle.

515
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:42,790
- Just a tickle?

516
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,960
I want to talk to you about something.

517
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:53,790
I don't know.

518
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:55,140
Advice, I suppose.

519
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:56,840
- So you are going to ask
a bloke who sells hot dogs

520
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,040
for a living for advice?

521
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:02,780
I'm not the brightest
bulb on the bubble mate.

522
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:05,400
- Yeah, but you've lived
much longer than me mate.

523
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,580
- Well, thank you very much for that.

524
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:11,490
So what is it young man?

525
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:14,140
What is it that's bothering
you apart from the whole

526
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:15,350
destitute thing?

527
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:29,570
Just got me thinking.

528
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:32,040
- I'm sensing a question.

529
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:40,670
- Just how long is too long?

530
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:45,740
I know you think if I could I just

531
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,200
go home.

532
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,310
- Why are you asking me this?

533
00:47:50,310 --> 00:47:51,660
Why don't you ask your pal.

534
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,600
- Chico is

535
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:00,700
he's involved and y'all know Gavin.

536
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:07,680
- Oh, so the only person you
could think to talk to is me.

537
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:12,110
- Well, I think your
answers right then mate.

538
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,040
When the only company you
can keep us in an old fool,

539
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,560
then perhaps a journey home
is exactly what you should be

540
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,390
doing.

541
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:26,380
You're lucky enough to
have a home to go home to.

542
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:37,360
- Nicole.

543
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:43,080
It's me, fish boy.

544
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:46,710
Frankie

545
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:53,500
- Frankie.

546
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:56,040
- I won't bite.

547
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,280
Do you mind to go to a walk with me?

548
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,420
Look I'm about to meet a friend.

549
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,340
You will like him, he's nice.

550
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:22,280
Would you like to come?

551
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,560
Let's see where I live.

552
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,860
it's not nothing special but

553
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:33,210
It's a home.

554
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:35,390
- Yeah, sure.

555
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:38,060
- Cool.

556
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:44,440
- Where is it?

557
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,280
Here?

558
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,450
- They are good people.

559
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:50,300
Very good people.

560
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:35,690
- So yeah, I felt it was
pretty much the last place

561
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:36,590
we saw each other.

562
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:42,400
So I guess that means,
you've known Frankie longest.

563
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:44,210
- Yeah.

564
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,690
- Tell me something.

565
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,020
Was he always this fucking boring.

566
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:54,200
I mean boy is boring, right?

567
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:01,720
- I haven't seen fish boy for so long.

568
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,590
- Fish boy so you notice the smell too?

569
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:07,220
- What?

570
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:08,050
I don't smell.

571
00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:08,890
- Are you kidding me?

572
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:10,920
Seagulls fly around thinking
you're a big sardine

573
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,330
waiting to pick your eyes out.

574
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:15,300
- Sorry listen, I suppose
that is your friend.

575
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,480
- I'm not the one being called fish boy.

576
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,900
Right?

577
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,990
I mean, it smells like a fish.

578
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:27,610
I think it will be a
little hard on Frankie.

579
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:30,220
Old lads been picked on enough.

580
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:32,500
Prince,

581
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:35,220
Play that song.

582
00:52:39,270 --> 00:52:40,900
- Do you mean the one you like?

583
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:42,350
- You know, yeah, the one I like,

584
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:43,180
play that one.

585
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:45,450
- No problem dude.

586
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:47,620
No problem.

587
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,000
- Check it out man.

588
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:13,600
- I like him.

589
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,430
- Chico.

590
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:15,990
- Yeah.

591
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:17,710
- Yeah he's great.

592
00:53:17,710 --> 00:53:18,830
- When you live like I do.

593
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:21,530
It's good to have someone
like that to have your back.

594
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:28,850
- That's what I want to ask you actually.

595
00:53:28,850 --> 00:53:30,670
Have you been out on the
streets all these winters?

596
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:32,520
- Yeah.

597
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:36,160
- State has some shelters.

598
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:39,900
roofs as big as this one.

599
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:44,140
Keeping a low profile when you're homeless

600
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:45,990
pretty much invisible to most people.

601
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:50,330
- So what you energy goes
just traveling around now?

602
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:54,190
Wait, you said you can
remember you me as a kid.

603
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:57,270
When did you meet them?

604
00:53:57,270 --> 00:53:58,100
- Three years ago.

605
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,270
Left his job just walked
away from his old life.

606
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:05,130
- Wait, he just willingly became homeless?

607
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:07,030
That's insane.

608
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:11,760
- I just wanted to be
where people were Nicole.

609
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,880
Where tools were, build my things.

610
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,710
Besides me and Chico
make money for supplies.

611
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:18,830
- So what, you two just
been piling around together

612
00:54:18,830 --> 00:54:19,660
ever since?

613
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:23,380
- Yeah.

614
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:24,300
- As I'm a psychic.

615
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:32,960
- You were always a serious young boy.

616
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,660
- Those were serious times Nicole.

617
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:38,190
- Do you ever think about your dad?

618
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:42,420
- Obvious.

619
00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:45,940
- Your mom

620
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,240
- Had a boyfriend, had a girlfriend.

621
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:06,770
Had a better boyfriend.

622
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:10,220
I lost the
for about six weeks.

623
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,910
- it's pretty funny full
book about investment.

624
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:18,700
- My dad will love him.

625
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:20,250
No matter how hard he makes it.

626
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:32,770
- Things okay with you guys?

627
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:35,300
- No.

628
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:40,300
Kind of

629
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:49,650
I love these things.

630
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:50,990
- Do you want to buy one?

631
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:55,270
- Do you want to buy one?

632
00:55:56,870 --> 00:55:59,010
Allright, maybe a bit later.

633
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:00,260
- Does your dad hurt you?

634
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:04,700
- What?

635
00:56:07,710 --> 00:56:08,930
No, nothing like that.

636
00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:10,990
Frankie he is not an evil man,

637
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:14,500
I just wish he cared less
about profit margins.

638
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:15,330
That's all.

639
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:19,280
- I wish you could do
something about all of this.

640
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:21,080
You know you me.

641
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:29,100
- Not everything can be repaired.

642
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:32,060
- I know.

643
00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:34,960
- I've got to go.

644
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:13,250
- Nicole, What have you been taking?

645
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:14,490
- Dad-

646
00:57:14,490 --> 00:57:15,330
- What have you been taking?

647
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:16,160
What have you taken?

648
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:17,830
I have called the ambulance.

649
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:20,660
- Give me my phone.

650
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:21,490
- I just called the ambulance for you.

651
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,190
You need to get some help Nicole.

652
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:27,800
I'm just looking out for you.

653
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:34,980
- I'm going to go.

654
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:36,230
Check on the ambulance.

655
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:42,430
- I've been there.

656
00:57:45,110 --> 00:57:45,940
I've been there Nicole.

657
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:49,650
Don't kill yourself.

658
00:57:56,850 --> 00:57:58,180
Let me help you.

659
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:03,000
Okay.

660
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:09,690
I have been there.

661
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:15,390
Okay, listen I have to go.

662
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:18,480
- No, don't go.

663
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:25,590
- The next
few weeks were tough.

664
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:27,860
I wasn't going to rehab.

665
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:28,700
Not this time.

666
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:31,920
was a gesture nothing more.

667
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,360
I needed places to get more.

668
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:36,540
Sometimes I did get more.

669
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:39,770
Data for counselors and
doctors Frankie gave me

670
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:42,020
the helping hand and
the shoulders to cry on.

671
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,120
To my father, my addictions
were an embarrassment.

672
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,580
To Frankie they were
a problem to be fixed.

673
00:58:57,210 --> 00:58:58,960
Neither of them totally understood.

674
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,590
At least

675
00:59:02,590 --> 00:59:04,140
- The script that got me fixed.

676
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:09,340
Tried maybe one of our cronies.

677
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:14,000
Serious Nicole.

678
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,300
That's what you got right.

679
00:59:18,030 --> 00:59:21,130
Snuck a voice that just
comes in your head.

680
00:59:23,370 --> 00:59:24,660
- Well, I've been getting help for that

681
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:25,770
from my online group.

682
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:33,400
their advice
is not anything I have known

683
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,230
before.

684
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:37,350
- It doesn't mean it's
not going to work Nicole.

685
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:44,270
. No, I have no easy answers for you.

686
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:50,720
Look at me, all I could
do is just be your friend.

687
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:01,540
- What did you do when the lights came on

688
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:04,990
- Build things.

689
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,590
- Sometimes weeks had passed
where I wouldn't go to him

690
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:38,420
at all.

691
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:41,220
We didn't always talk.

692
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:45,110
He helped me by just being.

693
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:48,910
Just to me

694
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:58,690
- Yeah it is fine.

695
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:01,520
They are my friends.

696
01:01:14,650 --> 01:01:15,910
Right,

697
01:01:15,910 --> 01:01:16,740
- Hey

698
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:22,140
- Listen I'm sorry about before.

699
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:24,570
I wasn't really thinking straight.

700
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:29,450
The way I see it if we start
stealing from each other

701
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:30,450
we're screwed right?

702
01:01:32,010 --> 01:01:33,920
The world has taken
enough from us as it is.

703
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:36,170
That's no excuse.

704
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:40,280
You gave my toss back.

705
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:41,110
we are good.

706
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:43,460
- Allright.

707
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:46,310
I'm PJ.

708
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:49,260
- Frankie.

709
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:56,990
- They already see us as thieves.

710
01:01:56,990 --> 01:01:58,260
So different tools.

711
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:02,600
Other than a few missed bills
away from being right here.

712
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:10,220
- PJ you haven't been
homeless long have you?

713
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,690
- If you told me two years
ago that I was going to end up

714
01:02:18,690 --> 01:02:20,970
living like this I would
have laughed in your face.

715
01:02:22,210 --> 01:02:24,840
I had my own bar, believe it or not,

716
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:28,030
fiance, a plan.

717
01:02:32,530 --> 01:02:34,180
But I was too quiet for too long.

718
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:36,810
Bills kept coming in.

719
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:39,550
Wedding was delayed

720
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:46,940
I was bankrupt.

721
01:02:49,570 --> 01:02:50,570
I was alone.

722
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,100
Don't take much for everything to unravel.

723
01:02:56,010 --> 01:02:57,510
- Just takes one thing, right.

724
01:02:59,770 --> 01:03:01,070
- So what happened to you?

725
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:03,970
Just one thing?

726
01:03:07,610 --> 01:03:09,000
- No.

727
01:03:17,270 --> 01:03:19,290
Hey another word.

728
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,860
- Chico's over there.

729
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:26,520
Hey.

730
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:43,260
- All right.

731
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:49,930
- Hello.

732
01:03:49,930 --> 01:03:50,790
- Hey, Miss Nicole.

733
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:53,060
- Hello.

734
01:03:53,060 --> 01:03:54,190
- How are you feeling?

735
01:03:54,190 --> 01:03:55,520
- Feeling okay.

736
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:56,660
- How are you doing?

737
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:57,680
- Good.

738
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:00,500
- Chico can I ask you something?

739
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:03,220
What if

740
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:05,320
you walked away from your life.

741
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:17,310
- I don't like to talk about that.

742
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:19,800
- Okay, I'm sorry.

743
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:23,320
- Don't ask me.

744
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:24,850
Heavy burdens Miss Nicole.

745
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:33,420
Heavier than the weight
of the world on your back.

746
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,940
around your neck.

747
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:46,240
I wasn't always on the streets.

748
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:48,960
I had a life,

749
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:56,290
a family.

750
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:00,730
- The green ones are my favorite.

751
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:03,450
- Allright, they are
your dad's favorite too.

752
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:15,440
- Ho ho ho, merry Christmas.

753
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:16,270
- Daddy.

754
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,080
- Hi, pumpkin.

755
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:22,670
Hello.

756
01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:25,180
Are you all right.

757
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:26,490
- Yeah, I'm good.

758
01:05:26,490 --> 01:05:27,320
How are you?

759
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:28,810
How is it out there?

760
01:05:28,810 --> 01:05:30,230
- Terrible.

761
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:31,370
It's madness.

762
01:05:31,370 --> 01:05:33,110
I'm not even kidding.

763
01:05:33,110 --> 01:05:34,110
I mean

764
01:05:34,110 --> 01:05:35,630
literally people are mad.

765
01:05:35,630 --> 01:05:37,150
Traffic, that's awful.

766
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:39,170
But this tree is fantastic.

767
01:05:39,170 --> 01:05:40,170
- Thank you.

768
01:05:40,170 --> 01:05:41,000
- We did a good job, didn't we?

769
01:05:42,570 --> 01:05:43,570
- I think so?

770
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:44,750
- Mm- hmm-

771
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:46,290
- I think you couldn't
have done it by yourself.

772
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:47,120
I'd say that we've got a
pretty good helper there.

773
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:49,810
And it was cold outside.

774
01:05:49,810 --> 01:05:51,750
You know what's worse?

775
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:53,310
Crowds.

776
01:05:53,310 --> 01:05:54,140
- Yeah.

777
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:55,330
- Mayhem

778
01:06:02,690 --> 01:06:05,190
- Daddy would forget his
head if it wasn't attached

779
01:06:06,450 --> 01:06:07,780
to his body.

780
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:10,740
I've already been out
the shops quite a bit,

781
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:15,630
getting things we don't
need like wrapping paper...

782
01:06:15,630 --> 01:06:16,630
Who wraps gifts?

783
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:17,980
- Santa and his howls.

784
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:18,810
- Santa!

785
01:06:19,870 --> 01:06:21,700
- Yeah, me too.

786
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:22,530
- Bye daddy.

787
01:06:25,570 --> 01:06:26,820
Get some sleep.

788
01:06:31,850 --> 01:06:32,980
- Sweet dreams.

789
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:35,270
- Don't get too long.

790
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:36,270
- I won't.

791
01:06:36,270 --> 01:06:37,290
I love you.

792
01:06:37,290 --> 01:06:38,370
- I love you.

793
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,270
- Merry Christmas

794
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:42,770
- Merry Christmas.

795
01:06:49,530 --> 01:06:51,030
- We are finished.

796
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:55,000
Yes, good girl.

797
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,010
Dad

798
01:06:57,010 --> 01:06:58,010
- Yeah,

799
01:06:58,010 --> 01:06:58,840
fire brigade.

800
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:01,960
There's a house it's
completely up in smoke.

801
01:07:03,410 --> 01:07:05,810
Three people I think.

802
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,170
- Stop.

803
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:37,110
- Beautiful wife.

804
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:46,730
An angel for a daughter.

805
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:53,140
I don't have them anymore.

806
01:07:58,320 --> 01:07:59,150
They're gone.

807
01:08:04,130 --> 01:08:08,590
So after that, I didn't want
to live this life anymore.

808
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:17,940
I wanted to take myself
out of the equation.

809
01:08:19,190 --> 01:08:21,120
Just didn't make sense to be here.

810
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:23,970
I don't know.

811
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:28,020
I might have been looking
for some reason to stay.

812
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:32,720
One day I found it.

813
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:33,960
Several years ago.

814
01:08:36,610 --> 01:08:38,830
I was squatting at this
place where I would

815
01:08:40,070 --> 01:08:44,720
do some bad things.

816
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:47,030
Are you doing all right?

817
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,160
- Oh shit, Chico.

818
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:50,320
Bloody mate.

819
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:51,820
- What?

820
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:55,710
- You are shitting me, right?

821
01:08:55,710 --> 01:08:56,910
You live in here?

822
01:08:56,910 --> 01:08:57,740
- No.

823
01:08:58,870 --> 01:08:59,920
- You did a good job.

824
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:13,010
- Come on Chico, I

825
01:09:13,010 --> 01:09:15,200
Come on, I want some things.

826
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,210
- There was a little boy there.

827
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:06,090
- Frankie?

828
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:09,660
Did I hear you say Frankie?

829
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:14,690
- No.

830
01:11:14,690 --> 01:11:16,280
I didn't save him Miss Nicole.

831
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:19,970
I had some training.

832
01:11:19,970 --> 01:11:22,320
I actually did what I could, I tried out.

833
01:11:23,690 --> 01:11:24,910
I didn't know what I was doing.

834
01:11:24,910 --> 01:11:26,250
I was scared.

835
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:28,070
Frankie saved himself

836
01:11:28,070 --> 01:11:29,390
- No, Chico you saved him.

837
01:11:29,390 --> 01:11:30,220
- No.

838
01:11:31,470 --> 01:11:32,490
- Yes.

839
01:11:32,490 --> 01:11:34,160
His strength to survive
is what saved Frankie.

840
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:38,330
He is such a bright light.

841
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:41,530
- Yeah, he is.

842
01:11:44,510 --> 01:11:45,390
- Well after.

843
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:53,540
We got together, we bonded.

844
01:11:58,170 --> 01:11:59,770
We were in the streets together.

845
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:07,440
He makes these contraptions
he invents these crazy things

846
01:12:08,630 --> 01:12:09,950
that people love off the streets.

847
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:12,730
I mean they're fantastic.

848
01:12:12,730 --> 01:12:15,570
Really and I sell them
I got the gift of gab,

849
01:12:15,570 --> 01:12:20,080
And that's how we

850
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,400
make our money and get by.

851
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:30,280
It isn't a bad life.

852
01:12:36,710 --> 01:12:37,550
- Frankie.

853
01:12:40,950 --> 01:12:44,990
He had nothing

854
01:12:44,990 --> 01:12:45,830
Nothing.

855
01:12:47,610 --> 01:12:50,610
He was on the streets and on the run.

856
01:12:50,610 --> 01:12:55,610
Me I started using because I was rich.

857
01:13:00,450 --> 01:13:02,940
And spoilt.

858
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:04,260
And I hate my dad.

859
01:13:06,670 --> 01:13:08,500
Coming
here was a big mistake.

860
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:11,670
- No Miss Nicole, don't do that.

861
01:13:11,670 --> 01:13:13,460
- You've been through so much Chico.

862
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:17,500
You can't keep running from yourself.

863
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:22,500
Funny thing that you're
always with yourself.

864
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:26,190
- Chico, some people live in such shit.

865
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:29,190
And some people live without a care.

866
01:13:31,810 --> 01:13:34,890
This all just feels so damn wrong.

867
01:13:36,350 --> 01:13:38,210
I'm exploiting you.

868
01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:39,100
You shouldn't be helping me.

869
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:58,040
- Nicole?

870
01:13:58,040 --> 01:13:59,470
- Yeah.

871
01:13:59,470 --> 01:14:00,470
- Where are you going?

872
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:01,890
- I just need to be alone
for a while Frankie.

873
01:14:01,890 --> 01:14:04,060
- Let me help you.

874
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:05,960
- I just need to help myself.

875
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:08,470
Wait, I got you

876
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:11,130
something

877
01:14:12,770 --> 01:14:13,920
Early birthday present.

878
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:17,010
I'm getting good, huh?

879
01:14:21,930 --> 01:14:25,150
Meet me at the bridge in an hour.

880
01:14:25,150 --> 01:14:26,160
- Okay.

881
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:00,670
Hey

882
01:15:00,670 --> 01:15:01,500
- Hi mate.

883
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:02,330
- Yeah.

884
01:15:02,330 --> 01:15:03,170
- what can I get you?

885
01:15:03,170 --> 01:15:04,350
- Can you get me Gavin?

886
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:08,100
Give this to him

887
01:15:10,670 --> 01:15:12,820
- He passed away a few days ago mate.

888
01:15:13,870 --> 01:15:14,700
I'm sorry.

889
01:15:18,330 --> 01:15:19,160
- Of what?

890
01:15:20,270 --> 01:15:21,100
- Pneumonia.

891
01:15:25,910 --> 01:15:28,220
He always liked cards.

892
01:16:05,450 --> 01:16:06,280
- Frankie.

893
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:11,420
It's your mum's new address.

894
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,590
Frankie, I haven't seen her for 10 years.

895
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:28,810
- Thank you.

896
01:16:55,940 --> 01:16:56,770
Hey bro.

897
01:16:58,660 --> 01:17:02,760
- You just fuck off allright?

898
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:05,320
Just get on, just fuck off.

899
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:09,760
- I'm just a friend.

900
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:13,400
Same situation as you,
you can't stay here.

901
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:14,520
- I don't give a shit.

902
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:15,790
You just leave me alone yeah.

903
01:17:15,790 --> 01:17:18,410
- Do you want to go to a
safe place man, come on

904
01:17:20,370 --> 01:17:21,200
You can trust me man.

905
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:24,450
- Why the fuck should I trust you, huh?

906
01:17:27,790 --> 01:17:30,710
Just leave me alone, just fuck off.

907
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:39,520
Help me, wait come
here, this is my friend.

908
01:17:41,130 --> 01:17:42,710
- Is she all right?

909
01:18:24,270 --> 01:18:25,470
- Viv, what happened?

910
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:34,810
- I thought you guys were friends.

911
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:36,710
- Friends?

912
01:18:36,710 --> 01:18:38,630
Friends is what you have or not me.

913
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:48,040
- Where's Ryan, Viv?

914
01:18:50,270 --> 01:18:51,190
Where's he?

915
01:18:57,470 --> 01:19:01,470
- Frankie,
on time but I'm so sorry.

916
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:10,120
- It's okay.

917
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:12,430
It's okay.

918
01:20:05,970 --> 01:20:07,390
Please, come, on.

919
01:20:12,590 --> 01:20:13,590
- What the fuck.

920
01:20:13,590 --> 01:20:15,090
Get the fuck off me.

921
01:20:15,090 --> 01:20:16,150
- Grab him.

922
01:20:16,150 --> 01:20:17,310
- Just fuck you.

923
01:20:17,310 --> 01:20:18,550
- Grab him.

924
01:20:18,550 --> 01:20:21,790
- Fuck you, I'm going to fucking kill you.

925
01:20:21,790 --> 01:20:22,790
- I got it.

926
01:20:22,790 --> 01:20:23,880
- Get off me.

927
01:20:25,110 --> 01:20:27,030
- What are you doing?

928
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:28,780
- You deserve worse than this fucker.

929
01:20:28,780 --> 01:20:32,150
- Fuck, I will fucking kill you.

930
01:20:34,030 --> 01:20:34,980
Go, Frankie go, go.

931
01:20:36,530 --> 01:20:38,030
- You fucking pig.

932
01:20:47,860 --> 01:20:49,010
- Thanks, allright?

933
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:51,570
- Is that all you have for your hat?

934
01:20:51,570 --> 01:20:54,450
- That's okay, you can give me
more when you make a fortune

935
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:55,600
some day.

936
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,060
- Deal.

937
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:59,960
- I want a big house a hot tub
and my own recording studio.

938
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:01,090
- Recording studio?

939
01:21:01,090 --> 01:21:02,220
- Yeah.

940
01:21:05,220 --> 01:21:06,730
It's not what goes to them, isn't it?

941
01:21:08,550 --> 01:21:11,620
Beg, sing, sell magazines
and they just walk straight

942
01:21:11,620 --> 01:21:12,450
past us.

943
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:16,770
- Don't forget about the ones
that speed up when they notice

944
01:21:16,770 --> 01:21:17,600
you.

945
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:21,120
They look at absolutely anything
in the street as long as

946
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:22,770
they don't have to look your way.

947
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:28,510
- I think it's easy for them.

948
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:33,960
To pretend to themselves
that they just don't see us.

949
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:36,580
- When they look at us they feel guilt.

950
01:21:36,580 --> 01:21:37,880
Nobody likes to feel guilt

951
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:42,730
- I suppose.

952
01:21:42,730 --> 01:21:44,120
I felt like they need to help
us and everyone has their own

953
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:45,750
problems I guess.

954
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:48,170
So it's easy to blank us and just move on.

955
01:21:51,070 --> 01:21:56,070
- Sometimes part of me wants to hate them.

956
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:02,400
Walk right up to them and
yell until they can ignore me

957
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:03,230
anymore.

958
01:22:07,940 --> 01:22:09,440
It's the kind of thoughts
that make you sick.

959
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:12,090
So instead of yelling I sing.

960
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:17,510
I sing and every once in a
while someone tosses me a coin.

961
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:28,150
- I did something bad.

962
01:22:28,150 --> 01:22:28,980
A long time ago.

963
01:22:31,670 --> 01:22:35,430
Every time people ignore
us it feels like judgment.

964
01:22:40,620 --> 01:22:42,540
- I could just trade one
prison for another, right?

965
01:22:48,710 --> 01:22:49,550
The attitude to you doesn't define you.

966
01:22:49,550 --> 01:22:52,580
You do and then the only
person you can answer to is

967
01:22:52,580 --> 01:22:53,530
yourself, allright.

968
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:57,380
If you've done right by
the people you care about,

969
01:22:57,380 --> 01:22:58,650
you will know it.

970
01:22:58,650 --> 01:23:00,450
If you haven't you'll know that too.

971
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:04,360
So if you feel like you're being judged

972
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:06,410
it is is because you're judging yourself.

973
01:23:18,950 --> 01:23:20,200
It's your life.

974
01:23:21,590 --> 01:23:24,750
maybe it's time you face
what you've been hiding from.

975
01:24:23,470 --> 01:24:25,140
- What are you fucking looking at?

976
01:24:27,550 --> 01:24:31,100
I said what do you fucking looking at?

977
01:24:32,430 --> 01:24:35,480
- Nothing I'm sorry.

978
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:40,650
- So what do you want then?

979
01:24:41,780 --> 01:24:43,360
A punch?

980
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:44,190
Money?

981
01:24:47,010 --> 01:24:48,660
Because I haven't got no money.

982
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:49,490
- I'm sorry.

983
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:52,210
- Where's my manners?

984
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:56,090
- Come on have a drink.

985
01:24:57,510 --> 01:24:58,340
- I'm good.

986
01:24:58,340 --> 01:24:59,420
Thanks.

987
01:24:59,420 --> 01:25:01,540
- Do you think you're better than me?

988
01:25:03,230 --> 01:25:04,590
You are going to fucking drink it.

989
01:25:04,590 --> 01:25:05,790
- Why don't you just go.

990
01:25:08,970 --> 01:25:13,970
- I swear, on your life, if
you don't fucking drink it.

991
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:19,410
I want to fucking

992
01:25:19,410 --> 01:25:21,430
- Why don't you just leave me alone?

993
01:25:21,430 --> 01:25:22,260
- Yeah.

994
01:25:23,130 --> 01:25:24,430
- Drink the fucking drink.

995
01:25:28,150 --> 01:25:29,310
- You bastard,

996
01:25:30,650 --> 01:25:33,560
You fucking bastard, I'm a veteran.

997
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:38,170
And I fought for this country.

998
01:25:38,170 --> 01:25:39,810
- Yeah.

999
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:44,150
- So what's your point?

1000
01:25:44,150 --> 01:25:44,980
Soldier.

1001
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:48,590
- That I deserve-

1002
01:25:51,180 --> 01:25:52,930
- What, deserve what?

1003
01:25:55,030 --> 01:25:56,030
Look at you.

1004
01:25:56,030 --> 01:25:58,560
You should be ashamed of yourself.

1005
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:02,150
You dirty, filthy

1006
01:26:05,870 --> 01:26:07,870
So come on then soldier.

1007
01:26:09,310 --> 01:26:10,400
Come on then.

1008
01:26:21,290 --> 01:26:26,230
You fucking, dirty, filthy

1009
01:26:26,230 --> 01:26:27,330
- Wait, what are you doing?

1010
01:26:27,330 --> 01:26:28,330
Leave him alone man.

1011
01:26:29,170 --> 01:26:30,580
- Now what are you, I'm
going to have to punch you.

1012
01:26:31,790 --> 01:26:32,870
What are you going to do?

1013
01:26:32,870 --> 01:26:33,950
- I hate you.

1014
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:36,290
You're a mess.

1015
01:26:36,290 --> 01:26:39,970
- Look at you, you are a
waste, you are a drunk.

1016
01:26:39,970 --> 01:26:41,260
You know what, I wonder whether
one day, you don't end up

1017
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:43,930
like one of us.

1018
01:27:02,370 --> 01:27:05,060
- The boy has become a man.

1019
01:27:05,060 --> 01:27:08,250
And the man has become a

1020
01:27:13,420 --> 01:27:14,250
- Allright.

1021
01:27:19,590 --> 01:27:22,450
You haven't told me about this.

1022
01:27:22,450 --> 01:27:24,570
- No

1023
01:27:24,570 --> 01:27:25,900
- Good.

1024
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:29,340
I've got some good news on-

1025
01:27:30,170 --> 01:27:31,260
- I found my mom's new address.

1026
01:27:31,260 --> 01:27:32,770
- What's the bad news?

1027
01:27:39,850 --> 01:27:43,460
- Chico, I found my mom.

1028
01:27:50,730 --> 01:27:53,790
Nicole, she's found my mom's new address.

1029
01:27:57,460 --> 01:27:59,260
I think it's time for me to go home.

1030
01:28:11,150 --> 01:28:16,150
I wanted to ask you, would
you like to come with me?

1031
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:47,100
- Well, from we hit the
open road, my advice

1032
01:28:47,100 --> 01:28:48,430
to you is pack right.

1033
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:50,560
Sleep fast.

1034
01:28:51,530 --> 01:28:52,430
Goodnight Frankie.

1035
01:28:53,590 --> 01:28:54,500
- Allright.

1036
01:29:20,340 --> 01:29:23,580
Probably don't understand
a word what I'm saying.

1037
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:25,950
- My English is pretty great.

1038
01:29:25,950 --> 01:29:26,780
Thank you.

1039
01:29:28,410 --> 01:29:29,240
- Sorry.

1040
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:32,310
- I've watched you these past days.

1041
01:29:32,310 --> 01:29:33,550
A lot is on your mind.

1042
01:29:34,580 --> 01:29:35,410
- Yeah.

1043
01:29:37,230 --> 01:29:39,380
I stopped a bad man
from hurting my friend.

1044
01:29:44,450 --> 01:29:45,400
And I'm going home.

1045
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:48,790
- Where is home for you?

1046
01:29:50,230 --> 01:29:51,330
- I don't know.

1047
01:29:52,580 --> 01:29:54,530
It's a house that I've never seen before.

1048
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:57,230
- You're weird.

1049
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:00,240
- You're not the first to tell me that.

1050
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:07,190
What about you?

1051
01:30:08,180 --> 01:30:10,760
- I was from

1052
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:11,590
Romania.

1053
01:30:15,170 --> 01:30:16,170
- Come here.

1054
01:30:40,710 --> 01:30:41,770
- What are you all about?

1055
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:42,780
It's my turn.

1056
01:30:50,950 --> 01:30:51,790
- Yes.

1057
01:30:52,830 --> 01:30:53,920
Very wrong.

1058
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:56,430
Now you tell me a bad English word.

1059
01:30:57,650 --> 01:31:00,470
- Arse hole.

1060
01:31:00,470 --> 01:31:01,420
- Like arse hole.

1061
01:31:01,420 --> 01:31:02,370
- Arse hole.

1062
01:31:02,370 --> 01:31:03,340
You, arse hole.

1063
01:31:03,340 --> 01:31:04,290
- Yeah.

1064
01:31:05,430 --> 01:31:07,460
- I want to know every English insult.

1065
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:11,600
- Idiot.

1066
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:13,580
- Idiot.

1067
01:31:13,580 --> 01:31:14,850
- Like idiot.

1068
01:31:14,850 --> 01:31:15,680
- Idiot.

1069
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:23,000
- Dickhead.

1070
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:27,320
- You are a dickhead.

1071
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:39,470
- It's my turn.

1072
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:42,610
- What are you on the about?

1073
01:31:42,610 --> 01:31:43,530
It's my turn.

1074
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:45,710
- I'm not playing.

1075
01:31:45,710 --> 01:31:48,210
- James stop playing, you
are always cheating man.

1076
01:31:50,940 --> 01:31:53,140
- We didn't even have
enough money for food.

1077
01:31:55,090 --> 01:31:57,030
He wanted me to do things for money.

1078
01:31:59,790 --> 01:32:00,620
- Sorry.

1079
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:03,470
I don't want to say.

1080
01:32:03,470 --> 01:32:05,370
- Well, I knew what to say to him.

1081
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:07,800
Go to your home Frankie.

1082
01:32:09,170 --> 01:32:11,060
Then go to see your friend, the lady.

1083
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:15,130
- Enough about helping her.

1084
01:32:18,670 --> 01:32:19,500
Just be there.

1085
01:32:39,750 --> 01:32:40,750
- I'm sorry.

1086
01:32:55,630 --> 01:32:56,630
- It's okay.

1087
01:33:12,370 --> 01:33:13,540
- Rise and shine.

1088
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:17,400
Let's go Lover boy

1089
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:18,450
burning daylight.

1090
01:33:19,290 --> 01:33:20,120
Road trip.

1091
01:33:30,170 --> 01:33:31,000
- What's wrong?

1092
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:34,180
- This is silly this.

1093
01:33:34,180 --> 01:33:36,630
Sadly I haven't seen my
mom in a long time Chico.

1094
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:42,400
- Well, it's a little late
now Frankie and me were pretty

1095
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:44,190
long ways up the road.

1096
01:33:49,020 --> 01:33:49,980
- Look, Frankie.

1097
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:56,380
If I would give anything.

1098
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:07,970
For the chance to go home.

1099
01:34:10,930 --> 01:34:15,340
Still, I can see why
you're a little hesitant

1100
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:17,140
about leaving after last night.

1101
01:34:23,230 --> 01:34:24,250
She's pretty cute.

1102
01:34:28,070 --> 01:34:30,400
- We are just friends nothing happened.

1103
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:34,060
- Friend?

1104
01:34:34,060 --> 01:34:37,390
Mate, that's what you said about Nicole.

1105
01:34:40,050 --> 01:34:41,550
We passed the threshold.

1106
01:34:41,550 --> 01:34:43,200
- You think so-

1107
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:44,450
- Frankie Moore.

1108
01:34:47,300 --> 01:34:48,710
You sold me out man.

1109
01:34:48,710 --> 01:34:49,710
It's on you.

1110
01:34:56,670 --> 01:34:57,500
- Promise me.

1111
01:34:58,370 --> 01:35:01,820
Honestly, I just wanted to
leave this message just to let

1112
01:35:01,820 --> 01:35:04,120
you don't need to worry.

1113
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:06,730
We've been planning this
party for the last two months.

1114
01:35:06,730 --> 01:35:09,110
Honestly, everybody's
put so much effort in.

1115
01:35:09,110 --> 01:35:10,310
Everyone's going to be there.

1116
01:35:10,310 --> 01:35:11,910
It's not going to be a big deal.

1117
01:35:11,910 --> 01:35:12,740
It's just...

1118
01:35:20,060 --> 01:35:20,890
It will be all right.

1119
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:22,720
Okay just...

1120
01:35:26,210 --> 01:35:27,690
Shit.

1121
01:36:03,230 --> 01:36:05,230
- You promised me you is
going to come see my mom?

1122
01:36:06,750 --> 01:36:08,010
- I know I did, Frankie.

1123
01:36:08,010 --> 01:36:09,080
I'm sorry,

1124
01:36:10,460 --> 01:36:12,410
Sometimes life flips the script on you.

1125
01:36:14,260 --> 01:36:16,590
I wanted to introduce

1126
01:36:16,590 --> 01:36:17,840
And I knew that's my mom.

1127
01:36:19,700 --> 01:36:20,560
- I know Frank.

1128
01:36:21,700 --> 01:36:22,820
I wanted that too.

1129
01:36:26,270 --> 01:36:29,740
We had our ride and listen,
we couldn't have done

1130
01:36:29,740 --> 01:36:30,840
it with anyone better.

1131
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:35,010
You are such a bright
light Franklin just keep

1132
01:36:35,010 --> 01:36:36,370
shining on this won't we?

1133
01:36:39,780 --> 01:36:42,360
You go and see your mom.

1134
01:38:18,650 --> 01:38:19,480
- Hello.

1135
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:29,880
- Mom it's me.

1136
01:38:32,430 --> 01:38:33,260
Frankie.

1137
01:40:48,020 --> 01:40:49,330
- Are you okay?

1138
01:40:49,330 --> 01:40:50,730
- Yeah.

1139
01:40:50,730 --> 01:40:51,560
Yes mom.

1140
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:55,780
- Need some toast?

1141
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:57,870
- Yeah, sure.

1142
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:24,970
- 11 years, Frankie

1143
01:41:28,010 --> 01:41:28,840
11 years.

1144
01:41:36,710 --> 01:41:37,540
- Mom,

1145
01:41:41,510 --> 01:41:43,210
I always said I was going to come.

1146
01:41:47,420 --> 01:41:50,170
After what happened for you to hate me.

1147
01:41:50,170 --> 01:41:51,080
- Hate you?

1148
01:41:51,930 --> 01:41:53,080
I could never hate you.

1149
01:41:55,470 --> 01:41:58,200
I called the police that night
because I want you to found.

1150
01:41:58,200 --> 01:41:59,100
I wanted you safe.

1151
01:42:05,970 --> 01:42:06,800
Come sit down.

1152
01:42:39,190 --> 01:42:41,560
Do you know what I think every day?

1153
01:42:43,060 --> 01:42:44,360
is he alive today?

1154
01:42:46,460 --> 01:42:48,630
Will it be alive tomorrow?

1155
01:42:48,630 --> 01:42:51,520
I kept on thinking you're going
to walk through that door.

1156
01:42:53,680 --> 01:42:56,970
I even stayed in that opera
house because I thought you'd

1157
01:42:56,970 --> 01:42:57,920
come home.

1158
01:43:04,830 --> 01:43:06,260
Your dad's death did not have
to be the end of your life

1159
01:43:06,260 --> 01:43:07,090
Frankie.

1160
01:43:16,570 --> 01:43:17,470
Okay.

1161
01:43:17,470 --> 01:43:18,310
So the way to see

1162
01:43:21,790 --> 01:43:23,860
Just wanted to know if you were okay.

1163
01:43:33,620 --> 01:43:37,630
Oh, God, Frankie, what
else have you been through?

1164
01:43:48,540 --> 01:43:50,200
- It doesn't matter.

1165
01:43:58,860 --> 01:44:01,540
Mom, this is really hot.

1166
01:44:01,540 --> 01:44:03,040
- Okay, I'm sorry.

1167
01:44:04,790 --> 01:44:05,720
- You got water?

1168
01:44:05,720 --> 01:44:06,560
- Yeah.

1169
01:44:15,850 --> 01:44:16,850
Here you go.

1170
01:44:47,800 --> 01:44:49,220
- I love you mum.

1171
01:44:51,530 --> 01:44:53,110
I love you so much.

1172
01:44:58,250 --> 01:45:00,340
- I love you too Frankie.

1173
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:02,770
God I love you.

1174
01:45:07,580 --> 01:45:08,750
- Have you got any mayonnaise?

1175
01:45:08,750 --> 01:45:09,580
- Yeah.

1176
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:22,970
Some things never change hey.

1177
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:56,740
- As far as the world's knew

1178
01:47:56,740 --> 01:47:58,230
Frankie Moore was a young boy

1179
01:47:58,230 --> 01:48:01,220
who brutally killed his father
and fled to the streets.

1180
01:48:02,460 --> 01:48:05,590
That was the only story
most people ever heard.

1181
01:48:05,590 --> 01:48:09,010
But for those of us who knew
him, it was a different story.

1182
01:48:09,010 --> 01:48:11,760
We knew a guy who'd always
tried to make things better.

1183
01:48:13,680 --> 01:48:15,530
Today, his story ends

1184
01:48:20,670 --> 01:48:22,580
- Are you sure you are ready, mum?

1185
01:48:22,580 --> 01:48:24,890
This is what he'd have wanted.

1186
01:48:24,890 --> 01:48:25,720
- Mm-hmm.

1187
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:38,450
- Welcome home, fish boy.

1188
01:48:38,450 --> 01:48:39,530
