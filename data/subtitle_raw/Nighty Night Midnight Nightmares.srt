1
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,900
You still can't sleep?

2
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,600
I'll read you a book.

3
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:37,000
I know! I'll tell you a wonderful story.

4
00:00:46,228 --> 00:00:52,000
Once upon a time, there was a cute girl
named Little Red Riding Hood.

5
00:00:54,725 --> 00:00:58,304
One day, her mother sent her on an errand.

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Her grandmother was sick,
so she asked her to visit her.

7
00:01:05,505 --> 00:01:07,000
"Yes, I'll go!"

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Little Red Riding Hood took a basket
and happily left for her grandmother's house.

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
She met a big bad wolf
at the entrance of the forest.

10
00:01:24,602 --> 00:01:27,000
"Hello, Little Red Riding Hood."

11
00:01:27,834 --> 00:01:31,000
"Where are you going in such a hurry?"

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
"I'm going to visit my grandmother!"

13
00:01:35,412 --> 00:01:39,000
The wolf thought to himself...

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,970
"She looks fat and delicious."

15
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:52,000
"Yes, I'll deceive her and eat her,
along with her grandmother!"

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The wolf sneaked into the grandmother's house,
crawling in through the window.

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
"Lucky for me, no one is at home!"

18
00:02:10,425 --> 00:02:13,999
But when he took out the grandmother's kimono,

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
he saw that she was sleeping soundly.

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So he got into bed and waited
for Little Red Riding Hood to arrive.

21
00:02:25,149 --> 00:02:27,970
Just then, Little Red Riding Hood
came through the door.

22
00:02:28,825 --> 00:02:31,129
"Hello, grandmother!"

23
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:37,502
Little Red Riding Hood
put her basket on the table.

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
"Oh, Little Red Riding Hood,
what did you bring me?"

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
"A big, white napkin."

26
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
"What else did you bring me?"

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
"A sparkling knife."

28
00:03:03,548 --> 00:03:07,000
"And did you bring me any food?"

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
"Yes."

30
00:03:10,504 --> 00:03:12,000
"I brought you a wolf!"

31
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Then, she grabbed the knife
and cut the wolf many times.

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,541
Then she cut the wolf's flesh into pieces,

33
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:32,897
each one dripping with dark red blood.

34
00:04:06,305 --> 00:04:07,502
Good night...

35
00:04:08,361 --> 00:04:09,363
Yumi.

36
00:04:48,226 --> 00:04:50,347
BIRTHDAY COCKTAIL

37
00:05:00,661 --> 00:05:05,268
<i>Happy birthday, dear Yumi!</i>

38
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:10,000
Happy birthday to you!

39
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Happy birthday!

40
00:05:22,486 --> 00:05:24,999
Why are you eating alone?

41
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,999
Because I have the biggest appetite!

42
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You should be ashamed!

43
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Eat more, Miyoko.

44
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Hey, I was eating that!

45
00:05:39,237 --> 00:05:41,999
Come on, give it back!

46
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,999
No.

47
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,999
Unlike you, I have a boyfriend.

48
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,999
It's just because you play
the damsel in distress!

49
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,999
You always get your way, don't you?

50
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,999
Hey, that's enough.

51
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,833
Stop it, you two.

52
00:05:55,863 --> 00:05:58,371
Just try not to add on
any more fat, okay?

53
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,351
You don't understand...

54
00:06:02,756 --> 00:06:04,175
I just...

55
00:06:04,643 --> 00:06:06,699
I just...

56
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:09,999
I just need to eat!

57
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,999
I don't care.

58
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,719
You were born to eat fried chicken,
and you're living up to your destiny!

59
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:17,060
Didn't you know?

60
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:22,534
Oh, she's mad...
Come and get me!

61
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,999
Hey, what are you doing?!

62
00:06:27,196 --> 00:06:28,381
Stop it, already!

63
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm scared!

64
00:06:35,245 --> 00:06:37,000
It's good.

65
00:06:41,376 --> 00:06:42,999
It's good!

66
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:45,000
It's really good!

67
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:49,515
Did you always have such white skin?

68
00:06:49,545 --> 00:06:52,000
Lick it up, lick it up!

69
00:06:53,254 --> 00:06:56,364
Why do you always make fun of me?

70
00:06:58,444 --> 00:07:00,149
Swallow it!

71
00:07:00,318 --> 00:07:02,726
Come on! What's wrong?

72
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:06,380
I can't...

73
00:07:11,283 --> 00:07:13,167
She couldn't take it!

74
00:07:13,327 --> 00:07:14,999
I said, that's enough!

75
00:07:15,253 --> 00:07:17,241
Eating and sleeping, just like a pig.

76
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:18,482
Yes, that's right!

77
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,999
Come on, get up already!

78
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,924
I think she's sleeping...

79
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Come on, get up!

80
00:07:27,506 --> 00:07:29,000
Come on!

81
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:39,000
What's the matter?

82
00:07:40,574 --> 00:07:42,000
Towako...

83
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,999
It's not my fault...

84
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,535
I didn't do anything!

85
00:07:53,977 --> 00:07:54,999
I...

86
00:07:55,253 --> 00:07:57,244
I was just having some fun!

87
00:07:58,844 --> 00:08:00,662
It's not my fault!

88
00:08:00,692 --> 00:08:01,970
That's right!

89
00:08:02,696 --> 00:08:04,414
We didn't do anything.

90
00:08:05,281 --> 00:08:07,369
Yes... That's right.

91
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,559
It was just an accident!

92
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:10,834
He's right...

93
00:08:11,932 --> 00:08:13,494
We're all friends here.

94
00:08:14,662 --> 00:08:16,184
We wouldn't hurt her.

95
00:08:17,818 --> 00:08:19,067
Is that so?

96
00:08:20,739 --> 00:08:25,050
Why do you trust other people
and call them your friends?

97
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,999
Miyoko.

98
00:08:27,313 --> 00:08:28,999
Remember what you said?

99
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,999
"You were born to eat fried chicken."
"Try not to add on more fat."

100
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,692
You said that to your friend.

101
00:08:36,043 --> 00:08:38,302
- I was just kidding!
- Just kidding?

102
00:08:38,332 --> 00:08:41,830
Really? I can see your true colors.

103
00:08:42,025 --> 00:08:44,540
Miyoko, what are you trying to say?

104
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:47,495
You never know what
other people are thinking.

105
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,449
- Did you do it?
- How can you blame me?

106
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:52,999
You were laughing, weren't you?

107
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:55,531
People are different from how
they look on the outside.

108
00:08:55,561 --> 00:08:59,167
You look serious, but I don't know
what you're really thinking.

109
00:09:01,504 --> 00:09:02,999
He's not like that.

110
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,580
You like to deceive girls, don't you?

111
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,848
Today's target is Yumi.

112
00:09:11,241 --> 00:09:13,748
You just came to this
party to seduce Yumi.

113
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:14,970
What?

114
00:09:15,249 --> 00:09:16,999
Now we see your true colors...

115
00:09:17,437 --> 00:09:18,999
Mamoru, is that true?

116
00:09:19,233 --> 00:09:21,689
- Don't listen to her, Yumi!
- But don't worry...

117
00:09:22,005 --> 00:09:25,066
Yumi isn't interested in you anyway.

118
00:09:40,528 --> 00:09:41,778
I'm so stupid...

119
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:44,535
I killed myself...

120
00:09:51,135 --> 00:09:53,621
What do you mean
she's not interested?

121
00:09:54,701 --> 00:09:57,522
Yumi has someone else
who she would do anything for.

122
00:09:58,428 --> 00:10:00,029
Who is that?

123
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:02,823
Where do you think
Yumi's father is tonight?

124
00:10:04,242 --> 00:10:07,960
He said he had to work...
and wouldn't be home until late.

125
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,999
I see...
So that's why you invited us.

126
00:10:11,925 --> 00:10:15,830
Sorry that you couldn't celebrate
your birthday alone with Papa.

127
00:10:16,342 --> 00:10:20,676
It's your 20th birthday...
It should have been a night to remember!

128
00:10:23,804 --> 00:10:25,261
That's ridiculous!

129
00:10:25,743 --> 00:10:27,735
So Yumi loves her father?

130
00:10:27,765 --> 00:10:29,697
So what? That's normal!

131
00:10:29,727 --> 00:10:32,013
Why shouldn't a child love their parents?

132
00:10:32,043 --> 00:10:33,603
Is that all it is...?

133
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,606
Come on, Yumi...
Tell her!

134
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,558
You're just father and daughter.

135
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,881
Hey, what's wrong with you?!

136
00:10:40,911 --> 00:10:42,209
What a joke...

137
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:44,213
They might as well be married.

138
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:46,599
He's more like a
lover than a parent.

139
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,830
Yumi... You take good care of
your father, don't you?

140
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,550
- Just like a wife would...
- Shut up!

141
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,299
Hey, are you really...

142
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,564
thinking about having sex
with your father?

143
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,599
Even when you know how I feel?

144
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,591
Tell me it isn't true!

145
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,403
Tell me you're not
that dirty and defiled!

146
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:08,099
Don't touch me!

147
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:08,981
I see.

148
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:11,699
You were having sex
with your father all along.

149
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,099
I see how it is...
I understand perfectly!

150
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,599
It's not true...

151
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,303
Really... I've can't believe it...

152
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,199
So that's what you really are!

153
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,299
No!

154
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,799
It's pathetic.

155
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,409
I didn't realize what
a sick person you were!

156
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:26,789
Stop it!

157
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,999
See?

158
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,198
Just when you start to trust someone,

159
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,770
you realize that you can't.

160
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,784
You betrayed him.

161
00:11:56,188 --> 00:11:58,960
First, you betrayed him
and then you killed him.

162
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,925
I don't like people
because I can't trust them.

163
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,899
People always act one way,

164
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,661
hiding their true feelings on the inside.

165
00:12:14,129 --> 00:12:17,493
You always felt sorry for me
and thought I was lonely.

166
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,907
That's why you invited me to your party.

167
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,048
But you really shouldn't have bothered.

168
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,656
Here, this will put you to sleep.

169
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,704
You can rest now.

170
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,296
There's nothing to be afraid of.

171
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,886
Don't worry, I'll die with you,
since you're too weak to do it alone.

172
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,513
I don't want to live in
such a dirty world anyway.

173
00:18:04,147 --> 00:18:06,516
Yumi, I'm home.

174
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,990
Papa...

175
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:15,120
You're home!

176
00:18:28,069 --> 00:18:29,175
Papa!

177
00:18:32,014 --> 00:18:33,432
Yumi, what's wrong?

178
00:18:34,628 --> 00:18:36,655
You'll stay with me, won't you?

179
00:18:36,685 --> 00:18:38,800
You won't betray me, right?!

180
00:18:39,415 --> 00:18:40,501
That's right.

181
00:18:40,531 --> 00:18:42,298
Papa won't betray you, Yumi.

182
00:18:44,233 --> 00:18:45,320
Promise?

183
00:18:45,784 --> 00:18:47,567
Papa, don't leave me...

184
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,337
Papa...

185
00:19:00,434 --> 00:19:02,800
Oh, this is Kei Asakawa.

186
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,137
Actually, I was thinking of remarrying.

187
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:13,800
I see...

188
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:23,800
Papa, will you celebrate
my 20th birthday with me?

189
00:19:25,592 --> 00:19:29,800
I'll probably have to
leave this house for a while.

190
00:19:58,509 --> 00:20:00,149
Okay, let's get started!

191
00:20:01,255 --> 00:20:02,800
Kei, I'm sorry.

192
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,309
We didn't have enough wine glasses.

193
00:20:07,343 --> 00:20:08,345
Here you go.

194
00:20:20,505 --> 00:20:22,353
Here's to Papa and Kei.

195
00:20:26,497 --> 00:20:28,799
Here's to your 20th birthday.

196
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,800
Cheers.

197
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,770
Here's to Papa and my future.

198
00:20:40,376 --> 00:20:41,600
Cheers...

199
00:20:48,188 --> 00:20:51,806
OUT OF THE WINDOW

200
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:44,800
Takashi...

201
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,800
Ta... ka... shi....

202
00:25:27,478 --> 00:25:29,300
It's so cute!

203
00:26:30,485 --> 00:26:33,964
<i>Be careful not to burn your fingers.</i>

204
00:27:37,408 --> 00:27:41,369
The battle between you and
the strange monster is about to begin.

205
00:27:41,564 --> 00:27:44,448
Do you have what it takes to survive?

206
00:28:26,341 --> 00:28:28,619
This is the start of the survival game.

207
00:28:28,905 --> 00:28:33,445
You have 3 minutes to stop the game,
if you do not wish to proceed.

208
00:28:34,044 --> 00:28:35,185
I repeat.

209
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:38,800
You have 3 minutes to stop the game,
if you do not wish to proceed.

210
00:28:42,502 --> 00:28:44,818
1 minute remaining until start...

211
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:48,085
In 1 minute, the game will start automatically.

212
00:28:56,223 --> 00:28:58,484
This is the start of the survival game.

213
00:28:58,514 --> 00:29:00,274
A monster will appear.

214
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:01,679
I repeat.

215
00:29:01,709 --> 00:29:03,800
A monster will appear.

216
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:10,764
Your mission is to defeat the monster.

217
00:29:11,285 --> 00:29:15,208
The monster will power up once every hour.

218
00:29:15,238 --> 00:29:19,585
Please defeat the monster
as soon as possible.

219
00:29:19,615 --> 00:29:22,799
It is no longer possible to stop the game.

220
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,001
I repeat.

221
00:29:24,031 --> 00:29:26,875
It is no longer possible to stop the game.

222
00:29:28,469 --> 00:29:30,773
SURVIVAL GAME

223
00:32:28,556 --> 00:32:30,232
Warning! Warning!

224
00:32:30,262 --> 00:32:34,084

225
00:32:34,358 --> 00:32:35,409
I repeat.

226
00:32:35,439 --> 00:32:39,213
The power of the monster
has increased by 20%.

227
00:37:13,455 --> 00:37:14,415
Hello?!

00:37:14,445 --> 00:37:19,634
<i>The number you have dialed is

229
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,799

00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,638
The player's power has been reduced by 20%.

231
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,506
Your mission is to defeat the monster.

232
00:37:45,014 --> 00:37:48,845
The monster will power up once every hour.

233
00:37:49,092 --> 00:37:52,921
Please defeat this monster
as soon as possible.

234
00:37:53,413 --> 00:37:56,485
It is no longer possible to stop the game.

235
00:37:56,862 --> 00:37:57,877
I repeat.

00:37:57,907 --> 00:38:00,623
It is no longer possible to stop the game.

237
00:38:27,493 --> 00:38:29,191
<i>Exterior is multi-colored.</i>

<i>Eyes, ears and nose are sensitive,
finely tuned to detect humans.</i>

00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:34,290
<i>IQ is 200.</i>

240
00:38:35,214 --> 00:38:36,580
<i>Foul smell...</i>

There is no information on file.

242
00:38:57,067 --> 00:38:58,121
I repeat.

243
00:38:58,151 --> 00:39:00,672
There is no information on file.

244
00:39:17,597 --> 00:39:19,354
I know... I'll lock it out.

245
00:39:20,122 --> 00:39:21,398
I'll just lock it out...

246
00:43:57,989 --> 00:43:58,822
Fire...

247
00:43:59,642 --> 00:44:00,996
I'll use fire!

248
00:44:05,795 --> 00:44:06,914
I found it!

249
00:45:01,481 --> 00:45:02,730
Please...

250
00:48:33,564 --> 00:48:36,609
Survival Game 2 is about to start.

251
00:48:37,218 --> 00:48:39,392
As the winner of Survival Game 1,

252
00:48:39,422 --> 00:48:42,671
you will now face an
even more powerful monster.

253
00:48:43,058 --> 00:48:46,090
It is no longer possible to stop the game.

254
00:48:46,585 --> 00:48:47,626
I repeat.

255
00:48:47,656 --> 00:48:50,333
It is no longer possible to stop the game.

256
00:48:56,945 --> 00:48:59,144
No!

257
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:08,462
Here.

258
00:49:18,231 --> 00:49:20,066
I'm sorry, but...

259
00:49:32,082 --> 00:49:33,435
Give me my...

260
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:41,830
letter back.

261
00:50:18,999 --> 00:50:21,849
Someone better than
Tetsuya is waiting for me.

262
00:50:23,772 --> 00:50:28,028
If I keep spending time with Tetsuya,
I won't be able to see him, right?

263
00:50:28,783 --> 00:50:29,850
Oh, well.

264
00:50:59,353 --> 00:51:02,450
I'm sorry, but...

265
00:51:11,762 --> 00:51:13,219
Sorry?

266
00:51:14,801 --> 00:51:16,467
Does that mean...

267
00:51:17,091 --> 00:51:19,811
I still have a chance with him?

268
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,459
Yes, I'm sure of it.

269
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:23,880
That's it!

270
00:51:24,283 --> 00:51:26,460
All right, I'll do my best!

271
00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:34,242
CINDERELLA

272
00:53:10,143 --> 00:53:11,597
<i>What are you talking about...</i>

273
00:53:12,473 --> 00:53:13,689
<i>Why not?</i>

274
00:53:15,476 --> 00:53:17,650
<i>It's easier if everyone does it...</i>

275
00:53:44,322 --> 00:53:46,460
I knew it wouldn't work.

276
00:53:52,137 --> 00:53:53,205
It's Yumi...

277
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:55,959
What's with that face?

278
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,407
Why don't you just give up?

279
00:53:57,437 --> 00:54:00,119
Kaori suits him because
she's got style and sense.

280
00:54:00,328 --> 00:54:02,046
Haven't you realized that?

281
00:54:08,711 --> 00:54:10,104
I bought it!

282
00:54:30,451 --> 00:54:31,284
Oh...

283
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:34,713
It's Kaori...

284
00:54:47,985 --> 00:54:50,878
Oh, I forgot!

285
00:54:51,489 --> 00:54:53,663
It's Tetsuya's birthday today!

286
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:32,679
Kaori?

287
00:55:46,892 --> 00:55:49,039
He's too good for her.

288
00:55:49,069 --> 00:55:50,659
Just accept it...

289
00:55:50,689 --> 00:55:53,430
There's no way Yumi
could get him to like her.

290
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:56,459
Kaori is a rich young lady.

291
00:55:57,022 --> 00:55:58,961
Even if they break up,

292
00:55:59,644 --> 00:56:01,844
he still wouldn't stoop to her level.

293
00:56:02,219 --> 00:56:03,354
I know, right?

294
00:56:03,911 --> 00:56:04,861
Yumi...

295
00:56:05,811 --> 00:56:06,775
What?!

296
00:56:08,076 --> 00:56:10,224
I want to talk to you, but...

297
00:56:10,254 --> 00:56:12,007
- Is that okay?
- What?

298
00:56:12,918 --> 00:56:13,894
Me?

299
00:56:15,009 --> 00:56:15,959
Yes.

300
00:56:16,714 --> 00:56:18,460
No way!

301
00:56:20,788 --> 00:56:22,935
Well, see you later.

302
00:56:22,965 --> 00:56:25,460
Okay... Bye bye...

303
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:32,836
What just happened...?

304
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:35,819
He didn't...

305
00:56:36,548 --> 00:56:37,993
I can't believe it.

306
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:46,420
I've always been watching you.

307
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:50,423
Just you.

308
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:54,905
What?

309
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:58,524
We broke up.

310
00:57:00,351 --> 00:57:02,511
Oh, so she went home!

311
00:57:03,566 --> 00:57:05,453
No, it's over.

312
00:57:08,578 --> 00:57:11,233
Maybe it's not too late for us?

313
00:57:12,795 --> 00:57:13,823
Yes!

314
00:57:17,243 --> 00:57:19,000
Well, wanna go somewhere?

315
00:57:20,707 --> 00:57:21,436
Yes!

316
00:57:26,486 --> 00:57:27,834
Come on, get in!

317
00:57:29,151 --> 00:57:30,036
Okay...

318
00:57:34,302 --> 00:57:36,046
I'm sorry, I'll get in now.

319
00:57:36,076 --> 00:57:37,400
Excuse me...

320
00:58:33,113 --> 00:58:35,039
I had a lot of fun today.

321
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:37,278
Thank you so much.

322
00:58:37,308 --> 00:58:38,241
See you!

323
00:58:38,725 --> 00:58:39,493
Yumi.

324
00:58:41,237 --> 00:58:42,005
What?

325
00:58:43,632 --> 00:58:45,988
I'll call you at 9, okay?

326
00:58:46,899 --> 00:58:48,005
Also...

327
00:59:13,137 --> 00:59:14,126
Well...

328
00:59:15,388 --> 00:59:16,703
Good night!

329
01:00:08,422 --> 01:00:10,765
Mirror, mirror, on the wall.

330
01:00:10,795 --> 01:00:14,751
Who is the most beautiful...

331
01:00:15,933 --> 01:00:17,351
of all?

332
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:04,294
Yes...

333
01:02:04,970 --> 01:02:06,129
Hello?

334
01:02:08,537 --> 01:02:10,739
Oh... Tetsuya?

335
01:02:11,801 --> 01:02:14,625
What's wrong?
You don't sound well.

336
01:02:15,237 --> 01:02:19,628
By the way, I was wondering if we could
have dinner at my house tomorrow.

337
01:02:21,143 --> 01:02:24,676
What's wrong?
I'll drive you home.

338
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:27,353
No, it's not that.

339
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:31,504
My mom wants to see you.

340
01:02:31,868 --> 01:02:34,042
What? Really?!

341
01:02:36,275 --> 01:02:37,381
I'd love to!

342
01:02:43,824 --> 01:02:45,092
Excuse me.

343
01:02:45,122 --> 01:02:46,553
Well, come on in.

344
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:02,551
Where's your mom?

345
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:06,079
She'll be home soon.
She probably went shopping.

346
01:03:07,133 --> 01:03:08,942
Oh, I see...

347
01:03:11,649 --> 01:03:14,628
What time is it?

348
01:03:16,526 --> 01:03:18,609
Don't worry about Kaori.

349
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:22,731
My mother might bring
her up, but it's okay...

350
01:04:48,270 --> 01:04:49,675
She's really late.

351
01:04:50,547 --> 01:04:52,057
I wonder where she went.

352
01:04:53,736 --> 01:04:55,715
Dinner should have been almost ready...

353
01:04:55,949 --> 01:04:57,186
It's okay...

354
01:06:22,442 --> 01:06:25,422
All right, I'll make dinner for us!

355
01:07:15,993 --> 01:07:18,060
Mother's not here yet, but...

356
01:07:31,483 --> 01:07:32,534
Cheers.

357
01:07:33,016 --> 01:07:34,330
Cheers!

358
01:08:23,084 --> 01:08:24,867
Te... Tetsuya!

359
01:08:25,779 --> 01:08:27,705
What time is it?

360
01:08:28,512 --> 01:08:30,113
It's 9:30, but...

361
01:08:30,582 --> 01:08:32,482
That clock is always wrong, so...

362
01:08:33,068 --> 01:08:34,552
Maybe around 9?

363
01:08:35,964 --> 01:08:37,031
I see...

364
01:08:38,652 --> 01:08:41,463
I... don't feel very good.

365
01:08:43,860 --> 01:08:45,042
I'm sorry!

366
01:08:58,896 --> 01:09:00,640
Th... This face!
