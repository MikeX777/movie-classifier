l"ve got no friends, either.

8
00:01:07,281 --> 00:01:09,715
Play by yourself, okay?

11
00:01:37,344 --> 00:01:38,276
Yes?

12
00:01:40,114 --> 00:01:41,138
What?

13
00:01:41,215 --> 00:01:42,016
A boy was killed?

Directed by SHUSUKE KANEKO

15
00:02:18,852 --> 00:02:20,285
You must not get angry.

16
00:02:20,354 --> 00:02:21,514
You must not hate.

17
00:02:21,655 --> 00:02:23,316
Please try not to cry, either.

18
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,149
Okay?

19
00:02:24,324 --> 00:02:26,918
You"re not like other kids.

20
00:02:27,061 --> 00:02:29,393
Don"t go near your friends...

21
00:02:29,463 --> 00:02:31,021
...or something horrible might happen.

22
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:34,395
Aren"t I a human being?

23
00:02:36,837 --> 00:02:38,771
Of course you are, Junko!

24
00:02:39,406 --> 00:02:41,431
You"re a lovely little girl!

25
00:02:43,811 --> 00:02:46,245
Fishing fires that
glimmer off the coast...

26
00:02:46,313 --> 00:02:49,407
...aren"t only for attracting the fish.

27
00:02:50,617 --> 00:02:54,212
In those ancient times, our ancestors...

28
00:02:54,488 --> 00:02:57,321
...secretly rowed out alone at night...

29
00:02:57,758 --> 00:03:01,159
...to release hatred that
accumulated in their bodies.

30
00:03:01,895 --> 00:03:04,796
It became a legend,
the legend of the Sea Fire.

31
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:12,402
My late mother used
to warn me all the time...

32
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:18,701
Wrath can grow in your heart like a fire.

33
00:03:19,346 --> 00:03:23,783
Once the flame of wrath
starts to burn, you can"t stop it.

34
00:03:24,885 --> 00:03:28,286
It will burn until it
consumes you as well.

You are coming, right?

00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,753
It"s Sunday, right?

46
00:04:34,822 --> 00:04:35,379
Are you going?

47
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:37,381
Hunting boys?

48
00:04:37,624 --> 00:04:41,116
If I get married to a dorm boy,
l"II end up living there forever...

49
00:04:41,195 --> 00:04:41,786
l"II pass!

50
00:04:41,995 --> 00:04:44,190
Come on, don"t be so mean.

51
00:04:44,264 --> 00:04:45,322
Please come!

52
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:53,597
Why don"t you invite her?

53
00:04:54,508 --> 00:04:55,566
She"s too morbid.

54
00:04:55,642 --> 00:04:57,576
She"d ruin the party.

55
00:04:57,644 --> 00:04:59,202
I really don"t like her.

56
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,143
Me neither.

57
00:05:00,214 --> 00:05:03,012
There"s something strange about her.

58
00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:30,634
You must have been terrified.

59
00:06:36,176 --> 00:06:37,268
l"m sorry l"m late.

60
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:39,973
Was she raped?

61
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,412
No, it"s just like the last case.

62
00:07:15,515 --> 00:07:16,539
What the...

63
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,162
Are you okay?

64
00:07:31,298 --> 00:07:32,356
Thank you.

65
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,096
That damn Trucker!

66
00:07:35,602 --> 00:07:37,900
Everybody is in a rush
on a rainy day like this.

67
00:07:38,405 --> 00:07:40,430
Miss Junko Aoki from
General Affairs, right?

68
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:42,105
Yes.

69
00:07:42,743 --> 00:07:43,937
Um, l"m...

70
00:07:44,344 --> 00:07:46,107
Mr. Tada from Sales.

71
00:07:46,179 --> 00:07:47,646
Oh, you know me?

72
00:07:48,482 --> 00:07:50,848
Right, that"s your job.

73
00:07:51,385 --> 00:07:54,912
You returned here to the
head office last month, l"ve heard.

74
00:07:55,088 --> 00:07:55,986
Yes.

75
00:07:56,256 --> 00:07:58,724
Now l"ve been assigned as a new
member of the dorm party committee.

76
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:00,357
Will you...

77
00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:03,761
Hey, look!

78
00:08:04,031 --> 00:08:05,089
Are you okay?

79
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,963
It"s drying because of my body heat.

80
00:08:08,602 --> 00:08:09,899
You mean you have a fever?

81
00:08:10,137 --> 00:08:11,399
Have you caught a cold?

82
00:08:11,972 --> 00:08:14,736
You shouldn"t go out
in this kind of weather.

83
00:08:14,975 --> 00:08:16,169
l"m okay.

84
00:08:18,512 --> 00:08:19,740
I get it...

85
00:08:19,813 --> 00:08:22,577
How could any human
have such a high fever!

86
00:08:25,318 --> 00:08:30,085
The former victim was alive when
she was left beside the Arakawa river.

87
00:08:31,224 --> 00:08:34,853
This one was already
dead when she was left there.

88
00:08:35,362 --> 00:08:36,420
Is it the same killer?

89
00:08:37,697 --> 00:08:41,793
Obviously, both of
them were hit by a car.

90
00:08:42,369 --> 00:08:44,667
Yes, then they were carried
away to cover up the hit & run.

91
00:08:45,172 --> 00:08:46,969
I believe the weapon was a car.

92
00:08:49,076 --> 00:08:51,977
They were bruised
and lacerated all over.

93
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:53,841
Get me ketchup.

94
00:08:54,748 --> 00:08:58,149
The killer played a
cat and mouse game.

95
00:08:59,119 --> 00:09:00,086
There you go, madam.

96
00:09:00,153 --> 00:09:00,619
Thanks.

97
00:09:01,755 --> 00:09:03,347
He enjoyed it.

98
00:09:07,694 --> 00:09:09,025
He"s a devil.

99
00:09:09,162 --> 00:09:09,958
It"s delicious!

100
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,563
Ms. Ishizu, how can you eat
while thinking about things like this?

101
00:09:20,407 --> 00:09:23,399
Righteous fury makes me hungry.

103
00:09:54,508 --> 00:09:55,805
You came!

104
00:09:55,976 --> 00:09:57,136
Looks good.

105
00:09:57,244 --> 00:09:58,404
It tastes great.

106
00:09:58,478 --> 00:09:59,536
Try some.

107
00:10:00,914 --> 00:10:02,279
Hey, is she your girlfriend?

108
00:10:02,349 --> 00:10:03,441
No, not yet.

109
00:10:06,553 --> 00:10:07,577
Not yet.

110
00:10:07,754 --> 00:10:09,984
You want herto be someday?

111
00:10:12,425 --> 00:10:15,189
This is Yukie, my sister.

112
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:16,893
Hello.

113
00:10:17,063 --> 00:10:18,655
You"re my type!

114
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:21,499
You"re totally my type.

115
00:10:23,003 --> 00:10:23,833
Idiot!

116
00:10:29,576 --> 00:10:31,407
You cook at home?

117
00:10:31,511 --> 00:10:32,978
Well, I live alone, so...

118
00:10:33,046 --> 00:10:35,776
I envy you, I wish I could live alone.

119
00:10:36,383 --> 00:10:37,441
Not you.

120
00:10:38,018 --> 00:10:39,042
Why not?

121
00:10:39,619 --> 00:10:40,677
You"re still a kid.

122
00:10:41,121 --> 00:10:43,681
That"s what you
want to believe, brother!

123
00:10:48,295 --> 00:10:49,421
l"II be all right.

124
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:53,422
Everyone is nice, right?

125
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:01,930
He"s talking about business stuff.

126
00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:04,109
My brother is boring, don"t you think?

127
00:11:04,778 --> 00:11:07,008
I don"t think so, he"s a very nice guy.

128
00:11:07,147 --> 00:11:09,081
Just "nice" huh?

129
00:11:09,182 --> 00:11:11,446
No good as a boyfriend.

130
00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:13,479
You are tough.

131
00:11:13,553 --> 00:11:16,954
He"s square, and
he"s totally old fashioned.

132
00:11:17,891 --> 00:11:19,859
Sorry, I didn"t mean
to ask you to babysit.

133
00:11:19,926 --> 00:11:21,518
No, l"m enjoying her company.

134
00:11:21,595 --> 00:11:23,790
It"s like she"s my little sister.

135
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:26,262
He came to tell me to go home.

136
00:11:28,668 --> 00:11:30,659
Our neighborhood
hasn"t been safe lately.

137
00:11:31,371 --> 00:11:33,771
I am going to the same
direction, l"II take her home.

138
00:11:34,074 --> 00:11:35,837
That means I get to
stay here a bit longer.

139
00:11:36,376 --> 00:11:38,742
Hey, Ms. Aoki has to go to
work tomorrow, you know!

140
00:11:44,451 --> 00:11:45,884
Thanks for coming.

141
00:11:46,186 --> 00:11:47,551
It was fun.

142
00:11:47,754 --> 00:11:49,244
Yukie"s cute.

143
00:11:49,422 --> 00:11:51,481
We used to quarrel every day.

144
00:11:51,825 --> 00:11:53,156
Really?

145
00:11:53,893 --> 00:11:55,918
Enough about her...

146
00:11:56,696 --> 00:11:58,664
How about a date?

147
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:00,524
Sure.

148
00:12:13,747 --> 00:12:15,806
Actually,
l"m thinking of studying abroad.

149
00:12:16,016 --> 00:12:17,278
Where?

150
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,784
England, l"II study theatre.

151
00:12:19,953 --> 00:12:22,319
I want to be able to
read Shakespeare in the original.

152
00:12:23,223 --> 00:12:25,191
Your brother will be worried.

153
00:12:25,925 --> 00:12:27,449
Hey, can you speak English?

154
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,857
"That is the question."

155
00:12:29,296 --> 00:12:31,594
Yeah, "that is the question."

156
00:12:32,432 --> 00:12:37,062
I once wished to die
in the water, like Ophelia.

157
00:12:37,504 --> 00:12:38,232
Yuck!

158
00:12:38,305 --> 00:12:39,533
Not anymore, right?

159
00:12:39,673 --> 00:12:41,140
No, no more.

160
00:12:41,975 --> 00:12:44,239
Can I call you "Sis?"

161
00:12:45,178 --> 00:12:47,271
l"ve always wanted a sister.

162
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,211
My brother is too much older.

163
00:13:10,503 --> 00:13:12,664
Make sure to take a cab.

164
00:13:12,772 --> 00:13:14,603
It"s not far, l"II walk.

165
00:13:14,674 --> 00:13:15,902
l"II come with you, then.

166
00:13:15,975 --> 00:13:17,567
I promised Mr. Tada.

167
00:13:17,877 --> 00:13:20,607
My brother would kill me if he
found out you walked me home.

168
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,875
You could be in
danger on the way back.

169
00:13:23,683 --> 00:13:25,514
How considerate!

170
00:13:25,618 --> 00:13:27,415
I try.

171
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,214
Bye!

172
00:14:42,695 --> 00:14:43,684
Okay!

173
00:14:58,211 --> 00:14:59,439
It"s just a party.

174
00:15:00,113 --> 00:15:02,343
Let"s have some fun tonight.

175
00:15:08,888 --> 00:15:09,912
No!

176
00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:14,324
It can"t be true!

177
00:16:18,591 --> 00:16:19,717
Yukie!

178
00:16:22,595 --> 00:16:23,755
Yukie...

179
00:16:27,433 --> 00:16:28,297
Why...

180
00:16:36,976 --> 00:16:38,739
A boy from the Toruen gang called us.

181
00:16:40,613 --> 00:16:42,103
A tip?

182
00:16:42,749 --> 00:16:44,307
We are in luck.

183
00:16:45,618 --> 00:16:47,586
Could I interview you for a minute?

184
00:17:24,557 --> 00:17:27,754
l"ve heard the killers are juveniles.

185
00:17:28,294 --> 00:17:30,592
The police have an idea who they are.

186
00:17:31,064 --> 00:17:34,124
l"ve heard they"re
bragging they aren"t afraid of cops.

187
00:17:34,701 --> 00:17:38,000
Even if caught, they won"t be
severely punished because they are minors.

188
00:17:39,205 --> 00:17:42,174
But how could they
get away with such a crime?

189
00:17:42,709 --> 00:17:45,439
That"s the law in this country.

190
00:17:52,151 --> 00:17:57,020
Hey, don"t you think it"s
getting hot in here all of sudden?

191
00:17:57,256 --> 00:17:58,484
I think so, too.

192
00:18:05,898 --> 00:18:07,525
l"II kill them.

193
00:18:09,202 --> 00:18:10,794
l"II kill them.

194
00:18:12,705 --> 00:18:13,694
<i>I'll kill them. </i>

195
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:16,535
<i>I'll kill them. </i>

196
00:18:18,411 --> 00:18:19,435
<i>I'll kill them. </i>

197
00:18:21,748 --> 00:18:22,578
<i>I'll kill them. </i>

198
00:18:41,401 --> 00:18:44,029
Teramachi Police Station

199
00:18:46,372 --> 00:18:51,071
Mr. Kogure, your
son is the key suspect.

200
00:18:51,144 --> 00:18:52,634
How do you feel about that?

201
00:18:52,712 --> 00:18:55,272
As an ex-district
attorney and commentator...

202
00:18:55,348 --> 00:18:57,316
...what do you think about this case?

203
00:18:57,517 --> 00:18:59,815
My son did nothing wrong.

204
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:08,020
It was just a party.

205
00:19:10,396 --> 00:19:14,332
Masaki Kogure, Age 18,
unemployed, is this correct?

206
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,628
Who are you?

207
00:19:15,835 --> 00:19:17,393
Have we met?

208
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,165
Where is your card?

209
00:19:21,607 --> 00:19:23,905
Here, l"m Ishizu.

210
00:19:27,647 --> 00:19:29,410
You"re a talkative one.

211
00:19:30,016 --> 00:19:32,712
You can"t stop bragging
about your crime, huh?

212
00:19:32,785 --> 00:19:35,982
What happened to
the lawyer my dad hired?

213
00:19:36,089 --> 00:19:37,613
He can"t be here.

214
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,555
It"s a little unlike American movies.

215
00:19:41,194 --> 00:19:42,491
That"s lame!

216
00:19:43,596 --> 00:19:44,620
That"s so lame!

217
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,431
Be honest with us...

218
00:19:51,104 --> 00:19:53,937
...and you"II get off light.

219
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,638
You know that, right?

220
00:19:58,077 --> 00:20:01,444
I feel sorry for how you live,
at your age with a cheap cop salary.

221
00:20:03,249 --> 00:20:05,809
Look, you"re an old
maid, got no lover, right?

222
00:20:12,191 --> 00:20:13,522
l"m married.

223
00:20:19,432 --> 00:20:21,229
You used violence!

224
00:20:21,601 --> 00:20:22,863
You saw it too, right?

225
00:20:29,976 --> 00:20:39,442
l"m here to accuse the department of
conducting a rough police investigation...

226
00:20:41,854 --> 00:20:45,517
...and to prove my son"s
innocence in these cases of murder.

227
00:20:45,658 --> 00:20:49,287
With no evidence against my son,
the police alleged him as culpable.

228
00:20:49,362 --> 00:20:53,389
They used violence
to force him to "confess."

229
00:20:53,733 --> 00:20:56,361
This is inexcusable!

230
00:20:57,403 --> 00:20:59,303
I bet he did it.

231
00:20:59,372 --> 00:21:00,134
Look at his face!

232
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,837
Even though his father is famous...

233
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:07,206
We made up our mind to come out
in the public and appeal to the world...

234
00:21:07,346 --> 00:21:10,406
...in orderto disclose the
oppressive conduct of the cops.

235
00:21:12,185 --> 00:21:15,086
Lately, it is said that cases of juvenile
delinquency are increasing, however...

236
00:21:21,093 --> 00:21:25,826
Guilty, or not guilty?
The boy killed the girls?

237
00:21:28,367 --> 00:21:31,037
Police squeeze confession.

238
00:21:31,037 --> 00:21:33,773
Suspicious enough.
But not enough evidence.

239
00:21:33,773 --> 00:21:36,401
The boy is protected.

240
00:21:41,147 --> 00:21:43,115
Investigation at deadlock.

241
00:21:43,115 --> 00:21:45,743
I am not the killer.

242
00:21:47,253 --> 00:21:49,084
The Cops use violence
and forced me to confess.

243
00:21:49,222 --> 00:21:52,623
He suggests that he did it on purpose.

244
00:21:52,758 --> 00:21:55,818
I bet he expose his
defect in court, easily!

245
00:21:56,662 --> 00:21:59,529
But the prosecutors were
positive that we couldn"t win.

246
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:02,329
No evidence, and his lawyer"s shrewd.

247
00:22:02,401 --> 00:22:06,064
Wait, don"t jump to conclusions.

248
00:22:06,138 --> 00:22:08,800
Kogure is saying you
used violence against him.

249
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:11,173
He"s going to sue us.

250
00:22:11,444 --> 00:22:14,072
I barely touched the kid!

251
00:22:14,146 --> 00:22:15,044
Calm down.

252
00:22:15,414 --> 00:22:17,075
Anyway, continue the investigation.

253
00:22:17,283 --> 00:22:20,650
We are dropping the case at this
point, but we are happy to cooperate.

254
00:22:21,087 --> 00:22:22,019
Good...

255
00:22:22,088 --> 00:22:23,419
It"s nice having someone who
appreciates you at the head office.

256
00:22:23,489 --> 00:22:25,184
I wish I had someone
appreciate me in my office.

257
00:22:26,392 --> 00:22:27,552
Excuse us.

258
00:22:45,978 --> 00:22:48,708
Mr. Masaki Kogure just finished the
live interview and is about to come out.

259
00:22:48,781 --> 00:22:50,612
Let"s ask him what"s
really going on in there.

260
00:22:50,683 --> 00:22:52,378
Mr. Kogure, a few words, please!

261
00:22:53,386 --> 00:22:55,377
I am not saying that l"m not a bad boy...

262
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,955
...but I could never be a murderer.

263
00:22:57,256 --> 00:23:00,487
Let"s pray forthe souls of the dead.

264
00:23:00,593 --> 00:23:02,390
You"re not guilty?

265
00:23:02,461 --> 00:23:03,189
Of course not.

266
00:23:03,329 --> 00:23:05,797
Is it true the cops were rough?

267
00:23:05,898 --> 00:23:06,523
Yes.

268
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:08,691
How do you feel about
being treated like a celebrity?

269
00:23:27,386 --> 00:23:29,547
You shouldn"t turn into a killer.

270
00:23:30,623 --> 00:23:32,056
What happened?

271
00:23:34,994 --> 00:23:36,655
Did you do that, Ms. Aoki?

272
00:23:38,664 --> 00:23:39,892
No, of course not.

273
00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:43,530
l"m going crazy.

274
00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:47,034
Your killing him will ruin your life.

275
00:23:47,506 --> 00:23:49,997
Yukie won"t be happy about it, right?

276
00:23:51,777 --> 00:23:54,302
It wouldn"t bring her back, I know.

277
00:23:56,349 --> 00:23:59,250
But I must do something,
otherwise, they"Iljust live on...

278
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,087
...while Yukie is dead.

279
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:06,482
It"s so unfair.

280
00:24:08,961 --> 00:24:10,394
I won"t forgive them!

281
00:24:11,664 --> 00:24:12,961
I won"t!

282
00:24:14,934 --> 00:24:16,299
l"II punish them...

283
00:24:17,303 --> 00:24:18,895
...for you, Mr. Tada.

284
00:24:21,607 --> 00:24:22,403
What?

285
00:24:36,622 --> 00:24:40,490
I can, without leaving any evidence.

286
00:24:43,129 --> 00:24:47,065
l"ve hated this
power since my childhood.

287
00:24:48,934 --> 00:24:53,928
But if I can be of help to you, using it...

288
00:24:55,474 --> 00:24:57,465
Wait a minute.

289
00:24:58,744 --> 00:25:00,302
Use it?

290
00:25:00,579 --> 00:25:02,376
What are you saying?

291
00:25:03,249 --> 00:25:05,649
How can I believe such a thing?

292
00:25:19,532 --> 00:25:23,024
This is a no parking area.

293
00:25:23,102 --> 00:25:24,433
Why not punish him?

294
00:25:54,633 --> 00:25:55,793
Hey, hey, hey...

295
00:25:56,268 --> 00:25:57,428
What the hell is this?

296
00:25:57,503 --> 00:25:57,935
What?

297
00:25:58,037 --> 00:25:59,800
Hey, put out the fire!

298
00:26:01,841 --> 00:26:03,172
That car"s burning!

299
00:26:05,611 --> 00:26:06,441
Stop!

300
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:20,281
Hey, someone put out the fire now!

301
00:26:26,365 --> 00:26:27,229
Ms. Aoki.

302
00:26:28,501 --> 00:26:30,025
That"s enough, stop it!

303
00:26:34,473 --> 00:26:35,201
Stop, Junko!

304
00:26:57,696 --> 00:27:01,154
Do you believe me now?

305
00:27:07,373 --> 00:27:08,032
What is it?

306
00:27:08,107 --> 00:27:09,369
Is it Kogure related?

307
00:27:09,441 --> 00:27:10,908
No, not at all.

308
00:27:12,912 --> 00:27:15,176
We have no clue how the fire started...

309
00:27:16,715 --> 00:27:19,513
Right, you used to
be in charge of arson.

310
00:27:20,152 --> 00:27:22,643
That"s why I asked to look at this case.

311
00:27:23,656 --> 00:27:25,624
Now is not the time forthat.

312
00:27:28,561 --> 00:27:32,429
Kaori Kurata was here all day that day.

313
00:27:32,665 --> 00:27:34,257
She didn"t go out at all.

314
00:27:34,433 --> 00:27:35,900
I see.

315
00:27:36,702 --> 00:27:38,033
Sorry to bother you again.

316
00:27:45,511 --> 00:27:46,307
It"s him.

317
00:27:46,745 --> 00:27:48,440
Kogure!

318
00:27:55,721 --> 00:27:57,188
Are you gonna do it now? Here?

319
00:28:01,493 --> 00:28:03,188
I believe he did it.

320
00:28:04,063 --> 00:28:05,052
I want to kill him...

321
00:28:07,099 --> 00:28:09,158
...but l"m not one hundred percent sure.

322
00:28:10,903 --> 00:28:12,530
I am still hesitating.

323
00:28:15,007 --> 00:28:17,498
I spoke with him

324
00:28:19,545 --> 00:28:20,204
What?

325
00:28:20,846 --> 00:28:23,838
I told him I was a reporter forthe
weekly magazine and interviewed him.

326
00:28:24,883 --> 00:28:27,044
I also wanted conclusive evidence.

327
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,521
But he managed to elude my
queries, avoiding direct answers...

328
00:28:32,258 --> 00:28:34,590
Telling lies tires me.

329
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:39,488
To tell you the truth, I did it.

330
00:28:40,065 --> 00:28:42,033
Murdering is my hobby.

331
00:28:43,969 --> 00:28:45,129
Is it okay...

332
00:28:45,337 --> 00:28:46,804
...to tell me this?

333
00:28:48,674 --> 00:28:50,403
The cops dropped the case against me.

334
00:28:50,476 --> 00:28:53,172
The prosecutor is not doing anything.

335
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,404
l"m untouchable.

336
00:28:55,514 --> 00:28:57,311
l"m the lion now.

337
00:28:59,351 --> 00:29:00,409
Sure.

338
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,254
Let me take some pictures.

339
00:29:05,424 --> 00:29:07,016
Damn him!

340
00:29:08,827 --> 00:29:10,351
He"s not human.

341
00:29:16,435 --> 00:29:17,595
What"s going on?

342
00:29:19,972 --> 00:29:21,030
Help!

343
00:29:21,173 --> 00:29:22,663
Somebody help!

344
00:29:25,377 --> 00:29:26,810
Please help!

345
00:29:27,212 --> 00:29:28,110
Help!

346
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,938
Hey you, are you okay?

347
00:29:33,118 --> 00:29:34,016
No!

348
00:29:36,221 --> 00:29:37,085
Get away!

349
00:29:37,222 --> 00:29:39,884
It"s too hot, too hot!

350
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:51,968
Stop it!

351
00:29:52,905 --> 00:29:54,236
Why?

352
00:30:13,926 --> 00:30:15,325
I can"t stop it.

353
00:30:15,394 --> 00:30:18,158
Take me where I can get some water.

354
00:30:25,537 --> 00:30:26,299
Fire!

355
00:30:26,638 --> 00:30:27,935
Come here!

356
00:30:28,941 --> 00:30:30,033
Put out the fire!

357
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:33,334
Look, there"s a fire!

358
00:30:33,412 --> 00:30:35,312
Get some water, quickly.

359
00:30:36,181 --> 00:30:37,910
Come on!

360
00:31:57,629 --> 00:31:59,324
I couldn"t stand watching it any longer.

361
00:32:01,233 --> 00:32:02,427
I know.

362
00:32:04,603 --> 00:32:06,230
l"m so weak.

363
00:32:09,608 --> 00:32:12,236
If only l"d sent her home...

364
00:32:13,612 --> 00:32:16,308
If only they attacked me instead...

365
00:32:17,216 --> 00:32:19,184
I keep thinking about that.

366
00:32:20,652 --> 00:32:22,813
I thought I heard Yukie"s voice...

367
00:32:24,289 --> 00:32:25,847
Telling us to stop.

368
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,188
It has your sister"s name on it.

369
00:32:34,733 --> 00:32:38,999
It"s a souvenir from her
Junior High school trip to Kyoto.

370
00:32:43,575 --> 00:32:45,372
She wanted something...

371
00:32:46,345 --> 00:32:48,176
...not a typical souvenir.

372
00:32:52,384 --> 00:32:53,851
l"m scary, right?

373
00:32:54,853 --> 00:32:56,582
I don"t think so.

374
00:32:56,922 --> 00:32:59,015
That"s all right if you think so.

375
00:32:59,124 --> 00:33:02,321
l"m afraid of myself.

376
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:08,791
Honestly, I was afraid.

377
00:33:12,237 --> 00:33:15,729
I was afraid you were
going to collapse in the car.

378
00:33:17,676 --> 00:33:19,837
You had a vacant look...

379
00:33:20,979 --> 00:33:22,503
Like you were a different person.

380
00:33:26,818 --> 00:33:28,718
What we were trying to do was wrong.

381
00:33:30,489 --> 00:33:35,654
If we stoop to that level, we"re
no betterthan the rats who killed Yukie.

382
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:39,861
Let"s stop it now.

383
00:33:41,867 --> 00:33:46,201
You told me your secret for my sister.

384
00:33:48,006 --> 00:33:49,906
You tried to avenge her.

385
00:33:51,043 --> 00:33:52,533
That"s all I need.

386
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,442
That"s enough.

387
00:33:58,917 --> 00:34:00,384
Or did you...

388
00:34:02,421 --> 00:34:06,881
...just want to try out
using your special power?

389
00:34:36,254 --> 00:34:38,984
Are you in some
kind of trouble with Junko?

390
00:34:41,627 --> 00:34:43,527
No, not particularly.

391
00:34:43,695 --> 00:34:45,526
Then why are the cops here?

392
00:34:45,597 --> 00:34:46,188
What?

393
00:34:55,207 --> 00:34:57,004
She quit yesterday.

394
00:34:57,643 --> 00:34:58,507
Did she come by?

395
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,002
No, just a phone call.

396
00:35:00,312 --> 00:35:02,746
The girl has no sense of responsibility.

397
00:35:02,814 --> 00:35:05,442
l"m sorry to bother
you, I know you are busy.

398
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,684
My condolences on your sister"s death.

399
00:35:12,057 --> 00:35:18,121
Did you know that Masaki Kogure
suddenly began to burn in Chuo park?

400
00:35:19,131 --> 00:35:19,825
No.

401
00:35:20,298 --> 00:35:26,294
The same day, a car sped to
a gas station, smoke pouring out.

402
00:35:26,605 --> 00:35:31,042
The driver didn"t want
to report it to the police.

403
00:35:31,743 --> 00:35:33,904
But an attendant
memorized the license plate number.

404
00:35:33,979 --> 00:35:35,003
Take a look.

405
00:35:35,614 --> 00:35:39,311
As I drove, smoke
suddenly began coming from the car.

406
00:35:40,919 --> 00:35:42,284
It"s an old car.

407
00:35:42,554 --> 00:35:45,387
You were with a girl, right?

408
00:35:45,691 --> 00:35:48,091
Yes, a friend of mine.

409
00:35:48,927 --> 00:35:49,621
All right.

410
00:35:51,897 --> 00:35:56,163
Kogure had an interview the day before.

411
00:35:56,468 --> 00:35:59,460
He went to the park
to take some photos for it.

412
00:36:00,372 --> 00:36:04,536
Wasn"t the interviewer your friend?

413
00:36:06,878 --> 00:36:09,210
Are you saying that
I burned Kogure out of hatred?

414
00:36:09,815 --> 00:36:11,578
I didn"t mean that.

415
00:36:11,783 --> 00:36:14,274
I still wish I could kill him.

416
00:36:14,419 --> 00:36:16,717
If only the police did their job...

417
00:36:16,788 --> 00:36:19,484
Was Junko Aoki your friend?

418
00:36:19,558 --> 00:36:20,081
No.

419
00:36:20,292 --> 00:36:24,888
On December 14, you took
herto a restaurant in Aoyama.

420
00:36:26,631 --> 00:36:27,893
I don"t remember.

421
00:36:29,935 --> 00:36:32,233
Where did Ms. Aoki move to?

422
00:36:35,474 --> 00:36:36,839
l"m looking for her, too

423
00:36:39,411 --> 00:36:41,402
If you find her, please let me know.

424
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:00,998
You were right, Mother.

425
00:37:31,263 --> 00:37:32,958
Pyrokinesis?

426
00:37:34,866 --> 00:37:37,858
It refers to a type of psychokinesis
that can set things on fire.

427
00:37:39,638 --> 00:37:42,004
You mean that"s what
burned Kogure and the car?

428
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:46,440
There was no
gasoline cans or oily rags...

429
00:37:46,545 --> 00:37:50,709
There was also no
trace of flammable gas.

430
00:37:50,816 --> 00:37:53,546
No possibility of
spontaneous combustion at the scene.

431
00:37:53,718 --> 00:37:58,417
How can a fire start
without means of ignition?

432
00:37:58,523 --> 00:38:02,482
It"s pyrokinesis, what else could it be?

433
00:38:09,067 --> 00:38:12,127
Don"t give me that crazy
look, it reminds me of my dog.

434
00:38:28,587 --> 00:38:31,147
Hello, is this Junko Aoki?

435
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:33,521
Who"s this?

436
00:38:33,658 --> 00:38:35,421
I saw what happened in the Chuo Park.

437
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,289
You"re great...

438
00:38:37,362 --> 00:38:38,829
A bit scary, though.

439
00:38:39,164 --> 00:38:41,132
You are the world"s strongest girl.

440
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:43,291
l"II ask again.

441
00:38:43,468 --> 00:38:44,435
Who"s this?

442
00:38:47,472 --> 00:38:49,963
This is 19th Century Canada...

443
00:38:50,141 --> 00:38:52,473
...a 14 year old girl
named Jenny Bramwell.

444
00:38:52,911 --> 00:38:55,812
The things she pointed at burned.

445
00:38:56,081 --> 00:38:58,982
So she was called a
witch and driven from her village.

446
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:02,547
This was just 14 years ago.

447
00:39:02,687 --> 00:39:05,986
A 13 year-old boy
named Sahsa in the Ukraine.

448
00:39:06,958 --> 00:39:10,155
Furniture and
clothes around him burned.

449
00:39:10,295 --> 00:39:13,753
He was suspected to be a pyromaniac
and hospitalized, but the fires continued.

450
00:39:13,899 --> 00:39:17,892
The Soviet Medical
Academy called him an ESPer.

451
00:39:18,737 --> 00:39:20,295
The newspapers said so.

452
00:39:20,839 --> 00:39:23,399
There were many
cases of pyrokinesis reported.

453
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:29,510
Pyrokinesis is a powerthat agitates
molecules to produce intense heat.

454
00:39:30,081 --> 00:39:33,778
Just like a microwave oven.

455
00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:36,814
That must be convenient in the kitchen.

456
00:39:47,933 --> 00:39:50,299
Hi, young lady, do you have a minute?

457
00:39:51,002 --> 00:39:52,902
Can you help me with a survey?

458
00:39:54,306 --> 00:39:55,603
A date, right?

459
00:39:56,041 --> 00:39:57,941
Then keep me company
until your boyfriend comes...

460
00:39:58,276 --> 00:40:01,211
We"re distributing free makeup
samples at the building overthere.

461
00:40:01,579 --> 00:40:02,876
Give it a rest, man!

462
00:40:03,348 --> 00:40:05,179
Was I talking to you, huh?

463
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,665
Hey, nice left!

464
00:40:37,749 --> 00:40:38,681
Waiting long?

465
00:40:38,984 --> 00:40:40,383
Pleased to meet you.

466
00:40:40,852 --> 00:40:41,876
l"m Koichi Kido.

467
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,593
What was that?

468
00:40:51,196 --> 00:40:54,188
I gave him an
impulse through my touch...

469
00:40:54,966 --> 00:40:58,026
...and it was sent
directly to his brain as an order.

470
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:02,734
If I touched Julia Roberts,
I could make her do a striptease.

471
00:41:03,441 --> 00:41:05,568
How did you know me?

472
00:41:06,077 --> 00:41:10,138
I wanted to touch
Kogure so he"d kill himself.

473
00:41:10,915 --> 00:41:12,815
So I went to Chuo park.

474
00:41:13,952 --> 00:41:17,115
Are you putting a
heat barrier around you?

475
00:41:17,722 --> 00:41:19,781
Don"t try to touch me if
you don"t want to be burned.

476
00:41:20,859 --> 00:41:23,623
I wouldn"t try that, we"re ESPer friends.

477
00:41:24,129 --> 00:41:26,620
l"m opening my heart to you...

478
00:41:29,601 --> 00:41:31,262
Who was with you in the car?

479
00:41:31,336 --> 00:41:32,360
A boyfriend?

480
00:41:33,471 --> 00:41:34,961
None of your business!

481
00:41:35,407 --> 00:41:37,307
An ordinary man
can"t last as your boyfriend.

482
00:41:37,575 --> 00:41:38,872
You shouldn"t date normal guys.

483
00:41:39,377 --> 00:41:42,175
We are the chosen ones.

484
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,971
Like Jesus Christ and Mohammed.

485
00:41:46,718 --> 00:41:48,777
What you were trying to do was right.

486
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:52,621
Somebody must punish
those teenage monsters.

487
00:41:52,891 --> 00:41:53,755
Isn"t that what you think?

488
00:41:56,661 --> 00:41:59,061
They"re a cancer on humanity.

489
00:41:59,397 --> 00:42:04,300
As ESPers, it"s our job
to rid the world of them.

490
00:42:05,437 --> 00:42:09,874
A little autistic, but her IQ is
normal, and she"s well behaved.

491
00:42:10,442 --> 00:42:14,401
She"s old enough
to leave this home, but...

492
00:42:17,115 --> 00:42:21,745
There have been some incidents
of combustion, so you"re worried.

493
00:42:23,254 --> 00:42:24,653
Hello!

494
00:42:27,592 --> 00:42:29,082
Do you believe she has...

495
00:42:30,295 --> 00:42:31,922
...that special talent?

496
00:42:35,867 --> 00:42:36,959
Kaori Kurata...

497
00:42:37,435 --> 00:42:39,528
Her parents died
soon after she was born...

498
00:42:39,604 --> 00:42:42,232
...and she had no relatives,
so we took custody of her.

499
00:42:42,674 --> 00:42:45,370
Strange things have
happened since she came here.

500
00:42:46,077 --> 00:42:47,044
Like what?

501
00:42:49,681 --> 00:42:54,846
One night, when she was still a baby...

502
00:42:54,953 --> 00:42:58,116
I saw a fireball
hovering above her like this.

503
00:42:59,858 --> 00:43:01,553
What can I say...

504
00:43:02,293 --> 00:43:06,320
It looked as though
she was playing with it.

505
00:43:07,632 --> 00:43:10,692
Kaori was smiling at it.

506
00:43:25,717 --> 00:43:27,309
Let"s get rid of them.

507
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:29,812
If you and I team up, we"II be invincible.

508
00:43:38,897 --> 00:43:41,127
I touched one of them
and made him confessed.

509
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,530
They"II do it again tonight...

510
00:44:05,064 --> 00:44:08,158
...at a deserted factory
not far from your apartment.

511
00:44:08,701 --> 00:44:12,000
Another innocent girl will fall prey.

512
00:44:12,538 --> 00:44:14,130
Why not stop them yourself?

513
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:16,107
With your power, you don"t need me.

514
00:44:16,709 --> 00:44:18,176
I want you to do it.

515
00:44:18,344 --> 00:44:19,709
We want to rope you in.

516
00:44:20,213 --> 00:44:22,306
Punishment is what you are after, huh?

517
00:44:25,718 --> 00:44:27,151
This is what they"ve done.

518
00:44:31,357 --> 00:44:32,324
You"II see.

519
00:45:38,925 --> 00:45:40,222
Junko Aoki.

520
00:45:42,962 --> 00:45:45,192
You know her?

521
00:45:46,299 --> 00:45:48,028
I told her nothing.

522
00:45:48,467 --> 00:45:52,733
She feels what you
feel by touching you.

523
00:45:53,572 --> 00:45:55,699
You know what l"m thinking?

524
00:46:06,185 --> 00:46:07,652
Is that what you thought?

525
00:46:10,089 --> 00:46:12,114
What are you
waiting for, put out the fire!

526
00:46:12,191 --> 00:46:12,987
Hurry!

527
00:46:13,059 --> 00:46:13,548
Yes!

528
00:46:15,294 --> 00:46:18,821
You didn"t think it was a trick, did you?

529
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,458
I remember, you were good at
card tricks at the new year"s party.

530
00:46:25,371 --> 00:46:28,067
lfJunko has the same kind of power...

531
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,936
Then everything would make sense.

532
00:46:31,844 --> 00:46:35,871
l"m sure she was nearthe
Mercedes when it burst into flame.

533
00:46:38,551 --> 00:46:41,645
She is extremely
dangerous if we let her run loose.

534
00:46:59,271 --> 00:47:00,260
Let me go!

535
00:47:02,408 --> 00:47:04,000
Please, spare me!

536
00:47:04,143 --> 00:47:05,007
What?

537
00:47:05,111 --> 00:47:06,271
I can"t hear you.

538
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:08,945
Don"t kill me!

539
00:47:09,281 --> 00:47:10,373
Sorry.

540
00:47:10,516 --> 00:47:11,949
The death scene is what sells.

541
00:47:12,018 --> 00:47:13,576
I want to make good
money forthis video.

542
00:47:13,686 --> 00:47:16,712
Cry and writhe a bit before you die.

543
00:47:43,816 --> 00:47:44,748
What the hell?

544
00:47:57,296 --> 00:47:58,126
Get up!

545
00:48:28,928 --> 00:48:29,758
It"s a chick.

546
00:48:34,633 --> 00:48:36,066
She"s not bad looking!

547
00:49:33,459 --> 00:49:34,653
Bitch!

548
00:50:01,153 --> 00:50:02,211
It"s that girl!

549
00:50:06,892 --> 00:50:08,086
Are you okay?

550
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:16,902
You were watching?

551
00:50:17,203 --> 00:50:19,137
Don"t burn me!

552
00:50:43,262 --> 00:50:44,388
It"s you.

553
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:53,533
T-They kidnapped
Natsuko and brought her here.

554
00:50:53,939 --> 00:50:55,270
Who"s she?

555
00:50:55,674 --> 00:50:57,107
My assistant.

556
00:50:57,710 --> 00:51:00,372
We were working on getting the
scoop on Kogure and the others.

557
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,377
l"II go save her.

558
00:51:02,448 --> 00:51:04,109
You saw nothing, okay?

559
00:51:05,918 --> 00:51:09,149
Haseyama Street,
third building from the corner.

560
00:51:09,588 --> 00:51:12,819
The Plaza Bar...

561
00:51:18,697 --> 00:51:20,062
Let"s chase him by my car.

562
00:51:22,835 --> 00:51:25,599
But before that,
l"II erase this guy"s memory.

563
00:51:26,005 --> 00:51:28,599
Don"t waste yourtime, let"s go!

564
00:51:28,874 --> 00:51:30,432
He"s a reporter.

565
00:51:31,277 --> 00:51:32,141
He"II talk.

566
00:51:32,511 --> 00:51:33,637
I won"t, I promise!

567
00:51:33,912 --> 00:51:35,379
Forget it and hurry!

568
00:51:42,321 --> 00:51:43,720
Should we tell the police?

569
00:51:43,789 --> 00:51:44,949
It"s too late.

570
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:46,114
l"II go.

571
00:52:17,423 --> 00:52:19,618
Sorry, I didn"t expect a gun.

572
00:52:21,994 --> 00:52:24,861
That aside, you were amazing.

573
00:52:25,297 --> 00:52:26,924
Shut up and drive!

574
00:52:26,999 --> 00:52:28,159
We have to save her!

575
00:52:39,712 --> 00:52:40,804
Here we are.

576
00:54:09,001 --> 00:54:10,969
I see, this is where
they made their copies.

577
00:54:49,641 --> 00:54:52,007
You"re not to blame.

578
00:54:54,913 --> 00:54:55,607
It was my fault.

579
00:55:02,754 --> 00:55:03,516
What"s the matter?

580
00:55:09,394 --> 00:55:10,656
Help!

581
00:55:11,763 --> 00:55:13,162
Mother!

582
00:55:16,702 --> 00:55:19,000
Hey, are you okay?

583
00:55:19,972 --> 00:55:20,802
Hey!

584
00:55:21,373 --> 00:55:22,101
Hey!

585
00:56:15,294 --> 00:56:20,061
Forensics couldn"t
identify any combustible agents.

586
00:56:20,265 --> 00:56:22,426
Even the organs and
bones were burned down to ashes...

587
00:56:22,668 --> 00:56:25,432
...with intense heart in
a short amount of time.

588
00:56:25,504 --> 00:56:31,101
The boys were members of a
gang suspect in serial murder cases.

589
00:56:31,476 --> 00:56:34,809
It might be the result of internal discord
or maybe personal revenge forthe victims.

590
00:56:35,213 --> 00:56:37,306
Natsuko Mita,
the victim, was a reporter.

591
00:56:37,449 --> 00:56:39,383
Toshimitsu Asaba was her boss.

592
00:56:39,818 --> 00:56:44,084
It seems she was covering Kogure
and the others, but ended up falling prey.

593
00:56:44,189 --> 00:56:50,719
Asaba didn"t witness the murder, but
stated that a strange woman saved him.

594
00:56:51,563 --> 00:56:54,031
I believe he is
covering up forthis woman.

595
00:56:54,399 --> 00:56:58,199
Can you be sure that
the woman was Junko Aoki?

596
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:02,597
An anonymous photo that was
taken by a passer-by was sent in.

597
00:57:03,275 --> 00:57:05,971
A woman resembles
Junko was seen nearthe factory.

598
00:57:06,244 --> 00:57:08,405
That was Junko Aoki, I am sure.

599
00:57:08,747 --> 00:57:11,215
The motive is to avenge Yukie Tada.

600
00:57:11,683 --> 00:57:13,514
The weapon is pyrokinesis.

601
00:57:16,722 --> 00:57:17,848
What"s wrong?

602
00:57:20,225 --> 00:57:21,590
Makihara...

603
00:57:22,794 --> 00:57:24,557
You sound excited.

604
00:57:25,263 --> 00:57:27,231
Any grudge against her?

605
00:57:27,666 --> 00:57:28,496
No.

606
00:57:29,334 --> 00:57:32,895
I wouldn"t let my personal feelings
get in the way of an investigation.

607
00:57:44,683 --> 00:57:48,016
A strange woman
spotted at the scene.

608
00:58:18,984 --> 00:58:20,144
What is it?

609
00:58:21,787 --> 00:58:23,277
Tell me.

610
00:58:25,824 --> 00:58:27,917
I had a brother-in-law.

611
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:29,391
He was a problem child.

612
00:58:31,329 --> 00:58:33,422
He used to kill dogs and cats.

613
00:58:36,601 --> 00:58:40,093
Now, I don"t know exactly what
he was trying to do to this girl, but...

614
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,367
That day, I saw it from far away...

615
00:58:45,644 --> 00:58:47,305
I was on my way home...

616
00:58:49,047 --> 00:58:51,106
Suddenly my brother was aflame.

617
00:58:52,851 --> 00:58:54,250
I ran to him.

618
00:58:56,722 --> 00:58:58,747
Have you ever built a bonfire?

619
00:59:00,058 --> 00:59:02,583
Of course, everyone used to.

620
00:59:04,262 --> 00:59:08,392
At certain point, piled
firewood starts to collapse, right?

621
00:59:10,769 --> 00:59:12,430
Just like that...

622
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:16,467
My brother"s bones
burned and disjointed...

623
00:59:19,144 --> 00:59:21,544
...and fell like a puppet.

624
00:59:25,083 --> 00:59:26,607
He was crying for help!

625
00:59:33,358 --> 00:59:34,848
I couldn"t do anything.

626
00:59:37,929 --> 00:59:40,159
And what happened to the girl?

627
00:59:40,999 --> 00:59:45,231
"l"m sorry, I burned him," she said.

628
00:59:47,072 --> 00:59:49,438
Was she Junko Aoki?

629
00:59:50,776 --> 00:59:52,403
She told me her name.

630
00:59:53,645 --> 00:59:58,548
But it was such a strange
story, I couldn"t tell it to anyone.

631
00:59:58,617 --> 01:00:00,278
If I did, l"d be suspected...

632
01:00:02,354 --> 01:00:04,481
...because I didn"t get
along with my brother.

633
01:00:07,893 --> 01:00:10,157
Soon after, the girl moved away.

634
01:00:11,496 --> 01:00:15,057
The police couldn"t find any suspects.

635
01:00:16,168 --> 01:00:18,966
Afterthat, my family was scattered.

636
01:00:26,711 --> 01:00:32,308
Before my mother died, she asked me...

637
01:00:35,754 --> 01:00:41,522
"Did you become a cop
to atone for what you did?"

638
01:00:44,563 --> 01:00:46,030
I told her she was wrong.

639
01:00:48,366 --> 01:00:51,164
"I didn"t do what you think I did", I said.

640
01:00:53,738 --> 01:00:56,263
She asked no more questions.

641
01:01:01,079 --> 01:01:05,516
That girl grew up to
be a vicious murderer.

642
01:01:25,303 --> 01:01:27,362
You slept for 40 hours.

643
01:01:28,039 --> 01:01:29,063
Where am I?

644
01:01:30,742 --> 01:01:31,640
My place.

645
01:01:50,528 --> 01:01:52,758
I didn"t see what I wanted to see.

646
01:01:53,164 --> 01:01:54,495
I closed my eyes.

647
01:01:54,933 --> 01:01:56,491
I didn"t touch you either.

648
01:01:56,568 --> 01:01:58,695
Please, believe me.

649
01:02:03,174 --> 01:02:07,440
I could nevertouch a girl I actually liked.

650
01:02:08,546 --> 01:02:11,014
If I did, it wouldn"t be fair.

651
01:02:11,683 --> 01:02:13,207
l"m such a poor guy, right?

652
01:02:52,023 --> 01:02:55,015
You spent too much energy last time.

653
01:02:55,894 --> 01:02:57,862
It could kill you.

654
01:02:58,029 --> 01:03:00,327
Us ESPers don"t have long lives.

655
01:03:12,744 --> 01:03:14,336
Kogure is dead?

656
01:03:14,779 --> 01:03:17,145
No, that was another boy.

657
01:03:17,449 --> 01:03:19,576
That"s right, it wasn"t Kogure!

658
01:03:19,918 --> 01:03:21,579
Wasn"t he there?

659
01:03:21,653 --> 01:03:22,642
Did you look?

660
01:03:23,355 --> 01:03:26,518
The guy had a gun,
I had to take you away.

661
01:03:27,125 --> 01:03:28,456
You know I can"t use fire.

662
01:03:30,595 --> 01:03:34,588
I haven"t thanked you
for saving me, have I?

663
01:03:35,934 --> 01:03:37,060
Forget it.

664
01:03:37,202 --> 01:03:38,897
It was my fault.

665
01:03:40,572 --> 01:03:41,732
Thank you.

666
01:03:48,213 --> 01:03:50,181
What is it, young girl?

667
01:03:55,887 --> 01:03:59,118
I went to your apartment,
but the police were watching it.

668
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,352
My clothes?

669
01:04:03,828 --> 01:04:05,159
You should rest longer.

670
01:04:05,730 --> 01:04:07,425
I must find Kogure...

671
01:04:07,499 --> 01:04:08,022
I must...

672
01:04:08,666 --> 01:04:10,861
Your clothes were
torn and had blood all over.

673
01:04:17,809 --> 01:04:21,609
Some are your usual
style, others are different.

674
01:04:23,948 --> 01:04:26,416
I don"t need this many.

675
01:04:27,485 --> 01:04:29,077
Just wear what you like.

676
01:04:29,587 --> 01:04:31,646
I really don"t want to thank you again.

677
01:04:31,723 --> 01:04:32,690
You don"t have to.

678
01:04:32,757 --> 01:04:33,246
Thank you.

679
01:04:33,324 --> 01:04:34,086
Forget it.

680
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:38,224
So you want to finish Kogure, right?

681
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:44,568
She used to come here alone.

682
01:04:48,106 --> 01:04:49,835
Her favorite table is overthere.

683
01:04:50,675 --> 01:04:53,337
l"m sorry, but I don"t remember.

684
01:04:58,950 --> 01:05:00,975
Have you found Ms. Junko Aoki?

685
01:05:03,488 --> 01:05:04,455
She has...

686
01:05:06,391 --> 01:05:07,756
...nothing to do with this.

687
01:05:08,059 --> 01:05:10,254
Can"t she burn
things with psychokinesis?

688
01:05:10,328 --> 01:05:11,727
What are you talking about?

689
01:05:12,397 --> 01:05:16,891
Let me ask you, did you
see the car burn here, too?

690
01:05:18,703 --> 01:05:21,866
Are you sure Kogure
is the one who died?

691
01:05:23,208 --> 01:05:26,006
The remains were carbonized.

692
01:05:26,077 --> 01:05:29,308
We are testing the DNA now,
but we"re pretty sure it was him.

693
01:05:31,049 --> 01:05:34,678
The cops forgave him, but God did not.

694
01:05:38,189 --> 01:05:41,625
Look, it"s not like we forgave him.

695
01:05:41,693 --> 01:05:43,888
But we can"t just lynch him, right?

696
01:05:44,629 --> 01:05:46,790
Would God permit that?

697
01:05:56,508 --> 01:05:57,566
Mr. Asaba.

698
01:06:03,014 --> 01:06:05,346
I didn"t say anything.

699
01:06:05,884 --> 01:06:07,374
I know.

700
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:12,851
l"m sorry I couldn"t save Ms. Natsuko.

701
01:06:15,693 --> 01:06:18,025
Who the hell are you?

702
01:06:18,229 --> 01:06:20,129
What were you doing there?

703
01:06:20,532 --> 01:06:22,295
Somebody told me...

704
01:06:22,367 --> 01:06:23,891
Was it the Guardians?

705
01:06:24,002 --> 01:06:24,969
What?

706
01:06:25,770 --> 01:06:28,068
Are you a member, too?

707
01:06:28,907 --> 01:06:31,000
What are you talking about?

708
01:06:34,946 --> 01:06:36,880
Stop, stop, no!

709
01:06:39,217 --> 01:06:39,979
Don't kill me!

710
01:06:48,459 --> 01:06:49,619
That"s...

711
01:06:51,196 --> 01:06:52,993
This belongs to Natsuko.

712
01:06:53,164 --> 01:06:55,632
What"s on the tape?

713
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:56,598
Nothing.

714
01:06:57,468 --> 01:06:59,129
Anyway, what are the Guardians?

715
01:07:01,773 --> 01:07:04,037
You didn"t come to kill me?

716
01:07:04,509 --> 01:07:05,669
No way.

717
01:07:05,743 --> 01:07:07,210
Why do you say that?

718
01:07:10,448 --> 01:07:13,042
Do you know where Kogure is?

719
01:07:13,251 --> 01:07:14,411
What?

720
01:07:14,552 --> 01:07:15,917
He"s dead, isn"t he?

721
01:07:16,688 --> 01:07:17,950
He"s alive.

722
01:07:18,389 --> 01:07:19,981
The body was another boy.

723
01:07:23,328 --> 01:07:25,091
What did Ms. Natsuko know?

724
01:07:25,163 --> 01:07:26,755
Who knows, she"s dead!

725
01:07:26,831 --> 01:07:28,230
Something inconvenient to you?

726
01:07:28,299 --> 01:07:30,199
I kept secret about
you, now leave me alone.

727
01:07:30,268 --> 01:07:32,133
Were you involved in
making the videotapes?

728
01:07:32,203 --> 01:07:34,068
I don"t know, I told you!

729
01:07:35,573 --> 01:07:36,437
Help!

730
01:07:36,541 --> 01:07:38,065
She"s a stalker!

731
01:08:01,833 --> 01:08:02,731
Monster!

732
01:08:26,891 --> 01:08:27,949
Ms. Junko Aoki.

733
01:08:38,670 --> 01:08:40,604
The spelling of his first name is...

734
01:08:41,472 --> 01:08:44,168
Here"s the name of the
victim, Toshimitsu Asaba.

735
01:08:44,242 --> 01:08:47,939
Another reporter who was after
Kogure with Ms. Natsuko Mita.

736
01:08:48,012 --> 01:08:49,707
What about the
woman spotted at the scene?

737
01:08:49,781 --> 01:08:50,907
Junko Aoki.

738
01:08:50,982 --> 01:08:52,973
Security camera caught herthis time.

739
01:08:54,819 --> 01:08:57,219
She did it again, right?

740
01:08:58,156 --> 01:08:59,714
This time, it"s different.

741
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:03,486
We found a part of a detonator.

742
01:09:05,330 --> 01:09:10,859
Three charred bodies were found at a
deserted factory in Nishimoto, Arakawa.

743
01:09:11,769 --> 01:09:16,638
A woman was shot and a man was
burned at Plaza Bar in Haseyama, Arakawa.

744
01:09:17,642 --> 01:09:20,406
A man died in an
explosion in Komatsu, Bunkyo.

745
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:24,510
In each case, the same
woman was seen at the spot...

746
01:09:24,649 --> 01:09:28,016
...an ex-employee
of Toho Pulp, Junko Aoki.

747
01:09:28,186 --> 01:09:31,553
We decided to pick
her up for questioning.

748
01:09:31,823 --> 01:09:38,285
Also, a video recording Yukie Tada"s
murder was seized at her apartment.

749
01:09:38,563 --> 01:09:41,964
We suspect Aoki was
involved in the serial murder cases.

750
01:09:42,333 --> 01:09:46,565
Gentlemen, try your best
to capture Junko Aoki at once.

751
01:09:47,071 --> 01:09:50,973
Do you mean you
suspect Aoki killed all of them?

752
01:09:51,442 --> 01:09:53,967
No, we must
not assume that at this point.

753
01:09:54,112 --> 01:09:56,012
We"re just saying
she"s suspicious enough.

754
01:09:57,014 --> 01:10:03,010
I can assure you that Junko Aoki didn"t
kill those three at the Plaza and Asaba.

755
01:10:04,021 --> 01:10:04,646
Because...

756
01:10:05,656 --> 01:10:07,556
Has anyone heard
the term pyrokinesis?

757
01:10:07,625 --> 01:10:09,320
Makihara, No!

758
01:10:10,395 --> 01:10:11,259
Listen!

759
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:19,065
Mr. Makihara needs
psychoanalysis, not psychokinesis.

760
01:10:20,138 --> 01:10:23,505
The bodies at the
factory were burned instantly...

761
01:10:23,641 --> 01:10:26,633
Besides, no fuel at all was used.

762
01:10:26,744 --> 01:10:29,008
The autopsy confirmed it.

763
01:10:29,313 --> 01:10:32,874
Makihara, what was the weapon, then?

764
01:10:33,384 --> 01:10:37,616
Can you write
psychokinesis on the indictment?

765
01:10:44,962 --> 01:10:49,490
I feel we have
something in common in our blood.

766
01:10:51,202 --> 01:10:54,569
Why do we have such power?

767
01:10:56,808 --> 01:10:58,776
My mother once told me.

768
01:11:00,111 --> 01:11:04,047
Our ancestors went
through endless hardships.

769
01:11:05,616 --> 01:11:08,016
They developed a hatred for people.

770
01:11:10,054 --> 01:11:16,755
Their hatred intensified and
gave them the powerto make fire.

771
01:11:19,964 --> 01:11:24,060
I never saw my parents.

772
01:11:34,745 --> 01:11:37,213
I can"t replace your mother, but...

773
01:11:43,054 --> 01:11:44,749
You"ve killed people.

774
01:11:48,993 --> 01:11:53,327
In this world, some
people are worse than devils.

775
01:11:53,631 --> 01:11:54,893
I know.

776
01:11:55,233 --> 01:11:57,133
So that"s okay, you can kill them.

777
01:11:57,869 --> 01:11:58,767
What?

778
01:11:59,237 --> 01:12:00,135
l"II do it, too.

779
01:12:00,238 --> 01:12:02,798
No, you can"t do that, Kaori

780
01:12:02,974 --> 01:12:04,339
Aren"t I good enough?

781
01:12:04,976 --> 01:12:06,466
It"s not that.

782
01:12:10,748 --> 01:12:12,773
I wanted to save this lady...

783
01:12:13,017 --> 01:12:14,541
Even at the cost of my life...

784
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:17,351
But I couldn"t.

785
01:12:19,624 --> 01:12:21,990
Nothing everturns
out to be the way I want.

786
01:12:23,327 --> 01:12:28,264
Every time I burn people,
I feel like I am walking in the dark.

787
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,833
l"m always scared, afraid of myself.

788
01:12:33,204 --> 01:12:35,672
I don"t want you to be like that.

789
01:12:43,948 --> 01:12:44,880
What"s the matter?

790
01:12:45,983 --> 01:12:49,180
A man shot her!

791
01:12:51,622 --> 01:12:52,520
You can see that?

792
01:12:57,895 --> 01:13:01,797
What do you mean,
Junko could be threat to us?

793
01:13:04,001 --> 01:13:06,094
Won"t you reconsider?

794
01:13:06,270 --> 01:13:09,899
If she joins us, she could
be a great fighting power.

795
01:13:14,245 --> 01:13:15,542
I see.

796
01:13:16,581 --> 01:13:21,211
But I don"t know where she is now.

797
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:45,731
Wow, it"s a feast!

798
01:13:48,713 --> 01:13:51,113
l"m going out after dinner.

799
01:13:51,248 --> 01:13:52,180
Where to?

800
01:13:52,717 --> 01:13:54,309
I won"t tell you.

801
01:13:54,785 --> 01:13:57,253
The cops are looking for you,
they suspect you are the killer.

802
01:13:57,655 --> 01:14:00,590
This man is a real brute,
be careful while l"m gone.

803
01:14:01,859 --> 01:14:03,292
He"s a nice man.

804
01:14:05,930 --> 01:14:07,090
He touched you?

805
01:14:07,898 --> 01:14:09,388
He likes you.

806
01:14:11,802 --> 01:14:14,464
He likes any girl.

807
01:14:15,006 --> 01:14:17,975
No, he really loves you...

808
01:14:18,042 --> 01:14:19,976
...so desperately, he wants to cry.

809
01:14:23,247 --> 01:14:24,145
Let"s eat.

810
01:14:24,215 --> 01:14:25,842
Sit down, both of you.

811
01:14:29,887 --> 01:14:31,445
She"s joking, right?

812
01:14:32,690 --> 01:14:34,282
You didn"t touch her, did you?

813
01:14:35,192 --> 01:14:36,489
That"s my Junko.

814
01:14:37,128 --> 01:14:38,925
Don"t call me that.

815
01:14:38,996 --> 01:14:41,055
l"m not your girlfriend.

816
01:14:41,699 --> 01:14:42,893
All right, all right.

817
01:14:51,876 --> 01:14:53,605
Yes, I understand.

818
01:14:55,946 --> 01:14:59,006
Kaori"s been missing forthree days.

819
01:15:00,084 --> 01:15:01,949
She might be looking forJunko.

820
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:05,720
What if they join forces?

821
01:15:09,193 --> 01:15:11,889
They can open a barbecue restaurant.

822
01:15:14,699 --> 01:15:16,394
Or a Yakiniku restaurant...

823
01:15:17,368 --> 01:15:21,498
...a roast Yakitori
shop sounds good, too...

824
01:15:34,985 --> 01:15:36,452
l"m Junko Aoki.

825
01:15:40,157 --> 01:15:41,715
Ms. Ishizu?

826
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:45,220
Kaori said I can trust you.

827
01:15:47,198 --> 01:15:48,722
Turning yourself in?

828
01:15:49,366 --> 01:15:50,298
No.

829
01:15:53,137 --> 01:15:54,536
Anyway, sit down.

830
01:15:57,541 --> 01:16:02,945
Was it you who burned the
three boys at the deserted factory?

831
01:16:03,848 --> 01:16:04,746
Yes.

832
01:16:05,716 --> 01:16:07,616
What about the
videotape in your room?

833
01:16:07,852 --> 01:16:11,151
That"s the reason why I killed them.

834
01:16:12,056 --> 01:16:14,786
They killed Yukie to
make the videotape...

835
01:16:15,226 --> 01:16:17,387
Only for fun.

836
01:16:17,695 --> 01:16:19,128
I couldn"t forgive them.

837
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:24,895
You mean you punished them?

838
01:16:25,269 --> 01:16:27,499
It was to save Ms. Natsuko Mita.

839
01:16:28,005 --> 01:16:30,701
I couldn"t do anything, though.

840
01:16:30,808 --> 01:16:33,902
No matter how malicious they
are, It won"t justify your killing them.

841
01:16:34,078 --> 01:16:35,943
I know I won"t be pardoned.

842
01:16:36,647 --> 01:16:38,137
But I don"t care.

843
01:16:41,218 --> 01:16:46,087
When I went to the Plaza,
she was already shot dead.

844
01:16:47,825 --> 01:16:49,725
Kogure is still alive.

845
01:16:50,528 --> 01:16:52,655
Somebody"s backing him.

846
01:16:56,367 --> 01:16:56,856
What?

847
01:17:00,304 --> 01:17:01,498
It"s him.

848
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:04,507
What"s this?

849
01:17:11,916 --> 01:17:13,645
Chief Hasegawa?

850
01:17:21,692 --> 01:17:23,489
Kaori"s psychic photos.

851
01:17:24,061 --> 01:17:25,494
Is it somebody you know?

852
01:17:26,530 --> 01:17:29,294
We can"t trust psychic photography.

853
01:17:31,468 --> 01:17:34,266
Isn"t this a composite
photograph or some kind of trick?

854
01:17:34,371 --> 01:17:37,807
It might not be admissible
as evidence, but it"s the truth.

855
01:17:46,617 --> 01:17:49,677
Kogure said he could get
a lot of money forthe tape.

856
01:17:50,354 --> 01:17:52,185
Asaba mentioned "the Guardians."

857
01:17:58,229 --> 01:18:01,164
I don"t want to get involved anymore.

858
01:18:02,666 --> 01:18:04,634
I want to leave the rest to you.

859
01:18:05,636 --> 01:18:06,728
Oh, my!

860
01:18:14,278 --> 01:18:17,008
You killed my brother.

861
01:18:18,148 --> 01:18:19,240
Are you...

862
01:18:20,751 --> 01:18:23,720
It was a big mistake that I
didn"t tell anybody about you.

863
01:18:24,688 --> 01:18:25,382
I...

864
01:18:25,489 --> 01:18:26,888
Try to burn me.

865
01:18:27,024 --> 01:18:28,184
l"m not going to do that.

866
01:18:30,628 --> 01:18:33,358
Did you everthink about
how they felt as they burned?

867
01:18:35,933 --> 01:18:37,332
Makihara.

868
01:18:40,738 --> 01:18:41,602
Drop it.

869
01:18:41,672 --> 01:18:43,105
She"s dangerous.

870
01:18:43,507 --> 01:18:45,270
She could use fire at any moment.

871
01:18:47,177 --> 01:18:49,077
You"re the dangerous one.

872
01:18:51,282 --> 01:18:52,874
Go back to your job.

873
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:58,285
Let"s talk overthere.

874
01:18:59,590 --> 01:19:02,650
I met Mr. Tada at the
restaurant in Aoyama.

875
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:05,153
He was trying hard to defend you.

876
01:19:05,229 --> 01:19:05,695
He did?

877
01:19:05,763 --> 01:19:08,323
But you know you"re guilty?

878
01:19:12,169 --> 01:19:14,000
You are saying that
if I were found guilty...

879
01:19:14,071 --> 01:19:16,062
...and served my sentences,
everything would be okay?

880
01:19:16,407 --> 01:19:18,272
Everything will be solved?

881
01:19:19,443 --> 01:19:21,343
What are you saying?

882
01:19:21,445 --> 01:19:24,107
You broke the law,
you"II be punished, that"s all.

883
01:19:24,448 --> 01:19:29,647
Then l"II go find my way,
and l"II survive somehow!

884
01:20:07,391 --> 01:20:09,222
After her!

885
01:20:16,066 --> 01:20:16,930
Idiot!

886
01:20:18,769 --> 01:20:21,067
You"d be fired.

887
01:20:27,011 --> 01:20:28,410
What"s this?

888
01:20:29,847 --> 01:20:33,078
This is pyrokinesis.

889
01:20:36,553 --> 01:20:41,115
Then, it"s not a trick, is it?

890
01:20:42,092 --> 01:20:44,219
Is that what you thought until now?

891
01:20:45,863 --> 01:20:47,831
Forget the barbecue...

892
01:20:52,202 --> 01:20:53,965
Hey, what about this?

893
01:20:54,238 --> 01:20:57,298
Psychic photography
would be easy forthem.

894
01:20:57,374 --> 01:20:58,864
No, the contents!

895
01:21:01,745 --> 01:21:04,179
It doesn"t make any sense!

896
01:21:04,948 --> 01:21:06,677
What"II we do?

897
01:21:08,285 --> 01:21:10,150
Let"s look into this.

898
01:21:29,506 --> 01:21:32,202
What I don"t understand is
why you killed Asaba like that.

899
01:21:33,444 --> 01:21:35,776
The police can"t execute Junko Aoki...

900
01:21:35,846 --> 01:21:39,509
...unless the public get the impression
that she is a dangerous terrorist.

901
01:21:40,517 --> 01:21:42,849
Asaba sold the "snuff film".

902
01:21:43,020 --> 01:21:45,215
Why pin it on Junko?

903
01:21:45,689 --> 01:21:47,680
It seems unreasonable.

904
01:21:48,826 --> 01:21:53,263
We execute vermin escaping the law.

905
01:21:53,530 --> 01:21:57,364
We make them realize
their sins, and suffer agony.

906
01:21:57,534 --> 01:21:59,832
That"s the Guardians" job, isn"t it?

907
01:22:01,038 --> 01:22:03,063
This case"s complicated.

908
01:22:04,608 --> 01:22:09,307
I understand how you feel,
but follow my instructions for now.

909
01:22:09,813 --> 01:22:11,144
Of course.

910
01:22:11,315 --> 01:22:13,408
My life is in your hands, chief.

911
01:22:38,876 --> 01:22:40,002
Mr. Tada!

912
01:22:46,950 --> 01:22:48,076
l"m so happy to see you.

913
01:22:49,419 --> 01:22:51,512
Have you been looking for me?

914
01:22:52,956 --> 01:22:54,480
I couldn"t think of any other place...

915
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:58,188
I said such a horrible thing to you.

916
01:23:00,597 --> 01:23:02,030
I couldn"t forgive myself.

917
01:23:03,433 --> 01:23:04,297
I wanted to apologize.

918
01:23:05,102 --> 01:23:07,502
They"II suspect you
if they see us together.

919
01:23:07,738 --> 01:23:08,500
I don"t care.

920
01:23:11,742 --> 01:23:12,936
l"II save you...

921
01:23:15,045 --> 01:23:16,410
No matter what!

922
01:23:18,649 --> 01:23:21,743
l"m nothing but a murderer.

923
01:23:21,919 --> 01:23:22,510
No more!

924
01:23:25,455 --> 01:23:26,717
Stop it!

925
01:23:32,629 --> 01:23:33,823
Live with me.

926
01:23:37,034 --> 01:23:38,058
That"s impossible...

927
01:24:14,571 --> 01:24:17,005
l"ve been watching you...

928
01:24:19,142 --> 01:24:23,044
Talking to you in
my mind for a long time.

929
01:24:24,815 --> 01:24:25,713
Really?

930
01:24:35,759 --> 01:24:37,818
l"II never forget you.

931
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:44,189
Good bye.

932
01:24:48,972 --> 01:24:50,132
Ms. Aoki...

933
01:25:38,322 --> 01:25:39,311
You"re back.

934
01:25:39,956 --> 01:25:41,116
Where"s Kaori?

935
01:25:41,358 --> 01:25:42,655
She"s with me.

936
01:25:43,026 --> 01:25:44,186
Is she safe?

937
01:25:44,394 --> 01:25:45,861
Don"t worry.

938
01:25:46,530 --> 01:25:47,497
Are you sure?

939
01:25:48,398 --> 01:25:51,526
l"m not interested in
laying hands on little girls.

940
01:25:54,571 --> 01:25:57,665
What"s Hasegawa to you?

941
01:25:59,142 --> 01:26:01,440
We work forthe same purpose.

942
01:26:02,346 --> 01:26:03,210
Comrades.

943
01:26:03,347 --> 01:26:05,372
He killed Natsuko, did you know?

944
01:26:05,782 --> 01:26:08,307
Not until Kaori told me.

945
01:26:08,785 --> 01:26:10,275
She told you?

946
01:26:10,787 --> 01:26:11,913
I touched her.

947
01:26:13,023 --> 01:26:14,991
She touched me first.

948
01:26:15,592 --> 01:26:17,150
I unconsciously touched her back.

949
01:26:17,894 --> 01:26:19,953
I trusted you.

950
01:26:21,031 --> 01:26:22,521
Did you touch me, too?

951
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:25,598
Come to the
amusement park where we went.

952
01:26:25,802 --> 01:26:27,167
We"II talk in person.

953
01:26:27,704 --> 01:26:29,001
That"s not fair!

954
01:26:29,506 --> 01:26:30,495
I know.

955
01:26:41,885 --> 01:26:43,876
Asaba is well
acquainted with illegal videos.

956
01:26:43,954 --> 01:26:47,583
We"ve heard the rumor
that he secretly sold them.

957
01:26:53,764 --> 01:26:56,494
This is the list of his customers.

958
01:26:56,566 --> 01:26:58,796
No real names, though.

959
01:27:04,241 --> 01:27:07,699
Yes, this e-mail address is
used at police Headquarters.

960
01:27:07,978 --> 01:27:09,536
Can you trace the message?

961
01:27:10,046 --> 01:27:12,606
No, you have to go to
the Headquarters forthat.

962
01:27:14,251 --> 01:27:15,081
No?

963
01:27:17,554 --> 01:27:19,419
You should get a new face afterthis.

964
01:27:20,557 --> 01:27:25,688
If you are reborn as a soldier,
you can kill as much as you want.

965
01:27:26,263 --> 01:27:28,458
Will you kill me someday?

966
01:27:31,435 --> 01:27:34,632
I could"ve killed you
at the Plaza if l"d wanted.

967
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:39,474
Let me ask you,
why did you join the police?

968
01:27:42,112 --> 01:27:44,307
First, I sought justice.

969
01:27:45,081 --> 01:27:46,070
But soon...

970
01:27:47,617 --> 01:27:52,919
I realized both killers and
victims are no betterthan trash.

971
01:27:58,094 --> 01:27:59,618
Help!

972
01:27:59,830 --> 01:28:01,764
This is a masterpiece.

973
01:28:03,733 --> 01:28:05,428
It gives me power.

974
01:28:07,270 --> 01:28:09,500
It"s betterthan real killing.

975
01:28:11,141 --> 01:28:12,301
Going to kill Junko?

976
01:28:15,278 --> 01:28:16,575
And another.

977
01:28:28,091 --> 01:28:29,683
Junko Aoki...

978
01:28:29,926 --> 01:28:31,689
...has turned up at Amuseland.

979
01:28:32,562 --> 01:28:36,089
The riot police and
SWAT are on the way.

980
01:28:36,399 --> 01:28:37,832
Snipers?

981
01:28:38,134 --> 01:28:41,661
Amuseland has been
completely sealed off!

982
01:28:41,738 --> 01:28:44,138
The order has been issued...

983
01:28:44,875 --> 01:28:49,574
...if she makes one wrong
move, they"II shoot to kill.

984
01:28:50,313 --> 01:28:52,042
That"s final.

985
01:28:52,282 --> 01:28:55,581
Are we allowed to
do that in this country?

986
01:28:56,586 --> 01:28:59,555
She"s just a girl in her
twenties, she has no criminal record.

987
01:28:59,923 --> 01:29:05,054
She tried to burn down
this building, don't forget that.

988
01:29:05,695 --> 01:29:08,220
Who know what kind
of lethal weapons she has!

989
01:29:09,399 --> 01:29:12,527
She"s a Ione terrorist.

990
01:29:13,069 --> 01:29:14,934
Her mental state is abnormal.

991
01:29:15,438 --> 01:29:16,996
She"s a tiger in the street.

992
01:29:17,207 --> 01:29:20,370
We must destroy her.

993
01:29:20,443 --> 01:29:23,276
It"s all Chief Hasagawa"s idea, isn"t it?

994
01:29:23,713 --> 01:29:24,577
Excuse me...

995
01:29:27,250 --> 01:29:31,550
Listen, I saw the
psychic photo Junko brought.

996
01:29:31,655 --> 01:29:34,818
Even if it"s
suspicious, he"s still our chief.

997
01:29:34,925 --> 01:29:38,884
l"II inform the prosecutors about it.

998
01:29:38,995 --> 01:29:41,623
Will you just go easy on him for now?

999
01:29:41,698 --> 01:29:43,928
He"s fond of you.

1000
01:29:44,634 --> 01:29:49,765
l"ve known you over 27 years, and
that"s the dumbest thing you"ve ever said.

1001
01:29:54,544 --> 01:29:55,806
Get moving, men!

1002
01:30:01,851 --> 01:30:02,579
This way.

1003
01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:04,548
Ms. Ishizu.

1004
01:30:10,026 --> 01:30:11,186
It"s Junko...

1005
01:30:13,229 --> 01:30:14,560
Please save her!

1006
01:30:14,698 --> 01:30:17,496
<i>Attention, customers. </i>

1007
01:30:17,901 --> 01:30:21,337
<i>We were just advised by the fire</i>
<i>department of a temporary evacuation. </i>

1008
01:30:21,404 --> 01:30:23,304
<i>Please follow the instructions, </i>
<i>and evacuate the park immediately. </i>

1009
01:30:23,373 --> 01:30:26,467
I paid to get in here,
I shouldn"t have to pay forthis too!

1010
01:30:26,943 --> 01:30:30,037
<i>Thank you for your cooperation. </i>

1011
01:30:49,366 --> 01:30:50,458
Kaori.

1012
01:30:52,902 --> 01:30:54,836
I miss the day we
walked here together.

1013
01:30:56,406 --> 01:30:58,431
When did you touch me?

1014
01:30:59,442 --> 01:31:02,309
I should"ve nevertrusted you.

1015
01:31:02,812 --> 01:31:06,543
I can read a pure
mind without touching.

1016
01:31:08,051 --> 01:31:10,451
You liked me a bit, didn"t you?

1017
01:31:11,955 --> 01:31:14,753
What"s your group"s real purpose?

1018
01:31:15,325 --> 01:31:18,089
To get rid of
corruption in human society.

1019
01:31:18,228 --> 01:31:20,423
Why the snuff film?

1020
01:31:20,864 --> 01:31:22,559
I didn"t know about it.

1021
01:31:23,266 --> 01:31:26,531
Asaba bought it from Kogure to sell it.

1022
01:31:26,803 --> 01:31:31,137
Natsuko found out,
so he sacrificed her.

1023
01:31:34,577 --> 01:31:36,670
They were both vermin, after all.

1024
01:31:37,647 --> 01:31:40,411
Hasegawa is the one who
ordered the video to be made.

1025
01:31:40,483 --> 01:31:42,075
He killed Natsuko.

1026
01:31:42,185 --> 01:31:43,812
He must be hiding Kogure somewhere!

1027
01:31:45,021 --> 01:31:46,682
He has his reasons, then!

1028
01:31:46,956 --> 01:31:49,015
Hasegawa is a devil.

1029
01:31:49,325 --> 01:31:51,054
He"s using you!

1030
01:31:51,594 --> 01:31:52,788
Junko.

1031
01:31:54,164 --> 01:31:55,961
Take a look at those hoods.

1032
01:32:08,078 --> 01:32:09,670
They"re worthless.

1033
01:32:10,914 --> 01:32:14,941
They"II harm innocent
people if we leave them alone.

1034
01:32:21,591 --> 01:32:22,216
No!

1035
01:32:36,406 --> 01:32:37,703
You"re horrible!

1036
01:32:39,109 --> 01:32:42,010
l"d say we just
prevented some future crimes.

1037
01:32:42,312 --> 01:32:44,007
Don"t get Kaori involved in this!

1038
01:32:50,153 --> 01:32:52,644
She"s making a heat barrier for me.

1039
01:32:53,323 --> 01:32:55,348
Fight fire with fire, right?

1040
01:32:57,026 --> 01:33:00,291
I had been hoping you
wouldn"t try to burn me.

1041
01:33:01,030 --> 01:33:02,691
But I was wrong.

1042
01:33:05,902 --> 01:33:08,803
We can"t be friends after all.

1043
01:33:08,972 --> 01:33:11,099
How could we be?

1044
01:33:11,307 --> 01:33:13,775
You kill people for fun.

1045
01:33:14,177 --> 01:33:16,111
It"s the same with Hasegawa.

1046
01:33:16,212 --> 01:33:21,445
He started just killing
criminals, but he began to enjoy it.

1047
01:33:22,418 --> 01:33:24,784
You"II be a devil like him.

1048
01:33:25,388 --> 01:33:27,720
I thought we could be friends.

1049
01:33:28,525 --> 01:33:30,254
l"II execute you.

1050
01:33:31,094 --> 01:33:32,925
You"II be happierthat way.

1051
01:33:54,818 --> 01:33:55,614
Stop!

1052
01:34:04,294 --> 01:34:05,261
Junko...

1053
01:34:34,757 --> 01:34:35,553
Good job.

1054
01:35:50,934 --> 01:35:52,128
Kaori!

1055
01:36:02,612 --> 01:36:04,637
Forgive me, Junko.

1056
01:36:06,149 --> 01:36:08,413
I can"t change who I am...

1057
01:36:10,153 --> 01:36:13,520
I didn"t make Kaori say
I loved you by touching her.

1058
01:36:15,258 --> 01:36:17,158
I really loved you.

1059
01:36:17,694 --> 01:36:19,628
So desperately I could cry...

1060
01:36:38,414 --> 01:36:41,042
She"s unrelated to the video tape.

1061
01:36:42,452 --> 01:36:44,818
Do the police believe
such a ridiculous story?

1062
01:36:44,887 --> 01:36:48,880
I told you, she is just
a key witness at this point.

1063
01:36:48,958 --> 01:36:51,085
Then who"s the real killer?

1064
01:36:51,728 --> 01:36:54,356
How should I know?

1065
01:36:56,699 --> 01:36:59,099
She wants to be a plain girl.

1066
01:37:01,437 --> 01:37:03,462
We deciphered Asaba"s memo.

1067
01:37:03,539 --> 01:37:06,565
It"s the date of order from
somebody whose name starts with an H.

1068
01:37:06,976 --> 01:37:10,377
The mail address was the
same as the one you found.

1069
01:37:10,780 --> 01:37:13,374
So is it Hasegawa, the chief?

1070
01:37:14,050 --> 01:37:15,881
Don"t throw his name around.

1071
01:37:16,285 --> 01:37:18,412
There"s a fire at Amuseland,
several casualties reported.

1072
01:37:19,422 --> 01:37:23,085
It seems that Junko Aoki is
firing an unidentified weapon.

1073
01:37:23,359 --> 01:37:25,554
The park is being evacuated.

1074
01:37:27,196 --> 01:37:28,322
No!

1075
01:37:28,865 --> 01:37:30,332
Stupid, it"s a trick!

1076
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:31,458
A trap!

1077
01:37:31,868 --> 01:37:36,328
That man is planning
to pin his crimes on Junko!

1078
01:37:37,573 --> 01:37:38,631
What man?

1079
01:37:42,011 --> 01:37:44,605
Mr. Tada, wait, please!

1080
01:38:11,074 --> 01:38:13,042
Junko Aoki"s weapon is unknown...

1081
01:38:13,142 --> 01:38:16,134
However, its explosive power
is strong and extremely dangerous.

1082
01:38:16,679 --> 01:38:20,615
Even if you can"t verify she"s
in possession, you must shoot.

1083
01:38:20,917 --> 01:38:23,750
You mean we
should kill an unarmed girl?

1084
01:38:30,693 --> 01:38:31,387
Get ready!

1085
01:38:42,438 --> 01:38:43,462
That"s her!

1086
01:38:43,673 --> 01:38:45,140
She"s with a child.

1087
01:38:45,508 --> 01:38:46,270
Fire!

1088
01:38:47,243 --> 01:38:48,403
We can"t!

1089
01:38:49,679 --> 01:38:52,876
Aim at that girl nearthe gate!

1090
01:38:53,950 --> 01:38:54,939
Ready!

1091
01:39:01,958 --> 01:39:03,550
Please don"t shoot!

1092
01:39:04,093 --> 01:39:05,890
Spare this girl!

1093
01:39:07,063 --> 01:39:08,360
Hey, stop!

1094
01:39:08,431 --> 01:39:09,762
Come back!

1095
01:39:10,166 --> 01:39:11,224
Commence fire!

1096
01:39:16,372 --> 01:39:17,430
Come on!

1097
01:39:17,940 --> 01:39:18,804
Fire!

1098
01:39:22,111 --> 01:39:25,103
If you don"t shoot, I will!

1099
01:39:25,348 --> 01:39:26,212
Stop!

1100
01:39:27,250 --> 01:39:28,740
What are you doing?

1101
01:39:29,685 --> 01:39:30,913
Who do you think you are?

1102
01:39:30,987 --> 01:39:31,851
All right...

1103
01:39:32,355 --> 01:39:33,185
You bastard!

1104
01:39:37,927 --> 01:39:38,916
Mr. Tada!

1105
01:39:45,201 --> 01:39:46,133
What are you waiting for?

1106
01:39:46,202 --> 01:39:47,169
Shoot now!

1107
01:39:47,236 --> 01:39:48,601
She"s a serial killer!

1108
01:39:48,738 --> 01:39:49,932
Commence fire!

1109
01:40:04,487 --> 01:40:05,419
Get the hoses!

1110
01:40:05,955 --> 01:40:06,922
Fire!

1111
01:40:19,435 --> 01:40:21,528
Hey, let me pass!

1112
01:40:21,604 --> 01:40:22,468
Make way!

1113
01:40:32,114 --> 01:40:33,081
Ms. Ishizu!

1114
01:40:34,483 --> 01:40:35,507
Ms. Ishizu!

1115
01:40:37,086 --> 01:40:39,077
What the hell is going on?

1116
01:40:39,355 --> 01:40:40,549
Ms. Ishizu!

1117
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:46,050
Please, help Kaori!

1118
01:40:47,530 --> 01:40:49,464
We first need an ambulance...

1119
01:40:50,433 --> 01:40:51,491
Let"s go.

1120
01:40:52,635 --> 01:40:55,069
What about you?

1121
01:41:11,187 --> 01:41:14,418
It"s our last party, let"s enjoy it!

1122
01:41:27,536 --> 01:41:30,198
I arrested Junko Aoki!

1123
01:41:33,843 --> 01:41:35,105
Ishizu...

1124
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:40,171
l"II take herto the police station.

1125
01:41:40,283 --> 01:41:41,341
All right?

1126
01:41:43,619 --> 01:41:45,314
Don"t shoot!

1127
01:41:48,190 --> 01:41:49,851
Please, okay?

1128
01:41:53,462 --> 01:41:54,622
Now get in.

1129
01:41:58,567 --> 01:42:00,000
l"m not going to let you!

1130
01:42:06,275 --> 01:42:08,835
Can you burn me, Junko Aoki?

1131
01:42:16,218 --> 01:42:17,549
Kogure!

1132
01:42:20,222 --> 01:42:23,555
Junko, l"m sorry.

1133
01:42:24,660 --> 01:42:25,820
Mr. Tada.

1134
01:42:26,362 --> 01:42:29,160
Use fire, and he"II be burned.

1135
01:42:38,541 --> 01:42:39,599
Freeze!

1136
01:42:49,852 --> 01:42:51,513
That"s Masaki Kogure!

1137
01:42:53,222 --> 01:42:54,348
Don"t shoot the man!

1138
01:43:45,541 --> 01:43:46,303
He"s got a gun!

1139
01:43:58,654 --> 01:44:00,679
Bitch!

1140
01:46:53,896 --> 01:46:57,195
Thank you, Mr. Tada.

1141
01:46:59,468 --> 01:47:00,594
Don"t go!

1142
01:47:01,470 --> 01:47:02,368
Don"t leave me!

1143
01:47:04,173 --> 01:47:05,470
Good bye.

1144
01:47:07,142 --> 01:47:08,473
Good bye.

1145
01:48:19,314 --> 01:48:24,251
Junko Aoki, along with
Asaba and Kido, belonged to...

1146
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:27,717
...a group of left wing terrorists.

1147
01:48:28,090 --> 01:48:31,526
They made snuff films to raise funds.

1148
01:48:31,960 --> 01:48:37,125
Eight civilians were killed
by her bomb at the Amuseland.

1149
01:48:39,201 --> 01:48:42,500
Unfortunately, two
officers lost their lives as well...

1150
01:48:42,905 --> 01:48:46,170
Fujiki Yutaro, Hiro Sasaoka...

1151
01:48:46,241 --> 01:48:48,903
We found that they also
belonged to the organization.

1152
01:48:48,977 --> 01:48:51,241
They seemed to be
victims of infighting.

1153
01:48:52,915 --> 01:48:55,782
We, the Metropolitan
Police Department...

1154
01:48:56,151 --> 01:48:58,381
...made the decision to
shoot Junko Aoki at Amuseland.

1155
01:48:58,821 --> 01:49:02,814
Today, the incidents were filed as a
criminal case at the Public Prosecutors Office.

1156
01:49:08,664 --> 01:49:09,358
What the...

1157
01:49:28,917 --> 01:49:29,781
Sis?

1158
01:49:33,255 --> 01:49:34,347
Junko...

1159
01:49:42,598 --> 01:49:44,623
I thought Junko Aoki was dead...

1160
01:49:58,080 --> 01:50:00,173
You"re doing it, aren"t you?

1161
01:50:21,436 --> 01:50:22,460
Kaori?

1162
01:50:23,505 --> 01:50:24,995
Please come in.

1163
01:50:34,283 --> 01:50:36,410
This is the doll I talked about.

1164
01:50:40,155 --> 01:50:41,315
Thank you.

1165
01:50:49,164 --> 01:50:51,530
Goodbye, Sis.
