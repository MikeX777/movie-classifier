JUSTINE - PASSION CRUELDAS

2
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,076
No!

3
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,117
For that, in addition to the gate?

4
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,075
His father died in mortal sin. 
Therefore, it should not rest on the 
earth, john paul ii.

5
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:04,037
<u> And mom? It was his desire to 
always lay on the side of her 
husband.</u>

6
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,230
In the fire of hell.

7
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,029
Have you ever prayed for her father? 
So, it would be against the 
commandment.

8
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,993
<u> 'Your father has been hanged. <u> 
"Do it for mom.</u>

9
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,112
Please!"
- We have to pay for it.

10
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:32,060
Blessed is he whose sin is forgiven, 
the same one who is washed from sin.

11
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,118
Blessed is the man that the Lord has 
revealed it all.

12
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:41,197
- Blessed Be ...
- In The Hell-Fire ...

13
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,195
In the fire of hell. In the fire of 
hell.

14
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,199
In the fire of hell. Fire.

15
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,075
If I don't maintain my 
confidentiality with you, I'm going 
to have to pay for it, in my old age.

16
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:31,993
Holy Mary, Mother of God.... Holy 
Mary, Mother of God....

17
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,039
Blessed are you....

18
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,199
- Why is he killing himself?
- Never think of us do you want to 
say.

19
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,074
Why should he have thought of us? He 
was worried enough.

20
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,992
Pray, also, is not going to help you 
right now.

21
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,112
You have to take a break. Then go to 
bed.

22
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,198
- Do you believe in hell?" <u> Yes, I 
do believe in hell.

23
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,153
<u> "Do you think this is forever?" 
to be cursed? As possible.</u>

24
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,989
Forever and ever in hell?
- What do they teach us

25
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,997
Good and evil, heaven and hell.

26
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,034
<u> Perhaps they are all wrong. <u> 
No, I can't believe it.</u>

27
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,110
Sleep well.

28
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,154
God, please forgive me! Please, 
please forgive me!

29
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,152
I don't want to do something wrong. I 
know it's wrong, and what can I do

30
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,034
but, dear god, Forgive me, forgive me.

31
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,993
I don't want to do something wrong. I 
don't want to sin, oh my God.

32
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,118
<u> I - I don't want to do something 
wrong. <u> 'Why are you so afraid of 
it?</u>

33
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,197
All of their physical needs, but it 
is natural.

34
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,995
My God, deliver me from Sin. My God, 
I hold up.

35
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,158
I don't want to do this, dear God. I 
hold it back!!!

36
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,080
I ask you, dear God.... I asked God 
to help me, keep me away from it.

37
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,077
To save me from sin.

38
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,113
How is it that the Terror is always 
with great fear and trembling

39
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,998
when he or she is exposed to?

40
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,200
In the name of the father and of the 
son and of the Holy Spirit. Even 
jesus christ, amen.

41
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,117
I think I'm going to, but to pray for 
them.

42
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,196
Do you have any money?

43
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,079
Forty pounds, not a lot.

44
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,231
The creditors took everything.

45
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,074
- You are going to receive it? - 
There is a small consolation that I 
can give you.

46
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,994
You seem to be too endless to the 
sleeping sister.

47
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,198
I was able to do a lot today, night, 
sleep tight, Mother Superior.

48
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,031
- Justine, Juliette's Like to appear. 
Yes, mother superior.

49
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,196
Your Father will receive you now.

50
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,999
Are they both sinners?

51
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,199
<u> The older girl is, shall we say, 
normal. And the other girl?</u>

52
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:20,992
Justine is an extremely devout. 
Almost to the edge of the pride.

53
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,119
When you finally get out of this 
cruel prison Escape ...

54
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,140
She is the government. It is in This 
sacred place is a prison.

55
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,040
... and to the path of virtue, so 
that from the Saying to the guards of 
the prison,and

56
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,197
you are going to discover that it is 
full of thorns.

57
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,140
<u> The atheist esmaguem of the 
flowers.</u>
- Like it's supposed to be an unhappy 
one.

58
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,040
It would be so much better, with the 
power to swim, and, well, blooming.

59
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,118
The virtue of this is very low, it is 
to defend against the addiction.

60
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,996
- It seems very bitter. - nonsense! 
It seems to be extremely happy.

61
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,037
It's a simple law of nature.

62
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,198
That is, the corrupt, and to flourish 
the Pious to have to step out of it.

63
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,072
We do not, we are here for you to 
learn some of these things.

64
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,192
I've been with the sisters of the 
holy I have Just learned to 
masturbate.

65
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,199
"What is it, little one? What have 
you learned here?

66
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,077
Oh Justine, you are without hope.

67
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,114
Normally, it is expected of us that 
We have become the working horses to 
be born.

68
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,191
Slaves, to some merchant rich,

69
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,196
while you are enjoying all of the 
pleasures you are going to enjoy what 
nature has to offer.

70
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,070
And, with the other women.

71
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,113
The women are beautiful, and although 
her terror.

72
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,152
- How Can She.
- Listen to it.

73
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,080
To make such a wife, you need to know 
about you....

74
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,111
You have to get your should Be aware 
of the body.

75
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,197
You have to know that you are a woman.

76
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,232
You have to learn the sexual desires 
felt by men.

77
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,152
Justine, let's go!

78
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,198
God, you know, where There is no room 
for sin.

79
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,231
Since he is no longer allowed to be 
alone in a room of their own?

80
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,117
- Mother Superior asked you to. Why 
is that?

81
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,073
We don't have a value, even Obedient 
unto him, Juliette?

82
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,157
And the value of chastity.

83
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,152
I am a man, I could, just for one day

84
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,159
so, I'd like for this old man to Have 
his buzzadry up-to-date.

85
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,034
I hope you are old enough to 
understand it.

86
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,997
His father was a man of honour and 
virtue,and

87
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,036
unfortunately for Satan, for Sin, a 
mortal has been tempted.

88
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,039
The life of a man he is, He can do 
what he wants with it?"

89
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,070
Why do you want to see ...

90
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,114
Your heresy will be a landslide, 
Carrying the soul doesn't help 
either, my son."

91
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,994
The burden of guilt, he broke the 
heart of his mother.

92
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,157
It was more the shock of it, I found 
I could have hoped for.

93
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,238
Please, please let him speak.

94
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,074
You're over a Target, an orphan.

95
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,119
- And without a single penny.
- It doesn't leave anything?

96
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,200
After your outstanding debts have 
been paid off, there is Not a lot for 
you.

97
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,197
Only 20 pounds for each and every one.

98
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,994
<u> And the house?</u>
- Sold

99
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,157
We have to do this is to let a sacred 
place?

100
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,180
We are not a school, and no love.

101
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,113
The monastery is now over-crowded.

102
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,078
What is to become of us now?

103
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,999
Without a dowry, we're Going to wait 
for marriage.

104
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:43,199
For my son, and I'm going to try and 
get something up tomorrow.

105
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,070
Thank you.

106
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,192
Now go to the first one.

107
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,118
Your father and I are going to try to 
help you out.

108
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,180
Soon you will find that The price of 
love is too high.

109
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,190
Why, you ask?

110
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,158
Do we need to go to church and pray 
for your mom and dad?

111
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,037
This will assist in the Day to beat 
the dead.

112
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,238
- It is possible to visit the tomb?
- You did a little bit for us.

113
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,158
And I think that you're that she 
cried a lot and prayed.

114
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,113
The sin is not to know the secrets.

115
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,029
Hundreds and hundreds of hope for the 
tormented souls.

116
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,232
Waiting for the time when they are in 
our hearts

117
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,074
The thoughts and souls to come, and 
we drop triumphantly.

118
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,194
So we can use them to wreak havoc in 
hell, you have to share the fire for 
all of eternity.

119
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:42,077
Satan will lead you to the powerful, 
hot flames of lust,and

120
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:48,031
they are the same as the flames in 
the Fire, please.

121
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:54,195
And even in the shelter of your holy 
matrimony

122
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,076
Satan will cause you to be lazy, and 
it is not natural to seduce them with 
the crimes of the flesh.

123
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:10,117
The worse the path, the more secure 
that it takes to descent to the hell

124
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,114
that is the fun of it, this is a 
mortal sin.

125
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:21,151
That's why God, in his wrath, those 
also City of evil was destroyed.

126
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,070
As we are.

127
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,992
We are going to pray.

128
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,153
Now, we are going to pray. 
Together....

129
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:39,070
So, we, the race of the Satans of our 
god

and our black Fantasies, experience 
...

as in heaven, on earth, as well.

All of this happens in The world, it 
has a purpose, my son."

137

that, you could save even more agony.

Yes, I do. - You can join us over 
here?

This is made possible by the love of 
his Grief, my son."

148

What will be the fate of a poor 
orphan,

we find love, happiness, and joy

happy.

No!

162

Please!"

163
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,039
Get out! That's enough!"

164
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,150
Get out!

165

- Does it hurt? <u> I - I don't think 
so.

Go to hell!!! Where do all of you 
belong to me.

If She is sure, will her hymen is 
intact

to bring you a small fortune in 
London. <u> in London?

169
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,119
You can hardly believe that this will 
allow us to stay here, right?

170
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,198
But In London! What are we going to 
do here?

171
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,029
We've got youth, Health and beauty.

172

Have the men in London in order to 
pay the gold for it.

173
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,994
Just for this great privilege also to 
Enjoy being with us.

174
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,193
If you don't, at least, to find a 
two. What's going on here?

175
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,117
I also couldn't for the life of a 
prostitute.

176
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,236
Do you still have your Innocence and 
you are beautiful.

177
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,079
Would you be mad if you don't at 
least find a prince.

178
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,114
<u> Yes, to marry him. How can we 
expect it?</u>

179
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,113
if you have to call it a lost?

180
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,073
All of the men say that they are To 
worship him.

181
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,993
But they do care more about her 
pleasure, that in all the rest of it.

182
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,198
So I look at the practice, they will 
only be higher.

183
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:12,071
- You could live a deviant?
- We have no other choice, the first 
time had?

184
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:17,155
I don't think so. And we want to be 
able to something out.

185
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,197
There is no honour amongst men?

186
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,200
Very little of it. In the survey, it 
is not worth it after that.

187
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,994
So, now we are going to have.

188
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,077
Tomorrow, we're going to see what it 
is trying to do to us.

189
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,191
Please, please never let me leave.

190
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,236
You would have thought this to locate 
the holy places.

191
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,195
You will, of course, you have to go 
away.

192
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:59,040
when you? - On the fly! So, the 
Corruption does not spread.

193
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,073
It is not very difficult for us to 
send you out unprepared?

194
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,140
Mercy is only for those who receive 
it with gratitude.

195
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,994
For those of you who are generous and 
give of what they have.

<b>: Our 40-pound. To 40, pounds? - 
This is the Money that our father 
left to us.</b>

197
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,192
You must do this for food and Logis, 
and it's not good enough.

198
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,153
You will be our front door to put on 
without a penny?

199
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,113
Perhaps it was his lordship with the 
rewards of the bishop,

200
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,113
when we talk about corruption, you 
tell it here on the website.

201
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,193
It would be, you liar, we're going to 
jail.

00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,999
But first he would be Flogged.

The first time had got up traces of 
Her rape.

204
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,992
This is proof that she is a "whore".

205
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,194
Sister Claire has a birthmark in a 
Place where you'll never find out.

206
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,191
Do you think it is to stand on a mark?

207
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:51,034
It's probably going to get out of 
Fear and torture to immediately make 
a confession.

208
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,998
The first time had!

209
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,112
So they took it anyway.

210

- yes -<b> - Where will you be?

211
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,153
We have an aunt in London, and it's 
going to take care of us.

212
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,193
You're supposed to be a God, so I 
thank you and I love you for her aunt.

213
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,118
It will be easy for us to get closer 
to her, to love her, because she is 
more wealthy than we are.

214
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,230
The kind that gets you

215
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,038
you will, without a doubt, the kind 
of you deserve.

216

If you are in need of a getaway, you 
will find that the door is open?

217
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,039
Thank you very much. - We want to be 
a stone on the grave.

00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:03,156
<u> At least for the mother.</u>
- By her or by her as well?

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:09,075
The virtue may not go far in this 
world-to Travel without any vanity as 
a guest.

<u> The car is not going to work, we 
can't. Good-Bye Father....</u>

221
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,995
You have been lied to before! We have 
but no one's aunt in London.

222
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,112
She gets a Noble support.

<b>, She is more happy than she had 
expected to have. But she is not 
married.</b>

224
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,152
Marriage offers these Women like we 
are nothing.

225
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,192
Do you want to do this? to live as 
She?

226
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,197
I've already told you, we don't have 
a choice.

227
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,039
We have to see that we make the best 
of it.

228
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,232
- Where are we going to spend the 
night?
- In a b & b close to the Beckshut.

229
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,151
Of course, it's only if you don't 
stop us.

230
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,113
- is stopping us? The thieves, the 
robbers, in a heist.

231
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,180
Unfortunately, Beckshut has a bad 
Reputation. There are so many bad 
guys in there.

232
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,159
I don't think that we are scared of 
an officer to protect yourself.

233
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,074
We don't know each other or know each 
other before?

234
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,992
We've got children, you've played a 
game.

235
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,033
When the carriage arrived, and we 
tried to guess the occupations of the 
passengers.

236
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,999
And put it in with an officer and we 
are mostly on the right side.

<u> 'And what was your next choice? 
<b>,- A lender of money."</u>

238
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,113
And then, a nun, a Monk or a priest.

239
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,113
<u> And then what? A "whore".</u>

240
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,992
We're going to give you a half To 
take time off from work.

241
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,180
I know that it's going to be a little 
too much time

242
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,113
but I'm afraid the horse has to take 
a break for a little bit.

243
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,997
Have you actually said to the 
prostitute?

244
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,999
Along with the education of my 
parents, and the lack of 
opportunities for

I would never have said anything like 
this before.

And now, here they are, with their 
penchant for releasing a free rein?

247
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:47,070
- There will be opportunities in 
London, uk.

And you have to admire him for the 
sake of it? The one virtue that is 
highly praised.

250
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,038
But it's that fear that leads you to 
the path of duty.

251
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,236
You are going to need the holy ghost 
to protect you.

Unfortunately, it will be dark before 
we get to the hotel.

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,195
Go ahead, mix it up!

312
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:08,160
Sophie, go for it. my God, what's 
going on here?"

313
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,152
This house is yours, sir.

314
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,072
It's a free house, and my girls are 
all very skilled.

315
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,113
But the whip and the Enema is a bit 
more expensive.

316
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,238
You are going to figure this out. I'm 
quite sure.

317
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,072
Don't worry, just keep going.

318
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,197
Come on, what's going on? Smile all 
the way.

319
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,036
<u> And, Is there, ma'am. Is clearly 
felt by all of us.</u>

320
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,152
If you have a fear of the test is 
evidence of guilt?

321
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,075
It's the lack of experience and his 
modesty and a natural,

322
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:04,990
those who have left to come back. - 
Then what? We'll find out soon 
enough, right?

323
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:09,996
So. You just need to of all my To 
keep up with the experience. This is, 
of course?

324
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:14,080
It is an economic place to stay. Open 
to me, and fair with each other.

325
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,073
And it's a little deceptive to their 
men.

326
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,038
Come on in, darlin'.

327
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,232
In ten years, and from now on, you 
you you you you you you you you you 
have your own apartment.

328
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:31,034
With a silver mirror in front of you 
and a maid behind you.

329
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,118
The art of the erotic, which they are 
to be taught in a

330
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:38,074
it allows you to also earn the way 
you want.

331
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:46,077
<u> - , Then. How much money do you 
have? Less than 40 pounds to put 
together, ma'am.</u>

332
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,118
A young girl, well-behaved, you must 
avoid the possession of the money.

333
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,231
It just brings up bad thoughts.

334
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,153
Man is the only currency in which A 
girl is sensible, you need.

335
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,032
And believe me, my love."

336
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,197
And you are only allowed a man to 
Measure out the wallet from him.

337
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,152
Never succumbing to the temptation of 
others to look For valuables in your 
pants.

338
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,157
Ever. Do you listen to?

339
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,994
<u> 'And that is enough. We're going 
to eat.</u>
- We ate on the way here."

340
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,993
I am very much looking forward to 
being with to get to my class.

341
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:21,033
"Oh, what are these treasures? you 
brought me there, Pauline.

342
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,992
Let's go look for Him.

343
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,076
Come away with me.

344
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:33,033
He is a little truth in them. His 
ways are the best

345
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:37,199
but when the mind has been dealt 
with, of course, he wasn't there.

346
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,113
Yes, it is a very hard work to make 
it liveable.

347
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,038
Why are you bothering, then?

348
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,039
You will be able to do this will soon 
see you my love.

349
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,073
There are women and men who are one 
would Pay a fortune for it

350
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,112
for the fun of it.

351
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:55,074
It is free for you. It will help with 
their lessons, and that's important 
to you.

352
00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:00,076
It is not gregarious, but he spits 
out like a waterfall.

353
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,070
We will be there.

354
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:36,118
<u> Also what? Oh, no. No, no, no, 
not Me".</u>

355
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,232
No, Not Me". No, Not Me".

356
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,197
Come On In, George.

357
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,193
I'm asking you, George. Stop right 
now with this game. I have a job for 
you.

358
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,232
Come on in, come on in. Let's go, go, 
go.

359
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,232
You work, you work.

360
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,037
And it was so cool.

361
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:31,193
Our sex never serves nature as well 
as if he had to go a whoring.

362
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,036
Do you understand me?

363
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:39,076
The small one is still young, and 
George. So please be careful.

364
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,994
Leave it up to her. She is looking 
forward enough.

365
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,112
Pull your pants down, and then push 
the shirt under the vest.

366
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,197
Well, you see, what I told you?

367
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,074
It is completely up to you, Available 
to you, my love."

368
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:58,035
Be sure to hold it with me. It's not 
going to break down.

369
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,119
Well, as you can see, the little 
Monster is already swelling.

370
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,112
Her sweet spot.

371
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,032
How well does it do this to you, 
right?

372
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,072
You see It grows and it grows.

373
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,039
Don't just stand there when you step, 
do something!

374
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,231
Then, I'd be happy if I did you would 
beat his ass.

375
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,198
- You're supposed to kiss it, you 
stupid idiot!!
- You're supposed to kiss it, you 
stupid idiot!!

376
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,072
This is awesome!!

377
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,113
- Should I?
- Go to the front.

378
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,040
Here are all those balls of fleshy, 
called the breast, the breasts

379
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,060
or, as George so fondly expressed, 
tits,

380
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,993
it can be very beneficial to be used.

381
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:00,154
Your lover always has to keep in 
mind. And then he kisses her

382
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:04,029
cuddle up to or play with them.

383
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:07,118
It may also be a link between the 
Place of those cute little fuzz balls.

384
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:13,032
Many of the men are going through a 
hard time will make you feel happy 
when you squeeze it.

385
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,060
We're going to show it to her. She 
wants to learn something new.

386
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,072
You can pet him with it.

387
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,198
You can tighten it so that your 
juices will flow.

388
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,072
George!

389
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,196
I think that's enough of that. The 
little boy is still too early for me 
to be otherwise.

390
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,198
You're spoiling it for the whole 
lesson. You may now talk about the a 
member.

391
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,153
- As long as George is on the mend, 
She. Yes, ma'am.

392
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,237
After that, a woman for the first 
time, he was taken in by a man

393
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,038
she will always be happy To give you 
pleasure. George?

394
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:51,159
There are other avenues where a man 
can seek comfort and pleasure.

395
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:03,200
Oh My God! I mean Goodness! Oh My God!

396
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:12,237
I'm about to come! I Will Come And 
See. I'm coming in! I'm coming in!

397
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,156
It was very fast.

398
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,111
It's my own fault. I allowed him to.

399
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,192
This is just outrageous.

400
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:29,116
<u> These dots right here, why are 
you oh ma'am? They contain the 
sperm.</u>

401
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,151
It has more to do with the medicine 
and make it as love.

402
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,034
A pretty girl like you shouldn't have 
to worry about it.

403
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,151
You have to learn with the Eyes to 
see.

404
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,029
Do you want to treat it? To give 
pleasure?

405
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,113
Happy. Lust! Lust! Happy.

406
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,994
So, take it in your mouth right now. 
Come on.

407
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,993
You can see how this idiot is out.

408
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:01,154
No woman ever diplomatic, would be 
her husband, would never refuse the 
pleasure.

409
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,035
The league-ever-after for her. 
For-ever.

410
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,197
Unbelievable, how fast he is learning.

411
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:13,192
Now double your efforts. Go ahead and 
triple it!

412
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:19,156
It. Oh, wait. Keep calm and don't 
move! Very quiet!

413
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,034
It does not make sense to the idiot, 
it will come.

414
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,199
I'm drowning! "Oh, God, I'm drowning!

415
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,039
Don't worry, my little one. Continues 
to to immediately.

416
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,196
What is it about? Do you get freaked 
out?

417
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,197
Are you afraid of me, Justine?

418
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,197
But you don't like it in this house, 
right?

419
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:25,115
I can't stand to look at it as 
Juliette, as she is well.

420
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:31,031
<u> -- But I don't dare to speak out. 
<b>, She has chosen to in this 
life.</u>

421
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:35,040
And it was on this wise. It must be 
delightful to be loved, one day

422
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:39,199
a doctor on call, a noble, a seller 
and a person.

423
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:43,033
But the goal in this way also result 
in a violation of any religion.

424
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:47,060
Religion is merely the tyranny which 
The rich do to the poor house.

425
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:51,199
<u> - , To humiliate her.</u>
- It is my only consolation.

426
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,071
Religion is a disease that must be 
cured.

427
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:59,036
A prejudice which has been created to 
keep the people chained.

428
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,071
Where will you be if you get out of 
here?

429
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,220
I'm going to get a job as like a 
waitress.

430
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,118
No husband is going to take you.

431
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,152
You are expected to be able to do you 
a Bed and meals are available

432
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,192
and it does not ask for anything 
other than washing clothes?

433
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,119
Why is it impossible for you to be a 
woman is decent?

434
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,072
A good woman is a hidden treasure.

435
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,113
And that's because it is, Someone 
forgot to dig them out.

436
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:26,232
Should you change your mind? and then 
it comes to me, yes?

437
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,037
I have an appointment right now.

438
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,072
Mother Mia!

439
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:56,035
He's an idiot, a rare Dog. A dog is a 
stupid regulation.

440
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,998
Power.

441
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,116
Do you have any money?

442
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:12,118
<u> Where is Justine? The first time 
had.</u>

443
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,036
The first time had!

444
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,038
The first time had!

445
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:41,080
Then let it go. She has the right to 
do so.

446
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,153
Then, my lord, you are the young man, 
to find that the cuticle is 
completely intact.

447
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,197
I can guarantee you that. To 
investigate this, take your time.

448
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,191
Since when do I have to cheat a 
suspicion, madame?

449
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:08,160
It is very nice. And The First Time 
Had?
- This is a child, however.

450
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,999
All of the girls are born into this 
life, and mine as well.

451
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,078
But only a few are really lucky, and 
good common sense

452
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:18,074
to see the time. You may believe me, 
my dear.

453
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:24,238
Come on girl! Come on, get out! Get 
out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get 
out!

454
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,033
That's enough of that. I've said it 
out!

455
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:33,036
Or, do you have the gold for the 
offer? go over your landlord? Then 
get out!

456
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,117
Why did you move all Herzblatt.

457
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:40,029
It's time for fun and play, but now...

458
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:43,994
So, your stallion is ready to jump 
into the race for the price.

459
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,071
"Hey, George, how are you?

460
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:13,036
Girls, you can keep George awake. 
He'll have to go through your 
landlord.

461
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,079
- If it is to take advantage of the 
totally.
- With great pleasure.

462
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:19,112
So what are you to me, George, at the 
helm.

463
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,232
I'm going to take care of that little 
bitch in Obedience to his lordship.

464
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,153
<u> The light has to be lit? <u> 
yes</u>

465
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,038
I want to see you....

466
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,038
Well, to hell with it.

467
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,032
I can't breathe!

468
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:44,030
"What's she doing in there? Allow me 
to tell you to be happy!

469
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:59,032
I don't think I can do it, it's just 
too much! I'll ask you! No! No!

470
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,116
This is not a ...

471
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:20,234
<u> "Yes," You said your Door would 
always be open.</u>

472
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:26,074
My maid is in for A night that has 
already passed. I do not live alone.

473
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,119
So, maybe I could go to his house, A 
butler, if you tell me where she 
lives.

474
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,076
Sign in.

475
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:51,193
- Are you hungry? <u> Yes, very much 
so. It can be felt.

476
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,150
So, you should eat.

477
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,999
- I'm going to take off his clothes. 
Thank you.

478
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:26,074
- And you and your sister? She has 
decided to live in London, uk.

479
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:45,080
You ought to know, lord, that I was 
forced to steal it.

480
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,152
A piece of jewelry that I sell, I 
have to be able to go back.

481
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,190
Of your aunt?

482
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:59,152
And her lovely sister has chosen the 
path to hell?

483
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,195
The law is unjust.

484
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:21,080
If it's a jewel in silver offers you 
a chance to survive

485
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,157
so you have to pick it up.

486
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:28,040
It is the first law of Nature and of 
God

487
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:32,000
this means of survival. At the age of 
just

488
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:35,078
you can change the position of 
representing what the theft, it serves

489
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,032
to distribute the wealth more evenly.

490
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:42,156
You mean to tell me that Madame 
Laronde was just as guilty because 
she was in possession of the jewelry?

491
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:45,989
Of course, it's because she's 
admitted that it has that it has been 
stolen.

492
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:54,152
It is difficult to reconcile with 
other properties. if you don't have 
anything else.

493
00:51:54,240 --> 00:52:00,032
God will not punish you, because you 
have tried them, their existence is

494
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,117
and to preserve their innocence.

495
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,152
What would happen to you, now you 
have it the first time had?

496
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:09,152
I'm going to have to accept a job as 
a domestic worker accepts the

497
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,157
what I want to tell you preserve the 
same ...

498
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:18,155
... and maybe you can conclude a good 
marriage.

499
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:25,115
It is possible that there are good 
marriages, the first time had. I just 
don't know any of them.

500
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:28,153
And if it's nature you want would 
have to be chaste,

501
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,192
we did not, we would have been born 
naked.

502
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:35,193
For others it is an invention that 
you Use of women, to bring them about.

503
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:38,233
For others it is that Start of 
corruption.

504
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,191
Results! Corruption.

505
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:51,032
<u> "Thank you for your mercy, 
sir."</u>
- a mercy.

506
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,152
I'm so tired.

507
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:31,117
Mercy is the bane of Civilization, 
you know that, right?

508
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:38,060
It encourages people with no talent 
and no ability to work,

509
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,993
however, the longer you live, as they 
should be.

510
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:47,035
And it's a challenge for those of you 
who are able to be out of your lazy

511
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:49,993
and communities in order to 
contribute to the world.

512
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:52,993
You certainly can't Give you a 
penalty for sin.

513
00:53:56,040 --> 00:54:00,080
It's such a simple thing, more than 
the other to turn around.

514
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,992
Again, thank you, sir."

515
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,157
If you have a word of Mercy, don't 
like,

516
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,193
so, I thank you for Your kindness.

517
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:40,154
We would love for our adorable acts 
that are worthy of many times put to 
shame,

518
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:44,991
if the world is to be able to do 
that, To see the reasons behind it.

519
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:02,114
I don't want to do something wrong. o 
lord, please Save me from this 
temptation.

520
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:08,037
Prior to the devil in my body and 
want to learn. Oh, god.

521
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:31,112
Lord, I hold up.

522
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:16,240
Satan will transform into the 
powerful, hot flames of lust,and

523
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:22,120
they are the same as the flames of 
Hell to load.

524
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,150
No!

525
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,999
Go for it, go for it. have you found 
anything yet?"

526
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,231
I don't know. now don't let even a 
ring.

527
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,151
What the hell are You here, Pearce?

528
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,119
Take her to the doctor, but before 
you do, you take care of the gold, 
yes?

529
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:57,114
Come on, get out of here. We'll be At 
the house to see what it goes for 
us....

530
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:59,994
Now, if you hurry up, you are already 
doing it.

531
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:05,151
We can't do this here all night long.

532
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:26,032
It is, and suddenly it was over and 
ran to the cemetery.

533
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:29,198
Take a little bit of water, and 
Pearce. And tell the others that they 
should stay away from.

534
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:41,120
A nice hot shower and some sleep and 
everything will be all right again.

535
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:48,039
You can no longer father John to 
blame for that.

536
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,151
Bring to life with your beauty, you 
are a saint.

537
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:52,232
You make me do it? Primitive 
ceremonies.

538
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,072
Above all else, their parents are to 
blame because they didn't abide in 
the house.

539
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:00,120
<u> I - I'm not a parent.</u>
- entirely on his own in the world, 
is it?

540
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:06,109
<u> "I have a younger sister, 
Juliette. <u> "'Here? in London, 
uk.</u>

541
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,071
So, get out, and I'm going to help 
you out.

542
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,117
I want to see if I'm on to You, you 
can find a dress.

543
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:17,231
So you start off with a bite to eat 
and a warm bed.

544
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,032
So, right here.

545
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:30,073
I'm going to take care of it, if it 
happens, the News about your Father, 
gives you.

<b>, And if he is dead, now what?</b>
- Now, sleep, my child.

547
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:36,993
You are safe as long as you're with 
the old man, Bonnie.

548
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:48,112
And it's a maiden as well.

549
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:51,079
How much time has passed since then, 
you want to be a virgin?

550
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,034
- What's going on here? She broke up 
with him.

551
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:02,080
Well, that's it. It is rather, very 
hard to believe.

552
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:09,119
I was so full of you that I almost 
didn't want to leave.

553
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:12,073
All of them believe that they got the 
Crooks thrown from the roof.

554
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,197
She has not stolen anything.

555
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:18,989
But, their clothes no longer have to 
give them a clue.

556
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:22,079
"Hey, wait a minute! I would imagine

557
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:25,020

<u> You're right. <u> It would not be 
a bad thing.</u>

01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:47,114
<u> "Is he dead? You are ostracized, 
and they are sought-after for his 
murder.</u>

561
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:49,152
I'm so very sorry, my dear.

562
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:54,040
This is the power and the fragility 
of human feelings.

563
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:56,060
<u> They brought to the hangman's 
noose.</u>
- For the hangman's noose?

564
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:58,197
It is always a crime, when you kill 
one of them.

565
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,037
God is my judge, I have none of the 
crime that has been committed.

566
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:04,118
You have to convince them that the 
poor are always to blame.

567
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:10,155
- Is there anything I can do? stay 
with us, we will, and then you are on 
the safe side.

- and other things.

569
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,117
A beautiful girl is always on the 
edge.

570
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:20,996
I would rather have a force a hundred 
times before committing such a crime.

571
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:24,118
"Oh my God, you are very polite.

572
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:27,153
You seem to be just as sincere, just 
as sincere, just as if you had never 
been.

573
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:30,113
I have my hopes up To see the sky, 
you never give up.

574
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:33,193
Listen to the rich, time to open up 
your purses

and we are a little bit of humanity

decency.

If you join us, and bring us profit

578
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:49,029

of Years to make a fortune.

01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:40,077
I think it Was a foolish choice.

620
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:46,077
You don't would prefer to be a 
Mistress as a whore?

621
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,117

worried about him.

<u> "Do you think she's in the house?

A beauty in Justine was supposed to 
be so easy to find in a small town.

624
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:42,231
I'm going to join you tomorrow to 
lead the horse up there.

That's okay. The weather up here. 
Let's go there now. Come on. Come on.

What's wrong with you?"

630
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:01,077
You're probably going to go up the 
full Moon of the head, is it?

631
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:07,118
Stop it!!! Stop it!!! What was I to

Leave it to me! Please!" "You must 
trust me, and I will protect you from

Quick! Nothing like it!!! Come on. 
That's it! "Come!"

Yes, this is a good thing. Be sure to 
secure it!

It is not meant to escape! I Hope 
that you will be tied down well 
enough.

645
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:02,152
She is always able to give us a few 
to bring a good reward.

646
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:04,999
And, as a lure, she's going to, we 
also will be useful to you.

647
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:03,194
Stop it! It's a trap! Thieves!

648
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:09,180
- Get out of here! Get out of here!
- We're going to make it to go with 
the cold!

her!" Kill them all!

We are all about! Yes, this is a good 
thing!

You read that right. To make it all 
ready to go! No one can escape!

652
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:45,060
Go for it, go for it. Search for all 
of them.

653
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:48,073
At this time, it will be worth it. 
They smell the money.

654
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:49,190
Come on in!

655
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:57,995
- Here it is! - oh, wait. My wallet 
is nothing compared to what you get

656
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,191
If you will spare my life.
- Why should we spare your life?

657
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:03,074
- And then later testify against 
us.... <u> "My word, it is guaranteed 
to be safe.

01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:05,197

We're going to talk about this then 
proceed.

Why, hold it up and take it away!

663
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:21,155
Go for it, go for it. Don't be so 
gentle with him.

01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:10,993
Let it lie there. It will not survive 
any way.

667
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,157
The prey of evil has been worth it.

668
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:24,113
As long as you have the killer also, 
Watch for thieves

669
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:27,034
it doesn't make sense To leave any 
witnesses.

670
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:37,072
You are now one of us.

671
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:41,995
I think we should kill him.
- What kind of parent is this?

672

after one or two killings that he did 
not tell us any more.

<u> "I Agree, Brough? According to? 
That's okay.</u>

like me, the question, then it seems 
to die.</u>

680
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:17,140
Is there a safe way to determine 
whether a man is alive at the time.

681

The first time had! The first time 
had! Justine is going to bring it 
back to life.

01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:25,240
She's going to wake up her cousin to 
prove to him that he is still alive.

doesn't feel it?"

It's weird to preserve it, which she 
promptly gave up
