1
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,292
Mom.

2
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,633
Hello, my loves.

3
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,653
Hello.

4
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,932
- Is it you, Mom?
- I said I'd be back.

5
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,952
You're the prettiest mom.

6
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,708
Oh, thank you.

7
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,767
- Leaving already?
- I'm going out.

8
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,072
You're going out at night?

9
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,593
Exclusively at night.

10
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,352
I just came by for a kiss.

11
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,458
Mom, don't go.

12
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,542
- We've no food.
- I can't stay with that up there.

13
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,453
We've no money.

14
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,737
My love!

15
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,843
Mommy will be back, darling.

16
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,742
Is that all there is?

17
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,003
We could've gone on credit.

18
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,377
That's nonsense.

19
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,067
You think Mom will return?

20
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,812
With your mother, we never know.

21
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,323
I'm sure she'll come back.

22
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,436
At ten, she'll be back...

23
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,740
One, two, three...

24
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,190
four, five, six...

25
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,486
Marlene Dietrich had hollow cheeks.

26
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,517
Listen. Do you want to know why?

27
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,430
Because she had her molars
and wisdom teeth removed.

28
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,467
I'm going to be
like Marlene Dietrich.

29
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,910
That way we'll both eat
only marble cake dipped in milk.

30
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,962
- No, stop.
- Come on, yes.

31
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,406
- Stop, Marlene Dietrich.
- Go on.

32
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,761
- My love!
- It's Marlene.

33
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,588
It's Mom.

34
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,342
Hello, Hanna.

35
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,112
Thanks for the money.

36
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,257
Don't touch that.

37
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,771
It's valuable.

38
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,868
This is your gift.

39
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,328
And this...

40
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,852
is my gift.

41
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,313
What's wrong?

42
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,033
Who gave you all that?

43
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,916
You're too old for photography.

44
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,037
Oh, stop. My head hurts.

45
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,233
Are you in any trouble?

46
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,701
I won't tell you
since I can't talk to anyone here.

47
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,716
If your feet hurt, sit down.

48
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,388
You're irritating me.

49
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,618
Thank you.

50
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,731
Go and criticize her.
She's out relaxing,

51
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,940
sipping on cocktails
with her billionaire lovers.

52
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,353
If only you worked.

53
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,011
As if expression through images
wasn't work.

54
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,492
It's the most beautiful,
sacred thing.

55
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,228
I'm going to make it.

56
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,617
I'll make it.

57
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,793
- Leave me.
- Why not?

58
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,066
Why? Why can't I exist, too?
I'm human, not a dog.

59
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,352
That's not nice. At all.

60
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,147
I'm scared of coming here.

61
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,341
I hardly dare coming.
I know you'll torment me.

62
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,236
It takes a day to recover,
like being hammered on the head.

63
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,908
She wrote to me.

64
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,666
I'd just like you to respond to her.

65
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,877
Why do you hang
my mother's portrait up?

66
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,589
You forget you threw
my mother out when she was...

67
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,126
pregnant at 1 5.

68
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,227
Don't tell me you've forgotten.

69
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,473
Violetta, listen.

70
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,171
Someone was nasty to Grandma
when she was young.

71
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,316
When she was very attractive.

72
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,137
She blames me now.

73
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,378
Right, Grandma? No?

74
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,948
Am I wrong or right?

75
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,532
Please, leave the child
out of all this.

76
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,716
Let's be calm. Everything's fine.

77
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,331
Besides, she's mine.

78
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,830
Then why did you leave
the two of us alone for so long?

79
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,076
For all these months. Why? Why?

80
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,522
Stop, Grandma. Get up.

81
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,377
Get up, Grandma.

82
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,612
Enough is enough.

83
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,652
If it's like that,
I'll do what she did.

84
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,313
I'm never coming back.

85
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,337
There's no reason to.

86
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,942
Oh, Mom!

87
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,827
My darling.

88
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,032
Will you come up with me?

89
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,907
- Up there?
- Yes.

90
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,402
Oh dear. My crummy paintings.

91
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,996
I'm done with those.
Hasta la vista.

92
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,098
Come on.

93
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,652
Come in.

94
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,673
Leave your bag there.

95
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,586
And take off your skates.

96
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,418
Come here.

97
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,772
Sit down.

98
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,012
You haven't come here
in a long time.

99
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,521
We'll have to make up
for lost time.

100
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,646
- How about some halva and fruit?
- Sure.

101
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,212
I ate that in Constanta
when I was little.

102
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,428
Undo your plaits.

103
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,060
You should show your lovely hair.
Don't you think?.

104
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,163
- Do you like it?
- A lot.

105
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,029
You were too young for me
to say anything before.

106
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,765
But, you know, I take pictures now.

107
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,121
- When I don't see you?
- Yes.

108
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,287
- Would you like to pose for me?
- Yes.

109
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,452
Lift your arms.

110
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,747
Oh no, don't smile.

111
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,287
Smiles are stupid.
They're for weddings.

112
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,657
Direct your gaze...

113
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,956
Look at me. As if looking at Hell.

114
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,482
There. Turn your face a bit.

115
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,532
That's it...

116
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,219
Like this.

117
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,658
That's it.

118
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,133
Lie on the floor.

119
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,992
Like an offering, see...

120
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,236
More effort.
Don't you want to go on?

121
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,476
- Yes, I do.
- Well, then?

122
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,005
Now, arch backward. Like this.

123
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,673
Very far back, then...

124
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,052
Like that.

125
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,965
And your hand on your forehead.

126
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,428
Like so. Your fingers

127
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,187
spread on your forehead.

128
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,619
Very good.

129
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,892
Ok, we're finished.

130
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,726
Go downstairs. Grandma's waiting.

131
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,443
Don't tell Grandma. Promise?

132
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,716
It's between us.
She wouldn't get it.

133
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,538
We agree, right?

134
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,153
I won't say a word, Mom.

135
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,868
Promise.

136
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,666
Simmer down! Adele!

137
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,252
Violetta!

138
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,993
Hand in your copies.

139
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,692
Violetta!

140
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,412
Violetta!

141
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,306
Grandma overdressed you again.

142
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,846
She's always scared
of who knows what.

143
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,316
- Aren't you glad to see me?
- Yes.

144
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,933
Go home.

145
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,548
She's coming with me.

146
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,802
Are you going
to the parent meeting?

147
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,268
Don't ask that of me.

148
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,188
The other parents will.

149
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,163
They're bored. They're hicks.

150
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,102
- What are hicks?
- People with nothing to offer.

151
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,457
We've better to do.

152
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,636
You'll no longer dress her.

153
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,372
Put this on.

154
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,188
- Is it for me?
- Yes.

155
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,811
You're not actually
dressing her in that get-up?

156
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,451
What get-up?
I don't see any get-up.

157
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,801
It's a very pretty lace dress.

158
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,297
Handmade.

159
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,697
Everyone's looking.

160
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,536
That's why it was made.
So she'd be looked at.

161
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,851
Why wouldn't they?

162
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,257
- They'll criticize.
- There's no harm.

163
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,172
Sheesh, we're having fun, right?

164
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,048
Yes.

165
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,220
Look! She's very happy
and pretty in her dress. See!

166
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,833
- Right?
- Yes.

167
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,220
Grandma thinks we'll die
if we laugh. Watch me laugh.

168
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,193
Come on, let's go.

169
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,381
Violetta, you're the prettiest girl
in the world.

170
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,907
My girl is beautiful.

171
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,322
I dreamt of you both last night.

172
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,887
You were much older, Violetta.

173
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:37,300
If I'd seen you the way you are,
it would've been more interesting.

174
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,036
- What time is your flight?
- 9 pm...

175
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:49,922
for Oslo.

176
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,291
I'm coming, too.

177
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,651
Not with your girl.

178
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,601
Take her to your grandmother's.

179
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,366
Oh, Ernie!
Why is it so complicated?

180
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,232
I've too much anxiety.

181
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,547
Relax, Hanna. You're hysterical.

182
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,291
It's Grandma. She'll drive me crazy.

183
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,706
Isn't it about time
to stop thinking of Grandma?

184
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,116
Yes. Let me show you my work.

185
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,972
What work?.

186
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,948
I take pictures.

187
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,102
Let's have a look.

188
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,891
I took them with
the camera you gave me.

189
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,388
What do you think?.

190
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,562
Better than your crummy paintings.

191
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,067
Bravo, Hanna.

192
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,738
Bravo.

193
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,287
- For you, her and Grandma.
- Thanks.

194
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,626
And so you can get some
decent photos developed.

195
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,440
Did you see how my women
are enchanting and intoxicating?

196
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,108
With heavy breasts...

197
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,492
...and hair like Arabian drapes.
- Yes.

198
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,411
Their rumps are...

199
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,017
splendid!

200
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,218
Yes.

201
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,747
It's exceptional, Hanna.

202
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,712
I want you to continue.

203
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,378
Stop it.

204
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,698
Stop it.

205
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,091
Stop! Can't you see I'm choking?

206
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,913
Look what she's done!

207
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,802
- Why did you do that?
- Do what?

208
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,126
Violetta! Violetta!

209
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,036
Why did you smear his painting?

210
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,747
I didn't do it on purpose.

211
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,626
Oh, come now.

212
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,427
Is Ernie your boyfriend?

213
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,267
No, not really.

214
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,547
Your mother is a physiophobe.
End of story.

215
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,061
Physiophobia
is claustrophobia of the flesh.

216
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,507
Picture yourself in a lift

217
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,211
going up, up, up.
It's full of people and...

218
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,066
you can't get away and...

219
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,632
and you can't take it anymore.

220
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,892
What about Dad?

221
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,372
Listen, darling.

222
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:04,179
You need to know that fathers
are a major handicap of nature, ok?.

223
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,406
Dear God,
please don't let anything happen

224
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,381
to my girls, especially Violetta.

225
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,027
Watch over her heart and her soul.

226
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,301
Keep evil away from her.

227
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,766
Oh Lord, I'm begging you.

228
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,276
It's my very own television.

229
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,947
Get ready.
I'm just checking my light meter.

230
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,407
Is this good, Mom?
Is the pose ok?.

231
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,392
Yes, it's interesting.

232
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,086
Do you know who you look like?
It's crazy.

233
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,073
Like Shirley Temple.

234
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,147
I know you don't know her.

235
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,352
Who is Shirley Temple?

236
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,400
Shirley Temple was a little girl
who sang and danced like you.

237
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,147
She looked a lot like you.

238
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,172
She was a little girl
from Hollywood!

239
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,017
Do you want... Here...

240
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,292
More lipstick.

241
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,018
Blood red.

242
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,037
The little mouth.

243
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,306
You're Shirley Temple,
violet vendor in the stars, ok?.

244
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,817
Yes, ok.

245
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,067
You'll put this on.

246
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,618
I don't want to.

247
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,427
But you can be a prima donna.

248
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,777
No...

249
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,147
I want this.

250
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,437
Ok, can you act like an enchantress?

251
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,636
Look here. How do the stars do it?

252
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,658
Very good.

253
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,337
It's exactly that.

254
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,967
You can work it.
I don't know how,

255
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,977
but you work it.

256
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,340
Oh, very pretty!
The eyelids down. Very pretty.

257
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,356
Ok. Let me introduce you to...

258
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,292
a friend.

259
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,652
The Bald Narrator.

260
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,571
He's appalling!

261
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,836
But that's what's poignant!
It's deeply moving.

262
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,892
Take him.

263
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,932
It sickens you?

264
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,328
That's it.

265
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,146
It's ugly. I don't like it.

266
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,177
It's white.

267
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,418
It's lovely.

268
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,547
It's soft.

269
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,937
Who did your hair?

270
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,156
It's like cotton candy!

271
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,706
My mom and I take pictures.

272
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,667
- It's fun!
- It's wicked!

273
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,372
Oh my God!

274
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,732
What's that?

275
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,587
She's the devil's daughter.

276
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,986
She's his daughter.
I'll chase you away, Satan!

277
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,098
Grandma?

278
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,572
Grandma?

279
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,513
Grandma, what's wrong?

280
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,122
Turn off that TV. I can't stand it.

281
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,511
There's nothing but crap
on that idiot box. Here.

282
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,713
Let in air. It's greasy.

283
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,882
The meatballs are still cooking.

284
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,553
Well, I don't feel well.

285
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,842
I just have one question for you.

286
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,763
I want to eat calmly now.

287
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,547
I won't stay long. I'm sorry.

288
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,052
You mustn't go up there.
Understood?

289
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,947
Understood, Grandma?
Don't go up there!

290
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,647
That room... that room...

291
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:56,820
with the mirrors...
and the blocked windows.

292
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,112
There's tons of spoiled food.

293
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,077
What do you do
with the child at night?

294
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,178
What do you do?

295
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,066
Everything may be spoiled,

296
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,532
but in any case, I'm an artist.
Not you.

297
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,126
We're not all required
to live the same way.

298
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,795
You forgot. You've been stuck
in the middle ages for years.

299
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,036
You refuse to see. You're backward!

300
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,956
I love very, very much,
but you're behind the times!

301
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,696
You mustn't shout
when I come to eat here.

302
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,802
I'll no longer eat here, then.

303
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,603
''Either that wallpaper goes,
or I do.''

304
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,603
I couldn't have said it better.

305
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,446
I think it'll be me.
I'm going to croak.

306
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,651
What's she saying?
I don't understand a thing.

307
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,587
Wrecked!

308
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,193
Give me back my keys.

309
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,037
You won't come back! It's over!

310
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,749
Questions about what's spoiled
or not are done with, ok?.

311
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,475
Ok. If you need to bathe,
you can go when I'm there.

312
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,172
- I'll bathe in the sink!
- My keys?

313
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,753
- Here.
- Thank you.

314
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,858
Ernst!

315
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,953
I'm happy to see you.

316
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,971
- Hello.
- Hello. We met at my gallery.

317
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,963
- Yes. Hello.
- Antoine, gallery owner.

318
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,862
Arnaud, my editor... Tina.
Meet Hanna Giurgiu.

319
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,181
And Violetta, my daughter,
Nadia and Fifi, my models.

320
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,582
The crazy virgins.

321
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,419
Can I sit down?

322
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,733
Of course.

323
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,757
- Please sit.
- Thank you.

324
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,218
I'm a photographer.

325
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,412
Can I, Ernie?

326
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,857
Of course.

327
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,731
A menu, please.

328
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,452
Do you like photos?

329
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,757
- Yes, I do.
- So, take a look.

330
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,587
Tell me what you think.

331
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,592
Very interesting.

332
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,513
What do you do?

333
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,012
- I make kokoshniks.
- What's that?

334
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,836
Kokoshniks are head-dresses
worn in Russian ballets.

335
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,676
And, you like posing nude?

336
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,867
It doesn't bother me.

337
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,931
Why? Nudity is beautiful.
Isn't it, Fifi?

338
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,388
What do you do?

339
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,227
I teach Chinese at a college.

340
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,877
Chinese. That's very nice.

341
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,636
Very erotic, the little girl.
I like that.

342
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,756
Would you like to publish me?

343
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,297
Fascinating, right?

344
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,218
Very interesting.

345
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,782
Very innovative.

346
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,813
Right, Ernst?

347
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,348
Yes, very...

348
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,112
I encourage her a lot.

349
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,333
Here, drink.

350
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,697
It'll keep you still.

351
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,086
Why is death so present
in your pictures?

352
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,218
Death is a party.

353
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,147
No, death is a whore.

354
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,418
Violetta!

355
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,227
Stop. Don't talk nonsense.

356
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,812
She is charming.

357
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,091
Come see me at the gallery.
We'll talk.

358
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,022
No one is bound
to the infinite - Ernst

359
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,082
Mom, I'm hungry and worn out.

360
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,401
You'll eat after. It's time to work.

361
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,473
You're beautiful.

362
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,272
Do you recall Marlene Dietrich?

363
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,982
In the cabaret, right?

364
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,212
Yes.

365
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,957
Go on the other set.

366
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,412
All right.

367
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,287
Stretch out your chin more.

368
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,837
Your head further back.

369
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,339
Marlene.

370
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,033
Your head further back.

371
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,532
Marlene, you see... Marlene...

372
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,740
Give me a bedroom gaze.
More sadness.

373
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,892
Very sad.

374
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,241
Yes. Very sad.

375
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,042
Spread a bit more your...

376
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,097
your legs.

377
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,516
It's very pretty like that.

378
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,993
Good, not bad.

379
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,367
It looks like Balthus.

380
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,577
Spread them more.

381
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,661
Your legs, a bit more.
Move your hand.

382
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,573
Move it.

383
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,707
Keep them spread. It's nice.

384
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,097
You're too inhibited.

385
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,266
But there's no hair.
People will know I'm young.

386
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,747
But that's what's so splendid.
It's striking.

387
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,587
Like a poisonous flower.
That's the beauty.

388
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,448
Show me.

389
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,096
Show me. I didn't know
you were so inhibited.

390
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,626
Just a bit more.
You'll see later, it's wonderful.

391
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,672
Wait, one minute.

392
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,033
Hurry up. We'll be late.

393
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,617
I'm done. I'm done.

394
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,506
It's ready. It's ready.

395
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,658
Help me, Violetta.

396
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,290
I won't invite you since you hate
those kinds of places anyway.

397
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,757
- See you later.
- See you.

398
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,492
Goodbye.

399
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,270
I saw Ernst's last painting.
It's a beauty.

400
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,291
Silence, please.

401
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,682
Listen up, everyone.

402
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,902
I'm sure you're wondering
who Hanna Giurgiu is.

403
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,547
And, well, so am I.

404
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,629
She's obviously from another planet.

405
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,113
She has her own world

406
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,966
and brings us back a few images
that she's entrusted to me.

407
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,282
Thank you sincerely.
Violetta, too.

408
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,222
The little princess
of this unique universe.

409
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,747
And thank you, Hanna,

410
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:26,110
who took the art world by storm.

411
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,292
Violetta.

412
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,460
What do you think
of your mother's pictures?

413
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,978
Go and ask her.

414
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,363
I'm interested in your opinion.

415
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,507
I'm just a model.

416
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,396
What do you think
about when you pose?

417
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,731
About what she says.

418
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,387
Well, what does she say?

419
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,187
To think about sad things and be...

420
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,787
very glamorous.

421
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,806
What does being
''very glamorous'' mean?

422
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,332
It's beautiful.

423
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,188
It's dark.

424
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,668
It's inaccessible.

425
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,793
It's distant.

426
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,820
You're questions are dumb, Jean.
Give it a rest!

427
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,886
I like the contrast
of the immature body

428
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,786
and the perverse gaze.

429
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,048
Very ''Bellmer''.

430
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,219
Hanna.

431
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,365
People are calling you
the high priestess of eroticism.

432
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,857
Yes, but...

433
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,756
it's not just any eroticism,
a literary eroticism.

434
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,867
Apparently, you live in a sanctuary.

435
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,036
I work in my room at night.

436
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,636
Your universe is dark,
your creatures are exuberant.

437
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,827
Where does it come from?

438
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,806
From the tales and stories
of my childhood.

439
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,803
Where did you grow up?

440
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,433
In Romania.

441
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,148
If you would allow me,

442
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,402
I'll write you an erotic text.

443
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,618
Please do.

444
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,788
Have you seen Ernst?

445
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,987
I'll find him.

446
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,498
Ten thousand.

447
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,242
A million total.

448
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,956
No. Ten thousand francs.

449
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,372
We'll repay Ernie.

450
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,807
Because we aren't beggars.

451
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,857
Here, Grandma.

452
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,092
1 ,000 francs.

453
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,253
Thank you.

454
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,462
- We agreed to meet?
- No.

455
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,256
But you should see my latest work,

456
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,516
since you didn't visit the gallery.

457
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,841
Here it is. At least I have class.

458
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,433
I go and see people.

459
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,546
- Don't you care how I am?
- Yes. How are you, dear Ernst?

460
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,132
Fine.

461
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,067
See. I turn worthless
girls into goddesses.

462
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,857
That's Nadia.

463
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,996
From the dance school.
You've met.

464
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,387
Did you see her sex?

465
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,913
It looks like a spider.

466
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,577
Do you like it?

467
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,161
Wait. Wipe before touching.

468
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,766
I like the one with
the spider-like sex.

469
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,002
She has the perfect sex, dreamlike,

470
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,866
magic and surreal.

471
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,468
Yes, it's marvelous.

472
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,747
Do you like any of them?

473
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,306
The nude one of Violetta
and that of Nadia.

474
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,752
They cost two million.

475
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,633
You don't hold back.

476
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,826
But, you're a friend
and you've done a lot for me.

477
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,313
You can have them for...

478
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,897
Ten thousand, Mom.

479
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,131
Half, at least.

480
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,611
Good thing I gave you that camera.

481
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,716
You'll be able to repay me.

482
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,531
You're a visionary.
That was my intention.

483
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,842
It's crazy, I swear.

484
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,553
So, then...

485
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,297
Five thousand.

486
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,892
Thank you.

487
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,843
There you go. Thank you.

488
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,253
Where are you going?

489
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:47,978
To the bathroom.

490
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,107
That one's broken.

491
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,372
That's ok.

492
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,563
I came because I needed money.

493
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,642
I swear. You always spoke of him.

494
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,860
You said he's nice.
I didn't know what to do...

495
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,317
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

496
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,206
I found his number
in your address book.

497
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,577
So, I came and...

498
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,737
He took me in and...

499
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,433
We're getting married.

500
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,322
Oh, well, how wonderful...

501
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,037
She cooks for you...

502
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,237
Oh, how wonderful...

503
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,818
Mom, stop!

504
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,012
I can't.

505
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,203
A scent in here is nauseating.

506
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,393
Shut up!

507
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,532
I didn't know you could be so mean.

508
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,552
You're worthless to him.

509
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,797
You're not even his wife.

510
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,682
You don't even sleep with him.

511
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,282
My head is spinning.

512
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:15,027
No one has ever done that to me.
Not like that!

513
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,867
Why are you talking loudly?

514
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,332
I'm not!
This is my way of speaking.

515
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,033
You're irritating me!

516
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,283
Can't I say what I think?.

517
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,298
What if I died?

518
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,232
It could happen to me.

519
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,363
It could very well happen.

520
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,797
I'm not feeling well.

521
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,317
I am not feeling well.

522
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,767
Oh my, what a tattered carpet.

523
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,012
Sir, could you
open my window please?

524
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,646
You know what?
We could die in here!

525
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,940
What would you say
if I croaked on your carpet?

526
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:55,220
Stop. I want to piss.
I can't just piss in your taxi!

527
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,827
What's all this about?

528
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,098
Get out of my cab.

529
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,993
I heard you pose naked.

530
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,242
Stuff full of ''insext''.

531
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,792
We saw you in a bookshop.

532
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,268
It's art, bitch!

533
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,826
Piss off!

534
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,348
You're the bitch!

535
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,337
Leave her alone!

536
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,446
Wake up.
We're going on a great trip.

537
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:04,698
What's happening?

538
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,057
- We're leaving.
- No.

539
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,497
She stays here.

540
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,588
No. I'm staying here.

541
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,882
Then you can't see
Sid Vicious or shop.

542
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,206
- Where are you going?
- England.

543
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,925
Hello.
Mr. Updike is waiting for you.

544
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,527
I'm so happy to do
this ''special order.''

545
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,803
Such a pretty little girl.

546
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:21,306
You're lovelier than
in your mom's photos.

547
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,577
And sexier, too.

548
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,910
I'm delighted
you accepted my invitation.

549
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,612
Very well.

550
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,197
I hope it'll go well...

551
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,636
and that my camera will work.

552
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,148
Will we shop tomorrow?

553
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,737
We shoot tomorrow.

554
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,137
I want to shop.

555
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,083
We'll shop after the shoot.

556
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,757
Such a pretty little girl.

557
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,877
Kiss him on the mouth, Violetta.

558
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,752
Violetta, very good.

559
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,537
Take off your dress.

560
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:05,897
It'll be better.

561
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,597
No. I'd rather like this.

562
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,022
Take off your clothes.

563
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,577
There we go.

564
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,833
Pretend to kill him by sword.

565
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,412
With force.

566
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,627
Stretch out a lot.

567
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,116
Arch your back a lot.

568
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,617
Spread your legs.

569
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,713
Just your thighs a bit.

570
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,232
- Spread them a bit.
- No.

571
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,026
Let him touch you.

572
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,817
Take that off.

573
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,048
Enough!

574
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,178
Undress!

575
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,686
I don't want to. Stop!

576
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:30,067
I don't want to pose.
I'm disgusted. Bloody idiot!

577
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,226
No, I got a few good ones.

578
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,402
Why are you screwing everything up?

579
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,566
As if the life
of a princess wasn't enough.

580
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,722
Shut up! We're going home.

581
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:01,938
I call the shots.

582
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,907
Oh, so life must stop if
Miss wants to go home?

583
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,473
What if I don't agree?

584
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,522
Updike's waiting. We're going out.

585
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,228
Can't I have a life?

586
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:13,108
Nobody wants you!

587
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:13,928
Is that so?

588
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,897
Everyone's at my feet.

589
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:16,808
Look at yourself.

590
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,462
You're too old.

591
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:20,948
I'm the one Updike wants.

592
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,923
You use me to get attention.

593
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:29,804
You're my top choice, my daughter.
I tried making you happy.

594
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,286
But any of my models
could have done the job.

595
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,548
I don't think so.

596
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,447
A little girl is much
more interesting.

597
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:38,853
Right, Mom?

598
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,258
What's your point?

599
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,187
I don't want to pose with men!

600
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,292
Shut your mouth.

601
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,233
What about the book I gave you?

602
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,507
I don't care about Bataille!

603
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,211
You're wrong.
You should read and talk to me.

604
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,531
I don't want to pose naked with men.

605
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:10,836
What about Lewis Carroll?
Suggestion isn't criminal.

606
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:11,892
That's where the art is.

607
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,732
I thought you were
old enough to see it.

608
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:15,653
But I was wrong.

609
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,513
You're stuck in mediocrity.

610
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,172
Don't make a scene!

611
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,402
Updike likes art. He helps artists.

612
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,012
I don't want to break ties with him.

613
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,842
Do you want us dead?
How will you live?

614
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,468
He's paying us a lot!

615
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,227
? 5,000. Go and find them.

616
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,542
I don't love you.

617
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,683
I don't want you
as a mother anymore.

618
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:01,046
I hesitated before bringing you.

619
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,182
I thought you were smarter,
but sadly I was wrong.

620
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,452
Don't make a scene.

621
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:13,196
I shouldn't share my life with you.

622
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:14,497
And yet...

623
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,387
God knows how I love you.

624
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:18,596
Few mothers love
their daughters as I do.

625
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,088
Everyone knows.

626
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,886
- My love!
- Oh come on, shut up.

627
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,352
I don't give a damn.

628
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,673
I want to go back to Paris.

629
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,402
Stop rebelling for God's sake.

630
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,113
What does ''incest'' mean?

631
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,951
Incest, my dear,
is when you sleep with your parents.

632
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,547
So, it's what you do with me.

633
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,967
Of course not.
What I do with you is art.

634
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:13,692
It's totally different.

635
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,752
I can read you some fan letters.

636
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,972
I've never touched you. You're mad.

637
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:25,937
We have fun. It's a game.

638
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,726
I don't have fun.
I no longer want to pose.

639
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,606
If you're done posing, it's a shame.

640
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,810
But, my photos remain in the
memories of all who've seen them.

641
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:38,978
Like it or not.

642
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,593
That's what matters.

643
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,923
Who cares about the rest?

644
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,026
Will I find myself in a porn shop?

645
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:50,418
You're crazy.

646
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,722
I'm an intellectual artist.

647
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,206
My last work
was in a great art journal.

648
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:58,631
Yes, I know. Brassaii,
Doisneau, Avedon... art, art, art!

649
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:02,156
The best photographers
are published in it. Shit!

650
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,606
Were you brainwashed at school?

651
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,885
The world is full of idiots.
Sad, but true.

652
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,747
In order to express yourself
and move forward,

653
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,097
you've a choice to make.

654
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:15,532
All this is dumb
over three jealous sluts.

655
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,353
Try and stand up to them.

656
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,011
Stop repeating yourself.
Answer my question.

657
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,902
You have your life in front of you.

658
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,565
Your stupid questions
are pissing me off.

659
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,457
Incest...

660
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,242
What a bunch of yokels.

661
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,571
Come on, let's go.

662
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:56,522
Fuck!

663
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,387
You're nasty. Not on the bog!

664
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,588
Don't be mad. It's funny.

665
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,643
- Give me the film.
- It's only fun.

666
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,763
Don't ruin my film for a photo!

667
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:05,892
You've no right.

668
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,098
Let go of it.

669
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:10,253
Bitch!

670
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,027
Violetta, come back.

671
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:13,642
Come back!

672
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:33,488
Your mother

673
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:36,052
dropped off this letter.
She's concerned.

674
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,792
We all are quite a bit.

675
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:42,336
Are you coming on Sunday?
We'll go walking.

676
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,482
I don't know. I'll try.

677
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:45,948
Leave me alone now.

678
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:50,212
''We mustn't fiight.

679
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:53,181
''I spend sleepless nights
thinking of you.

680
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:56,006
''This photo is stunning
in its own way.

681
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:00,244
''You'll find that out on your own.
You're the queen of the bog.

682
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:03,285
''Your loving mother.
Burning kisses.

683
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,206
''P.S. - I have a superb gift

684
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,378
''for you.''

685
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:09,708
I'm going to kill her!

686
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:11,732
What's wrong?

687
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:13,173
Enough of this!

688
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:16,006
You're aloof. You don't work!

689
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,548
You're never here.

690
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,483
I want your mother to come.

691
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:20,368
Get out!

692
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:22,852
Get out now.

693
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,987
And I don't want you back
in that indecent outfit!

694
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,956
Why doesn't your mother come?

695
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:34,817
Stay here.

696
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,308
You're punished.

697
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:02,427
She thinks she's special.
I hate her so much.

698
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,393
You're right. That slut

699
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:05,692
tries too hard.

700
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:11,779
I'm done with you.

701
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,282
- You're feeling blue?
- You understood me.

702
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:15,122
Your gift?

703
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,806
It's a superb
Yves Saint Laurent dress.

704
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:20,833
I don't want your gifts.

705
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,217
Go away!

706
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:28,568
Mouss,

707
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,472
two hot chocolates.

708
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,327
Why are you mean to your mother?

709
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,387
That bitch is the mean one.

710
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,657
That bitch.

711
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,507
You're talking nonsense.

712
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,202
Mothers aren't mean to their girls.

713
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,586
Why is that nonsense,
Mr. Know-it-all?

714
01:01:56,320 --> 01:02:00,734
Because mothers always
love their daughter.

715
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,137
Oh, right.

716
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:03,947
She's forced to, right?

717
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,792
She can't do otherwise.

718
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,033
She loves you

719
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:27,292
in her own way.

720
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,647
What do you think of pornography?

721
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:48,982
Your mother...

722
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:51,826
is a pioneer.

723
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:53,473
You're her work of art.

724
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:57,610
Your image is so sublime in the
photos that it's someone else.

725
01:02:58,120 --> 01:02:59,291
Who is it, then?

726
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,272
I don't want to see her.

727
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:37,932
I'm old.

728
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,606
I'm old and tired.

729
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:42,523
I can't do anything anymore.

730
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:49,987
Open the door!

731
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:52,273
I've come to make peace.

732
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:54,112
- No.
- Go away!

733
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:55,673
You're a monster.

734
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:59,251
That's ok.
There are other ambitious girls.

735
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:01,697
Violetta!

736
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,273
Open up!

737
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:06,177
I have your gift.

738
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:07,338
No!

739
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:11,719
She mustn't have all those mirrors.

740
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,652
As soon as she gets out of bed,

741
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:17,122
they cut up her head.
It's no good.

742
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,157
It's not good for her.

743
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:20,812
Violetta!

744
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:35,109
Dear God,
please don't let anything happen

745
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:39,284
to my girls, especially Violetta.

746
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:41,193
Watch over

747
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:45,600
her heart and her soul.

748
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:48,006
Keep evil away from her.

749
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:53,140
Oh Lord, I'm begging you.

750
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:59,956
Come with me
to show her my grades.

751
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:02,281
The principal wants to see her.

752
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:05,446
No. I'm not allowed.

753
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,556
I'll go no further.

754
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:18,947
Your face further back...

755
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:20,138
That's it.

756
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,522
The funeral lover.

757
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:25,108
Stand up.

758
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:26,713
Take the pearls.

759
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,316
Thighs closer, close your legs.

760
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:32,086
Give me bedroom eyes.

761
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,032
Arch back well.

762
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:41,702
- Wear the Yves St. Laurent dress.
- Thanks.

763
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:44,208
Violetta!

764
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:03,652
Your new model?

765
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:06,122
Exactly.

766
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:07,713
Leave me alone!

767
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:10,612
You're the one barging in here!

768
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,886
For my homework. I can't do them!

769
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:16,486
You don't want to.
You're being lazy.

770
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:18,841
You're exceptional,
but ruining it all.

771
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:22,997
I want to be like everyone.

772
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:24,947
No one wants that!

773
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,452
No one wants
to be stuck in mediocrity.

774
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:30,966
That girl just wants
to be looked at.

775
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:34,181
Her mother paid me.
They'll put up the portrait.

776
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:40,083
And you gave her my dress.

777
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:44,772
Put it on if you want to.

778
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:47,521
I'm going to Apolline's on Sunday.

779
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:48,362
Apolline?

780
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:50,057
That'll be the day.

781
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:53,371
- You won't visit those hicks.
- So, she'll come?

782
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:55,898
Come on, please.

783
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,716
To play explorers.
Come on.

784
01:06:58,920 --> 01:06:59,978
There's nothing to explore.

785
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:04,127
You don't play dolls with me.

786
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,686
You'll go if you pose
in the pink dress.

787
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:34,132
Take off your clothes.

788
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:43,172
Violetta.

789
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:44,258
Who's there?

790
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:48,581
No one. Adults have complained
because you pose naked.

791
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:50,147
Who's that? Adele?

792
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:31,153
Where is Violetta?

793
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:34,596
My God. My God.
What's happening?

794
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:39,187
Where is Violetta?

795
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:42,700
I don't know where she is. She left.

796
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:45,126
Tell me. What's going on?

797
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:49,287
Mom, Violetta brought a cake.

798
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:54,532
There's our star.

799
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:01,195
We bought the journal
with the pictures Hanna took of you.

800
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:04,037
It's super cool.

801
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:06,912
Remaudiere wrote the article.

802
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:08,672
''Neither child nor woman,
angel nor beast.

803
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:13,061
Giurgiu created a hybrid reflecting
the uncertainty of the times.''

804
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,612
Excuse me.

805
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:38,372
Violetta!

806
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:43,086
We'll call someone to help.
You need help.

807
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:44,912
You're getting screwier.

808
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:46,627
I'm not crazy!

809
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,188
Calm down!

810
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,972
You're the crazy one.
What's that journal?

811
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,156
- I'm called a whore!
- You're mad!

812
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:54,338
Why?

813
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,433
I want you to die!

814
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:58,807
- You don't love me!
- Yes, I do!

815
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,587
I love you, Violetta!

816
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:03,326
Violetta, I love you!

817
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:08,517
Loving mothers act differently!

818
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:11,251
You should thank me
for making you famous!

819
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:14,107
Luckily the world
doesn't think like you!

820
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:16,193
You can't be on their side.

821
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:17,748
I'm done posing nude!

822
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:20,980
What about film stars?
And statues in gardens? And...

823
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,553
And museum paintings...

824
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:24,187
Women show themselves off!

825
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:25,952
Someday you'll leave school!

826
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:28,532
They'll have other lives and forget.

827
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:31,126
You don't get it.
I'll never pose again!

828
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,487
You have no right to stop posing!

829
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:36,828
You've never held me.

830
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,353
You never wanted that!

831
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:40,897
I want to die!

832
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:42,752
I want to die with you.

833
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,272
I want to die with you.

834
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,017
My little girl.

835
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:52,412
Grandma!

836
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:23,805
We have to clean up
and give back the room.

837
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:27,747
Don't look at me that way.
Someone has to do it.

838
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:09,661
Now that Grandma's gone,
we're all alone.

839
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:14,246
Do you think she'll go to Heaven?

840
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:16,571
Of course.

841
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:21,162
Where did you put her icons?

842
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:23,068
I threw them out.

843
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:26,052
I never bought that religious crap.

844
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:31,162
You're such a mean person.

845
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,972
''Then, with his children
dressed in hides,

846
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:31,532
''disheveled, livid,
through the storms,

847
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:34,296
''Cain fled from before Jehovah.

01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:37,307
''As night was falling,

''staring at him in the shadows.''
Victor Hugo.

856
01:15:58,200 --> 01:15:59,588
That's good. Good.

857
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:04,151
Now, you'll all leave a bit early.

858
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:05,812
Wait.

859
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:07,947
Class is still in session.

860
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:10,867
I want you to go home

861
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:12,917
and observe
everything on the street.

862
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:16,837
Textures, trees, colors, people.
Whatever touches you

863
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:18,252
until getting home.

864
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,032
Once you sit down,

865
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,691
I'd like you to write
everything you felt.

866
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:25,332
- Understood?
- Yes.

867
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:26,498
Any questions?

868
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:30,093
Yes.

869
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:33,780
- Can we say what we don't like?
- Yes. Tell a story.

870
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:35,833
All I want, listen up,

871
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,616
is that you tell a story.
You may go.

872
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:30,892
What are you doing?

873
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:32,982
Homework.

874
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:53,117
They want my custody rights.
They want Violetta.

875
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:54,818
Who?

876
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:58,106
A civil judge. A state prosecutor.

877
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:00,476
He wants to put me in prison.

878
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:01,902
No one will do that.

879
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:03,877
Who could do this to me, Ernst?

880
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:05,667
They've submitted a case.

881
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:08,292
There are ten,
twenty pleas against me.

882
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:10,067
They denounced my photos.

883
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:18,227
Do you think it's normal?

884
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:20,962
Yes.

885
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:23,017
You're awful!

886
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:31,341
Hanna, you went too far
with your daughter.

887
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:33,633
We tried telling you.

888
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:35,188
You didn't listen.

889
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,057
I'm with you.

890
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:42,872
I'll pay for a lawyer.

891
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:47,547
It'll be bad for my daughter.

892
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:48,652
Think she'll die?

893
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:49,977
Of course not.

894
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:54,780
Only, you have
to tell her the truth.

895
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:58,046
And you have to face reality.

896
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,397
But, you know I love her.

897
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:03,972
Too much.

898
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:10,696
Do you think
they'll take my photos away?

899
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:13,057
Do you think so?

900
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:16,086
They don't understand your images.

901
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:21,556
But hide the negatives.

902
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:23,626
Wait until it all goes over.

903
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:11,963
Something very serious happened.

904
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:13,792
They may say I'm not your mom.

905
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:19,020
They saw my photos
and said I'd gone too far.

906
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:21,051
Who are ''they''?

907
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:22,548
Justice.

908
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:24,612
We'll be separated?

909
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,761
Yes. Well,
they can't really do that.

910
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:30,153
Who decides, then?

911
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,392
A children's judge...

912
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:35,317
who's authorized to decide.

913
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:38,196
That's how society works.

914
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:54,692
Violetta.

915
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,026
Aren't you coming to school?

916
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:36,196
So, this must be the sanctuary.

917
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,877
Have you spoken to her?

918
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:41,277
No, I wasn't able to.

919
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:43,147
Hello Violetta.

920
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:47,107
I'm a social worker.
I'm in charge

921
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:48,747
of the investigation.

922
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:51,282
The judge will take the decision.

923
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:52,742
I'm only here to help.

924
01:21:57,160 --> 01:22:01,130
She'll see if everything's ok,
if I don't beat or hurt you.

925
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:04,051
Normally,

926
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:07,981
your daughter should've
been interned in a center.

927
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:12,726
Mrs. Giurgiu, I'm the one
who asked the court

928
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:14,632
for an investigation.

929
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:18,460
Take this chance,
Mrs. Giurgiu, and fight.

930
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:20,517
Show the judge you can raise her.

931
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:23,006
Shit, I don't want to be locked up!

932
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:25,316
Sometimes it's better, Violetta.

933
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:27,113
I've nothing to prove.

934
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,487
You can't photograph her anymore.

935
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:36,555
- For now.
- No. Until she's no longer a minor.

936
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:40,467
Violetta must live
like a little girl again.

937
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:42,652
You must help her.

938
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:53,229
What do you think, Violetta?
Is your mother capable of that?

939
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:54,698
I don't know.

940
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:56,882
Well, then.

941
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:58,491
Can I see the flat?

942
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:15,507
Our grandmother
raised her until recently.

943
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:17,107
But she died a bit ago.

944
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:19,722
I know. My condolences.

945
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:23,386
The upkeep is artistic too,
Mrs. Giurgiu.

946
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,522
A child's everyday upbringing.

947
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:27,966
I'll do my best. I promise.

948
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,597
Violetta needs a normal life.

949
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:33,907
A normal context like everyone else.

950
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:38,365
Can you show me where you sleep?

951
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:40,418
There.

952
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:48,381
If there's financial trouble,
I'll get you

953
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:49,492
on welfare.

954
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:50,453
Call me.

955
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:52,057
Stay strong.

956
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:55,352
Go to junior high school.

957
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:56,812
And you...

958
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:00,686
Take down that black satin,

959
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:03,092
the skulls, the funeral wreaths.

960
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:05,193
Frankly, it's morbid.

961
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:26,852
You're becoming

962
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:30,470
a woman now, no longer
a little girl. It's a shame.

963
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:34,711
Even if we did more photos,
it wouldn't be the same.

964
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:38,492
Fortunately, the best has been done.

965
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:42,706
I'll look after you, dear Mom.
I'll make you dinner.

966
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:45,667
I'll work alone
since I can't photograph you.

967
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:47,252
It's forbidden.

968
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:49,516
You're not allowed
to mention photos!

969
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:51,881
- I have to go.
- What about dinner?

970
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:54,267
We're broke. We can't pay!

971
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:56,932
Use our welfare money!

972
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:00,132
I'm not that miserable.
I'm still alive.

973
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:01,713
Who do you think I am?

974
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:40,233
Are you Mr. Leger?

975
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:45,722
I brought you the pictures.

976
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:53,066
My new newspaper is wonderful.

977
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:55,841
Violetta's photo
will make the cover.

978
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:02,676
- Here's the money.
- Thank you.

979
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:09,323
- See you soon.
- See you.

980
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,092
What are you doing?

981
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:55,007
I'm trying to do a self-portrait.

982
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:59,136
What do you plan to do
with the photos of me?

983
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,353
The erotic photos?

984
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:02,908
They belong to me.

985
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:05,076
I'll burn them all someday.

986
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:07,153
You'll never get them.

987
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:10,451
What about them?
Can they take them?

988
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:11,858
What do you mean?

989
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,091
Tear them up?

990
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:18,141
They've already been published.
They can be copied.

991
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:20,562
They haven't all been published.

992
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:31,653
Where are they?

993
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:34,683
You have no right to do that.

994
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:36,553
No, but I do it.

995
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:41,748
Good night, darling.

996
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:43,131
You're dead to me!

997
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:45,606
You're no longer my mom.
Understood? You're dead!

998
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:46,533
Ok, ok.

999
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:49,581
It's better
if we don't tell those people much.

1000
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:23,683
Can I ask you a question?

1001
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:27,852
Will we finally lead normal lives?

1002
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:30,957
When you're better, we can.

1003
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:32,908
We can take pictures.

1004
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:35,332
You're mad!

1005
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:41,710
I want to go to the zoo.
I want to have hair all over!

1006
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:43,938
You're mad!

1007
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:56,085
Violetta, calm down! You're insane!

1008
01:28:56,720 --> 01:28:57,573
Stop!

1009
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:06,087
All right! Calm down now.

1010
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:07,952
You'll end up badly, girl.

1011
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:10,907
That's not from me.
It's genetic, from men!

1012
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:12,348
They're degenerate!

1013
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:23,338
Violetta!

1014
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:39,891
Go get me some
strawberry banana ''Andy's''.

1015
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:41,253
Some what?

1016
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:43,273
Strawberry banana ''Andy's''.

1017
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:45,178
Yes.

1018
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:52,858
Here.

1019
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:04,203
Hold the string tight.

1020
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:07,433
Hello. Can you hear me?

1021
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:10,513
Yes, I can hear you.

1022
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:14,485
I'm in the hallway. Fuck you.

1023
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:10,723
Why don't you go to school?

1024
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:13,906
You should go to school.
It's the law. You know that.

1025
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:15,611
Yes, I know.

1026
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:20,467
Make an effort.
If not, I can't do a thing.

1027
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:25,067
You asked to see me.
What did you have to say?

1028
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:30,042
That I'm a woman now.

1029
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:33,851
And I don't want
to go to school anymore.

1030
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:35,739
And...

1031
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:39,252
And?

1032
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:45,996
Why don't you tear up
my mother's pictures?

1033
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:48,083
Instead of giving me hell.

1034
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:52,950
I'm not authorized.
Only the judge can do that.

1035
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:54,693
Do you want that?

1036
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:16,753
She doesn't seem well.

1037
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,867
I brought the
social security paperwork.

1038
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,643
Your girl doesn't go to school.

1039
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:32,756
It's very serious.
That's your responsibility.

1040
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:37,590
She's not comfortable in her skin.
She's becoming a teen.

1041
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:43,066
It's not easy for me either.

1042
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:47,177
I live alone.

1043
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:51,869
I have a question. What do you do
with the pictures of her?

1044
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:55,683
The photos are mine.

1045
01:32:56,240 --> 01:32:57,912
They belong to the artist.

1046
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:03,036
They've been sold,
reproduced, published.

1047
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:08,997
They belong to everybody.

1048
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,433
Can't you stop selling?

1049
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:20,587
I'm a photographer.
I'm for free expression.

1050
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:30,132
Can I go now?

1051
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:33,576
Don't forget your
psychoanalyst appointment.

1052
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:37,978
Goodbye.

1053
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:39,213
Goodbye.

1054
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:12,081
I'm preparing to shoot with a model.

1055
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:15,227
I have to carry on.
It's my job, Violetta.

1056
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:16,948
Do you understand?

1057
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:18,978
What's this thing?

1058
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:22,837
That's mine.
It's a work I'm doing on myself.

1059
01:34:23,680 --> 01:34:26,660
I'm seeing a shrink.
Your mother is lost.

1060
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:31,387
My mother slept with her father.
He raped her.

1061
01:34:33,480 --> 01:34:35,402
At birth, no one wanted me.

1062
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:39,116
Not even Grandma.
It's a miracle I survived.

1063
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:42,122
They're just fantasies.

1064
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:45,403
Martha is your sister?

1065
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:47,313
I miss my mother.

1066
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:49,097
I miss her.

1067
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:51,523
I miss her terribly.

1068
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:52,898
I miss her.

1069
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:59,587
Your grandfather is...

1070
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:02,716
He's also your father, then.

1071
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:05,932
Who is Grandma?

1072
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:08,872
That's not the truth.

1073
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:10,883
If it was, I'd tell you.

1074
01:35:13,320 --> 01:35:14,628
Why hide anything?

1075
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:20,206
All right. Give me the dough.

1076
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:26,820
I never want to see your face again,
you big whore!

1077
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:10,300
Can I pray with you
like I did with my grandma?

1078
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:15,802
Will you be my grandma, then?

1079
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:20,371
I can't.

1080
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:23,617
Please.

1081
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:27,347
You must already have a grandma.

1082
01:36:29,680 --> 01:36:30,942
She's dead.

1083
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:39,804
You can't do that
to your dead grandma.

1084
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:42,571
You can't replace a grandma.

1085
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:46,402
Our Lord would not be happy.

1086
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:49,916
Go on. Take off.

1087
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:54,713
May God keep you.

1088
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:02,572
Bitch!

1089
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:04,876
My bag! My bag!

1090
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:35,467
Hello. I'm Violetta's mom.

1091
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:37,187
Very well. Follow me.

1092
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:07,618
Is that good?

1093
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:09,298
Come here.

1094
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:13,406
Hold on. The left eye isn't even.

1095
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:28,402
- Did you make these?
- Yes.

1096
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:29,373
Wicked!

1097
01:38:29,560 --> 01:38:30,868
- You like?
- Totally.

1098
01:38:32,440 --> 01:38:33,452
You don't have to.

1099
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:34,977
My beer isn't dry.

1100
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:37,321
Your beer is dry. Move your ass.

1101
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:40,152
- Shit. Holy cow.
- What?

1102
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:44,051
- Did your old man do that to you?
- No.

1103
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:46,566
My old woman.
My old man was pretty cool.

1104
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:49,442
Violetta. Your mother is waiting.

1105
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:08,833
My love!

1106
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:13,891
I love you!
