OOKAMI SHOUJO Film Partners
presents

2
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:40,032
Those days when it was called
The Era of Showa...

3
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:49,083
There is no 100% in this world.

4
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,117
Uh, yeah...

5
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:54,119
We can indeed go to the moon now.

6
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:56,282
Uh, yeah...

7
00:00:57,157 --> 00:01:01,025
The scientists go digging
mysteries of underworld.

8
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,029
Uh, yeah...

9
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:04,255
Aren't you listening?

10
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:07,123
Uh, yeah...

11
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,001
Tell you what,
everything is not what we see!

12
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:15,207
...I know, Akira-kun.

13
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:18,143
You don't believe this!

14
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,214
I do, I do!

15
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:30,247
This isn't the place but,

16
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:35,253
The ditch is connecting to
bigger pipe, and

17
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:39,033
That connects to even
bigger ones.

18
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:41,225
That's where
underworld people would live.

19
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:45,061
...Say, how about playing
at your house?

20
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,177
Ko-chan, let me do it.

21
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:08,218
He is messing your kite,
Ko-chan.

22
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:11,164
It is mine!

23
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,998
That is mine!!

24
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:16,196
Ah, yes, that is yours indeed,
Ko-chan.

25
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:20,029
You cannot call me Ko-chan!

26
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,040
Sorry, Koichi-kun.

27
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:29,038
He is tearing up your kite,
Ko-chan.

28
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:30,274
I kick ass!

29
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:49,035
Ohta, Don't go away!

30
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:51,127
Stop, Ohta!

31
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:06,217
Ohta, wait!!

32
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,132
Ohta, wait!

33
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:25,067
Ohta!

34
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:35,044
Shunji, not that way. This way!

35
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:36,206
Yah!

36
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:10,140
Welcome, welcome,
yes, yes, please this way!

37
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,179
Well well, ladies and gentlemen,

38
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:18,282
Have mercy and pity this girl.

39
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:23,087
Saved by a wolf,
No more misery if eaten up then.

40
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:27,089
But she was alive and brought up
by the wolf. At age 10,

41
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:30,067
She grows hair all around her body!

42
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:33,164
Well worth watching,
worth watching!

43
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:36,268
80 for kids, 40 for half blind,
50% more for pregnant,

44
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:40,206
Show tent will start tomorrow!

45
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,217
Wolf Girl, Human Pomp,
Lady Octopus and Girl Torch!

46
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:49,189
Stretchy Neck Girl.
They are all genuine.

47
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:53,250
Well well well,
Show Tent will start tomorrow!

48
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,991
"Wolf Girl"

49
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:09,231
WHEN THE SHOW TENT
CAME TO MY TOWN

50
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:03,025
Thank you.

51
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,137
Guess she is still in
elementary school.

52
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:15,198
That's impressive.

53
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:19,142
OK, I will go.

54
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,146
Have safe commuting.

55
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:30,213
"Monster Encyclopedia",
"UFOs", "Dracula"

56
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:46,298
"Elementary school, School Yard"

57
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,244
You've got to pay the damage!

58
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,086
It's 10000 yen worth, that kite!

59
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,057
Have it by tomorrow.

60
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:09,254
I didn't break it.
It just fell on to me.

61
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,254
Shut up! Just pay me!

62
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,225
It's a rip-off!

63
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:21,196
A kite cannot cost 10000 yen.
You are ripping him off.

64
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:25,034
Police will come and get you.

65
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,271
...What's it to you?

66
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:35,052
Hurry, you guys will be late.

67
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,191
What's a Rip-off?

68
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,153
Don't know!

69
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:45,129
Who is she?

70
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:08,053
We have somebody new today.

71
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:10,256
Be nice to her.

72
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:15,095
I am Rumiko Tezuka.
Nice to meet you.

73
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:28,230
"Rumiko Tezuka"

74
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:34,146
Where are you from,
Tezuka-san?

75
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:35,181
Tokyo?

76
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:38,046
I've been there...

77
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,109
As I thought! You are different...

78
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:44,123
Where did you buy your skirt?

79
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,989
She is wearing a wristwatch!

80
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,085
Looks nice, Tezuka-san!

81
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:01,064
She is late again.

82
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:04,111
Yeah, she's weird.

83
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:24,161
Hey, let's show her around.

84
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,163
Let's

85
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,133
I want to go too.

86
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:29,067
How about music room first?

87
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:31,068
Can I call you Rumiko-chan?

88
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:32,070
Yeah.

89
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:33,128
Let'me call you that way.

90
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,004
Me too.

91
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,132
Me too.

92
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:43,081
Your brother's cold,
is it still bad?

93
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:50,182
Be careful,
you won't catch it, Komuro-san.

94
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:20,052
You want Class-List?

95
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:23,214
Yes, I want to remember
everybody's name quick.

96
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:25,088
Wait a moment.

97
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,024
Network list will be better?

98
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:33,189
Hoping you make
many friends soon.

99
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:34,223
Yes...

100
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,037
Teacher, that girl?

101
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:40,230
You mean, Komuro-san?

102
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,277
Doesn't she have a school bag?

103
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:51,082
No... Taking care of
her little brothers and...

104
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:53,219
Be nice to her, will you?

105
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:56,120
Yes!

106
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:18,102
That new girl, she got nerves!

107
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,174
Does she...?

108
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:28,076
But she is kind of cute, isn't she?

109
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:30,214
...is she?

110
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,195
Look, look, this magic card!

111
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:44,035
Well, fellows, gather around!
What I have here is MAGIC CARD.

112
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:49,007
Doesn't this look cool? Magic it is.
Don't blink. Look just closer.

113
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:52,103
I do it once and only once.
Well, I put this on the card...

114
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,182
And do this...

115
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:02,282
Invented at Dr. Takayanagi's Lab,
up in deep Northern Hokkaido,

116
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:06,026
What is underneath this card?

117
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,117
1 Yen!

118
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:14,133
That's right. You saw it.
And what happens to 1 <i>Yen...</i>

119
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,061
As you see!

120
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:27,009
With this ca rd, anyone can change
1 Yen to 100 Yen Coin!

121
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:33,119
No need to beg your parents,
have all the money you want!

122
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:36,122
Well,
who wants to have this card?

123
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,246
Me, me, me!!

124
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:46,256
He was cheating.

125
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:53,105
There aren't no Magic Card.
Just a Trick.

126
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:55,231
A card covers 1 yen.

127
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:59,269
Then, a different coin in another card
comes out when opened again.

128
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,103
You got that?

129
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:07,985
Don't you see, you almost got hooked,
Akira Ohta-kun.

130
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:12,013
What? I looked at it up closest.

131
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:17,196
Ohta-kun, you are funny.

132
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:26,103
Ohta-kun, you cannot tarry on.

133
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:31,033
Never bring this stuff here!

134
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:33,978
Will never let you in again.

135
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:35,174
Please... Koichi-kun.

136
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:40,213
I'm not swinging by.
It's a short cut.

137
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:45,022
Aren't you scared?

138
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:46,014
What?

139
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,026
Place like this,
you see some ghosts.

140
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:50,187
I am not afraid!

141
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:54,267
Hey, there is
a long-nosed goblin in shrine.

142
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:59,002
I know that. It comes kidnapping.

143
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:01,268
You know it well.

144
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:06,236
Common sense,
but I am not scared at all.

145
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:13,242
How come adults tell a lie like that?
There is no long-nose goblin at all.

146
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:16,146
There is!

147
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:23,095
It must be here even now.
We just cannot see it.

148
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,197
You are funny.

149
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:29,998
From their view,
people are all funny!

150
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:08,173
Well, well, well,
everybody, everybody!

151
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:13,270
Split-mouthed Woman,
Lady Octopus, Spellbinding!

152
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:18,984
Brand new to this area,
Wolf-Girl Hana-chan is must to see!

153
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:23,147
Cursed badly or sent by God,
pity girl, poor girl.

154
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:27,250
She was born in
deep Northern riverside of Hokkaido,

155
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:32,988
Her father dumped her in deep mountain
foot of Big Snow Mountain.

156
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,261
As in ill luck,
saved by a big wolf.

157
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:40,130
No big deal if eaten up then.
Misery starts as the wolf raised her.

158
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:45,177
She is just age 10!
Here, you nice-looking little gent!

159
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:50,242
Just like your age!
What ill fate, raised by wolves,

160
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:54,015
Thick body hair and
speaks no words.

161
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,114
Rats, Chicken, snake, frog,
she eats all of them alive.

162
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:02,057
Shocking live show
will wait for you!

163
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:09,228
Well, everybody, come in and see.
Come in and See.

164
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:19,040
Little Fellow!

165
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,274
Do you have money?

166
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:30,216
Welcome, welcome.

167
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,201
Ouch!

168
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:50,058
"Hideko Komuro"

169
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:00,169
Teacher!

170
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,275
I saw Ohta-kun yesterday

171
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:07,151
running away from the Shrine,
still with his school bag on.

172
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:17,195
The school note said
"No Swing-by after school".

173
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:25,059
Is it true, Ohta-kun?

174
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,108
Ohta-kun?

175
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:37,140
Lost your tongue?

176
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:51,161
It's true... My tongue is okay.

177
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,066
Quiet, everyone!

178
00:18:56,068 --> 00:19:00,266
Remember what I said last week?

179
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,198
Yes, I do.

180
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:08,172
To the corridor, then.

181
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:19,191
Stupid!

182
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:21,023
You nerd!

183
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,059
Teacher?

184
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:28,063
I was there, too.

185
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,065
Tezuka-san?

186
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,264
The corridor, for me, too.

187
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,225
Good morning, Komuro-san.

188
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,126
...Good morning.

189
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:08,104
She spoke!

190
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,010
Hadn't heard her voice in a while.

191
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:15,103
But you two are
in the same class!

192
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:19,081
Hey! You are being punished,
so be quiet!

193
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:38,059
No way. Going to
the show tent is out of question.

194
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,063
I am not asking you to come along.

195
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:44,143
It is all fake I think.

196
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,143
You've seen it?

197
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,205
No, I haven't.

198
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,116
Then how would you know?

199
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:57,178
I saw a Lady
whose mouth was split up to here.

200
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,018
Can't be true.

201
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:02,119
But it was, I saw it.
And the Wolf Girl, too.

202
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:05,120
What's a Wolf Girl?

203
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:07,997
It is written here,
take a good look.

204
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,192
"Wolf Girl"

205
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:15,070
She is really human,
but was brought up by a wolf.

206
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,209
She walks on all four limbs
and can't talk.

207
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:24,040
That reminds me of something
I heard from Grandma.

208
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:28,245
Speak up!

209
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:32,056
A cat brought up by a dog.

210
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:43,059
Please. Dogs and cats are
a totally different matter.

211
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,162
It is?

212
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:10,058
Thank you very much.

213
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,028
You are very good.

214
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:18,296
Not worth showing around, is it?

215
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:25,067
"Wolf Girl"

216
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:29,045
I met the owner of
Canary Craft Shop today.

217
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:31,209
He gave me a generous discount.

218
00:22:32,151 --> 00:22:35,212
Nice colors, aren't they?

219
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:40,092
I will knit your muffler with this.
Going to keep you warm.

220
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:50,133
Akira,
I was asked to teach knitting.

221
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:53,228
Two days a week.
What do you think?

222
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:02,170
Imagine, me teaching at
a knitting class! Isn't it great?

223
00:23:03,282 --> 00:23:05,046
Yeah...

224
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:14,149
"Yesterday was Father and Mother's
Wedding Anniversary..."

225
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:19,164
"I helped out and
we baked a large anniversary cake."

226
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:25,003
"The three of us blew out
the candles in the dark."

227
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:28,065
"I could hear
Father and Mother laugh."

228
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:34,077
"I want to get married soon and
bake cakes for someone, too."

229
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,146
Very good.

230
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:39,241
You are next, Ohta-kun.

231
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:47,091
"My mother likes the winter season."

232
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:52,052
"It is because
she will have a lot of things to knit."

233
00:23:52,298 --> 00:23:56,132
"She is going to knit my father
a necktie next,"

234
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:58,260
"but my father said Please, No!"

235
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:03,132
"Still my mother knits
with a smile on her face..."

236
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:22,092
Right, well done.
How about a hand for Tezuka-san?

237
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:30,195
We will be eating the curry
you are making now for lunch.

238
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,095
So better make it delicious.

239
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:39,040
Tezuka-san, you are good.

240
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:41,144
You do it at home as well?

241
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:43,978
Komuro-san does better than I do.

242
00:24:49,288 --> 00:24:53,282
Don't go near her.
She is muggle.

243
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:58,025
No one is gonna eat anything
she makes.

244
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,098
Dis--gusting.

245
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:27,054
Don't come near me, Komuro-san.

246
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:36,268
This would be fun,
everyone, get Komuro!

247
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:43,233
Coming infield!

248
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:05,031
Fool! You got hit by a girl!

249
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:37,093
Ko-chan, not hurt?
Are you all right?

250
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,220
Ouch...

251
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:16,117
Komuro,
do you clean up properly!

252
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:21,097
Having a newspaper route is
no excuse for loafing.

253
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,262
That's so, Wolf Girl!

254
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:29,096
Komuro is a Wolf Girl.

255
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:33,009
Don't bring a cookie can to school!

256
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:40,209
Wolf Girl! Wolf Girl!

257
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,151
Stop it!

258
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:58,025
I am not letting you
pick on Komuro-san!

259
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,975
Komuro-san!

260
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:12,013
Don't you stop picking on her!

261
00:29:15,187 --> 00:29:17,212
"Hideko Komuro"

262
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:20,055
"Totally naked,
running four-legged,"

263
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:24,086
"speaks no words,
just howling like a wolf."

264
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,121
Right... but...

265
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:31,065
And here.

266
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:37,107
"The girl had thick body hair and
sharp teeth, eating birds alive."

267
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:41,976
See, this Wolf Girl must be
the real thing...

268
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:48,179
But that was so long ago,
it must be dead by now.

269
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:57,220
Can I go to your house today?
Your Mom's gonna be late again?

270
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:01,193
Akira-kun?

271
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:05,135
Hey, Akira-kun!

272
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:11,007
Akira-kun!

273
00:30:12,044 --> 00:30:14,172
Huh, what? Akira-kun...

274
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:27,057
What? What is it?
What happened?

275
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:30,060
Akira-kun, tell me!

276
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:32,263
Believe me. I didn't go!

277
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:35,097
You saw Komuro
of the Show Tent, right?

278
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:37,160
You said so.

279
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:41,070
You saw Komura doing
the Wolf Girl act, didn't you?

280
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:43,267
No, I didn't say so. I wasn't...

281
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:45,033
Make up your mind.

282
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:48,172
Or you're gonna get smacked
by Ko-chan.

283
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:52,176
I saw it, but
I didn't go to the Show Tent!

284
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:54,314
You really didn't go?

285
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:57,112
I absolutely did not go!

286
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:03,118
He lies too much, no fun.

287
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:08,997
You are not allowed into
our secret base from new on.

288
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:11,034
...Wait!

289
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:18,234
Koichi-kun! Promise me
you won't tell the teacher?

290
00:31:34,126 --> 00:31:36,185
4 days a week.

291
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:41,098
Oh, 4 days a week I have to...

292
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,994
Please...

293
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:54,239
That is my son.

294
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:57,072
Please consider my request...

295
00:31:57,115 --> 00:32:00,244
Yes, I will be considering it.
Thank you.

296
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:12,286
I am home.

297
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:14,088
Welcome back.

298
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:17,091
What is it?
You don't seem that pleased.

299
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:19,036
The front door was locked!

300
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:22,129
Right. I am sorry.

301
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,073
I guess should give you keys
from now on.

302
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:31,309
And now the show is about to begin.

303
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:35,179
The hottest topic in town!
The WOLF GIRL!

304
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:40,216
Her strange but fascinating story,
and real-life performance.

305
00:33:07,052 --> 00:33:09,214
You got money?

306
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,989
I say you got money?

307
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:29,071
Help, Help me!

308
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:35,045
I was waiting for you, kid.

309
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:41,151
You... Saw... Me!

310
00:34:18,123 --> 00:34:21,115
Going different ways.

311
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:27,029
You mean divorce?

312
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:43,171
All in all, not much understanding
for a job like ours.

313
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:48,076
The child..., which will...

314
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:51,179
The mother should, right?

315
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:54,248
At this point, why the father?

316
00:34:58,129 --> 00:34:59,153
...What's that?

317
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:04,258
I hate the way you say it.
The child gets hurt the most.

318
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:08,128
Maybe he woke up.

319
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:11,208
What, is he sleeping there?

320
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:18,240
Akira, you gonna catch a cold
dozing off like this.

321
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:44,037
Ohta-kun, you all right?

322
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,166
Yes.

323
00:35:46,011 --> 00:35:49,208
You want to take a rest
at the sidelines? Can you sit up?

324
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:55,175
Sit down.

325
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,145
Are you OK?

326
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:24,072
Airball...!

327
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:34,215
"Teacher's Office"
I think you should start wearing them.

328
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,188
Having trouble exercising?

329
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:43,033
Let's speak with your Mother.

330
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:47,261
Tomorrow, I can accompany you.

331
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,263
No, it's OK.

332
00:36:50,275 --> 00:36:52,141
Can you tell her by yourself?

333
00:36:58,016 --> 00:37:01,281
Don't have to buy a new one.

334
00:37:02,087 --> 00:37:04,146
You can borrow some
from your mother.

335
00:37:06,191 --> 00:37:07,249
Is it OK?

336
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,105
What's wrong?
With the lights out.

337
00:37:31,149 --> 00:37:34,983
Nothing... welcome back.

338
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:38,079
Where is Mom?

339
00:37:38,156 --> 00:37:39,214
Canary Fancy Shop.

340
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:45,253
Really...
Wanna go out for a bite?

341
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,020
No.

342
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,032
Aren't you hung FY?

343
00:37:49,067 --> 00:37:52,162
Not hungry.
I will wait till my Mom is back.

344
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:07,080
Hey, Akira. Sit down here.

345
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:16,049
You wanna come to
Dad's office tomorrow?

346
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:22,090
Well, tomorrow's Saturday.
How about lunch together?

347
00:38:23,201 --> 00:38:24,259
Yeah...

348
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,238
You don't like being together
with me?

349
00:38:27,272 --> 00:38:29,138
No, that's not it.

350
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,199
You know, Mom's got
knitting classes tomorrow, too.

351
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:38,180
At the bus stop
in front of my office, 1 o'clock.

352
00:38:38,283 --> 00:38:43,016
Here, this is your bus fare.
So don't lose it.

353
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:49,116
"500 yen"

354
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:54,292
Hideko-chan!

355
00:38:59,204 --> 00:39:04,267
I can't go to school today.
I wanted to give you this.

356
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,100
What is it?

357
00:39:07,212 --> 00:39:11,046
I got it from my sister.
No use for me.

358
00:39:12,217 --> 00:39:13,275
Bye Bye.

359
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:25,119
"500 Yen"

360
00:40:03,301 --> 00:40:07,101
Isn't the show tent open?

361
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:13,269
Don't know... well,
the street stands are all gone.

362
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:18,106
What? You mean
the show tent is not here to stay?

363
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:25,987
Don't know...
but no sense being here all the time.

364
00:40:27,058 --> 00:40:31,017
Guess they move on.

365
00:40:34,032 --> 00:40:36,160
Wish the show tent would stay.

366
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:06,994
Akira-kun!

367
00:41:10,168 --> 00:41:11,260
Tezuka-san?

368
00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:14,028
I'll get off here.

369
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,242
Your father?

370
00:41:30,021 --> 00:41:31,045
Yeah.

371
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,124
Why did you skip school?

372
00:41:35,126 --> 00:41:40,223
Well... I went to Tokyo,
but there was a change in plans.

373
00:41:41,032 --> 00:41:43,194
Had I known,
I would have gone to school.

374
00:41:44,102 --> 00:41:46,036
Where are you going,
Akira-kun?

375
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:51,005
Nowhere... wait!
My father's office!

376
00:41:54,145 --> 00:41:57,046
What does your father do?

377
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:59,114
A newspaper reporter.

378
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:01,247
Wow, sounds interesting!

379
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,146
Not really.

380
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:07,014
I think its cool.
Can I go with you?

381
00:42:11,162 --> 00:42:13,028
I hear something.

382
00:42:44,262 --> 00:42:46,060
Hideko-chan!

383
00:42:50,101 --> 00:42:51,262
What's wrong?

384
00:42:52,203 --> 00:42:53,261
Are you okay?

385
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:56,231
Can you stand up?

386
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:58,199
Give me a hand!

387
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:11,089
It was them, wasn't it?

388
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:13,223
They did this to you?

389
00:43:19,197 --> 00:43:25,000
This is outrageous! Boys picking on
girls is despicable. Am I right?

390
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:29,040
Ahm... yes.

391
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,265
You should get angry, too!

392
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:33,038
I am.

393
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:34,272
No, you are not!

394
00:43:35,046 --> 00:43:36,172
Yes, I am.

395
00:43:37,048 --> 00:43:41,076
You got angry first,
so I might not look like I am angry,

396
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:43,177
But I am definitely angry.

397
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:49,220
Carry heron your back.

398
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:51,119
You are a boy, aren't you?

399
00:43:52,263 --> 00:43:53,287
Yeah,I am...

400
00:43:58,202 --> 00:44:01,263
<i>I am all</i> right <i>now...</i> I <i>can walk...</i>

401
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,108
You are still OK, Akira-kun?

402
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:09,171
Hideko-chan,
you can't let them get away with this.

403
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,270
Yeah...

404
00:44:11,082 --> 00:44:15,144
You just can't.
You will lend a hand, Akira-kun?

405
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:17,121
Yeah.

406
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:54,022
Hideko!

407
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:58,118
What are you doing!
Late for paper route!

408
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:06,127
Where did you goof off?

409
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:08,263
I am sorry.

410
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:12,006
You are covered with mud.

411
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:16,238
I fell down.
Tezuka-san and Ohta-kun helped me.

412
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:20,216
You are so clumsy.

413
00:45:23,321 --> 00:45:27,258
Thank you.
Hope you will be friends with her.

414
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:29,049
Yes, we will.

415
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:32,060
Oh, yes.

416
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:40,104
You missed meeting your father.

417
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:41,194
That's okay.

418
00:45:43,174 --> 00:45:44,266
It's my fault.

419
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:49,136
No, it's not...
I didn't want to go, really.

420
00:45:50,281 --> 00:45:52,249
You are kind.

421
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:54,108
I meant it.

422
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:10,158
Why don't we go somewhere now?

423
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:13,238
What do you mean somewhere?

424
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:17,007
I only have 500 yen.

425
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:23,213
Want to go to movies tomorrow?

426
00:46:25,049 --> 00:46:27,143
What? The two of us?

427
00:46:28,052 --> 00:46:29,247
Three, with Hideko-chan.

428
00:46:30,054 --> 00:46:31,078
Oh, okay.

429
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:36,083
Hey, from now on
we are going to stand up for her.

430
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:41,129
But... I...

431
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:48,002
It's a promise.

432
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:13,221
"Rock-Pa per-Scissors"

433
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:19,262
Ch...o...co...la...te!

434
00:47:20,104 --> 00:47:22,232
Rock-Paper-Scissors!

435
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:27,236
P...i...ne...app...le!

436
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:30,204
Rock-Paper-Scissors!

437
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:34,149
G...li...co!

438
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:37,010
Rock-Pa per-Scissors!

439
00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:41,020
P...i...ne...app...le!

440
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:44,184
See you at school tomorrow.

441
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:47,221
Akira-kun, bye-bye!

442
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:06,039
That's her house?

443
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:07,184
It's gorgeous.

444
00:48:10,187 --> 00:48:13,122
Ohta is on a date with Komuro!

445
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:15,181
You two are a good match... Yuk!

446
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:18,990
We got you, we got you!

447
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:21,088
Are you two dating?

448
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:28,000
A Wolf Girl and a Wolf boy!
Who are we going to tell?

449
00:48:58,102 --> 00:48:59,160
Hideko?

450
00:49:04,074 --> 00:49:07,135
Better get sleep or
you'll be late again tomorrow.

451
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:08,211
Yes.

452
00:49:11,215 --> 00:49:15,174
Father will be back from work
in spring.

453
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,179
Then it will all be better.

454
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:22,219
Good night...

455
00:49:23,227 --> 00:49:24,285
Good night.

456
00:49:34,271 --> 00:49:37,241
"Akira and Hideko is in love."

457
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:50,117
Rumiko-chan,
tomorrow's Satomi-chan's birthday.

458
00:49:50,187 --> 00:49:51,245
Well, Happy Birthday!

459
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:55,117
We are having a party.
I want you to come.

460
00:49:55,226 --> 00:49:59,254
Oh, I can't.
I will skip school, too.

461
00:50:00,064 --> 00:50:01,225
What? Why?

462
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:03,191
I am really sorry...

463
00:50:10,074 --> 00:50:13,271
I bet she takes singing lessons.

464
00:50:14,078 --> 00:50:17,013
But it's no reason to skip school.

465
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:22,220
"Wolf Girl"

466
00:50:25,089 --> 00:50:27,217
Lovely couple!

467
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:31,028
Hey, Ohta.
You'll be a Wolf Boy, too.

468
00:50:31,095 --> 00:50:34,065
Komuro, have 0hta's baby!

469
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:47,134
What?

470
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:51,112
Ouch! What is that for?

471
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,230
What!

472
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:19,166
Nothing.

473
00:51:30,054 --> 00:51:31,112
Don't mind it.

474
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,128
Uh... here.

475
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:54,269
I thought it was amazing.

476
00:51:57,147 --> 00:52:01,084
I've never used up pencils
that short.

477
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:05,050
Your Mom wrote your name?

478
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:11,023
Very nice mother.

479
00:52:16,033 --> 00:52:18,024
I said something wrong, didn't I?

480
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:36,118
Well, where are we going?
Sort of heavy, this is.

481
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:38,244
This way.

482
00:52:39,123 --> 00:52:42,115
What are we going to dig up?

483
00:52:46,063 --> 00:52:46,256
Here.

484
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:52,235
Something buried here?

485
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:56,037
Show you the proper way
to use a scoop?

486
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:14,057
Bye bye.

487
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:20,219
Your mother has
started teaching knitting?

488
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,295
That's awesome.
My mother told me.

489
00:53:25,069 --> 00:53:27,231
Let's do homework at my house.

490
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:29,264
I've got to be back home
early today.

491
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,270
Your mother is going to be late.

492
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:36,102
My mother says
you can have dinner with us.

493
00:53:36,113 --> 00:53:37,205
Sorry, I am busy.

494
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:45,111
Divided by 3,
that's 17 remainder 1, right?

495
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:51,119
So 26 x 2/3 is 17 remainder 1.

496
00:53:51,295 --> 00:53:55,027
Ah, right. You are right.

497
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:58,999
You should finish your homework
at school.

498
00:53:59,169 --> 00:54:00,193
Talk of the impossible.

499
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,099
How deep are you going to dig?

500
00:54:07,111 --> 00:54:10,103
All the way
to the core of the earth.

501
00:54:12,116 --> 00:54:14,278
What if we find
the underworld people?

502
00:54:15,185 --> 00:54:18,155
If we do,
Akira-kun would become a celebrity.

503
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:21,047
I don't want to be famous.

504
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:26,051
But that would show
those people that made fun of me.

505
00:54:26,196 --> 00:54:28,164
Then it would be really great.

506
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,129
What!

507
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,078
You are...

508
00:55:59,089 --> 00:56:03,048
The newspaper girl?
To our housing project.

509
00:56:03,227 --> 00:56:05,093
Thank you for delivering.

510
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:09,129
You must be cold. Take this.

511
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:11,067
No, that is okay.

512
00:56:11,168 --> 00:56:16,129
I want you to have it.
I teach knitting.

513
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,265
These are samples.
There are many more.

514
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:26,139
Don't be shy.

515
00:56:35,092 --> 00:56:39,120
There are generous people.
Take good care of it.

516
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:43,123
No!! Don't scribble on it.

517
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:46,231
It is not yours! No scribbling!

518
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:59,079
I don't know!

519
00:56:59,116 --> 00:57:01,050
But it looks the same to me.

520
00:57:01,051 --> 00:57:02,143
It's not!

521
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:08,049
You are right... Pair mufflers
with Komuro, that is awful.

522
00:57:08,292 --> 00:57:09,259
Yeah...

523
00:57:11,028 --> 00:57:13,156
Akira-kun, wait for me!

524
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:16,097
Definitely the same mufflers.

525
00:57:16,133 --> 00:57:20,036
Maybe the rumor is really true.

526
00:57:20,037 --> 00:57:25,134
Right. Koichi-kun and the lot has
seen them together so many times.

527
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:31,038
Disgusting!
The two of them sucks!

528
00:57:35,085 --> 00:57:39,022
Rumiko-chan, did you hear
about Ohta-kun and Komuro-san?

529
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:40,089
Yeah.

530
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:45,024
Stop it, Nobuko-chan.
She likes Ohta-kun.

531
00:57:47,097 --> 00:57:48,030
Is that true?

532
00:57:48,098 --> 00:57:51,159
I've been watching her,
so I know.

533
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:54,168
I like both Akira-kun
and Hideko-chan.

534
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:57,197
More than I like you girls.

535
00:58:04,114 --> 00:58:07,084
Tezuka-san, digging today too?

536
00:58:14,124 --> 00:58:17,094
I have a gift for you.

537
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:30,199
Wow, marvelous...
Is this for me?

538
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,139
Yes.

539
00:58:32,242 --> 00:58:35,109
How about doing homework
at my house?

540
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:46,085
You are in love
with Komuro.

541
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:49,191
No way, right?

542
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:54,293
I will do my homework
with Masashi-kun today.

543
00:58:55,298 --> 00:58:57,062
Thank you.

544
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:00,066
Your voice is loud.

545
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:23,989
Still here?

546
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:28,293
You dig this far alone?

547
00:59:29,266 --> 00:59:31,098
Why are you here?

548
00:59:32,169 --> 00:59:35,298
Enough for today.
It's getting dark.

549
00:59:36,273 --> 00:59:39,208
I can dig by myself.
You can go home.

550
00:59:41,111 --> 00:59:43,205
Let's go home together.

551
00:59:58,295 --> 01:00:02,198
Sorry, I smudged it.

552
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,090
Don't mind it.

553
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:06,228
I'll pay for it.

554
01:00:06,236 --> 01:00:08,000
I say don't mind it.

555
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:20,113
What are you doing?

556
01:00:20,217 --> 01:00:24,051
You know what?
I hate it. It pricks me.

557
01:00:29,059 --> 01:00:30,083
Let's go home...

558
01:01:03,093 --> 01:01:05,118
An unexploded bomb, really?

559
01:01:05,162 --> 01:01:09,156
I found it by chance.
Like you read in the papers.

560
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:13,000
What if it really explodes?

561
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:14,161
It will not.

562
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:19,140
I wanted to show you before
telling the police.

563
01:01:19,276 --> 01:01:24,180
You seem to understand us, huh?
You can be in our group.

564
01:01:25,015 --> 01:01:25,277
Over there.

565
01:01:26,049 --> 01:01:28,108
Wait, Ko-chan.

566
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:36,025
Ko-chan, Ko-chan,
please come out.

567
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:40,061
Don't leave me alone.

568
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:47,228
What is going on, Ko-chan?
What are you doing, Ko-chan?

569
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:56,103
You, stop!

570
01:02:04,254 --> 01:02:06,188
You can do it too.

571
01:02:06,289 --> 01:02:07,256
<i>But I...</i>

572
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:09,122
Eye for an eye.

573
01:02:12,295 --> 01:02:14,195
Stop!

574
01:02:16,166 --> 01:02:19,101
We are being buried alive!

575
01:02:29,112 --> 01:02:31,080
You do it too!

576
01:02:36,186 --> 01:02:38,280
Stop! Please stop!

577
01:02:40,123 --> 01:02:42,251
You won't call her
a Wolf Girl anymore?

578
01:02:43,193 --> 01:02:45,025
None of my business!

579
01:02:45,228 --> 01:02:47,128
Apologize to her!

580
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:52,160
I am sorry, I am sorry!

581
01:02:56,206 --> 01:03:00,109
Not much injury to the children.

582
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:08,210
Their parents say
it was just a usual kid brawl.

583
01:03:09,152 --> 01:03:12,053
I am really sorry, miss.

584
01:03:13,056 --> 01:03:15,252
Ohta-kun.
You understand what I mean?

585
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:26,034
Your mother is not here?

586
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:30,106
Bringing my brothers,
so will be a little late.

587
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:34,006
Okay...
tell me when she is here.

588
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:47,087
Excuse us.

589
01:03:50,026 --> 01:03:51,994
Mrs. Ohta, I am sorry!

590
01:03:53,196 --> 01:03:54,220
You are...

591
01:03:58,268 --> 01:04:00,134
I am truly sorry!

592
01:04:01,204 --> 01:04:04,071
No, don't mind... It's also him.

593
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:11,241
Keep up your newspaper route.

594
01:04:37,073 --> 01:04:39,201
Why did you hurt your friends?

595
01:04:43,313 --> 01:04:47,181
He was standing up for
Komuro-san.

596
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:53,121
Why, Akira?

597
01:04:54,257 --> 01:04:59,161
Whatever the reason,
you must never hurt others.

598
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:04,124
He didn't mean to hurt...

599
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,032
You stay out of this!

600
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:15,007
Answer me.

601
01:05:17,247 --> 01:05:21,150
Did Tezuka-san, the new girl,
put you up to this?

602
01:05:23,052 --> 01:05:24,281
That is not so, Akira?

603
01:05:24,287 --> 01:05:26,221
You lost your tongue?

604
01:05:28,057 --> 01:05:29,047
Hey...

605
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:31,254
Don't hit him!

606
01:05:34,063 --> 01:05:36,054
What kind of a girl is she?

607
01:05:39,169 --> 01:05:42,195
You shut up when it suits you.

608
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:46,166
When have you become
such a coward?

609
01:05:51,147 --> 01:05:56,108
You didn't watch him good!
I left him in your charge!

610
01:05:56,219 --> 01:05:59,052
He is not a baby anymore.

611
01:05:59,122 --> 01:06:01,181
Do you expect me
to watch over every minutes?

612
01:06:02,025 --> 01:06:04,050
Yes, that's what mothers are for!

613
01:06:04,194 --> 01:06:07,061
Well,
what about the fathers, then?

614
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:08,220
I have my work!

615
01:06:09,032 --> 01:06:13,265
Always work,
you never take the time for him.

616
01:06:13,269 --> 01:06:18,207
How about you?
Not home and a bad mother!

617
01:06:19,275 --> 01:06:23,143
I just teach a knitting class!

618
01:06:23,213 --> 01:06:25,272
Akira and knitting,
which is more important?

619
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:27,207
Akira, of course!

620
01:06:27,217 --> 01:06:29,117
Then quit knitting!

621
01:06:29,219 --> 01:06:31,051
I have things I want to do!

622
01:06:31,087 --> 01:06:34,022
You know much about Tezuka girl?

623
01:06:34,123 --> 01:06:37,058
You don't know who's his friend!

624
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:38,084
Shut up!

625
01:06:39,229 --> 01:06:41,163
I am sick and tired of all!

626
01:06:42,065 --> 01:06:45,126
It's nothing to do with Mom
or Tezuka-san!

627
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:48,971
Akira !?

628
01:07:03,253 --> 01:07:05,119
This is all?

629
01:07:14,097 --> 01:07:16,065
No, Stop, please!

630
01:07:20,103 --> 01:07:25,132
These are not things
you get from other people.

631
01:07:27,277 --> 01:07:29,211
I am so heartbroken.

632
01:07:33,149 --> 01:07:34,173
Sorry.

633
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:39,018
I am sorry.

634
01:07:48,131 --> 01:07:49,189
I am sorry.

635
01:07:52,168 --> 01:07:53,158
I am sorry...

636
01:07:55,238 --> 01:07:57,263
Sorry for calling late.

637
01:08:00,176 --> 01:08:02,201
He is not at Masashi's

638
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,274
He'll be fine.

639
01:08:12,021 --> 01:08:14,183
He doesn't have his jacket on.

640
01:08:21,197 --> 01:08:24,030
Like father, like son...

641
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:11,042
Born to this earth,
this fabulous beauty,

642
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:16,017
I would like to hand her over
to you tonight.

643
01:09:18,054 --> 01:09:20,250
Still a twenty something cute girl.

644
01:09:22,025 --> 01:09:26,155
The thing is that she's got six legs.

645
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:31,259
Please doggy-bag our sushi.
Just octopus legs.

646
01:09:32,235 --> 01:09:35,136
Hundred sushi from her legs alone.

647
01:09:38,041 --> 01:09:44,139
Next up, a shocking act,
more so than the oil shock.

648
01:09:46,249 --> 01:09:49,014
Please be aware,
it is a dangerous act.

649
01:10:27,156 --> 01:10:29,181
Get ready for the next act please!

650
01:10:31,027 --> 01:10:35,123
This one here, when not performing,
has other jobs.

651
01:10:35,164 --> 01:10:37,030
You have seen him elsewhere.

652
01:10:38,201 --> 01:10:43,162
Can't give you details,
the smaller monsters in movies...

653
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:46,031
He is in most of them.

654
01:10:47,276 --> 01:10:50,143
Now,
we are ready for the show.

655
01:10:59,288 --> 01:11:04,089
Just as advertised in the billboard,

656
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:09,031
Beast or human,
here is the Wolf Girl!

657
01:11:12,034 --> 01:11:17,268
Oh, oh.
A sinister cage before you!

658
01:11:19,008 --> 01:11:23,206
Don't worry,
it won't bite, so come closer.

659
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:29,241
But quietly, quietly,
it does react to noise.

660
01:11:35,057 --> 01:11:38,083
So we open it slowly...

661
01:11:46,235 --> 01:11:49,227
See it? Please, no sound.

662
01:11:50,206 --> 01:11:53,232
See? Do you see? No? Not yet?

663
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:57,135
You don't see? Well then!

664
01:11:57,246 --> 01:12:04,084
Especially for you tonight,
we will open the cage!

665
01:12:07,256 --> 01:12:11,250
Normally she lives in this cage.

666
01:12:12,028 --> 01:12:15,987
She still bites sometimes,
but tonight will be OK.

667
01:12:16,098 --> 01:12:19,068
She feels easy
with this keeper lady.

668
01:12:20,102 --> 01:12:24,164
OK, come out, come out!

669
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:32,171
This young girl eats
no rice or bread.

670
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:36,115
Still remembers
being raised by the wolves.

671
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:40,045
Her food is mostly
snakes and frogs alive.

672
01:12:40,156 --> 01:12:45,094
We'll let you see her
eat in action.

673
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:51,224
My, so many audiences have her
little blood running.

674
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:02,102
She's been with us
for half a year now.

675
01:13:02,144 --> 01:13:06,980
Yet I still misunderstand
her feelings?

676
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:10,110
Oh, no! Don't you bite me!
Let me go!

677
01:13:11,187 --> 01:13:15,124
Let go, will you!

678
01:13:53,129 --> 01:13:54,119
Akira-kun!

679
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:59,223
What's up?
We got a phone call from your mother.

680
01:14:02,138 --> 01:14:05,199
Akira-kun, what is wrong?

681
01:14:06,142 --> 01:14:08,201
I came to look for you.

682
01:14:15,084 --> 01:14:18,247
You are a little strange
these days.

683
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:24,025
You don't play with me much,
but only with the girls.

684
01:14:25,094 --> 01:14:30,225
I told your mother. You've been
strange since Tezuka-san came.

685
01:14:31,267 --> 01:14:36,171
But I didn't mention you being
made to stand or about Komuro.

686
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:39,138
It was Tezuka-san.

687
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:45,011
The Wolf Girl... I saw her...

688
01:14:45,281 --> 01:14:47,079
What are you saying?

689
01:14:47,116 --> 01:14:48,106
Don't come near me!

690
01:14:49,018 --> 01:14:50,042
Akira-kun!

691
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:55,206
Damn it!

692
01:15:58,187 --> 01:15:59,279
Why?

693
01:16:03,259 --> 01:16:04,988
Can't be!

694
01:16:07,296 --> 01:16:08,991
Can't be!

695
01:16:17,006 --> 01:16:17,996
Damn it!

696
01:16:21,143 --> 01:16:24,078
Thought we'll be here
for the winter.

697
01:16:27,049 --> 01:16:29,177
What is this suddenly?

698
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:33,984
You were upset about
not going to the bigger shrine.

699
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:37,248
I don't want to go anywhere.

700
01:16:44,033 --> 01:16:47,264
If we stay here longer,
we'll starve.

701
01:16:48,137 --> 01:16:52,096
I don't care...
I want to go to school.

702
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:55,039
There are schools where we go.

703
01:16:55,211 --> 01:17:02,015
I don't want a new school.
I like it here. I want to STAY!

704
01:17:19,101 --> 01:17:21,069
You can leave me here.

705
01:17:26,142 --> 01:17:28,110
No one will take you in.

706
01:17:31,213 --> 01:17:33,238
I can live on my own.

707
01:17:35,284 --> 01:17:37,150
Stop it!

708
01:17:46,095 --> 01:17:49,998
You are ten now. But still...

709
01:17:51,066 --> 01:17:54,195
you are just ten, Hana-chan.

710
01:18:09,318 --> 01:18:10,285
Akira!

711
01:18:14,056 --> 01:18:15,023
Akira!

712
01:18:56,065 --> 01:18:57,123
Akira...

713
01:18:59,301 --> 01:19:01,030
Akira!

714
01:19:02,137 --> 01:19:06,040
Got to rescue... the Wolf Girl...

715
01:19:07,042 --> 01:19:08,168
Got to rescue her...

716
01:19:54,056 --> 01:19:56,081
You were sleep for so long.

717
01:19:58,027 --> 01:19:59,256
Be good and rest.

718
01:20:05,267 --> 01:20:07,031
That is...

719
01:20:08,037 --> 01:20:12,065
Untwining Father's one.
It's for you.

720
01:20:14,043 --> 01:20:15,010
Why?

721
01:20:16,145 --> 01:20:21,015
His was getting all worn out.

722
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:24,151
I am going to use
the unworn parts.

723
01:20:27,289 --> 01:20:29,053
I don't want it.

724
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:33,126
Your favorite color.

725
01:20:39,134 --> 01:20:42,126
I'll knit Father a new one
next year.

726
01:20:42,271 --> 01:20:45,263
Dad's still
going to be here then?

727
01:20:46,175 --> 01:20:48,075
Why, of course.

728
01:20:49,011 --> 01:20:51,070
Not getting divorced?

729
01:20:51,213 --> 01:20:54,274
Why would you think so?

730
01:20:55,184 --> 01:20:58,119
But you were talking about it.

731
01:21:02,191 --> 01:21:07,061
Oh, that was about
Father's colleague.

732
01:21:07,196 --> 01:21:10,222
He was our matchmaker.

733
01:21:19,007 --> 01:21:22,204
I will quit teaching
at Canary Fancy Store.

734
01:21:23,011 --> 01:21:24,035
Why?

735
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:29,046
Rather knit and
wait for you at home.

736
01:21:34,256 --> 01:21:37,226
Rumiko?
No granddaughter by that name.

737
01:21:39,027 --> 01:21:41,086
This isn't the Tezuka residence?

738
01:21:41,263 --> 01:21:43,288
We are the Tachibanas.

739
01:22:14,997 --> 01:22:16,123
What are you doing?

740
01:22:19,234 --> 01:22:21,999
I say, what are you doing?

741
01:22:22,204 --> 01:22:24,138
None of your business!

742
01:22:25,274 --> 01:22:27,106
Hey, wait...

743
01:22:33,081 --> 01:22:35,072
...Want to know something juicy?

744
01:22:55,103 --> 01:23:00,041
"Departure"

745
01:23:09,051 --> 01:23:10,109
Which is next?

746
01:23:10,285 --> 01:23:11,275
There.

747
01:23:17,226 --> 01:23:18,193
Next?

748
01:23:28,103 --> 01:23:32,006
Hideko-chan,
let me help you out.

749
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:36,103
Where is your house?

750
01:23:37,079 --> 01:23:38,046
What?

751
01:23:39,181 --> 01:23:43,118
I couldn't find it on the hills.

752
01:23:46,188 --> 01:23:51,126
I am staying at a hotel now.

753
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:53,150
A hotel?

754
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:58,193
Top floor of a big hotel,
the view is great.

755
01:24:00,002 --> 01:24:02,130
...you can come visit me.
You're my friend.

756
01:24:03,071 --> 01:24:04,095
Stop it!

757
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:09,034
...you are just rich...
you pity me.

758
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:11,043
So you've been kind to me.

759
01:24:11,079 --> 01:24:12,069
That is not it.

760
01:24:12,147 --> 01:24:14,013
No more gifts!

761
01:24:15,117 --> 01:24:16,084
Wait!

762
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:20,078
Hate <i>you...</i>
I hate you the most!

763
01:24:50,052 --> 01:24:51,042
Morning.

764
01:24:54,122 --> 01:24:55,146
Morning.

765
01:24:55,257 --> 01:24:57,089
Good morning.

766
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:06,190
Morning.

767
01:25:08,203 --> 01:25:10,001
...how's your bruises?

768
01:25:19,247 --> 01:25:24,242
Ohta-kun still may not be
able to make it today.

769
01:25:26,021 --> 01:25:28,183
Komuro-san will be late.

770
01:25:29,191 --> 01:25:30,181
I know.

771
01:25:32,194 --> 01:25:38,031
I thought you could
still stay here longer.

772
01:25:41,003 --> 01:25:42,129
When will we tell?

773
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:12,190
Good morning.

774
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:20,040
We'll have a stay-over tonight.
Do you want to come?

775
01:26:20,242 --> 01:26:22,142
...Got to go somewhere today.

776
01:26:22,277 --> 01:26:26,009
Be on TV in Tokyo, maybe?

777
01:26:27,015 --> 01:26:27,243
...Right.

778
01:26:28,050 --> 01:26:31,076
You are a consummate liar,
aren't you?

779
01:26:32,087 --> 01:26:35,079
You are the spectacle
at freak show.

780
01:26:35,257 --> 01:26:38,090
You are the real Wolf Girl.

781
01:26:38,226 --> 01:26:42,026
Awful.
Fooling them to earn money.

782
01:26:43,098 --> 01:26:46,124
Masashi-kun told me.
Ohta-kun saw you there.

783
01:26:47,135 --> 01:26:52,073
That's why you are nice to her.
Poor Komuro-san!

784
01:26:52,107 --> 01:26:53,165
No, it's not!

785
01:26:54,076 --> 01:26:56,044
No... It's not that.

786
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:58,035
Don't come near me! Disgusting!

787
01:26:58,180 --> 01:26:59,079
It is not true!

788
01:26:59,114 --> 01:27:00,275
Stop it, Wolf Girl!

789
01:27:01,049 --> 01:27:02,210
It's all wrong!

790
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:03,207
Stop it!

791
01:27:04,086 --> 01:27:07,147
She is bullying Mizuguchi-san!

792
01:27:07,189 --> 01:27:09,157
You've got it wrong!

793
01:27:54,169 --> 01:27:55,159
Yes.

794
01:27:59,207 --> 01:28:03,075
Hello. How is Akira-kun?

795
01:28:04,045 --> 01:28:07,037
...you are... Tezuka-san?

796
01:28:08,116 --> 01:28:09,140
Yes, I am.

797
01:28:16,057 --> 01:28:20,051
Come in. Its cold out there.

798
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:27,098
Just a second.

799
01:28:43,051 --> 01:28:45,145
Akira... are you asleep?

800
01:28:53,094 --> 01:28:57,156
I am sorry. He is still not well.

801
01:29:10,011 --> 01:29:12,275
These are from school.

802
01:29:15,116 --> 01:29:17,084
Thank you.

803
01:29:20,155 --> 01:29:24,023
I knit this. If you like...

804
01:29:24,259 --> 01:29:29,026
...I am not cold. Good bye.

805
01:29:54,189 --> 01:29:56,055
Is this OK?

806
01:29:57,058 --> 01:30:00,050
Don't you use the same books?

807
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:11,228
"Wolf Girl"

808
01:30:16,044 --> 01:30:22,108
See Hanako the Wolf Girl.
This is her last performance!

809
01:30:22,183 --> 01:30:27,121
By cruel fate or God's bidding?

810
01:30:27,188 --> 01:30:31,147
Born deep inside
the wilderness of Hokkaido.

811
01:30:31,226 --> 01:30:35,220
Left to die by her poor father.

812
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:41,168
The cute child was
brought up by wolves.

813
01:30:41,236 --> 01:30:45,969
Better to have been
eaten up instead,

814
01:30:46,007 --> 01:30:52,174
At age 10, and devours chickens,
snakes, frogs all alive...

815
01:31:20,208 --> 01:31:21,198
I am off now.

816
01:32:05,253 --> 01:32:08,018
"To Hideko-chan"

817
01:32:08,123 --> 01:32:12,993
"So sorry you got scolded
by your Mom because of me..."

818
01:32:28,243 --> 01:32:31,110
"I am sorry that I lied to you."

819
01:32:32,113 --> 01:32:37,108
"I am not rich at all.
I don't have a father nor a mother."

820
01:32:42,157 --> 01:32:45,218
"I never thought that I was lonely."

821
01:32:46,094 --> 01:32:50,258
"But when I met your mother,
I felt envy for the first time..."

822
01:32:53,268 --> 01:32:56,260
"If I had a mother
like yours or Akira-kun's,"

823
01:32:57,005 --> 01:33:00,100
"how happy life would be..."

824
01:33:11,052 --> 01:33:13,282
"I'm going now
to somewhere far away."

825
01:33:14,155 --> 01:33:17,989
"Wanted to talk so much more
with you."

826
01:33:20,128 --> 01:33:24,258
"I don't need the school bag,
so I want you to have it."

827
01:33:26,034 --> 01:33:30,062
"I never pitied you, you know."

828
01:33:31,139 --> 01:33:36,134
"I like you so much.
Thank you so much. Good bye."

829
01:33:36,277 --> 01:33:37,972
What is it?

830
01:33:44,018 --> 01:33:44,985
Katoh-san

831
01:33:46,054 --> 01:33:47,044
Komuro-san

832
01:33:48,056 --> 01:33:49,251
Naomi Takahashi-san

833
01:33:50,191 --> 01:33:51,283
Mizuki Takahashi-san

834
01:33:52,193 --> 01:33:53,183
Tukada-san

835
01:33:54,129 --> 01:33:55,119
Tezuka-san

836
01:33:56,097 --> 01:33:57,121
Nakagawa-san

837
01:33:58,066 --> 01:33:59,124
Numata-san

838
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:01,064
Nogami-san

839
01:34:01,202 --> 01:34:02,135
Handa-san

840
01:34:03,071 --> 01:34:04,163
Fujishiro-san

841
01:34:04,272 --> 01:34:06,001
Mamiya-san

842
01:34:06,141 --> 01:34:07,165
Morishita-san

843
01:34:07,275 --> 01:34:09,004
Yoshida-san

844
01:34:10,245 --> 01:34:11,235
Teacher!

845
01:34:12,247 --> 01:34:14,113
Yes, Naitoh-kun?

846
01:34:16,217 --> 01:34:21,246
You said that we couldn't go to
the Show Tent, that still true?

847
01:34:22,157 --> 01:34:25,218
It is not for school kids.

848
01:34:26,127 --> 01:34:29,097
Then is it OK to be in the Show?

849
01:34:33,067 --> 01:34:35,001
What do you want to say?

850
01:34:35,170 --> 01:34:42,133
The Wolf Girl Show,
Hide-kc Komuro is in it.

851
01:34:47,115 --> 01:34:48,276
Wolf Girl...?

852
01:34:51,085 --> 01:34:53,019
See, the Wolf Girl!

853
01:34:53,121 --> 01:35:00,050
Wolf Girl! Wolf Girl!

854
01:35:03,164 --> 01:35:04,256
Stop it!

855
01:35:07,135 --> 01:35:12,130
Who is saying this?
I hate these kind of lies!

856
01:35:12,273 --> 01:35:16,039
It is not a lie. Toru saw it.

857
01:35:23,051 --> 01:35:26,282
Come to the Teacher's Office later.

858
01:35:28,056 --> 01:35:31,253
I heard Tezuka -san
was the Wolf Girl.

859
01:35:34,262 --> 01:35:36,094
Akira-kun, I am sorry!

860
01:35:39,067 --> 01:35:43,163
I too think that
Tezuka-san is the One.

861
01:35:43,171 --> 01:35:48,075
Ridiculous!
Komuro is the Wolf Girl. Right, Toru?

862
01:35:48,142 --> 01:35:49,109
Yeah!

863
01:35:52,146 --> 01:35:56,174
Teacher!
I cannot be in the same class with her!

864
01:36:02,190 --> 01:36:03,214
Me too!

865
01:36:04,025 --> 01:36:04,253
Me too!

866
01:36:06,294 --> 01:36:07,261
Me too!

867
01:36:07,295 --> 01:36:12,165
Quiet! No howling!

868
01:36:13,268 --> 01:36:14,235
Teacher!

869
01:36:16,037 --> 01:36:18,165
No, Ohta-kun, you don't.

870
01:36:18,306 --> 01:36:22,038
All wrong!
She isn't the Wolf Girl!

871
01:36:22,176 --> 01:36:26,113
I went to see-t it! I just had to!

872
01:36:27,248 --> 01:36:30,218
But Tezuka -san
isn't the Wolf Girl!

873
01:36:36,024 --> 01:36:38,152
That's right! We saw wrong!

874
01:36:42,063 --> 01:36:46,227
So Komuro is the Wolf Girl.
Definitely not Tezuka!

875
01:36:46,301 --> 01:36:47,234
Quiet!

876
01:36:47,268 --> 01:36:49,100
It isn't Komuro-san...

877
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:55,977
I went to see though
I was told not to.

878
01:36:57,011 --> 01:36:59,070
But it wasn't Tezuka-san.

879
01:36:59,247 --> 01:37:01,181
Not Komuro-san, too.

880
01:37:04,218 --> 01:37:06,209
No one in our class.

881
01:37:11,092 --> 01:37:12,150
Sit down.

882
01:37:15,096 --> 01:37:16,188
Sit.

883
01:37:19,233 --> 01:37:21,099
You two, too.

884
01:37:26,074 --> 01:37:28,270
I thought
I would wait till the end.

885
01:37:30,111 --> 01:37:32,045
But I will tell you now.

886
01:37:34,215 --> 01:37:39,119
Tezuka-san is
transferring to another school.

887
01:37:42,290 --> 01:37:45,157
Leaving this afternoon.

888
01:37:47,061 --> 01:37:53,296
She said she had a short
but a wonderful time with you all.

889
01:37:56,037 --> 01:38:01,134
And you are still calling her
a Wolf Girl?

890
01:38:16,190 --> 01:38:17,214
Ohta-kun!

891
01:38:18,226 --> 01:38:21,161
Let's go! To see Rumiko-chan!

892
01:38:29,203 --> 01:38:30,261
Ohta-kun!

893
01:39:06,207 --> 01:39:07,174
Here.

894
01:39:12,079 --> 01:39:14,241
Said good-bye to your friends?

895
01:39:16,184 --> 01:39:20,280
I have no friends.
I want to leave now!

896
01:39:21,289 --> 01:39:26,090
You begged not to go.
What is this change?

897
01:39:43,177 --> 01:39:47,080
I said horrible things to Tezuka-san.

898
