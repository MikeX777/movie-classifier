So what do you say, vince?
Not bad, huh?

37
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:58,640
Not bad?
It stinks.

38
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,670
The next one we do has
got to have more punch.

39
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:03,640
Is that why the record company
sent us back here to shoot it?

40
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,480
To give you some
hometown inspiration?

41
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,010
Sure.
Once we get there

42
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,320
we can take it,
experiment, play around

43
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,980
till we come up
with something original.

44
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,220
What's going on back there?

45
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,790
Very funny.
Very funny.

46
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,200
How many years is it since
you last went back home, vince?

47
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,500
Nearly 20.

48
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,810
Old joss is the only one
left now.

49
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,380
He's the caretaker. He's been
alone in the house all these years.

50
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,580
Joss...

51
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,510
I can hardly remember his face.

52
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,850
He was already old when I left.

53
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,590
We kids used to rib him about
the way he shook all the time.

54
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,690
We were always asking him
to make us malts.

55
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:32,690
Lousy weather.

56
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,490
It sure is.
Goddamn fog.

57
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,600
Oh, jeez, another roadblock.

58
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,870
We only just left one.

59
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,770
Looks like all the cops in
this county are out tonight.

60
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,640
They're making a whole big deal

61
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,610
about those mad dogs.

62
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,250
The camper's mine.
It's registered.

63
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,620
I used to live up here.

64
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,950
We're coming to shoot
a rock video.

65
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,060
Vince roberts.

66
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:13,830
Ain't you lou and
martha roberts's boy?

67
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,860
Well, I'll be.

68
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,960
Vince raven...

69
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,400
The guy who sings
"my mother's gone"?

70
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,840
Uh-huh.

71
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,970
Holy shit.
Imagine meeting you.

72
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,940
I can't tell one of these
newfangled songs from another,

73
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,040
but if you really are
lou and martha's boy,

74
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,850
you sure as hell
should remember me.

75
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,580
Sheriff morrison.

76
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,790
Yeah, I remember.
I used to sit on your lap

77
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,120
and piss all over
your pants, right?

78
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,990
That's right, boy.

79
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,890
You was more full of water than hoover dam.

80
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,560
And now he's a rock singer, huh?

81
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,030
Just sounds like
a big pisser to me.

82
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,370
Flesh and blood,

83
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,400
as I live and breathe.

84
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,570
It's been a long time
since I last saw you, boy.

85
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,110
Since your father had...

86
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,910
Oh, yes, I remember.

87
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,780
Well, if it's okay with you,
guys, we'd like to go now.

88
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,680
The caretaker's waiting up for us

89
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:10,920
and it's really
getting cold out here.

90
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:13,520
Okay,

91
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,960
but you know about the dogs,
don't you?

92
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,020
Yeah, we'll watch out.

93
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,630
There already have been
five deaths in the area.

94
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,860
Five?
At the other roadblocks

95
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,530
they only mentioned two deaths.

96
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,500
Well, now there's three more

97
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,970
to chalk up to the damn dogs.

98
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,410
The samples family...

99
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,140
Bill, Jennifer
and peter samples...

100
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,910
Butchered like hogs.

101
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:43,520
It was difficult to tell

102
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,320
which bit came from where,

103
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,020
just like last time.

104
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,520
Why, what was left

105
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,590
you could put in a plastic bag this big.

106
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,670
Okay, kids,

107
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,200
you can go now,

108
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,140
but be careful.

109
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,840
Vince knows what
these dogs can do.

110
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,580
Barricade yourselves in
when you get to the house.

111
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,550
Back the car up.

112
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,280
You sure picked a fine time

113
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,320
to come back home, vince.

114
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,350
Folks around here ain't forgot

115
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:24,020
that story about your daddy,
you know.

116
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,590
Well, take care, boy.

117
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:30,300
Make sure there are weapons in the house

118
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,930
and don't let nobody in.

119
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,940
Slow down, vince.

120
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,640
I'm crawling as it is.

121
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,680
Vince,

122
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:44,110
what was all that
about your father?

123
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,380
Okay.

124
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:52,390
If you don't want
to talk about it,

125
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,350
it's all the same to me.

126
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,590
I'd rather not talk about it.

127
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:00,160
- I thought...
- I said I don't want to talk about it.

128
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,200
All right.

129
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,400
All right.

130
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,740
I'm sorry.

131
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,920
Vince, how are you going
to find the way to the house?

132
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,420
With my nose.

133
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,620
What are you laughing about?
I'm not kidding.

134
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,490
When I was a kid
I could find my way home

135
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,260
- just by the smell.
- What smell?

136
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:35,290
The bullshit.
It's unmistakable.

137
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:50,010
Hey.

138
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,010
What's gotten into you?

139
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:55,010
I saw something move over there.

140
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:57,080
I don't see nothing.

141
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,920
Maybe it was one of them things,

142
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,990
one of them dogs.

143
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,820
Well, I guess we'd better
go take a look.

144
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,430
What do we do if they attack?

145
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,930
Bleed, I guess.

146
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,080
♪ Whoopee-ti-yi-yo

147
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,180
♪ come along,
little doggie... ♪

148
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,880
- Sheriff.
- I'm right here, dan.

149
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,780
Got a pack of doggy cookies with you?
Might come in handy.

150
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:38,520
Come on out.

151
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,830
Show yourselves, you damn dogs.

152
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,540
I'll pop lead into
every last one of you.

153
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,340
Yes, sirree.

154
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:10,760
Hey, sheriff.
Sheriff, where are you?

155
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,830
Sheriff, answer me.

156
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,600
Don't get too far away.

157
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,520
Sheriff, for christ sakes,
answer me.

158
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,470
Sheriff?

159
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,630
Vince, look out!

160
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,240
God.

161
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,580
Easy, vince.
It wasn't your fault.

162
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:43,920
Oh, that poor dog.
What if we killed it?

163
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:47,320
Jordan, frank, I found it.

164
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,790
He's alive, but not for long.

165
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,460
At this rate, we may not be
either. Those dogs could be everywhere.

166
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,300
She's right.
Let's beat it.

167
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,900
In a second.
Jordan, switch on the emergency lights

168
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,800
before someone rams the camper.

169
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,540
And frank, let's move the
dog over to the side of the road.

170
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,210
Okay.

171
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,800
- Vince, don't.
- He has to.

172
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,810
Come on, let's get back
to the camper.

173
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:49,220
Who are you?

174
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,580
Now you've done it.

175
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,320
Can you feel the wind?

176
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,890
The wind is lifting the fog

177
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:02,800
and blowing away the clouds

178
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,760
that cover the moon.

179
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,970
Now he's back at last.

180
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,440
He will command the house.

181
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,970
And all of you...

182
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:15,410
All of you will die.

183
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,810
- It was an accident.
- All of you will die.

184
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,950
Can't you see he's crazy?
Make him go away!

185
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,950
You are already dead.

186
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,850
All of you are already dead.

187
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,320
His dogs will not spare you.

188
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:34,060
He'll find you wherever you go.

189
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:37,360
And when the moon shines again,

190
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,500
you will all die.

191
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,970
Wait. Let's get you
to a hospital.

192
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,900
Hold it, vince.
If there's something out there,

193
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,740
we'd better all stick together.

194
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,080
He was covered with blood.
He needs help.

195
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,380
My god, what's that?

196
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,310
The dogs must have attacked him.

197
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,380
Let's go away, please.
Let's get back

198
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,250
into the camper
before it's too late.

199
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:02,390
Yeah, vince,
let's get out of here.

200
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,420
I'm going.

201
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:08,060
I can't just drive off
and leave him.

202
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:10,000
Okay, so I'll drive.

203
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,960
Hey, wait a minute, vince.

204
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You're crazy to go
out there on your own.

205
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:17,400
You're all chicken.
Wait, vince.

206
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,870
I'm coming with you.

207
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,510
Here, put this on.

208
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,780
Vince, we've got to find him.

209
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:04,080
Sure we do.
He'd be great for our video.

210
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,150
I don't think
that's at all funny.

211
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,550
Lighten up.
What's eating you?

212
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,520
I don't know,

213
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,060
but I have a feeling,
something would like to.

214
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,930
Vince, what's that?

215
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:24,870
In the camper, quick, everyone.

216
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,090
Come on, vince.

217
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,320
I want to know what went on in the woods.

218
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,330
Nothing, man.
I didn't touch her.

219
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,400
- What about the old man?
- Didn't touch him either.

220
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,280
Joss.

221
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,220
I haven't had a welcome like
this since I came back from camp.

222
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,260
And they used
the same banner then.

223
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:18,520
They don't throw their
money around, these country folk.

224
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,990
Local boy comes home a star.
"welcome, vincent"...

225
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,030
- How about that?
- Hey, joss, we're here.

226
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,130
Joss.

227
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,940
Hey, joss, where are you?

228
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:36,010
The welcome seemed warmer out there

229
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,240
- than it does in here.
- You can say that again.

230
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:41,780
Joss?

231
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,950
Quit hiding out on me, will you?

232
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,460
I wonder where
the old guy's got to.

233
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,000
Let's try the kitchen.

234
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,900
Sandra, come on.

235
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,110
How are we supposed
to shoot a video in here?

236
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,710
There's not enough light
to take a pee.

237
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,180
Vince said we needed something new.

238
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:15,680
- How about 10 minutes of total black?
- Revolutionary.

239
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,680
He's got to be here somewhere.

240
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,290
Joss.
Hey, joss.

241
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,960
Well,
at least he put in some good work

242
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,790
before he disappeared.

243
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,490
Mm, right on.

244
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,900
You guys wait here, okay?

245
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,870
Okay.

246
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,440
- I'll just be a minute.
- Sure thing.

247
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,180
- Jordan, want a beer?
- Sure. Thanks.

248
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,530
- Wowee.
- What have you found?

249
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,230
Another tray.
Good old joss.

250
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,230
Mm, I'm starving.

251
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,400
- Leave a few for vince.
- He's too busy looking for joss.

252
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,640
These look even
better than the others.

253
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,840
Angela, why don't you
eat something?

254
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,580
I'm not hungry.

255
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:03,720
You don't know
what you're missing.

256
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,280
We're not safe here.

257
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,590
I've got a strange
feeling about it.

258
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,950
Angela, for god's sake.

259
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,360
There are some things I feel.

260
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:13,360
I sense them.

261
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,230
We're in danger here.

262
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:18,630
The old man was right.
We should never have come.

263
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:21,330
Horrible things
are going to happen here.

264
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:09,680
Can you feel the wind?

265
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,890
The wind is lifting the fog.

266
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,390
He will command the house

267
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:18,920
and all of you will die.

268
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:24,530
You are all going to die.

269
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,270
You are all dead.

270
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,240
They have come for you.

271
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:33,740
They're his.

272
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,340
Go away!

273
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,340
No, leave me alone!

274
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,310
You're horrible!

275
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,080
I warned you.

276
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,520
You should never
have come to this house.

277
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,490
You will all die.

278
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,460
You're going to die too.

279
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:31,100
It's no use trying to resist.

280
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:34,070
You are all doomed.

281
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,750
Help me.

282
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,960
Your singer...

283
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,930
He is the killer.

284
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,170
You will see.

285
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,370
Only he will escape the dogs.

286
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,350
If you come out now,

287
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:27,590
perhaps he will spare you

288
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:30,860
because you're
so young and pretty.

289
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:39,430
You're trying
to trick me, old man.

290
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:43,570
I know you're lying.

291
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,240
Vince is our friend.

292
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:48,210
I know he is.

293
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,180
He's our friend.

294
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,710
And now it's you
that's gonna die.

295
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,460
Vince.

296
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,830
Can you hear me?

297
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,560
Vince.

298
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,100
Watch out for the old man.

299
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:16,170
He's trying to kill us,

300
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,670
but we'll kill him first.

301
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,670
We'll kill him before he gets the chance.

302
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:24,610
Right, vince?

303
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,050
Vince, where are you?

304
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:36,720
So you think I'm lying, do you?

305
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,420
You'll soon find out

306
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,890
who your singer is.

307
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,200
Vince! I knew
you were still alive.

308
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:55,970
Do you hear me?

309
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,940
Hey, vince,

310
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,910
it's me, angela.

311
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:02,410
No!

312
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,680
No!
I don't want to die!

313
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,820
- Leave me alone!
- Angela, what are you talking about?

314
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:09,960
It's okay.
Wake up.

315
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:12,660
- Go away!
- What's going on? What happened?

316
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:14,730
Wake up, angela.

317
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,000
- What the hell's going on?
- What's the problem?

318
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,960
It's all over, honey.

319
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
It's all over.
You're all right now.

320
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:25,500
- What's wrong with her?
- She's had a nightmare.

321
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:28,310
It was a signal.

322
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,880
You changed into a...

323
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:35,550
And you killed everybody...
Everybody except me.

324
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,280
I call that discrimination.

325
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,580
- Right on.
- Yeah.

326
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,720
Vince, you can't play
favors with friends.

327
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:44,120
Either you wipe out everybody or no one.

328
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:47,390
But then he almost killed me.

329
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:49,960
There was the old man too,

330
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,660
the one we met on the road.

331
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,300
Before, you said
I'd changed into something.

332
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,870
What was it?

333
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:04,640
You changed into a... a werewolf.

334
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:11,350
Can you see vince
transformed into a werewolf?

335
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,390
Just think of vince

336
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,220
covered with hair,
howling at the moon.

337
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:18,380
She's sleeping now.

338
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,790
And the others have gone
back to bed too.

339
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:31,200
Only now I can't get back to sleep.

340
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:34,430
Neither can you,
from what I see.

341
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:38,840
What are you reading?

342
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:42,340
Oh, vince,
you're not letting angela get to you?

343
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:45,180
Forget her nightmares.

344
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:48,910
We're grown-up people,
vince, rational and...

345
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,920
That thing we saw in the
woods wasn't normal or rational.

346
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:55,090
"Werewolves:

347
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,120
Myths, legends

348
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,560
and scientific
realities."

349
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:03,260
Just what exactly are

350
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,860
the scientific realities?

351
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,670
There's a disease...
A heart disease

352
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:12,240
that transforms the patient
into some kind of madman,

353
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:14,970
a beast that goes howling
at the moon like a wolf.

354
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:16,980
What?
That's crazy.

355
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:19,610
That thing we saw out there

356
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,150
was an animal of some kind,

357
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,120
not a man.

358
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,120
Listen, werewolves do exist.

359
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:28,190
Oh, bullshit, vince.

360
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,160
The year 2000 is
just around the corner.

361
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:34,360
I am a recognized expert
in electronic videos.

362
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:37,530
And you are the hottest
rock 'n' roll star in the world.

363
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,600
You're making records,
videos, movies

364
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:42,630
on high-tech
electronic equipment

365
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,600
of fantastic sophistication.

366
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,640
You can get on a plane tonight

367
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:48,640
and be in australia tomorrow.

368
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:51,680
And you're scared of werewolves?

369
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:54,710
20 years ago something terrible

370
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:57,150
happened here.
And it's happening again.

371
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,180
Entire families were wiped out

372
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,190
by a pack of killer dogs.

373
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,190
They weren't normal dogs.
These dogs were

374
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,260
more unpredictable
and more intelligent.

375
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:07,830
The people went crazy.
They needed a scapegoat

376
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,300
so they accused my father.

377
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:14,030
Oh...

378
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:16,100
your father?

379
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:18,070
Yes, my father.

380
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,870
He was afflicted with that
disease I was telling you about.

381
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:23,440
Sometimes when the moon
was full he'd leave the house

382
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,880
and go wandering through
the fields like an animal.

383
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:28,950
One time my mother found
him underneath a bush.

384
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,550
His hands and his mouth
were covered with blood

385
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,520
and next to him on the ground

386
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:35,550
were the remains of a baby calf.

387
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,590
He'd ripped the guts out
and eaten them.

388
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:40,060
- Oh my god.
- The neighbors were convinced

389
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:42,560
that he was the cause
of all the atrocities.

390
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:45,160
They came to the house
and dragged him out.

391
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,070
My mother and I
tried to stop them,

392
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,800
but it was useless.

393
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,400
They slaughtered him.

394
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,510
They stabbed him to death
with pitchforks.

395
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:56,210
They doused him with
gasoline and set him on fire.

396
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,240
Oh, vince, forgive me.

397
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,880
How was I to know?

398
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:05,220
But you must try to understand

399
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,920
that this has nothing
to do with werewolves,

400
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:10,560
just a pack of
ordinary stray dogs.

401
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,460
And that creature
we saw out there?

402
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:15,530
That was a dog too.

403
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,000
He was a bit bigger than normal,
that's all.

404
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:20,300
Maybe he was sick.

405
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:22,330
After all,

406
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:25,700
we only saw it for a second.

407
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,250
You sure are something,

408
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,280
you know that, sandra?

409
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:38,350
Do you know something, vince?

410
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,320
As soon as we deliver
this video job,

411
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:43,160
we're heading
straight for moorea...

412
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,890
One of the 130
polynesian islands...

413
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,990
Floating in crystal clear water,

414
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:52,060
two weeks of nude sunbathing

415
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,030
coconut drinks

416
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:58,140
and making love.

417
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,240
I love you, vince.

418
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:02,310
I can't stand
seeing you like this.

419
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:18,260
You go to bed now.
I'll be up in a minute.

420
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:20,590
Okay.

421
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:30,900
Don't be long.

422
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,870
I won't.

423
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:14,380

Give me a hand.
Turn him over.

492
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,880
Oh, god, it's joss.

493
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:58,950
Joss?

494
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:01,290
Why would anyone want
to kill an old caretaker?

495
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,320
I don't know.

496
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:05,260
Take it easy, angela.
Take it easy.

497
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:06,760
Come on, up you get.

498
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:08,790
Here, let me give you a hand.

499
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:10,600
It's okay.

500
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,600
You'll be all right now.

501
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,500
Here, blow your nose.

502
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:16,430
That's the way.
Come and lie down.

503
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:19,240
No, I don't want to lie down!

504
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:21,270
I want to get away
from this house.

505
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:23,940
I told you we should never have come here.

506
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:25,810
Angie, you've got to calm down.

507
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:29,010
Okay, guys,
I want to check out what went on up there.

508
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:30,980
Does anyone want to come along?

509
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:09,190
Looks like there's been
one hell of a struggle here.

510
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:11,220
Hey, guys,

511
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:15,060
maybe whoever it was dropped this before.
What do you think?

512
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:29,970
I don't get it.

513
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:32,010
Why would anyone
want to kill joss?

514
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,050
But if the dogs did it,

515
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,410
they could still be
in the house.

516
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:39,320
Hey, guys, where is angela?

517
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:41,250
She must still be
in the living room.

518
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:43,220
Come on, we mustn't
leave her alone.

519
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,300
Thank god you've got
guns in this house.

520
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:56,870
Looks like we may need them.

521
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,940
We've looked everywhere.
She's not in the house.

522
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:05,740
I'm going outside to look for her.
You stay here

523
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:08,450
- and barricade yourselves in.
- What if you don't find her?

524
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,410
If I'm not back by sundown,
leave without me.

525
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:13,150
- Are you crazy?
- No, I mean it.

526
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:15,150
Are we all agreed then?

527
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:18,360
Well, only if you swear

528
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:21,130
not to take any risks, okay?

529
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,860
Sure.
And don't open up to anybody.

530
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:26,230
I'm going to call the police.

531
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:28,200
I'll go with you.

532
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:33,570
The line's dead.

533
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,540
This is all getting

534
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:37,570
like a nightmare, marilou.

535
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:40,750
Yeah, just like angela's
nightmare, right?

536
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:45,080
That's done.
Ed's finished his little job.

537
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,300
This here is a bullet

538
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:02,000
that will pierce
vince roberts's heart.

539
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,710
Hey, we've got company.

540
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,760
Was vince expecting anyone?

541
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:26,260
Not that he told me.

542
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:38,040
Here, take this.

543
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:53,450
Keep your guns up.

544
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,240
Howdy, folks.

545
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:17,780
Is vince roberts with you all?

546
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:19,710
No,

547
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:21,850
but he should be back soon.

548
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,850
We're after them damn dogs.

549
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,950
We ain't seen no sign of them

550
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:28,520
around here.
How about you?

551
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:30,550
Not yet.

552
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:33,320
But if they do show up,
we're ready for them.

553
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,930
Good, sonny.

554
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:39,100
That sure is good to know.

555
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:43,230
Angela.

556
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,540
Angela.

557
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,670
Angela!

558
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:02,020
You know, I'm sort of
like family to vince.

559
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:04,390
We knew his daddy real well.

560
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:06,860
I can't wait to see him again.

561
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:09,860
If you invite me in,

562
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:13,230
maybe we can
wait for him together...

563
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,070
real friendly-like,
over a couple of beers.

564
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:22,140
What do you say?

565
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:24,180
Shall we let them in?

566
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:27,610
Vince said we shouldn't
open up to anybody.

567
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:30,180
But these people are
in the same boat as us.

568
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:33,020
And it seems to me the more
guns we have around the better.

569
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:37,550
Well, I don't like
the looks of them.

570
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:40,360
Oh, come on now.
Don't you try and tell me

571
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:42,860
you ain't got
no beer in the fridge.

572
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:44,830
That wouldn't be friendly.

573
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:46,800
Well, I guess since they said

574
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:50,030
they knew vince's daddy...

575
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:53,200
okay, come on in.

576
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,340
That's more like it.

577
00:48:55,370 --> 00:48:58,080
Do you hear that, guys?
What do you say

578
00:48:58,110 --> 00:49:00,640
we accept these people's
kind hospitality?

579
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,680
Ed, you stay out here

580
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:05,480
just in case anything
unpleasant comes around,

581
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,650
know what I mean?

582
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:18,100
Angela!

583
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:31,510
Hey, ed, take care
of the camper.

584
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,130
Stay where you are.

585
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,270
Who's this?

586
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:31,200
Joss, the caretaker.

587
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,940
What do you know?
His heart's been torn clear out.

588
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:36,170
Another victim
of your boyfriend?

589
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:38,840
What the hell
are you talking about?

590
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,840
I think you know, missy.

591
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,810
And if you don't,
you'll soon find out

592
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:44,850
when vince roberts gets back.

593
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,350
What are you going
to do with him?

594
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:50,390
What I'm going to do with him,

595
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:53,960
I'm going to shoot
this here silver bullet

596
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:56,960
right through his heart.

597
00:50:56,990 --> 00:50:59,830
But why would anyone
want to kill vince?

598
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:02,000
I think I understand.

599
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:03,970
You are the same band

600
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,940
that killed vince's father,
aren't you?

601
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:09,070
We made a mistake back then.

602
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:12,540
We should have known that his
son was cursed by the evil too.

603
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:14,910
We should have
killed him off then.

604
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:17,980
You're just a bunch
of stupid animals.

605
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:19,950
What the hell do you think

606
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,950
that killing vince
is going to solve?

607
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:23,950
Don't you understand
that werewolves are

608
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:26,260
just an idiotic superstition?

609
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:28,330
Listen, I was here

610
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,260
that night when
we killed roberts

611
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:34,000
and I'm telling you,
he wasn't a man anymore.

612
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:37,030
You understand me, girl?
He was something horrible.

613
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:41,410
It was a night like this,

614
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,440
a night when there was
a full moon.

615
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:46,780
It is then that they
transform themselves.

616
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:50,010
When vince gets back,

617
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:52,580
I'm going to shoot him
right through the heart

618
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:55,120
with this silver bullet.

619
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:59,120
That's how you kill werewolves.

620
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:02,160
But they're mad, completely mad.

621
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:05,800
And the dogs... have you seen the dogs too?

622
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:08,000
It's him who commands them,

623
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:11,140
controls them.

624
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:14,840
Those are the powers
of werewolves.

625
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,980
If you try to kill him,
we'll turn you in.

626
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:20,810
We'll go to the sheriff.

627
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,850
The sheriff's dead,

628
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,680
and so is the deputy...

629
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:29,020
Torn to pieces by the dogs.

630
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:34,160
Ed and me seen vince roberts

631
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:36,160
while he turned

632
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:39,560
from a man to a monster.

633
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,470
What monster?
What's he talking about?

634
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:43,430
I saw it too.

635
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:46,970
- What? What did you see?
- The monster,

636
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,710
the thing you call the werewolf.

637
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:51,110
When?

638
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:54,710
Last night,
when I was with vince.

639
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:56,750
So it can't possibly be him.

640
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:05,990
Did you see it too?

641
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:20,740
Well, I guess you must be
the werewolf's sweetheart.

642
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:23,670
Ain't that right?

643
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:47,100
- Angela.
- Vince.

644
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:49,530
Come on, let's get back
to the house.

645
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:54,810
- I have this vision...
- forget the vision.

646
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,770
Let's get out of here.

647
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:07,480
He's coming.

648
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,920
It's vince roberts with a girl.

649
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:15,490
Jerome, greg, watch these kids.

650
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:17,630
If they move so much as a hair,

651
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:19,630
shoot.

652
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:24,000
Ed, you be ready

653
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:26,300
to open the door
when I tell you.

654
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:28,140
Right.

655
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:40,950
Frank, sandra, open the door.

656
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:43,690
Come on, quick.

657
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:46,990
Whose car is that?
Are you guys all right?

658
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:50,530
Answer me, someone.
Jordan, frank, come on.

659
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:55,170
Wait here a minute.

660
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:02,940
Now!

661
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:52,260
The bastard's escaping.
He's getting away.

662
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:55,260
Jerome, greg, after him.

663
00:55:57,830 --> 00:55:59,860
Kill them.

664
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,830
Okay, boys, I'm coming.

665
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:06,870
- Let's get her onto the couch.
- Right.

666
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:27,620
He's going up on the roof.

667
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:15,940
Up, both of you.

668
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:26,320
I don't like you.

669
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:29,350
Well, you're not exactly
my type either.

670
00:57:32,790 --> 00:57:36,160
You look like a couple
of queers to me.

671
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:40,860
Queers make my stomach turn!

672
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:49,810
Move.
Go on.

673
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:29,510
Do you know I got to kill you?

674
00:58:29,550 --> 00:58:32,350
You're not serious.

675
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:42,330
Say goodbye to your boyfriend.

676
00:58:50,170 --> 00:58:53,600
- Vince roberts!
- Don't shoot!

677
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,360
I'm going to treat this bastard

678
00:59:14,390 --> 00:59:16,360
like he wanted to treat you.

679
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:18,330
- Well?
- No, sandra.

680
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,400
We're not murderers.

681
00:59:20,430 --> 00:59:22,330
Listen, sandra, think of vince.

682
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:25,070
We've got to help him.

683
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:30,970
Okay.

684
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:03,570
I'm going out to find vince.

685
01:00:03,610 --> 01:00:04,910
Okay, but be careful.

686
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:09,650
Shut the door!

687
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,180
Frank!

688
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,030
Hey, you!

689
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:36,510
All right, vince roberts.

690
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:06,740
Shoot them!
Shoot them!

691
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:10,910
I can't.
I'd kill him.

692
01:01:16,850 --> 01:01:18,010
No!

693
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:24,490
Frank! Frank!

694
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:27,060
Fight them off so I can shoot.

695
01:01:27,090 --> 01:01:29,090
Frank, fight them off.

696
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:36,100
I can't.
He may be hurt.

697
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:52,080
- They've quieted down.
- Yeah.

698
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:55,790
- Why?
- I don't know.

699
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:01,090
Something is trying to get in!

700
01:02:09,130 --> 01:02:12,640
That's not a dog
trying to get in.

701
01:02:12,670 --> 01:02:14,570
I can't hold it back.

702
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:04,990
Your jacket.

703
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:10,660
- Don't jordan, don't.
- Let me go.

704
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,770
Come on, let's go.

705
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:57,110
Sandra, my hair, my hair!

706
01:03:57,140 --> 01:03:59,410
He's pulling my hair.
My hair.

707
01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:06,380
Help me, sandra.
Help me.

708
01:04:38,410 --> 01:04:42,220
Okay, where is it?
I'll kill it!

709
01:04:46,890 --> 01:04:49,760
Vince. Oh, vince,
where have you been?

710
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:55,770
Come on, marilou, let's go.

711
01:04:59,570 --> 01:05:01,540
That's good.

712
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:15,950
It's all over.

713
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:20,420
It's all over.

714
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:22,830
We are going to die too.

715
01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:24,960
We haven't got a chance.

716
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,600
It's all over.

717
01:05:27,630 --> 01:05:29,600
Calm down, marilou.

718
01:05:29,630 --> 01:05:32,070
You'll see, everything
will be all right.

719
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:35,170
It's him.
He is to blame

720
01:05:35,210 --> 01:05:37,740
for what has happened
to angela, frank and jordan.

721
01:05:37,770 --> 01:05:40,640
What are you talking about?
Have you gone crazy?

722
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:44,080
Where was he
when that monster dog

723
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:46,080
crashed through
the living room door

724
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:49,090
and when jordan was eaten alive?

725
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:52,320
And before that,
in the bathroom?

726
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:56,190
And now?
Why don't the dogs attack us?

727
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:58,860
Tell me the truth, vince.
Your neighbors were right.

728
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:01,000
You are the monster dog.

729
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:03,000
You are the murdering animal.

730
01:06:03,030 --> 01:06:05,340
God damn you!
Damn you!

731
01:06:05,370 --> 01:06:08,400
You are a werewolf.
I know you are.

732
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:10,540
I know it!

733
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:18,980
What can we do, vince?

734
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:50,930
Vince.

735
01:08:50,970 --> 01:08:52,940
It's amazing, isn't it?

736
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:55,810
They suddenly all calm down,
just like that.

737
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:00,140
But how?

738
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:02,510
Why?

739
01:09:02,550 --> 01:09:04,480
Go wake up marilou.

740
01:09:04,510 --> 01:09:07,080
Make it quick.

741
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,220
Okay.

742
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:20,120
- Shit.
- What's happened?

743
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:21,760
The keys aren't here.

744
01:10:21,790 --> 01:10:23,990
I guess one of those four
had them on him.

745
01:10:24,030 --> 01:10:26,860
- I'm gonna have to go back.
- I'll come with you.

746
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:28,900
Are you going to
leave me here alone?

747
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:30,700
You'll be safe enough
locked in here.

748
01:10:30,730 --> 01:10:32,570
But what if you don't come back?

749
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:35,570
Well, you'd better pray
that we do.

750
01:11:13,610 --> 01:11:15,510
He doesn't have them.

751
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:18,650
- Check that one.
- Okay.

752
01:11:22,350 --> 01:11:26,560
Vince, I found them!
Here, catch.

753
01:11:26,590 --> 01:11:29,060
Vince!
Vince!

754
01:11:29,090 --> 01:11:31,260
I'll catch you yet,
vince roberts.

755
01:11:33,230 --> 01:11:36,130
Sandra, grab the gun!

756
01:11:36,170 --> 01:11:38,800
Help!
Help!

757
01:11:56,650 --> 01:11:59,960
Oh, vince, vince.

758
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:04,230
It's not over.
We've still got to get out of here.

759
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:06,230
Come on, let's go.

760
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:21,710
Come on.
Come on, hurry up.

761
01:12:31,990 --> 01:12:34,220
I can hardly believe

762
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:36,930
that this nightmare
is finally over.

763
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:41,630
What do you say, marilou?

764
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:43,670
Marilou?

765
01:12:43,700 --> 01:12:47,170
You haven't
fallen asleep, have you?

766
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:49,640
Marilou?

767
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:01,250
Open the door.

768
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:03,490
Sandra, open the door.

769
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:05,690
- Jump!
- No.

770
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:09,890
Jump!
Jump!

771
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:43,430
Vince?

772
01:15:54,220 --> 01:15:56,660
I tell you now,
he's taken my place

773
01:15:56,690 --> 01:16:00,460
and his blood is
as tainted as mine.

774
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:02,800
Vince was just a baby.

775
01:16:02,830 --> 01:16:05,540
Horrible things happened.

776
01:16:05,570 --> 01:16:08,400
His father sank his teeth
into my neck.

777
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:10,710
And now vince
has come back to help me.

778
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:15,580
Now, for better or worse,
we have a new king

779
01:16:15,610 --> 01:16:19,050
who will live in the house
of the dead forever.

780
01:16:57,090 --> 01:16:59,020
Vince.

781
01:16:59,050 --> 01:17:01,060
Vince!

782
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:21,340
- Vince.
- Stay away from me!

783
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:23,810
Why?

784
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:29,450
Stay away from me!

785
01:17:35,830 --> 01:17:38,990
Use it.
Shoot me.

786
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:41,500
Do it before it's too late.

787
01:17:41,530 --> 01:17:45,130
Come on, shoot me.
Come on.

788
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:52,430
God help me.

789
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:10,990
You were right, angela.

790
01:19:11,020 --> 01:19:15,660
You weren't crazy.
You knew.

791
01:19:15,690 --> 01:19:18,260
You knew all along.
