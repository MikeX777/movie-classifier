<i>In our obsession
with antagonisms of the moment,</i>

2
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:07,698
<i>we often forget how much unites
all the members of humanity.</i>

3
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,767
<i>Perhaps, we need some
outside universal threat</i>

4
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:15,873

00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:22,880

00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:36,826

12
00:01:56,314 --> 00:01:59,883
Oi, Matt, what's going on?

13
00:01:59,885 --> 00:02:01,785
Shit.

14
00:02:01,787 --> 00:02:03,954
Good day, Arnold.
How are we?

15
00:02:03,956 --> 00:02:07,823
Uh, take a wild guess.
How long?

16
00:02:07,825 --> 00:02:10,626
Well, like I tell you every day,
when I know, you'll know.

17
00:02:10,628 --> 00:02:13,930
- Got any smokes?
- No, mate, I don't. This is ridiculous.

18
00:02:13,932 --> 00:02:16,266
- You know, I've lived here for 50...
- Fifty-five years.

19
00:02:16,268 --> 00:02:20,436
Don't be a... take that bloody
tone of voice with me, boy.

20
00:02:20,438 --> 00:02:24,541
Fifty-five years, and I'll be damned if
I see the point of this bypass, really.

21
00:02:24,543 --> 00:02:26,442
It's progress,
Arnold, progress.

22
00:02:26,444 --> 00:02:28,679
Oh, progress my ass.
I've got fruit in the back

23
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:32,281
that's about to go bad. I've been sitting
here for 42 bloody minutes, mate.

24
00:02:32,283 --> 00:02:34,483
- It's 2:45.
- All right. Look, I'll...

25
00:02:34,485 --> 00:02:35,953
I'll talk
to my supervisor, okay?

26
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:38,922
- Yeah, you do that.
- Jesus Christ.

27
00:02:38,924 --> 00:02:41,424
Jimmy, can you take over, mate?
Gotta head off.

28
00:02:41,426 --> 00:02:45,362
Well... Well, Arnold's
giving away free fruit.

29
00:02:45,364 --> 00:02:46,929
Yeah, right, aye.

30
00:02:46,931 --> 00:02:49,298
Hey, does Boss know you're
knocking off?

31
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,000
Only if you tell him.

32
00:02:51,002 --> 00:02:54,239
Tonight. Don't be late.

33
00:02:58,343 --> 00:03:01,845
Good day, Arnold.
Uh, mangoes.

34
00:03:01,847 --> 00:03:04,248
- Mangoes?
- Yeah.

35
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,416
They're out of season,
you idiot.

36
00:03:06,418 --> 00:03:09,485
Who put you in charge? No wonder this
bypass is taking so bloody long.

37
00:03:09,487 --> 00:03:12,288
Now, listen,
I've lived here for 55 years.

38
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,458
- Yeah, it, it... what it is...
- Get away from me.

39
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,792
They build a road and it...

40
00:03:15,794 --> 00:03:17,463
Get back to work,
you mongrel bastard!

41
00:03:20,832 --> 00:03:22,733
What are you
doing off work?

42
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:24,500
Well, unlike last week,
your sister wanted me

43
00:03:24,502 --> 00:03:25,869
to make sure you
get there on time.

44
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:28,437
- Last week wasn't my fault.
- Mm-hmm.

45
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:30,806
Besides, you ever tried
saying no to Amelia?

46
00:03:30,808 --> 00:03:32,976
I'm her brother.
Of course I've said no.

47
00:03:32,978 --> 00:03:35,679
You, on the other hand,
are screwed.

48
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:39,416
I wasn't gonna say anything,
mate, because she's your sister,

49
00:03:39,418 --> 00:03:41,417
but she does this thing with her
legs, they go, like, right...

50
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:44,353
Oh, that...
bad mental pictures.

51
00:03:44,355 --> 00:03:47,457
That's what you get, kid.

52
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,326
Pass me the aspirin,
will you?

53
00:03:49,328 --> 00:03:53,030
You playing tonight?
Serious?

54
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:56,066
Apparently. Pass one.

55
00:03:56,068 --> 00:03:57,633
Come on, come on.

56
00:03:57,635 --> 00:04:01,738
Yeah. Finally get
to see the big man work.

57
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,805
Relax, will you?

58
00:04:11,582 --> 00:04:13,883
- Yo.
- What?

59
00:04:13,885 --> 00:04:17,353
- We've stopped.
- Why?

60
00:04:17,355 --> 00:04:21,324
- To stretch our legs.
- No thanks.

61
00:04:21,326 --> 00:04:22,928
I'm good.

62
00:04:32,403 --> 00:04:36,707
- Fine, Peter.
- Thanks, Bella.

63
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:39,642
Come on, Samuel.

64
00:04:39,644 --> 00:04:42,712
Give me that. A bit
of real world won't kill you.

65
00:04:42,714 --> 00:04:46,585
Let it go.

66
00:04:48,786 --> 00:04:50,620
- Two bucks, mate?
- Do you know where we are?

67
00:04:50,622 --> 00:04:52,856
- Yes.
- Bella.

68
00:04:52,858 --> 00:04:56,760
- What's with this stupid town?
- I don't know, darling.

69
00:04:56,762 --> 00:04:59,663
We'll have a look around
and we'll find out, okay?

70
00:04:59,665 --> 00:05:01,697
Fine.
I'll meet you back here.

71
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:04,101
Careful, Bella.
Dinner, back here 6:00.

72
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:06,069
- Yeah.
- And I don't want any dramas.

73
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:10,673
Mom, it's a country town.
What's gonna happen?

74
00:05:10,675 --> 00:05:12,878
Thanks, mate.

75
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:18,016
Let it go.

76
00:05:31,797 --> 00:05:34,865
Hey, guys, it's me.
Thought I'd do a vlog,

77
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:37,700
considering we've landed
in a parallel universe.

78
00:05:37,702 --> 00:05:40,937
I think this town
still thinks it's 1996.

79
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:46,409
Probably all use landlines
and all have the same cousin.

80
00:05:46,411 --> 00:05:49,512
That's... that's mean.

81
00:05:49,514 --> 00:05:52,084
- Anyway.
- Do you want me to film for you?

82
00:05:53,485 --> 00:05:55,851
- No, thanks.
- I could do your sketch.

83
00:05:55,853 --> 00:05:59,555
- I do sketches.
- This all seems legit and not at all creepy.

84
00:05:59,557 --> 00:06:02,591
Well, you can't blame a guy for
trying to make an honest living.

85
00:06:02,593 --> 00:06:07,764
- You here on holidays?
- Uh, something like that.

86
00:06:07,766 --> 00:06:11,834
Just passing through, seeing what the locals
do on a Friday night in the middle of nowhere.

87
00:06:11,836 --> 00:06:17,072
- Well, this is it.
- Yeah.

88
00:06:17,074 --> 00:06:20,709
Wow, these are really good.

89
00:06:20,711 --> 00:06:23,647
It's okay.

90
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:26,949
- Dennis.
- Shit. Yeah, I'm going.

91
00:06:26,951 --> 00:06:29,719
I doubt you've got
a permit for a stall. Come on.

92
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:33,656
- We were just talking, officer.
- Yeah, well, Dennis knows the rules.

93
00:06:33,658 --> 00:06:38,060
I said I'm going.

94
00:06:38,062 --> 00:06:40,529
- It was nice talking to you.
- Yeah.

95
00:06:40,531 --> 00:06:43,966
Come on, move it.
Keep walking, Dennis.

96
00:06:43,968 --> 00:06:46,502
Uh-uh, hands off the car, go on.

97
00:06:46,504 --> 00:06:48,841
Fifth time this week.

98
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:59,949
Beef burger, pineapple on the side, and chicken
Caesar salad, no mayo, extra croutons.

99
00:06:59,951 --> 00:07:01,485
Would you like another Coke?

100
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:04,253
Oh, my feet are killing me.

101
00:07:04,255 --> 00:07:06,188
Um, Bill wants
another milkshake, okay?

102
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,925
One chicken schnitzel
off a heart attack, that one.

103
00:07:08,927 --> 00:07:13,829
"The law presumes anyone entering into a
contract has the legal capacity to do so."

104
00:07:13,831 --> 00:07:17,033
- Hey, Amelia.
- Contract legal capacity to do so. Hey, Marcus.

105
00:07:17,035 --> 00:07:19,836
How was school? Contract law in
business and commercial life.

106
00:07:19,838 --> 00:07:22,738
- Hello.
- Mm, looks good.

107
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,974
- Shut up.
- It's a bit chill for a cafe, isn't it?

108
00:07:24,976 --> 00:07:28,945
- How's the world of the law going?
- Ask me in two years.

109
00:07:28,947 --> 00:07:30,981
Here he is. Traitor,
working for the enemy.

110
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:35,819
- Job's a job, Mom.
- Hey, Helen, I'm playing tonight.

111
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:37,887
- Did you know that?
- You sure that's a good idea?

112
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:39,856
- You're not as young as you used to be.
- Yeah, baby, you...

113
00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:40,990
You sure that's a good idea?

114
00:07:40,992 --> 00:07:42,125
Look, it's one of the last games

115
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:43,226
of this season, maybe ever.

116
00:07:43,228 --> 00:07:44,627
I promise I'll be careful.

117
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:46,829
Okay.
Then I'll come watch you.

118
00:07:46,831 --> 00:07:50,800
- Hey, your funeral.
- Thanks, Helen.

119
00:07:50,802 --> 00:07:53,039
Thanks for your support.

120
00:07:54,939 --> 00:07:58,207
Hey, last time he played,
he ended up in a coma, fact.

121
00:07:58,209 --> 00:07:59,242
I'm just saying.

122
00:08:09,588 --> 00:08:12,255
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

123
00:08:12,257 --> 00:08:14,658
- Oh! No, put me down.
- You missed me, did you?

124
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,325
Put me down, honey.
You know I did.

125
00:08:16,327 --> 00:08:18,094
- So what's the big emergency?
- Um...

126
00:08:18,096 --> 00:08:20,596
Hey, Jack-o,
good luck tonight, mate.

127
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:23,166
Oh, thanks, mate. We're
gonna absolutely kill them.

128
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:26,603
Sorry, I didn't... you know
I can't say no to my fans.

129
00:08:26,605 --> 00:08:29,105
Well, I'm your biggest fan.

130
00:08:29,107 --> 00:08:31,974
- Okay, listen.
- I'm listening.

131
00:08:31,976 --> 00:08:35,981
- I just... I'm pregnant.
- I'm all ears, babe.

132
00:08:37,282 --> 00:08:40,753
- You... you're what?
- I'm pregnant.

133
00:08:41,886 --> 00:08:43,320
You sure?

134
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:46,091
Yes, Jackson,
I'm pretty sure.

135
00:08:48,826 --> 00:08:50,326
- That's... that's amazing.
- Oh!

136
00:08:50,328 --> 00:08:52,329
Oh, wait, wait,
I didn't hurt the baby?

137
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:55,600
Hey, I'm sure it's fine.

138
00:08:56,835 --> 00:08:59,736
Hey, how you doing in there?

139
00:08:59,738 --> 00:09:02,204
Okay, babe, it can't hear you.
It's, like, the size of a peanut.

140
00:09:02,206 --> 00:09:04,608
- Hey, yeah, but what a peanut.
- Oh.

141
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:09,145
- What's all this then?
- Uh, we are, uh, starting our own team.

142
00:09:09,147 --> 00:09:11,381
- Oh, hey! Congratulations!
- Thank you, man.

143
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:14,820
Thank you, Jimmy. Ah!

144
00:09:18,756 --> 00:09:20,757
What... what
the hell was that?

145
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:23,627
Don't know, but, we, um,
better get going, yeah?

146
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,929
Yeah, I'll see you guys out there.
I just have to change.

147
00:09:25,931 --> 00:09:29,833
- Yeah.
- Bye, baby. Babies.

148
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:33,673
- Congratulations again, Ness.
- Thanks, Jimmy, good luck.

149
00:09:41,312 --> 00:09:44,647
- Thank you. See ya.
- See ya.

150
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:46,382
Hello.

151
00:09:46,384 --> 00:09:48,685
Uh, apples?

152
00:09:48,687 --> 00:09:52,287
I wanna reassure you that
a vote for me and my party

153
00:09:52,289 --> 00:09:54,958
will be the best thing
that can happen to this town.

154
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,893
We've got policies in place
and initiatives worked out

155
00:09:57,895 --> 00:10:03,233
to encourage industry back into the
community, which will create more jobs.

156
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,749
Jesus.

157
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:22,654
Simmons.

158
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:32,462
Sorry.

159
00:10:36,701 --> 00:10:38,868
Oh, there you are.

160
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,438
Thanks for coming tonight.
People love you

161
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,040
and they need all the
enjoyment they can get, right?

162
00:10:44,042 --> 00:10:48,277
First the factory closes,
and then this damn bypass.

163
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:52,181
Uh, we all hope you aren't out there
helping in the construction too much.

164
00:10:52,183 --> 00:10:54,084
- Uh...
- Right? Are you?

165
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:56,486
Uh, how's the, uh, the head?

166
00:10:56,488 --> 00:10:59,155
You gonna be
all right tonight?

167
00:10:59,157 --> 00:11:01,824
Don't, uh, don't
kill yourself out there.

168
00:11:01,826 --> 00:11:05,361
- I won't.
- You, you know... you know what I meant.

169
00:11:05,363 --> 00:11:08,430
And good evening,

170
00:11:08,432 --> 00:11:11,834
ladies and gentlemen,
girls and boys,

171
00:11:11,836 --> 00:11:15,271
you're with Seth Grimes
from 97.1,

172
00:11:15,273 --> 00:11:18,208
the Country Smile on your dial.

173
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,276
Catch me 7:00 to 11:00 weekdays.

174
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:23,146
Now it's a perfect evening
for our own Drop Bears

175
00:11:23,148 --> 00:11:26,749
to take on the Kookaburras
in this match for charity.

176
00:11:26,751 --> 00:11:28,951
Oh, wait, hold the phone,
ladies and gentlemen.

177
00:11:28,953 --> 00:11:32,155
We have a, uh, special player
out on the field tonight.

178
00:11:32,157 --> 00:11:35,492
A blast from the past,
the big man himself,

179
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:38,994
put your hands together for the
ex-captain, Matty Simmons.

180
00:11:38,996 --> 00:11:42,165
Go, Matty! Whoo!

181
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:46,201
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

182
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,377
Go, Matty!

183
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:58,281
Hey, big man. I think
you, uh, forgot your helmet.

184
00:11:58,283 --> 00:12:00,949
That's funny.

185
00:12:00,951 --> 00:12:03,953
Look, mate, there's a talent
scout up here from Melbourne,

186
00:12:03,955 --> 00:12:06,292
so just stay out of my way,
all right?

187
00:12:14,499 --> 00:12:19,134
Dickhead.

188
00:12:19,136 --> 00:12:21,805
Okay, bring it in, lads!
Bring it in.

189
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:26,276
I don't know why, why we
let her run off on her own.

190
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:28,978
Because it's Bella.

191
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,848
What, do you think we're gonna find her under
the grandstand making out with the town hunk?

192
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:36,386
- No.
- Mom, look.

193
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:37,921
Anyway, maybe I'll have
a look around for her.

194
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,388
I'll meet you guys
back at the van.

195
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,793
Okay. Bye.

196
00:12:42,994 --> 00:12:44,359
And there's the bounce.

197
00:12:44,361 --> 00:12:49,267
Simmons takes it in hand.

198
00:12:51,135 --> 00:12:53,502
Big kick there
from Jimmy Stiles.

199
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:02,281
Get up! Get up, baby!

200
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:10,386
Flying above the
pack there, Jackson! Amazing.

201
00:13:10,388 --> 00:13:15,992
And makes no mistake putting it
through the sticks.

202
00:13:15,994 --> 00:13:21,064
Simmons a little slow to warm up this
quarter, but there's more to come.

203
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:22,464
Yes!

204
00:13:22,466 --> 00:13:26,071
- Look, you get the teddy bear.
- Thank you.

205
00:13:27,538 --> 00:13:30,205
Everyone's a winner.

206
00:13:30,207 --> 00:13:32,374
Yeah. Cocktails.

207
00:13:32,376 --> 00:13:35,445
Looks like the Kookaburras
are starting to take control.

208
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:38,614
Simmons, pick it up!

209
00:13:38,616 --> 00:13:41,584
- Okay, go.
- Ready?

210
00:13:41,586 --> 00:13:43,522
Oh!

211
00:13:45,523 --> 00:13:48,358
- Shit.
- What the hell was that?

212
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,026
- Piss off, blondie.
- What?

213
00:13:51,028 --> 00:13:55,397
Whoa. And there's some heated words
there from the old and new captains.

214
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:58,334
- There's...
- You two break it up. Come on.

215
00:13:58,336 --> 00:14:00,505
We're down by two.

216
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:06,408
Oh, Bella, there you are.

217
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,310
Have you any idea how
worried your mom is?

218
00:14:08,312 --> 00:14:10,412
I texted her.
Town has no reception.

219
00:14:10,414 --> 00:14:13,315
Well, look, for the rest of the trip,
let's just stay together, okay?

220
00:14:13,317 --> 00:14:15,984
No wandering off
on your own.

221
00:14:15,986 --> 00:14:19,223
Think you can just come back into our
lives and start telling us what to do?

222
00:14:31,101 --> 00:14:34,103
What? What's happened?

223
00:14:34,105 --> 00:14:38,107
Charity gigs.

224
00:14:38,109 --> 00:14:39,975
No more, Seth. No more.

225
00:15:29,693 --> 00:15:33,595
What? What's this? Do you
know anything about this?

226
00:15:33,597 --> 00:15:35,099
No, not at all.

227
00:15:37,168 --> 00:15:39,471
Marcus, what is that?

228
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:11,066
Take cover!

229
00:16:31,188 --> 00:16:34,424
Stay! Stay here!
Stay here! Matt!

230
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:36,695
Vanessa, stay there!

231
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:41,766
Run, Jimmy!
Go, go, go, go! Go!

232
00:16:50,508 --> 00:16:54,844
Matt! Matt!
Marcus!

233
00:16:54,846 --> 00:16:58,250
- Amelia!
- Marcus, come here!

234
00:17:34,184 --> 00:17:36,387
Come on. Hey, this way.

235
00:17:37,855 --> 00:17:39,822
- Bella!
- Daddy!

236
00:17:39,824 --> 00:17:41,627
Bella!

237
00:17:43,193 --> 00:17:46,164
Bella, Bella, let's run!
Let's go!

238
00:17:50,201 --> 00:17:53,302
- Marcus. What the...?
- Where's your mom? Where's Helen?

239
00:17:53,304 --> 00:17:55,474
- Where's your mom?
- Ah!

240
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:01,212
- Mom!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

241
00:18:03,714 --> 00:18:08,151
- Where's your mom? Shit.
- Mom, Mom!

242
00:18:10,154 --> 00:18:12,488
Mom! Matt, Matt, let me go!

243
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,257
Let me... Mom!

244
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,225
- Mom!
- Let's go.

245
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:41,586
Get out of there!

246
00:18:45,656 --> 00:18:47,558
Move, move!

247
00:18:58,836 --> 00:19:01,807
- Where are we gonna go?
- Anywhere but here, kid.

248
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,409
Shit!

249
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:08,744
Hey! Hey!

250
00:19:08,746 --> 00:19:10,712
Come here! Hey, guys!

251
00:19:10,714 --> 00:19:12,717
This way!

252
00:19:14,352 --> 00:19:16,719
Jenny! Samuel!

253
00:19:16,721 --> 00:19:18,955
- Matty, Matty!
- I'm shot.

254
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:21,958
You gotta help me. What if it's an artery?
I'm bloody toast.

255
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,793
- Hey, is this your van?
- Yeah.

256
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:26,828
- Jenny! Samuel!
- Let's go, let's go.

257
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,663
Peter! Peter! Dad!

258
00:19:28,665 --> 00:19:30,967
Hey, is that your daughter?
We gotta go! Let's go!

259
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:33,902
Yeah. I told them to meet me back here.
I can't leave without them!

260
00:19:33,904 --> 00:19:36,805
Hey, I promise you I'll help you
get the rest of your family back,

261
00:19:36,807 --> 00:19:38,373
- but right now we need to go.
- Dad!

262
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,609
Or she is dead!

263
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:41,180
Ah! Dad!

264
00:19:42,446 --> 00:19:43,748
Get in.

265
00:19:45,883 --> 00:19:47,352
Saddle up.

266
00:19:51,722 --> 00:19:54,356
Amelia! Come on!

267
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:57,927
Close that!
Close that!

268
00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:00,763
- Vanessa! Come on!
- Come on, man! Start the car!

269
00:20:00,765 --> 00:20:03,769
Yeah, man.
I'm doing my best with this.

270
00:20:08,905 --> 00:20:11,373
- Vanessa!
- Amelia!

271
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,845
Over here! Wait!
Come on!

272
00:20:17,048 --> 00:20:19,917
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

273
00:20:22,586 --> 00:20:24,388
We're getting close!

274
00:20:25,722 --> 00:20:27,590
- Jimmy!
- No!

275
00:20:27,592 --> 00:20:29,859
Jimmy! Jimmy, come on!

276
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:33,595
Jackson! Jackson, please!
Jackson, we have to go!

277
00:20:33,597 --> 00:20:34,963
- Jimmy!
- Please, Jackson, leave him!

278
00:20:34,965 --> 00:20:36,931
No, I can't just leave him!
Jimmy!

279
00:20:36,933 --> 00:20:38,867
Jackson, get up! Please!

280
00:20:38,869 --> 00:20:41,671
Come on. Now!

281
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:45,009
- Jimmy.
- Get in! Get in!

282
00:20:49,913 --> 00:20:51,817
Shit.

283
00:20:54,751 --> 00:20:58,456
Go! Go!
Get out of here!

284
00:21:10,034 --> 00:21:11,436
Careful!

285
00:21:18,509 --> 00:21:21,344
Whoa! Let's go!

286
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:23,582
Wait a minute! Get out of the way!
I've got this!

287
00:21:33,124 --> 00:21:35,591
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

288
00:21:38,895 --> 00:21:40,898
Get out of the way.

289
00:21:49,006 --> 00:21:50,475
Left, left, left!

290
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,047
- Hey, what's your name?
- Peter.

291
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:03,486
- You sure about this, Peter?
- I hope so.

292
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:06,924
- Hold on.
- Oh, shit.

293
00:22:18,736 --> 00:22:21,003
- Hey, what are you doing?
- No, it's okay, it's okay.

294
00:22:21,005 --> 00:22:22,805
I'm a nurse. Vanessa.

295
00:22:22,807 --> 00:22:25,440
Seth, 97.1, you know,
the country smile on your dial.

296
00:22:25,442 --> 00:22:30,014
- Sorry, I don't...
- Oh, that's all right. No one does.

297
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:41,724
Can someone tell me
what the hell is going on?

298
00:22:41,726 --> 00:22:43,726
It's a terrorist attack.

299
00:22:43,728 --> 00:22:46,461
Hey, babe, you okay?
You hurt?

300
00:22:46,463 --> 00:22:50,732
- Shit. I don't like the look of this.
- Oh, crap!

301
00:22:50,734 --> 00:22:52,870
- What do we do now?
- Keep going!

302
00:22:54,939 --> 00:22:56,872
- Did anyone see that?
- Shit, it's behind us!

303
00:22:56,874 --> 00:22:59,842
- Can this thing go any faster?
- This is going faster.

304
00:22:59,844 --> 00:23:03,115
Oh, my God! We're doomed!

305
00:23:10,654 --> 00:23:14,190
That was Air Force, one of ours.

306
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:17,026
Keep the engine running.

307
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:18,663
Move.

308
00:23:20,664 --> 00:23:22,131
Hey, whoa, whoa.

309
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:23,865
Hey, do you think
this is a good idea,

310
00:23:23,867 --> 00:23:25,668
just stopping out
here in the middle,

311
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,440
in the, like, in the open,
in the... Jesus.

312
00:23:31,608 --> 00:23:33,912
Jesus.

313
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:40,649
- What are you looking for?
- Markings.

314
00:23:40,651 --> 00:23:42,183
Pilot.

315
00:23:42,185 --> 00:23:45,156
What if the
pilot's still alive?

316
00:23:46,757 --> 00:23:48,990
I don't think
that's gonna be a problem.

317
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:51,429
Why not?

318
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:54,863
It's not a man.

319
00:23:54,865 --> 00:23:56,097
Drone, maybe.

320
00:23:56,099 --> 00:23:58,933
Matt! Amelia!

321
00:23:58,935 --> 00:24:00,638
Get back in the van.

322
00:24:05,843 --> 00:24:09,245
- What are you doing?
- You staying? You coming? What's going on?

323
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:11,514
- Dude, crap or get off the pot.
- Matt.

324
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:13,951
Just drive. Drive.
Leave him.

325
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:23,526
Matt?
Matt, is that you?

326
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:25,827
Oh.

327
00:24:25,829 --> 00:24:28,162
Bloody good to see you.

328
00:24:28,164 --> 00:24:32,034
We're all up shit creek
now, eh, boys?

329
00:24:32,036 --> 00:24:33,835
Dennis?

330
00:24:33,837 --> 00:24:35,837
What the hell are you doing
in the back of Arnold's Ute?

331
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:38,274
Do you have any idea how hard it is
to jump in the back of a moving car?

332
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:41,643
- Are you hurt?
- Huh?

333
00:24:41,645 --> 00:24:44,145
- That's not mine.
- Hey, I know you.

334
00:24:44,147 --> 00:24:46,681
You stole my fruit
two weeks ago, didn't you?

335
00:24:46,683 --> 00:24:49,151
Boy, if I ever
bloody catch you...

336
00:24:49,153 --> 00:24:52,587
Are you seriously blowing up over some
fruit after what we've just seen?

337
00:24:52,589 --> 00:24:55,857
Besides, I know
where we can hide.

338
00:24:55,859 --> 00:24:57,992
Come on, then.

339
00:24:57,994 --> 00:24:59,594
Good luck.
We'll follow you.

340
00:25:00,897 --> 00:25:02,730
Hey!

341
00:25:02,732 --> 00:25:06,837
I used the bypass.
It is quicker.

342
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:20,248
Hey, you okay?

343
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:23,117
- Ness, talk to me.
- They just started shooting.

344
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:27,590
- I know, babe.
- Everyone, our friends, Jimmy.

345
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:29,057
Jackson,
what are we gonna do?

346
00:25:29,059 --> 00:25:31,059
Babe, it's okay.
All right? It's okay.

347
00:25:31,061 --> 00:25:33,328
It's behind us now.

348
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:35,898
What about Peanut?

349
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,936
We're gonna be okay.

350
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:05,664
Just let yourselves in.

351
00:26:10,999 --> 00:26:11,900
What is this place?

352
00:26:11,902 --> 00:26:15,336
Oh, it was an old timber mill
before the town went to shit.

353
00:26:15,338 --> 00:26:18,774
Now, welcome
to Casa de Destitute.

354
00:26:18,776 --> 00:26:21,309
- How many more are there?
- Why so interested?

355
00:26:21,311 --> 00:26:23,144
Hey, quiet.

356
00:26:23,146 --> 00:26:26,215
I want to know
what your plan is.

357
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:28,750
- My plan?
- Yeah.

358
00:26:28,752 --> 00:26:31,687
You promised, man. You promised
you'd help me find my family.

359
00:26:31,689 --> 00:26:33,188
Ease up, man.
I'm working on it.

360
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:36,091
Okay. Did you find
anything at that crash?

361
00:26:36,093 --> 00:26:39,894
- Aliens.
- Jackson, I think we've all been through enough tonight.

362
00:26:39,896 --> 00:26:42,363
All right. Just, let's
all settle down, okay?

363
00:26:42,365 --> 00:26:45,734
Let's cover the cars, get some sleep, and
we'll figure out the rest in the morning.

364
00:26:45,736 --> 00:26:49,037
- Mm-hm.
- You guys get some. Someone's gotta stay on watch.

365
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:52,341
- I'll give you a hand.
- Chin up, everyone.

366
00:26:52,343 --> 00:26:54,809
I got out of worse
situations than this.

367
00:26:54,811 --> 00:26:57,680
Been married three times.

368
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:59,784
Don't touch my shit.

369
00:27:16,366 --> 00:27:21,402
You mean what you said in there?

370
00:27:21,404 --> 00:27:23,074
Which part?

371
00:27:24,307 --> 00:27:26,975
You all right?

372
00:27:26,977 --> 00:27:28,744
I'm great.

373
00:27:28,746 --> 00:27:31,479
About helping him
find his family.

374
00:27:33,851 --> 00:27:37,186
What do you want me
to say, Amelia?

375
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:40,488
Yeah, yeah, I will help him
find his family.

376
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:42,224
That an old bottle of pills
or a new one?

377
00:27:42,226 --> 00:27:45,227
Just give me a break,
will you!?

378
00:27:45,229 --> 00:27:46,798
Fuck.

379
00:27:51,999 --> 00:27:52,770
I'm sorry.

380
00:28:01,979 --> 00:28:03,682
I'm sorry.

381
00:28:05,281 --> 00:28:10,154
- I'm scared, baby.
- It's okay.

382
00:28:12,823 --> 00:28:16,061
I'm sure our guys
are fighting back right now.

383
00:28:18,762 --> 00:28:20,328
- Let's hope so.
- Hey.

384
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,998
- What are you doing here?
- Building a fire pit.

385
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,501
- No, I mean, here with us.
- Oh, I don't know.

386
00:28:26,503 --> 00:28:29,103
Just, um, lucky, I guess.

387
00:28:29,105 --> 00:28:33,044
- I used to write.
- Cool.

388
00:28:36,846 --> 00:28:38,817
Hey...

389
00:28:41,218 --> 00:28:43,788
What are you
doing there, kid?

390
00:28:45,221 --> 00:28:49,391
No one calls me kid
except Matt. I'm Marcus.

391
00:28:49,393 --> 00:28:52,928
And there's a lot of us and not much
food or water that has to last.

392
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:57,032
So before you interrupted me, I was
trying to work out our daily rations.

393
00:28:57,034 --> 00:29:01,973
Okay, Rain Man, fine.
Jesus.

394
00:29:03,907 --> 00:29:05,540
What are you doing?

395
00:29:05,542 --> 00:29:07,209
Stripping back the bark
so that when it burns

396
00:29:07,211 --> 00:29:10,478
it creates as little smoke
as possible.

397
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,247
Okay. Let me help.

398
00:29:12,249 --> 00:29:17,822
Hey, Marcus. Wanna come help
find some branches, help Dennis?

399
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:21,358
Okay.

400
00:29:27,096 --> 00:29:29,297
Matty! Matt!

401
00:29:29,299 --> 00:29:31,802
Babe, are you okay?
What's wrong?

402
00:29:35,005 --> 00:29:38,510
You gotta see this.

403
00:30:10,207 --> 00:30:12,410
I told you it was aliens.

404
00:30:18,582 --> 00:30:21,019
We are toast.

405
00:30:51,315 --> 00:30:53,515
Hey, what are you doing?
Some of those bags are mine.

406
00:30:53,517 --> 00:30:56,584
- I'm leaving.
- We need to stick together.

407
00:30:56,586 --> 00:30:58,487
What together?

408
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:00,154
Okay, I don't owe you anything,

409
00:31:00,156 --> 00:31:02,524
especially now that
we've got a kid on the way.

410
00:31:02,526 --> 00:31:04,392
No, I just
found out yesterday and...

411
00:31:04,394 --> 00:31:07,062
- Congratulations.
- Vanessa, why didn't you tell me?

412
00:31:07,064 --> 00:31:11,603
Well, I don't even know
if I should have it...

413
00:31:14,003 --> 00:31:18,105
Come on, baby, we'll get
as far away from here as we can.

414
00:31:18,107 --> 00:31:21,142
No, hands off.
These are mine. Piss off.

415
00:31:21,144 --> 00:31:23,312
What if it's
the same everywhere?

416
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:25,447
Yeah, well, we're gonna
have to take that chance.

417
00:31:25,449 --> 00:31:28,182
So whoever wants to get
out of Dodge, we're going.

418
00:31:28,184 --> 00:31:31,652
- I'll go.
- Arnold?

419
00:31:31,654 --> 00:31:34,189
Can't do it, Jack-o.

420
00:31:34,191 --> 00:31:36,424
You can have my truck
if you want.

421
00:31:36,426 --> 00:31:39,126
I've got no need for it now.

422
00:31:39,128 --> 00:31:42,663
Thank you. Dennis?

423
00:31:42,665 --> 00:31:45,566
With those ships they have, you
two'll be like sitting ducks.

424
00:31:45,568 --> 00:31:48,202
Well, we'll stay
off the road, man.

425
00:31:48,204 --> 00:31:52,975
- What about when the baby comes?
- Vanessa's a nurse.

426
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:55,079
She can...

427
00:31:56,613 --> 00:31:59,613
What's your plan, Matt?

428
00:31:59,615 --> 00:32:02,683
Stay? Fight?

429
00:32:02,685 --> 00:32:06,488
I mean, I've been in a few bar brawls, but I
doubt anyone here has ever been in a gun battle.

430
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:08,356
- Huh?
- Peter has.

431
00:32:08,358 --> 00:32:12,163
- Bella.
- He was one of the Bankstown boys.

432
00:32:14,464 --> 00:32:16,199
Great.

433
00:32:21,337 --> 00:32:22,738
Have you ever
killed another man?

434
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:26,243
- Yeah. He's been in...
- Bella, please.

435
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:32,146
Well, to be quite honest, I've been
inside for the last seven years.

436
00:32:32,148 --> 00:32:34,682
I've only been out
for about a month.

437
00:32:34,684 --> 00:32:38,152
- Well, that's just perfect.
- What's that supposed to mean, mate?

438
00:32:38,154 --> 00:32:42,090
I've paid my debt. I was in
the middle of moving my family

439
00:32:42,092 --> 00:32:44,125
as far away from that
city life as I could get.

440
00:32:44,127 --> 00:32:46,460
Okay.

441
00:32:46,462 --> 00:32:49,730
Well, I'm no killer,

442
00:32:49,732 --> 00:32:52,700
but I was a crack shot with
a rifle in the army reserve.

443
00:32:52,702 --> 00:32:56,238
Mind you, that was
a good 30 years ago.

444
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,308
- I can fight.
- Now why would we believe anything you say?

445
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:04,712
- You wanna find out, mustache?
- Anytime..

446
00:33:04,714 --> 00:33:10,053
- What was that?
- Look, we got a murderer and a bum. It's over.

447
00:33:11,221 --> 00:33:13,223
We're going, Vanessa. Come on.

448
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:24,099
You wanna go, go.

449
00:33:24,101 --> 00:33:26,535
I'm going back
to the town.

450
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:29,207
Find out what happened
to our families.

451
00:33:32,742 --> 00:33:34,644
Good luck, Jack-o.

452
00:33:45,756 --> 00:33:48,155
- You guys should stay.
- Mm-hmm.

453
00:33:48,157 --> 00:33:50,324
If there's one thing I know
about Dad, he's a fighter.

454
00:33:50,326 --> 00:33:54,365
Yeah, we'll all take care
of each other, right?

455
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:59,704
Twenty-four hours,
and then we'll decide.

456
00:34:05,741 --> 00:34:07,545
Shit.

457
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:12,416
All right.
Spread out, be careful.

458
00:34:34,538 --> 00:34:36,338
- This is stupid.
- Shh!

459
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,905
How are we supposed
to fight them if they see us?

460
00:34:37,907 --> 00:34:39,710
Shut up.

461
00:34:41,244 --> 00:34:42,547
Baby, stay.

462
00:34:54,824 --> 00:34:56,490
Take that.

463
00:34:56,492 --> 00:35:00,195
- Here, here, we gotta move.
- Are you serious?

464
00:35:00,197 --> 00:35:03,634
Christ. If we come across
anything, we'll just build a gun.

465
00:35:27,858 --> 00:35:34,231
- What the hell are they doing?
- Making themselves at home.

466
00:36:01,324 --> 00:36:04,425
- Mrs. Kyle.
- Dennis. Matty.

467
00:36:04,427 --> 00:36:07,329
- Get away, as far as you can.
- Have you seen my mom?

468
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,862
They moved her today
with some of the others.

469
00:36:08,864 --> 00:36:11,900
- Have you seen these two?
- Those poor kids.

470
00:36:11,902 --> 00:36:14,469
It'll be okay, Mrs. Kyle.

471
00:36:14,471 --> 00:36:18,305
They're coming!
Go, run, go!

472
00:36:18,307 --> 00:36:20,941
Just stay alive, okay? We're
coming back, just stay alive.

473
00:37:05,655 --> 00:37:07,824
Okay. Go.

474
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:20,034
How did we end up with
a nurse of our own, huh?

475
00:37:20,036 --> 00:37:22,503
That's...
that's just crazy luck.

476
00:37:22,505 --> 00:37:24,673
Yeah, well, I'm still in my
three year training period,

477
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:27,976
- so I wouldn't be so sure.
- Oops, amputated the wrong leg.

478
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:33,451
Don't be so modest.
It's only another year, babe.

479
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:38,086
What am I saying?

480
00:37:38,088 --> 00:37:42,724
- Try not to dwell, son.
- Yeah, it's hard not to.

481
00:37:42,726 --> 00:37:45,360
I've wasted the last ten years
of my life on social media.

482
00:37:45,362 --> 00:37:48,662
Yeah, yeah, I know, me too.

483
00:37:48,664 --> 00:37:52,434
Hashtag "bestdayever."
Hashtag "TGIF."

484
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:59,007
Hashtag "it's-the-end of-the
world-we're-all-gonna-die who-gives-a-shit?"

485
00:37:59,009 --> 00:38:01,943
Something's wrong.
They should be back by now.

486
00:38:01,945 --> 00:38:03,748
Easy.

487
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,548
I'm gonna give it another hour

488
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,882
and then we're leaving.

489
00:38:07,884 --> 00:38:09,516
Yeah.
I'm getting a bad feeling.

490
00:38:09,518 --> 00:38:11,485
- We can't just leave.
- I know, baby,

491
00:38:11,487 --> 00:38:13,588
but we have to think
about the rest of us.

492
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:15,055
Look, take it easy,
all right?

493
00:38:15,057 --> 00:38:18,425
Look, I said relax, mate.

494
00:38:18,427 --> 00:38:20,764
No one's going anywhere.

495
00:38:24,034 --> 00:38:25,603
Take a load off.

496
00:38:32,708 --> 00:38:35,045
What are you doing, Pete?

497
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:39,847
- Oh, that's just great.
- Okay. Let him go.

498
00:38:39,849 --> 00:38:41,985
Just be cool.

499
00:38:46,088 --> 00:38:49,492
Hey, you wanna go back inside?
I can stay out here.

500
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,427
Where's Mom?

501
00:38:52,429 --> 00:38:55,063
It's us.

502
00:38:55,065 --> 00:38:56,498
- Are you guys all right?
- Yeah.

503
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,800
- Yeah, we're fine.
- Yeah.

504
00:38:58,802 --> 00:39:01,105
What's going on down there?

505
00:39:04,641 --> 00:39:07,842
- Did you see Mom?
- Thanks.

506
00:39:07,844 --> 00:39:11,615
- Jenny, Samuel?
- No.

507
00:39:14,184 --> 00:39:16,050
Everyone's been taken
to the old factory.

508
00:39:16,052 --> 00:39:18,619
It's like a livestock paddock,

509
00:39:18,621 --> 00:39:21,488
except we're the livestock.

510
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:23,958
The bastards are here
for the long haul.

511
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,528
What, do you speak alien?
How do you know?

512
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,898
Because we saw them...

513
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:38,108
You led them right to us.

514
00:39:44,481 --> 00:39:46,851
- Behind here.
- Go, go, go.

515
00:39:49,652 --> 00:39:53,123
Okay. Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

516
00:40:55,018 --> 00:40:56,586
You son of a bitch!

517
00:40:58,788 --> 00:41:00,824
Matt, Matt.

518
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:09,967
You expect
a welcome party, bitch?

519
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:47,838
Oh! Ah!

520
00:41:57,581 --> 00:42:00,615
Hold him down,
hold him down!

521
00:42:00,617 --> 00:42:02,150
Hold him down, Arnold.
Get his leg!

522
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:05,054
Grab it! Grab it!

523
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:27,742
Hold him down. Get his leg!

524
00:42:27,744 --> 00:42:30,748
- Grab it! Grab it!
- Hold him down!

525
00:42:31,914 --> 00:42:33,715
Hold him!

526
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:36,887
Clear shot, better watch now,
watch out!

527
00:42:38,954 --> 00:42:40,990
Pull his head back,
pull his head back!

528
00:42:42,257 --> 00:42:44,160
Pull his head back!

529
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:57,974
Die, you son of a bitch!

530
00:43:05,748 --> 00:43:08,383
Well, that was your best
tackle of the season.

531
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:11,918
Arnold's hurt.

532
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,123
- Oh, God.
- You're crazy, old man, you know that?

533
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:18,860
Ah! Just got the wind
knocked out of me.

534
00:43:18,862 --> 00:43:20,961
Guys, we gotta go. Now.

535
00:43:20,963 --> 00:43:25,066
And we're taking these bodies with us.
Grab those guns, too.

536
00:43:25,068 --> 00:43:29,103
Thanks, Pete.
Thank you.

537
00:43:29,105 --> 00:43:31,875
Let's get rid
of this thing, huh?

538
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:48,389
They're
gonna hunt us down now.

539
00:43:48,391 --> 00:43:50,458
We just started a war.

540
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,963
We're already at war.

541
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:58,800
Son of a bitch.

542
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:01,001
Oh.

543
00:44:06,275 --> 00:44:11,848
Oh, that's...

544
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:16,286
- You all right?
- That's just...

545
00:44:18,755 --> 00:44:21,188
- Matty. Matt.
- Matt. No, no, no, don't.

546
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:22,456
You don't know
what that will do.

547
00:44:22,458 --> 00:44:25,094
What have we got to lose?

548
00:44:30,032 --> 00:44:31,465
Holy shit.

549
00:44:31,467 --> 00:44:37,340
- What do you see?
- Everything.

550
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,882
- And nothing.
- What?

551
00:44:50,253 --> 00:44:52,186
Give me a look?

552
00:44:52,188 --> 00:44:53,854
Careful, baby, it's heavy.

553
00:44:53,856 --> 00:44:55,155
It stinks.

554
00:44:55,157 --> 00:44:58,325
The helmets pick up
anything alive.

555
00:44:58,327 --> 00:45:03,831
Out here there's so much life
that... we're invisible.

556
00:45:03,833 --> 00:45:06,767
Maybe where they're from, there
isn't any other life to see.

557
00:45:06,769 --> 00:45:12,041
These guys are here to stay. We want this
back, we're gonna have to do something.

558
00:45:14,277 --> 00:45:16,443
Hm. Let's do it, then.

559
00:45:16,445 --> 00:45:19,045
I'm with you till the end.

560
00:45:19,047 --> 00:45:21,951
That's more like it.

561
00:45:24,019 --> 00:45:25,853
Invisible, eh?

562
00:45:25,855 --> 00:45:28,492
Bastards won't know
what hit 'em.

563
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:37,465
These things are a little
different from our rifles.

564
00:45:37,467 --> 00:45:39,800
But the same principle applies.

565
00:45:39,802 --> 00:45:45,305
Anyone's grandma can shoot a target
20 feet away in broad daylight.

566
00:45:45,307 --> 00:45:49,480
We gotta be faster than them,
smarter than them.

567
00:45:51,581 --> 00:45:54,849
And when you're ready,
the shot must be released

568
00:45:54,851 --> 00:45:58,519
<i>without any disturbance
to the firer's position.</i>

569
00:45:58,521 --> 00:46:02,222
Alrighty. Take aim.

570
00:46:02,224 --> 00:46:04,393
<i>Breathe in.</i>

571
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,195
Take 'em down.

572
00:46:29,853 --> 00:46:32,485
Greetings, Earthlings. Come
with me if you want to live.

573
00:46:32,487 --> 00:46:35,423
Always wanted to say that.
You're heavy.

574
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:39,028
Come on, let's go.
Has anyone seen my mom?

575
00:46:40,329 --> 00:46:42,429
You the last?

576
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:44,097
Arnold.

577
00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:47,471
Arnold, let's go.
Jackson, come on.

578
00:47:04,186 --> 00:47:06,289
Hello.

579
00:47:08,224 --> 00:47:10,057
Where to start today?

580
00:47:10,059 --> 00:47:11,626
<i>Dad's still clinging
to the hope</i>

581
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:15,295
<i>that Mom and Sammy
are alive out there.</i>

582
00:47:15,297 --> 00:47:18,199
<i>I'm trying to believe it.</i>

583
00:47:18,201 --> 00:47:20,001
Hey, hey. Here.

584
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,635
<i>I'm not sure
if I'm that naive anymore.</i>

585
00:47:21,637 --> 00:47:24,237
Come on, you must be exhausted,
here, here.

586
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:26,941
- <i>If you're watching...</i>
- <i>Here. Here you go.</i>

587
00:47:26,943 --> 00:47:29,146
...I miss you.

588
00:47:30,213 --> 00:47:31,646
We're doing good, right?

589
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:33,383
Yeah.

590
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:38,286
<i>I'm fighting for you.</i>

591
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:40,655
<i>The others are kicking ass.</i>

592
00:47:40,657 --> 00:47:44,925
<i>Um, Marcus and I
have been building armor,</i>

593
00:47:44,927 --> 00:47:48,065
<i>repairing clothes
for survivors.</i>

594
00:47:52,568 --> 00:47:54,972
He's a good kid.

595
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:03,110
I don't... I don't even know
who's gonna watch this.

596
00:48:03,112 --> 00:48:07,548
These are the best
seats in the house, babe.

597
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:09,349
Yeah, my view
isn't too bad either.

598
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:14,421
I hope the baby
gets your eyes.

599
00:48:14,423 --> 00:48:17,260
I hope the baby
gets your strength.

600
00:48:20,128 --> 00:48:23,164
I couldn't do this
without you, baby.

601
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:26,603
We're gonna get
through this... somehow.

602
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:29,269
Yeah.

603
00:48:29,271 --> 00:48:32,273
So you do that,
cut off their supplies,

604
00:48:32,275 --> 00:48:34,441
it also hits their morale.

605
00:48:34,443 --> 00:48:38,579
Now, we just need to figure out
what's strategic to them.

606
00:48:38,581 --> 00:48:42,583
An occupying force can
be brought to its knees,

607
00:48:42,585 --> 00:48:46,356
if you have the will
and the drive to fight.

608
00:48:47,724 --> 00:48:51,061
I just never thought
we'd be the ones occupied.

609
00:48:52,394 --> 00:48:55,028
Okay. Bella, compression
on the head wound.

610
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:57,597
Bella, you got this.

611
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,566
Okay. Bandages.

612
00:48:59,568 --> 00:49:01,534
Keep that there,
now check her for vital signs.

613
00:49:01,536 --> 00:49:04,438
- Yeah. She's gonna be okay.
- You're gonna be okay.

614
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,275
Yeah.

615
00:49:20,623 --> 00:49:23,226
Guys, they're
poisoning the water.

616
00:49:34,536 --> 00:49:38,072
- Hey, where's, um...
- We're out.

617
00:49:38,074 --> 00:49:41,211
- The creeks...
- Higher ground, boys.

618
00:49:52,221 --> 00:49:53,757
Come on.

619
00:50:01,731 --> 00:50:03,563
We got people here
looking to us to lead.

620
00:50:03,565 --> 00:50:06,499
- You guys wanna get in the fight?
- Yeah.

621
00:50:06,501 --> 00:50:08,637
Just get your
head right, mate.

622
00:50:36,498 --> 00:50:38,100
Let's go!

623
00:50:42,237 --> 00:50:43,806
Move, move!

624
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:07,164
I guess it's important to
document the end of the world.

625
00:51:11,434 --> 00:51:16,673
If anyone finds this,
we really tried.

626
00:51:36,692 --> 00:51:40,394
Hey, hey.

627
00:51:40,396 --> 00:51:42,530
Matt.

628
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:44,664
We're not gonna hurt you.

629
00:51:44,666 --> 00:51:46,802
Hey.

630
00:51:48,503 --> 00:51:50,938
I'm Amelia.

631
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:54,575
- What's your name?
- Chloe.

632
00:51:54,577 --> 00:51:56,911
Where did you get the gun,
Chloe?

633
00:51:56,913 --> 00:51:59,115
Found... found it.

634
00:52:01,416 --> 00:52:03,717
- You wanna put it down?
- No.

635
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:06,556
- Okay.
- How did you get away?

636
00:52:07,789 --> 00:52:10,324
I crawled.

637
00:52:10,326 --> 00:52:13,563
Hey, hey.

638
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:16,867
Did they do this?

639
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:35,349
They've got the rest out here
just planting for their food.

640
00:52:35,351 --> 00:52:38,385
Okay.
Chloe, Chloe.

641
00:52:38,387 --> 00:52:41,921
It's okay. Look at me.
It's okay.

642
00:52:41,923 --> 00:52:46,630
Give me the gun.
It's okay.

643
00:52:49,264 --> 00:52:51,498
They know
everything about us.

644
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,001
Some are slaves.

645
00:52:54,003 --> 00:52:55,668
Some are...
Some are like me.

646
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:57,338
Okay. Okay.

647
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:00,273
- Take it, take it. Take it.
- Okay.

648
00:53:00,275 --> 00:53:03,276
- Okay.
- Baby, baby, we got to move.

649
00:53:03,278 --> 00:53:06,012
No, no!

650
00:53:06,014 --> 00:53:09,550
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- No!

651
00:53:27,769 --> 00:53:29,505
Come on!

652
00:53:36,278 --> 00:53:38,278
- This is the place?
- Yup.

653
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,713
Every night this week they've
dropped off more, right here.

654
00:53:40,715 --> 00:53:42,883
- You checked the detonators?
- Yeah.

655
00:53:42,885 --> 00:53:44,584
- And the wires?
- Yeah.

656
00:53:44,586 --> 00:53:45,853
- What about the...
- Yeah, man, it's cool.

657
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:49,490
I got it. Jesus.

658
00:53:49,492 --> 00:53:51,557
We've got problems.

659
00:53:51,559 --> 00:53:55,362
Okay. Shh. Quiet.

660
00:53:55,364 --> 00:53:56,800
Here it comes.

661
00:54:11,447 --> 00:54:15,818
- Yeah! Good one!
- Told you, I told you.

662
00:55:05,034 --> 00:55:10,070
Hello. What...

663
00:55:10,072 --> 00:55:12,873
Slow down, slow down.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.

664
00:55:12,875 --> 00:55:15,778
You should have seen it blow.
Boom.

665
00:55:17,512 --> 00:55:20,079
Hey, I'll be back.

666
00:55:20,081 --> 00:55:22,885
Dennis, Dennis, Dennis.

667
00:55:34,864 --> 00:55:38,034
Remember, always aim
ahead of the bow.

668
00:55:50,646 --> 00:55:53,416
Hey. You guys better see this.

669
00:56:10,733 --> 00:56:12,499
What have you done?

670
00:56:12,501 --> 00:56:14,668
We've been doing it
your way for months.

671
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:16,804
It's time we start
listening to someone else.

672
00:56:16,806 --> 00:56:19,106
How do you know
they can't track him?

673
00:56:19,108 --> 00:56:21,577
We're not stupid,
we checked it over.

674
00:56:22,878 --> 00:56:26,079
- Whoa.
- How the hell did you do it?

675
00:56:26,081 --> 00:56:29,148
We caught two of them off guard.

676
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:32,019
The other one got Amy and Jean
Claude before Bella shot it.

677
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:35,822
That's not the deal, Bella. You're
not supposed to go after them.

678
00:56:35,824 --> 00:56:37,990
- Relax, Pete, she did good.
- I'm not talking to you.

679
00:56:37,992 --> 00:56:41,195
- You disobeyed me.
- You're kidding.

680
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:44,965
Who do you think was looking
after our family?

681
00:56:44,967 --> 00:56:49,539
- I don't want to hear it.
- This is bullshit.

682
00:56:55,143 --> 00:56:59,213
What about you?
What were you thinking, hm?

683
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:01,815
Thinking that I was actually
doing something for once.

684
00:57:01,817 --> 00:57:05,688
I can really help.
I'm not a kid anymore.

685
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:15,864
They're experimenting
on humans.

686
00:57:17,833 --> 00:57:21,838
- How do you know that?
- I know.

687
00:57:22,905 --> 00:57:25,137
We gotta bust them out of there.

688
00:57:25,139 --> 00:57:28,608
Yeah. I'm with you
on that, Arnold.

689
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:31,144
And what do we do
with this thing, huh?

690
00:57:31,146 --> 00:57:33,947
You're experimenting on us,
are you?

691
00:57:33,949 --> 00:57:38,918
Get off me, get off me!

692
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:41,153
- Enemy soldier!
- I haven't finished with him.

693
00:57:41,155 --> 00:57:43,557
Let's just sit on this before
doing anything rash, all right?

694
00:57:43,559 --> 00:57:45,829
Come on, mate, let's go.

695
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:50,097
Sort your shit out.

696
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:52,199
Jackson, just put it
out of its misery.

697
00:57:52,201 --> 00:57:53,566
- What?
- No.

698
00:57:53,568 --> 00:57:55,101
Look at it.
This isn't right.

699
00:57:55,103 --> 00:57:57,537
- I don't like this.
- What would you like?

700
00:57:57,539 --> 00:58:00,943
- I need to talk to you, now.
- What?

701
00:58:06,282 --> 00:58:08,115
Why did you
let them do that?

702
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:10,550
- Can you blame them?
- Hmm.

703
00:58:10,552 --> 00:58:14,054
What good is beating the shit
out of it gonna do anyone?

704
00:58:14,056 --> 00:58:16,789
They invaded us.
Maybe they deserve it.

705
00:58:16,791 --> 00:58:19,159
Yeah. Columbus found America,

706
00:58:19,161 --> 00:58:21,862
Cook found Australia, they were never the
same again. These guys aren't leaving.

707
00:58:21,864 --> 00:58:26,133
So, what? You want
to give up, let them kill us?

708
00:58:26,135 --> 00:58:29,302
- Your mom?
- No. Mm-mm.

709
00:58:29,304 --> 00:58:32,338
I want us to be real
about this, okay?

710
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:34,675
That big ship in the sky,
it's not going anywhere.

711
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:38,278
We all know it. We need to accept
that the life that we had is gone.

712
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,717
- Bullshit.
- It's gone.

713
00:58:42,117 --> 00:58:44,521
I love you.

714
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:50,793
I do not accept any other life
than one we choose for each other.

715
00:58:58,266 --> 00:59:00,133
Vanessa.

716
00:59:00,135 --> 00:59:02,202
Why did you have to bring it
back here, huh?

717
00:59:02,204 --> 00:59:05,137
What? I was trying to help.
Suddenly I'm the bad guy?

718
00:59:05,139 --> 00:59:09,642
You're not a bad guy, but
you have to control your ego.

719
00:59:09,644 --> 00:59:11,811
- My ego, wow.
- You know what I mean.

720
00:59:11,813 --> 00:59:14,648
It's just, like, you're
always trying to be the best,

721
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:18,084
but this isn't a game, Jackson.
All right?

722
00:59:18,086 --> 00:59:20,287
Slow down,
let them run this.

723
00:59:20,289 --> 00:59:23,893
I need you around
when the baby arrives.

724
01:00:31,427 --> 01:00:33,262
What are you doing?

725
01:00:47,141 --> 01:00:49,041
Bella? Bella.

726
01:00:49,043 --> 01:00:50,342
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop, stop, stop.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

727
01:00:50,344 --> 01:00:52,012
- What?
- You okay?

728
01:00:52,014 --> 01:00:54,014
- Yeah.
- Are you sure you're okay?

729
01:00:54,016 --> 01:00:55,414
Yes.

730
01:00:55,416 --> 01:00:58,855
Your dad, he just
doesn't quit, does he?

731
01:00:59,922 --> 01:01:01,987
What's that?

732
01:01:01,989 --> 01:01:08,961
Oh, it's about $9,634.25.

733
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,867
- Dennis?
- No, it's good.

734
01:01:13,869 --> 01:01:16,235
It's good. It's good.

735
01:01:16,237 --> 01:01:18,905
It's a new world, right?
Come on.

736
01:01:18,907 --> 01:01:22,876
I mean, everything we should
value we have here, right?

737
01:01:22,878 --> 01:01:28,184
People, family,
relationships. That shit...

738
01:01:29,751 --> 01:01:31,318
It doesn't matter anymore.

739
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:34,755
Yeah.

740
01:01:34,757 --> 01:01:37,523
You should try it.
You should try something new.

741
01:01:37,525 --> 01:01:40,159
- What?
- Try something new.

742
01:01:40,161 --> 01:01:44,097
It's a new world. So anything
connected to the old world...

743
01:01:44,099 --> 01:01:45,965
Go on. Try it.
What have you got?

744
01:01:45,967 --> 01:01:47,367
You got a thousand pockets
in this thing.

745
01:01:47,369 --> 01:01:49,101
You gotta
have something in here.

746
01:01:49,103 --> 01:01:50,537
- No. I don't...
- What have... what's this?

747
01:01:50,539 --> 01:01:53,373
Okay, nice. Try it.

748
01:01:53,375 --> 01:01:55,175
Trust me.

749
01:01:55,177 --> 01:01:57,543
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.

750
01:01:57,545 --> 01:02:00,780
Nice.

751
01:02:00,782 --> 01:02:03,349
Oh, my God.

752
01:02:03,351 --> 01:02:07,723
Actually, I've got
something for you.

753
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:11,059
It might be of value.

754
01:02:13,262 --> 01:02:16,231
- What is it?
- Open it.

755
01:02:19,534 --> 01:02:22,904
- Is that me?
- Hmm.

756
01:02:33,148 --> 01:02:38,284
So they've been watching us for centuries,
just planning? Why did they wait so long?

757
01:02:38,286 --> 01:02:42,521
It doesn't really
matter what they want.

758
01:02:42,523 --> 01:02:46,425
Their plans don't
include us hanging around.

759
01:02:46,427 --> 01:02:48,295
You know what
we have to do, huh?

760
01:02:48,297 --> 01:02:50,800
What do we have to do?

761
01:02:56,838 --> 01:03:00,139
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Peter, what are you doing?

762
01:03:00,141 --> 01:03:02,575
Right, I get you want your family back.
But this is nuts.

763
01:03:02,577 --> 01:03:05,211
Look, the only way to get our planet
back is to kill enough of them

764
01:03:05,213 --> 01:03:07,613
- until they lose the will to fight.
- You don't know them.

765
01:03:07,615 --> 01:03:09,583
This thing has information,
this thing can help us.

766
01:03:09,585 --> 01:03:11,584
We don't know what's
going on out there, Pete.

767
01:03:11,586 --> 01:03:12,952
I know what will happen
if you don't get out of my way.

768
01:03:12,954 --> 01:03:14,487
Matt, Pete, Pete.

769
01:03:14,489 --> 01:03:16,055
Just calm down.
Calm down, all right?

770
01:03:17,326 --> 01:03:20,526
You don't like it?
Piss off!

771
01:04:20,621 --> 01:04:23,125
Are you proud of yourself?

772
01:04:24,425 --> 01:04:26,494
What about you, boy?

773
01:04:28,329 --> 01:04:31,900
Why don't you piss off back
to jail where you belong?

774
01:04:57,525 --> 01:04:58,994
Listen up.

775
01:05:01,362 --> 01:05:03,095
We're going back to the factory.

776
01:05:03,097 --> 01:05:05,498
We're getting our people out.

777
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:08,168
- Any volunteers to go on a supply run?
- Let me go.

778
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:11,271
- Got a list of every person from town.
- Where's your sister?

779
01:05:11,273 --> 01:05:14,074
- She left on her own.
- I'm ready, Matt.

780
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:18,644
That's why you're coming with us.
Get your gear, kid.

781
01:05:18,646 --> 01:05:20,412
So, what are you gonna
say to Amelia, huh?

782
01:05:20,414 --> 01:05:22,081
Amelia's not here.

783
01:05:22,083 --> 01:05:24,383
We've just gotten back
from another all-nighter.

784
01:05:24,385 --> 01:05:26,219
- We're tired.
- Then don't go.

785
01:05:26,221 --> 01:05:28,988
Matt, these guys are exhausted.

786
01:05:28,990 --> 01:05:31,157
They're gonna
make mistakes out there.

787
01:05:31,159 --> 01:05:34,427
We fight or we die.

788
01:05:34,429 --> 01:05:37,998
I'm sick
of digging graves, man.

789
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,235
How about you?

790
01:05:43,070 --> 01:05:45,237
Coming?

791
01:05:45,239 --> 01:05:47,273
Hey, no.
We talked about this.

792
01:05:47,275 --> 01:05:50,142
Yeah. But the baby,
all right?

793
01:05:50,144 --> 01:05:52,244
We need supplies.

794
01:05:52,246 --> 01:05:57,118
- Be careful, okay?
- I'll be careful.

795
01:05:59,054 --> 01:06:01,157
Be back soon, baby.

796
01:07:05,152 --> 01:07:07,686
- You and I need to have a little talk.
- Yeah?

797
01:07:07,688 --> 01:07:12,694
- You done killing prisoners?
- Don't be smart, boy.

798
01:07:14,728 --> 01:07:18,798
- She's my little girl.
- Oh. Oh, right, that.

799
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,599
Okay. What?

800
01:07:20,601 --> 01:07:23,603
Hey, I'm her stepdad, maybe
I'm a little overprotective.

801
01:07:23,605 --> 01:07:26,873
But what I don't like
is some shithead like you

802
01:07:26,875 --> 01:07:30,577
taking advantage
of an opportunity.

803
01:07:30,579 --> 01:07:33,646
Well, I don't know what
you want me to say, Pete.

804
01:07:33,648 --> 01:07:35,548
They're just drawings.

805
01:07:35,550 --> 01:07:38,150
You are this close, mate.
You are this close.

806
01:07:38,152 --> 01:07:40,653
Hey, Ness, Ness, Ness.

807
01:07:40,655 --> 01:07:42,621
- Yeah.
- You all right?

808
01:07:42,623 --> 01:07:44,356
You okay?

809
01:07:44,358 --> 01:07:45,624
Just stay away from her, okay?

810
01:07:45,626 --> 01:07:47,193
It's all right.
You can go inside.

811
01:07:49,864 --> 01:07:53,633
All right. Get inside.
Get inside, please. Oh!

812
01:07:53,635 --> 01:07:54,733
- I got you. I got you.
- Oh.

813
01:07:54,735 --> 01:07:56,436
- Bella!
- It's okay.

814
01:07:56,438 --> 01:07:58,137
Look at me. It's okay.

815
01:07:58,139 --> 01:08:00,373
It's okay. It's okay.

816
01:08:00,375 --> 01:08:02,842
- Oh!
- Okay. Breathe. Breathe.

817
01:08:02,844 --> 01:08:05,211
- Vanessa, over here.
- Okay.

818
01:08:05,213 --> 01:08:07,646
- Breathe. Come on.
- You okay?

819
01:08:07,648 --> 01:08:09,816
- Where's Jackson?
- He's out on a run. They all are.

820
01:08:09,818 --> 01:08:11,617
- It's okay. We're gonna help.
- Seth, Seth.

821
01:08:11,619 --> 01:08:13,853
Go out and find someone who
can help, anybody, a nurse.

822
01:08:13,855 --> 01:08:16,789
She is a nurse. You've had two kids.
You must know something.

823
01:08:16,791 --> 01:08:18,691
Look, I wasn't there
for either of them.

824
01:08:18,693 --> 01:08:20,393
All right. I'm gonna
walk you through this, okay?

825
01:08:20,395 --> 01:08:22,829
Okay.

826
01:08:22,831 --> 01:08:24,930
- I'll go find Jackson.
- Oh! Okay.

827
01:08:24,932 --> 01:08:26,732
Okay. Squeeze as hard
as you like.

828
01:08:26,734 --> 01:08:28,268
- What's going on?
- Her baby's coming.

829
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:29,768
Whoa. Hey, Ness.

830
01:08:29,770 --> 01:08:31,336
- It's okay.
- Bella.

831
01:08:31,338 --> 01:08:32,405
- I'm here.
- Okay.

832
01:08:50,926 --> 01:08:53,559
Just relax. It's all right. You can do this.

833
01:08:53,561 --> 01:08:55,628
- Vanessa, tell me what you need.
- I wanna wait for Jackson.

834
01:08:55,630 --> 01:08:57,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Dennis is gonna get him.

835
01:08:57,332 --> 01:08:59,299
- Can I just wait for Jackson?
- This baby isn't...

836
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:00,799
- Please, I need Jackson here.
- This baby isn't gonna wait.

837
01:09:00,801 --> 01:09:02,835
Bella, have a look.
What's happening?

838
01:09:02,837 --> 01:09:03,769
It's happening.

839
01:09:10,811 --> 01:09:12,911
Come on. Bella.

840
01:09:12,913 --> 01:09:15,514
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
That's it.

841
01:09:15,516 --> 01:09:17,584
- It's happening too fast.
- Good girl. Come on.

842
01:09:17,586 --> 01:09:19,852
Something's wrong. It's happening too fast.
Something's wrong.

843
01:09:19,854 --> 01:09:21,653
It's okay. You're okay.
You're okay.

844
01:09:21,655 --> 01:09:22,988
- No one's listening to me.
- You can do this.

845
01:09:22,990 --> 01:09:25,825
Everything you can carry, kid.
Move it.

846
01:09:25,827 --> 01:09:28,760
I want that 4x4 stripped
in 20 minutes, Jackson.

847
01:09:28,762 --> 01:09:30,729
Matt, the storm's setting in.
We're a long way out.

848
01:09:30,731 --> 01:09:33,234
- Let's just get out of here, all right?
- We're pushing on.

849
01:09:39,474 --> 01:09:43,578
- What?
- Vanessa.

850
01:09:44,645 --> 01:09:46,912
Jackson. Jackson, no!

851
01:09:46,914 --> 01:09:49,752
Jackson!
On your left!

852
01:09:58,726 --> 01:10:01,462
Come on, old man.
Don't you die on me.

853
01:10:03,030 --> 01:10:05,501
- Go!
- Ah!

854
01:10:07,034 --> 01:10:08,000
Matt!

855
01:10:08,002 --> 01:10:09,871
You can do this. Let's go.

856
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:14,574
- Shit.
- Run.

857
01:10:14,576 --> 01:10:16,442
- Let's get out of here.
- Get me out. Get me out!

858
01:10:16,444 --> 01:10:19,478
- Bella, grab the blaster!
- I've got it!

859
01:10:31,359 --> 01:10:33,293
It's okay.

860
01:10:35,529 --> 01:10:38,464
Seth. Grab the gun, Seth.

861
01:10:38,466 --> 01:10:40,299
- Bella, over here.
- Okay.

862
01:10:40,301 --> 01:10:43,505
You're good. You're good.

863
01:10:57,819 --> 01:11:00,719
Grab his leg!
Move, move, move!

864
01:11:00,721 --> 01:11:04,025
- Go!
- Ah!

865
01:11:13,033 --> 01:11:15,902
Marcus, what's happening?
Marcus!

866
01:11:15,904 --> 01:11:18,407
Marcus, what are you doing?

867
01:11:32,087 --> 01:11:35,821
I can't, I can't!
I can't, I can't!

868
01:11:35,823 --> 01:11:38,691
It's okay. It's okay.

869
01:11:38,693 --> 01:11:40,927
They're killing them all.
They're killing them all.

870
01:11:40,929 --> 01:11:43,995
- Here, bite down on this.
- I know!

871
01:11:43,997 --> 01:11:46,465
- You gotta keep quiet!
- Stop it!

872
01:11:46,467 --> 01:11:48,604
Please keep her quiet!

873
01:11:50,137 --> 01:11:53,438
- Slow down. Choose your targets.
- Arnold, is he alive?

874
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:56,478
- Dennis.
- Come here, keep an eye on our six.

875
01:12:00,114 --> 01:12:03,652
It's okay. It's okay!

876
01:12:04,918 --> 01:12:07,387
- Come on!
- No, I can't! I can't!

877
01:12:07,389 --> 01:12:08,888
You can do this.
Keep going. Keep going.

878
01:12:08,890 --> 01:12:11,491
- Oh, my God!
- We can see the head.

879
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:13,058
- Keep breathing!
- You gotta work with me!

880
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:16,696
They're gonna hear us!
They're gonna hear us!

881
01:12:20,435 --> 01:12:22,101
It's coming.
You're getting there.

882
01:12:31,078 --> 01:12:34,048
Push this kid out now.

883
01:12:47,494 --> 01:12:49,428
Shit!

884
01:12:49,430 --> 01:12:52,098
Shut up!

885
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:55,871
Get out of here!

886
01:12:57,204 --> 01:12:59,938
It's okay. It's just you and me.

887
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:01,174
We're gonna be okay.

888
01:13:02,877 --> 01:13:04,643
Oh, my God! It's okay.

889
01:13:04,645 --> 01:13:07,179
She's coming.
She's coming.

890
01:13:07,181 --> 01:13:09,449
- Daddy!
- No!

891
01:13:09,451 --> 01:13:13,820
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

892
01:13:13,822 --> 01:13:16,656
Oh, a baby!
You've got a baby girl.

893
01:13:16,658 --> 01:13:21,193
It's a baby girl. Oh, it's so beautiful.

894
01:13:21,195 --> 01:13:23,196
You have a baby girl.

895
01:13:25,966 --> 01:13:28,134
Motherfucker!

896
01:13:28,136 --> 01:13:30,102
Fuck you!

897
01:13:30,104 --> 01:13:32,941
Jackson's gonna be
so proud of you.

898
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:38,611
I'm gonna kill you!
I'll kill you!

899
01:13:42,182 --> 01:13:46,218
I love you so much.

900
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:49,023
- Tell Jackson...
- Yeah?

901
01:13:50,824 --> 01:13:52,657
Allison.

902
01:13:52,659 --> 01:13:54,794
Vanessa?

903
01:13:54,796 --> 01:13:58,531
Vanessa! Vanessa!

904
01:13:58,533 --> 01:14:00,199
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

905
01:14:00,201 --> 01:14:02,535
Oh, my God!
There's a lot of blood!

906
01:14:02,537 --> 01:14:04,803
Dad! There's so much blood!

907
01:14:04,805 --> 01:14:07,072
Dad! Wake up!

908
01:14:07,074 --> 01:14:09,141
Hey, wake up!

909
01:14:09,143 --> 01:14:12,480
Wake up!

910
01:14:15,082 --> 01:14:18,183
- Come on. Come on.
- It's okay. It's gonna be fine.

911
01:14:18,185 --> 01:14:20,018
- You're gonna be fine.
- Come on, now.

912
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:24,656
She's gonna be...

913
01:14:24,658 --> 01:14:27,058
Daddy!

914
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:30,228
Wake up, please!

915
01:14:30,230 --> 01:14:33,165
Daddy!

916
01:14:33,167 --> 01:14:35,804
Wake up!

917
01:15:20,247 --> 01:15:22,682
Australian Army!
We're gonna get you out!

918
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:25,253
Come on! Here! Go!

919
01:15:38,632 --> 01:15:41,866
Come on, guys! Get up!
Come on, let's go! Let's go!

920
01:15:41,868 --> 01:15:44,336
Go, go, go! Move out!
Go, go!

921
01:15:44,338 --> 01:15:47,339
Second Commandos,
anyone alive out there?

922
01:15:53,247 --> 01:15:57,383
I said, anyone alive out there?

923
01:15:57,385 --> 01:16:01,053
You guys okay?

924
01:16:01,055 --> 01:16:05,127
Do not move.
We'll come to you.

925
01:16:07,261 --> 01:16:09,197
Trackers are getting good, Az.

926
01:16:13,868 --> 01:16:16,102
What you got, mate?

927
01:16:16,104 --> 01:16:17,836
- 11:00.
- 11:00.

928
01:16:17,838 --> 01:16:20,809
Two hundred meters, target
moving from left to right.

929
01:16:27,849 --> 01:16:32,250
What happened?
Bella, what happened?

930
01:16:32,252 --> 01:16:34,219
Is she dead?
Is Vanessa dead?

931
01:16:34,221 --> 01:16:37,156
Do you have a medic?
Is there a medic?

932
01:16:37,158 --> 01:16:41,192
Is there a medic? It's the fucking army!
We need a fucking medic!

933
01:16:41,194 --> 01:16:44,964
Vanessa! Vanessa, no!

934
01:16:44,966 --> 01:16:47,369
Bella, what happened?!

935
01:16:51,271 --> 01:16:53,906
- No, no, no!
- Peter, look at me.

936
01:16:53,908 --> 01:16:56,211
What happened to her?

937
01:16:57,779 --> 01:17:00,079
She's not dead.
Please wake up.

938
01:17:00,081 --> 01:17:04,316
- She's gone.
- What do you mean she's gone?

939
01:17:13,427 --> 01:17:15,896
I'm so sorry.

940
01:17:23,938 --> 01:17:27,042
Oh!

941
01:17:59,306 --> 01:18:03,679
You two, take these guys out.
Do that right now.

942
01:18:24,832 --> 01:18:26,766
Tinned peaches.

943
01:18:26,768 --> 01:18:28,299
For months now,

944
01:18:28,301 --> 01:18:31,070
all we've heard about is
a resistance in the forest.

945
01:18:31,072 --> 01:18:32,905
You kept us going.

946
01:18:32,907 --> 01:18:35,241
That's why we
came back out here.

947
01:18:35,243 --> 01:18:37,446
You guys are heroes.

948
01:19:02,002 --> 01:19:05,773
He took a hit to the head.
Thank you.

949
01:19:20,587 --> 01:19:22,224
How is he?

950
01:19:29,963 --> 01:19:35,433
I found this just
before you found me.

951
01:19:35,435 --> 01:19:37,335
- They cultivated it.
- All right. Jesus, I'll just,

952
01:19:37,337 --> 01:19:39,541
I'll stick with my peaches.

953
01:19:43,109 --> 01:19:46,213
Do you know what's actually
going on out there?

954
01:20:04,131 --> 01:20:06,368
Well...

955
01:20:08,869 --> 01:20:11,903
All our cities are
either flooded or destroyed,

956
01:20:11,905 --> 01:20:15,473
something do with their ship being
too close to our atmosphere.

957
01:20:15,475 --> 01:20:19,413
Government leaders are gone,
everyone's in hiding.

958
01:20:35,128 --> 01:20:40,098
I don't know about all you guys,
but look, the army's here now.

959
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:43,602
I've got to get out of here.
I've got to keep...

960
01:20:43,604 --> 01:20:46,537
I've got to keep
searching for them.

961
01:20:46,539 --> 01:20:48,540
We're out of here, Bella.

962
01:20:48,542 --> 01:20:52,177
Dad, we can't leave.

963
01:20:52,179 --> 01:20:54,213
Pete?

964
01:20:54,215 --> 01:20:56,147
- Bella, we gotta...
- Peter.

965
01:20:56,149 --> 01:20:58,683
I will go back
to that factory with you,

966
01:20:58,685 --> 01:21:01,120
and we will finish this.

967
01:21:01,122 --> 01:21:05,193
But please, please,
can you stay?

968
01:21:08,261 --> 01:21:10,329
What factory?

969
01:21:10,331 --> 01:21:13,665
The factory's where they're
holding everyone from our town.

970
01:21:13,667 --> 01:21:16,335
I think we should see the CO.

971
01:21:16,337 --> 01:21:21,540
Recon elements indicate that the grays
have some kind of biological weapon.

972
01:21:21,542 --> 01:21:26,678
It's a toxin or pathogen obviously
designed to wipe us out once and for all.

973
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:30,382
We finally got confirmation it is
at this particular grid reference.

974
01:21:30,384 --> 01:21:34,986
- It's your town.
- That factory is one of the most strategic targets in this war.

975
01:21:34,988 --> 01:21:38,290
Now, our intel suggests that the
weapon's been moved to Sydney,

976
01:21:38,292 --> 01:21:41,626
so that's gonna be the focus
of our major attack. Davis.

977
01:21:41,628 --> 01:21:46,165
During the Sydney assault, we wanna
cause a distraction at the facility

978
01:21:46,167 --> 01:21:51,135
and destroy any means to continue
manufacturing this virus.

979
01:21:51,137 --> 01:21:54,005
Now, your prison break plan
could be that distraction.

980
01:21:54,007 --> 01:21:56,642
Now, your team know the size,
the layout,

981
01:21:56,644 --> 01:21:59,178
the disposition of the enemy
there better than anyone else.

982
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:05,284
It would help the situation if you were
to assist Major Davis and his men.

983
01:22:05,286 --> 01:22:07,689
Our first priority
is to get our families out.

984
01:22:08,756 --> 01:22:10,488
Well, my priority

985
01:22:10,490 --> 01:22:13,459
is to save as many civilian
lives as is possible.

986
01:22:13,461 --> 01:22:17,729
And there are currently 500,000
innocent people living in Sydney.

987
01:22:17,731 --> 01:22:19,464
They're living like rats.

988
01:22:19,466 --> 01:22:23,102
We are moving against
the factory at 1400 hours.

989
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:25,137
If you're in,
you have our thanks.

990
01:22:25,139 --> 01:22:29,074
If not, then we understand.
The decision's yours.

991
01:22:29,076 --> 01:22:32,510
So this is it, everybody.
Months of planning

992
01:22:32,512 --> 01:22:38,083
with every fighter, trooper, fucking
pilot, goddamn sapper we have left,

993
01:22:38,085 --> 01:22:40,785
and it all comes down to today.

994
01:22:40,787 --> 01:22:43,321
This day.

995
01:22:43,323 --> 01:22:47,459
No mistakes.
Let's make it count.

996
01:22:47,461 --> 01:22:52,367
Look after your people.
Good luck.

997
01:22:55,536 --> 01:22:59,705
She's a ball buster, no doubt. But
she got us through dark days.

998
01:22:59,707 --> 01:23:02,107
But listen, we're in a bit
of a rush here, okay?

999
01:23:02,109 --> 01:23:03,674
So if you're gonna join us,

1000
01:23:03,676 --> 01:23:07,713
there's an orders group
in one hour at the motor pool.

1001
01:23:07,715 --> 01:23:09,751
One hour.

1002
01:23:11,217 --> 01:23:13,317
I like it. Let's do this.

1003
01:23:13,319 --> 01:23:16,388
Not with your wing clipped,
old man.

1004
01:23:16,390 --> 01:23:20,826
Jackson... where are you going?

1005
01:23:20,828 --> 01:23:24,196
- I'm done.
- What?

1006
01:23:24,198 --> 01:23:26,468
I'm done.

1007
01:23:42,515 --> 01:23:45,219
There's something I have to do.

1008
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:49,153
I think you'd approve.

1009
01:23:49,155 --> 01:23:52,726
God, I love you so much.

1010
01:23:55,328 --> 01:23:58,265
Please find your way back.

1011
01:24:18,685 --> 01:24:20,552
Nothing on TV tonight, huh?

1012
01:24:20,554 --> 01:24:24,826
- Thought you might join us.
- No one else?

1013
01:24:33,199 --> 01:24:36,567
Turns out, we're all
with you till the end.

1014
01:24:36,569 --> 01:24:38,870
What do you
think you're doing?

1015
01:24:38,872 --> 01:24:40,772
- Coming with.
- I don't think so.

1016
01:24:40,774 --> 01:24:43,442
He's a fighter.
He saved my ass.

1017
01:24:43,444 --> 01:24:45,680
We're all in this together.

1018
01:24:46,846 --> 01:24:48,780
All right.

1019
01:24:48,782 --> 01:24:50,848
- What's the plan?
- Cause a distraction,

1020
01:24:50,850 --> 01:24:53,818
break your people out,
and save the fucking planet.

1021
01:24:53,820 --> 01:24:56,155
That's the plan.

1022
01:24:56,157 --> 01:24:58,891
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

1023
01:25:14,207 --> 01:25:17,209
Hope you guys
are sure about this.

1024
01:25:17,211 --> 01:25:20,245
It's everything we got left.

1025
01:25:20,247 --> 01:25:22,450
That's my family.

1026
01:25:36,564 --> 01:25:39,234
Two minutes!
Everyone sharpen up!

1027
01:25:45,206 --> 01:25:47,708
- Ready to deploy, men?
- Copy that.

1028
01:26:02,288 --> 01:26:04,725
Armor-piercing rounds!

1029
01:26:14,734 --> 01:26:18,704
Listen up. There's a lot more
of them. Intel is off.

1030
01:26:18,706 --> 01:26:20,004
Az, patch me
through to the colonel.

1031
01:26:20,006 --> 01:26:22,876
I know a vantage point.
Left up here.

1032
01:26:37,890 --> 01:26:42,727
Okay. It's a straight run through
the crops to the facility.

1033
01:26:42,729 --> 01:26:45,030
On foot, 40 minutes.

1034
01:26:45,032 --> 01:26:49,433
They're our people.
Amelia, that's right, isn't it?

1035
01:26:49,435 --> 01:26:51,669
I think so.

1036
01:26:51,671 --> 01:26:53,871
Can I borrow those?

1037
01:26:53,873 --> 01:26:57,509
Be careful.
I got them for Father's Day.

1038
01:26:57,511 --> 01:26:58,977
- You have kids?
- Not anymore.

1039
01:26:58,979 --> 01:27:02,848
- Dave-o? I've lost comms.
- Keep trying.

1040
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:04,819
Look.

1041
01:27:12,826 --> 01:27:14,761
Ah!

1042
01:27:16,997 --> 01:27:21,066
- That's a commander.
- Commander?

1043
01:27:21,068 --> 01:27:22,534
Yeah, tough sons of bitches.

1044
01:27:22,536 --> 01:27:23,968
Yeah, I barely
got away from one.

1045
01:27:23,970 --> 01:27:25,803
- We need to get them out.
- You heard the colonel.

1046
01:27:25,805 --> 01:27:27,406
There are bigger things
at stake here.

1047
01:27:27,408 --> 01:27:29,607
Look, there they are.
That's them. My family.

1048
01:27:29,609 --> 01:27:30,844
Bella!

1049
01:27:40,787 --> 01:27:43,854
- We're staying.
- Okay.

1050
01:27:43,856 --> 01:27:46,058
Something doesn't
feel right here. Az.

1051
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:49,061
- Yeah.
- Get the boys out and on rec-y.

1052
01:27:49,063 --> 01:27:51,766
I wanna know what
we're up against.

1053
01:27:58,905 --> 01:28:01,639
Grays moving
into sector 545.

1054
01:28:01,641 --> 01:28:04,976
Cag reports the enemy air strength
is much higher than anticipated.

1055
01:28:04,978 --> 01:28:10,014
And the boys are taking a hell of a
beating over the skies of Sydney.

1056
01:28:10,016 --> 01:28:12,983
- What are your numbers?
- Unknown. At 1345, Major Davis

1057
01:28:12,985 --> 01:28:15,986
reported the grays are fortifying
all along these lines.

1058
01:28:15,988 --> 01:28:19,924
When was the last report by Davis
before we lost radio contact?

1059
01:28:19,926 --> 01:28:23,363
Same as everyone else,
ma'am, about 30 minutes.

1060
01:28:27,801 --> 01:28:30,067
I think it's
a goddamn trap.

1061
01:28:30,069 --> 01:28:32,937
- Colonel!
- This is a restricted area. You cannot be in here.

1062
01:28:32,939 --> 01:28:35,773
Colonel, what's happening?
Colonel, what about my friends?

1063
01:28:35,775 --> 01:28:40,347
The attack has suffered major losses.
There's no sign of the bio weapon.

1064
01:28:42,048 --> 01:28:44,786
The virus was never moved.

1065
01:28:45,886 --> 01:28:47,085
It's still in your town.

1066
01:28:47,087 --> 01:28:49,086
What are you gonna do?

1067
01:28:49,088 --> 01:28:54,025
Well, sending what's left of my
men would be a suicide mission.

1068
01:28:54,027 --> 01:28:57,398
Your friends
are on their own.

1069
01:29:03,002 --> 01:29:05,169
Hey, hey. Hey, hey.
I need to wake him up.

1070
01:29:05,171 --> 01:29:07,472
He's off the machines
and breathing normally.

1071
01:29:07,474 --> 01:29:08,706
- It's just a matter of time.
- No, no, no.

1072
01:29:08,708 --> 01:29:10,808
Sorry.

1073
01:29:10,810 --> 01:29:13,644
Matt! Come on, Matt. I need
you to wake up, all right?

1074
01:29:13,646 --> 01:29:15,946
Get up. Matt, get up.
Come on!

1075
01:29:15,948 --> 01:29:18,083
Matt, come on!
I need you to wake up, buddy!

1076
01:29:18,085 --> 01:29:20,922
All right. Come on!
Wake up!

1077
01:29:28,429 --> 01:29:31,495
Matt! Matt.
Get up, get up, mate, come on.

1078
01:29:31,497 --> 01:29:35,166
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look at me. Matt.

1079
01:29:35,168 --> 01:29:37,869
Marcus and Amelia
are all gonna die

1080
01:29:37,871 --> 01:29:39,204
unless we do
something right now.

1081
01:29:45,645 --> 01:29:47,978
- Where are they?
- They're in town.

1082
01:29:47,980 --> 01:29:51,049
- The factory. Come on.
- Where the hell are we?

1083
01:29:51,051 --> 01:29:53,621
We're in a military camp.

1084
01:29:58,759 --> 01:30:01,863
- Get us a car.
- All right.

1085
01:30:09,069 --> 01:30:14,071
<i>♪ From glen to glen
and down the mountainside ♪</i>

1086
01:30:14,073 --> 01:30:16,942
Can I trust you
with her, mate?

1087
01:30:16,944 --> 01:30:19,544
Where do you think
you're going?

1088
01:30:19,546 --> 01:30:21,946
I'm going out.

1089
01:30:21,948 --> 01:30:24,549
I'm not letting
you go alone.

1090
01:30:24,551 --> 01:30:26,785
This is the most important
thing I can ask of you, mate.

1091
01:30:26,787 --> 01:30:28,586
- Please?
- Yeah.

1092
01:30:28,588 --> 01:30:30,488
No, it's okay. Come on.

1093
01:30:30,490 --> 01:30:33,493
Daddy's gotta go away
for a little while, okay?

1094
01:30:35,162 --> 01:30:36,864
Here you go, mate.

1095
01:30:42,636 --> 01:30:44,936
There we go.

1096
01:30:44,938 --> 01:30:47,175
He'll be back soon.

1097
01:30:54,581 --> 01:30:58,549
- What the hell is this?
- What? Think you can do better?

1098
01:30:58,551 --> 01:31:01,753
Let's go.

1099
01:31:01,755 --> 01:31:05,723
- Roomy.
- Yeah. Well, how about a little bit of gratitude, huh?

1100
01:31:05,725 --> 01:31:08,159
- Thank you.
- You all good over there?

1101
01:31:08,161 --> 01:31:10,898
- I'm fine. Let's just go.
- Seat belt.

1102
01:31:30,082 --> 01:31:31,883
<i>Davis,
we've got eyes on you now.</i>

1103
01:31:31,885 --> 01:31:34,818
- <i>Targets are clear to engage.</i>
- Roger that.

1104
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:39,126
We're set.
Engage targets when ready.

1105
01:31:50,270 --> 01:31:52,870
Well, this is nuts.

1106
01:31:52,872 --> 01:31:55,072
Yeah.
Thanks for waking me up.

1107
01:31:55,074 --> 01:31:59,777
Bioweapon's in the factory,
detonator doesn't have much range.

1108
01:31:59,779 --> 01:32:02,750
No idea
of the welcoming party.

1109
01:32:03,884 --> 01:32:06,585
Hey, you listening?

1110
01:32:06,587 --> 01:32:11,956
Bioweapon's in the factory, the detonator has
short range and a possible welcoming party.

1111
01:32:11,958 --> 01:32:14,694
And it's just
the two of us.

1112
01:32:15,828 --> 01:32:17,731
At least they
won't expect it.

1113
01:32:19,966 --> 01:32:21,601
You got your helmet?

1114
01:32:23,636 --> 01:32:25,105
Dick.

1115
01:32:32,679 --> 01:32:34,345
It's okay.

1116
01:32:49,128 --> 01:32:50,730
Jesus.

1117
01:32:56,302 --> 01:32:58,573
They found us.

1118
01:33:01,975 --> 01:33:03,744
Take cover!

1119
01:33:04,810 --> 01:33:07,113
Move! Move!

1120
01:33:20,926 --> 01:33:23,163
Let's do this.

1121
01:33:30,404 --> 01:33:33,007
Okay. Let's go.
Move, move, move, move.

1122
01:34:40,039 --> 01:34:42,906
- Amelia.
- Matt, Matt, Matt, come on.

1123
01:34:42,908 --> 01:34:45,910
There's no time, all right?
We gotta go. Look at me.

1124
01:34:45,912 --> 01:34:47,682
Come on.

1125
01:35:02,762 --> 01:35:06,531
Hey, Tin Man.

1126
01:35:14,440 --> 01:35:16,176
Take that one. I got this.

1127
01:35:30,457 --> 01:35:32,055
Nothing's working.

1128
01:35:32,057 --> 01:35:34,261
Screw it!

1129
01:35:37,564 --> 01:35:39,164
Jackson!

1130
01:35:39,166 --> 01:35:41,802
Set the explosives, be careful!

1131
01:35:43,103 --> 01:35:45,068
All right.
You're free, let's go.

1132
01:35:45,070 --> 01:35:47,171
We're blowing the building,
get the hell out!

1133
01:35:47,173 --> 01:35:50,275
Henderson's farm, move.

1134
01:35:50,277 --> 01:35:52,009
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1135
01:35:52,011 --> 01:35:53,945
Take it easy, take it easy,
look after each other.

1136
01:35:53,947 --> 01:35:55,513
- Helen, are you all right?
- Matt, you're alive.

1137
01:35:55,515 --> 01:35:57,447
Big fella,
come here, come here.

1138
01:35:57,449 --> 01:35:59,317
Stay with her,
and keep your heads down.

1139
01:35:59,319 --> 01:36:00,821
Henderson's farm, go.

1140
01:36:32,586 --> 01:36:34,221
Shit.

1141
01:37:31,478 --> 01:37:33,547
I should have worn a helmet.

1142
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:41,285
I need you to cover me.

1143
01:37:41,287 --> 01:37:44,022
You're going alone.
You don't want help.

1144
01:37:44,024 --> 01:37:46,057
Not this time.

1145
01:37:46,059 --> 01:37:49,329
Cover fire!

1146
01:37:53,132 --> 01:37:56,934
Here. You want this, huh?

1147
01:37:56,936 --> 01:37:59,073
Come get it.

1148
01:38:03,409 --> 01:38:04,709
Rookie.

1149
01:38:04,711 --> 01:38:07,081
Enough.

1150
01:38:08,381 --> 01:38:11,382
- Hand it to me.
- English, huh?

1151
01:38:11,384 --> 01:38:14,152
Well done. That was sarcasm.

1152
01:38:14,154 --> 01:38:16,254
You haven't learnt that yet,
haven't you?

1153
01:38:16,256 --> 01:38:17,988
We have learned many things.

1154
01:38:17,990 --> 01:38:21,159
The universe
grows smaller every day.

1155
01:38:21,161 --> 01:38:22,962
Good for you.

1156
01:38:24,497 --> 01:38:26,563
Uh-uh!

1157
01:38:26,565 --> 01:38:31,137
You shoot me, I smash this,
and you start again.

1158
01:38:37,277 --> 01:38:39,544
Learned we want you gone yet?

1159
01:38:39,546 --> 01:38:42,981
You understand nothing.

1160
01:38:42,983 --> 01:38:46,284
You have no power
and we have no choice.

1161
01:38:46,286 --> 01:38:48,922
There's always a choice.

1162
01:38:50,356 --> 01:38:54,094
I've seen your world,
what's left of it.

1163
01:38:55,161 --> 01:38:57,294
Humans.

1164
01:38:57,296 --> 01:39:01,665
You cling to a planet
you insist on destroying.

1165
01:39:01,667 --> 01:39:03,768
We learned from our mistakes.

1166
01:39:03,770 --> 01:39:08,339
Our world is gone.
We need this one.

1167
01:39:08,341 --> 01:39:11,709
If we must kill to survive,
we will.

1168
01:39:11,711 --> 01:39:15,682
- Not today.
- Humans!

1169
01:39:33,399 --> 01:39:36,302
<i>Comms back up. Get
those choppers over there now!</i>

1170
01:39:39,773 --> 01:39:42,242
Peter!

1171
01:39:46,746 --> 01:39:49,379
Ah!

1172
01:39:49,381 --> 01:39:50,415
Go get your family, Pete.

1173
01:39:50,417 --> 01:39:51,715
I'm not leaving you.

1174
01:39:51,717 --> 01:39:54,253
- Come on.
- Ah!

1175
01:40:02,761 --> 01:40:04,428
Peter, get down!

1176
01:40:10,270 --> 01:40:14,772
Colonel's sending air support!
Tigers are inbound now!

1177
01:40:14,774 --> 01:40:20,547
Demon call sign, this is 91-Charlie.
Fire mission, over. Hot smoke!

1178
01:40:22,849 --> 01:40:25,083
We see your call sign,
send, over.

1179
01:40:25,085 --> 01:40:28,285
Fire mission, call sign
is in the center

1180
01:40:28,287 --> 01:40:30,854
of the cleared field in craters.
Danger close, over!

1181
01:40:30,856 --> 01:40:34,459
Roger that. Danger close.
Keep your heads down. Over.

1182
01:40:34,461 --> 01:40:37,431
Take cover!

1183
01:41:56,376 --> 01:41:57,778
Come on!

1184
01:42:19,599 --> 01:42:23,470
Yo!

1185
01:42:44,724 --> 01:42:47,825
Shit.

1186
01:42:47,827 --> 01:42:51,562
<i>91-Charlie, we see you have a
large alien force coming from the west.</i>

1187
01:42:51,564 --> 01:42:54,632
- Come in. Come in, this is Matt Simmons.
- <i>Over.</i>

1188
01:42:54,634 --> 01:42:57,835
I'm in the factory, I have the weapon.
Is anyone out there?

1189
01:42:57,837 --> 01:43:02,673
<i>Repeat, this is Matt Simmons,
I have the weapon.</i>

1190
01:43:02,675 --> 01:43:07,777
<i>We're in the factory, our escape
is blocked. Can anyone hear me?</i>

1191
01:43:07,779 --> 01:43:10,615
- Matty?
- Amelia?

1192
01:43:10,617 --> 01:43:14,652
Oh, baby,
it's so good to hear your voice.

1193
01:43:14,654 --> 01:43:18,488
Okay, listen, I have the weapon,
I'm in the factory.

1194
01:43:18,490 --> 01:43:21,826
- I could stop them.
- No.

1195
01:43:21,828 --> 01:43:23,861
No, Matt, you put that down.

1196
01:43:23,863 --> 01:43:26,397
You put it down
and you get out of there.

1197
01:43:26,399 --> 01:43:28,936
Wait, just... listen.

1198
01:43:30,403 --> 01:43:32,602
Your mom is at Henderson's farm.

1199
01:43:32,604 --> 01:43:35,473
Matt!

1200
01:43:35,475 --> 01:43:37,974
I love you!

1201
01:43:37,976 --> 01:43:40,378
<i>I love you!</i>

1202
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:43,013
- <i>Matt!</i>
- <i>I love you.</i>

1203
01:43:44,884 --> 01:43:45,883
Shit.

1204
01:43:45,885 --> 01:43:48,454
Matt!

1205
01:44:05,537 --> 01:44:08,505
You cannot kill all of us.

1206
01:44:08,507 --> 01:44:10,907
You cannot escape.

1207
01:44:10,909 --> 01:44:13,076
Let us finish this now.

1208
01:44:13,078 --> 01:44:17,080
What? And ruin
this great conversation?

1209
01:44:28,360 --> 01:44:29,695
Jackson!

1210
01:44:43,676 --> 01:44:46,477
Shit.

1211
01:44:46,479 --> 01:44:48,879
- Just go.
- Trying to take the glory again?

1212
01:44:50,582 --> 01:44:51,982
Vanessa needs you.

1213
01:44:51,984 --> 01:44:54,954
Vanessa is dead, man. Go.

1214
01:44:58,123 --> 01:45:00,891
See you soon, mate.

1215
01:45:00,893 --> 01:45:03,059
You take care of
my little girl, Matt, okay?

1216
01:45:03,061 --> 01:45:06,863
You take care of Allison,
you hear me?

1217
01:45:06,865 --> 01:45:11,371
Matt, you hear me?
You take care of Allison, okay?

1218
01:45:16,542 --> 01:45:18,679
Move. Move.

1219
01:45:31,591 --> 01:45:33,827
Take care of my little girl!

1220
01:45:34,926 --> 01:45:36,595
You take care of her!

1221
01:46:12,698 --> 01:46:16,936
Something is up!
Let's take them down!

1222
01:46:19,439 --> 01:46:21,775
Put your weapons down.

1223
01:46:23,176 --> 01:46:26,012
Put them down!

1224
01:46:33,819 --> 01:46:35,518
Jenny! Samuel!

1225
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:37,456
Dad!

1226
01:46:44,997 --> 01:46:48,568
Oh!

1227
01:46:53,872 --> 01:46:56,009
How are you doing?

1228
01:47:38,783 --> 01:47:41,684
- <i>Outstanding work.</i>
- <i>Thank you, colonel.</i>

1229
01:47:41,686 --> 01:47:44,120
<i>The, uh, Sydney operation
also broke through in the end,</i>

1230
01:47:44,122 --> 01:47:48,194
so, yeah,
we're starting to push back.

1231
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:09,982
Matt?

1232
01:48:45,717 --> 01:48:48,251
Hey.

1233
01:48:48,253 --> 01:48:50,524
Where's Jacko?

1234
01:49:07,672 --> 01:49:09,842
What now?

1235
01:49:21,854 --> 01:49:24,791
There's not many
of their species left.

1236
01:49:27,693 --> 01:49:31,797
They came here because it was
their last chance to survive.

1237
01:49:40,338 --> 01:49:44,010
- Amelia.
- Davis.

1238
01:49:46,078 --> 01:49:49,245
Can I have your knife, please?

1239
01:49:49,247 --> 01:49:51,283
Trust me.

1240
01:50:08,434 --> 01:50:11,237
You have nothing left here.

1241
01:50:13,972 --> 01:50:16,141
But you can.

1242
01:50:18,043 --> 01:50:21,711
Will you help us?

1243
01:50:21,713 --> 01:50:25,915
Will you help us
stop this war,

1244
01:50:25,917 --> 01:50:28,220
and share this world?

1245
01:50:35,961 --> 01:50:38,896
Do you understand me?

1246
01:50:38,898 --> 01:50:41,400
Am I wasting my time?

1247
01:52:26,137 --> 01:52:28,004
<i>The war is changing now.</i>

1248
01:52:28,006 --> 01:52:29,973
<i>There are still
rogue alien units</i>

1249
01:52:29,975 --> 01:52:32,009
<i>who don't want to join us,</i>

1250
01:52:32,011 --> 01:52:36,213
<i>but we've got inside
information and ideas.</i>

1251
01:52:36,215 --> 01:52:38,581
<i>The galaxy just
became a much smaller place,</i>

1252
01:52:38,583 --> 01:52:41,951
<i>but I know the only way
to see this through</i>

1253
01:52:41,953 --> 01:52:44,821
<i>is for everyone
to work together.</i>

1254
01:52:44,823 --> 01:52:48,761
Go! Go! Go!

1255
01:52:55,134 --> 01:52:56,567
<i>We'll push on.</i>

1256
01:52:56,569 --> 01:53:00,970
<i>We'll pull through.
We'll survive.</i>

1257
01:53:00,972 --> 01:53:03,042
<i>We'll keep fighting.</i>

1258
01:53:04,475 --> 01:53:07,179
<i>And I know we'll be victorious.</i>

1259
