After the Pilgrims' arrival,
Native Americans in New England

26
00:05:16,047 --> 00:05:18,510
grew increasingly frustrated
with the English settlers'

27
00:05:18,511 --> 00:05:20,232
abuse and treachery.

28
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:23,260

51
00:06:51,706 --> 00:06:54,357
The innocent, first victim of
the struggles between

52
00:06:54,358 --> 00:06:57,856
the Colonists and the Crown,
which resulted in independence.

53
00:07:31,828 --> 00:07:34,487
The Stono Rebellion, the largest
slave insurrection

54
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:37,987
in British North America, began
nearby on September 9. 1739.

55
00:07:38,254 --> 00:07:41,333
About 20 Africans raided a
store near Wallace Creek,

56
00:07:41,578 --> 00:07:44,078
a branch of the Stono River.
Taking guns and other weapons,

57
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:47,880
they killed two shop-keepers.
The rebels marched south

58
00:07:48,044 --> 00:07:50,619
toward promised freedom in
Spanish Florida, waving flags,

59
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,457
beating drums, and
shouting "Liberty!"

60
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,999
The rebels were joined by 40
to 60 more during their

61
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,219
15-mile march.
They killed at least 20 whites,

62
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,377
but spared others.
The rebellion ended

63
00:08:00,378 --> 00:08:02,962
late that afternoon when the
militia caught the rebels,

64
00:08:02,963 --> 00:08:04,628
killing at least 34 of them.

65
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:07,297
Most who escaped were
captured and executed;

66
00:08:07,298 --> 00:08:09,809
any forced to
join the rebels were released.

67
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:12,298
The S.C. assembly soon enacted
a harsh slave code,

68
00:08:12,299 --> 00:08:15,797
in force until 1885.

69
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:38,604

71
00:08:41,023 --> 00:08:43,190

an enslaved blacksmith

72
00:08:43,191 --> 00:08:45,564
from Brookfield plantation in
Henrico County, was executed

73
00:08:45,565 --> 00:08:47,982
there for attempting to lead
a mass uprising

74
00:08:47,983 --> 00:08:50,446
against slavery on 30 Aug. 1800.
A fierce rainstorm

75
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:53,149
delayed the insurrection, which
then was betrayed by two slaves.

76
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,652
Gabriel escaped and eluded
capture until 23 Sept.,

77
00:08:55,653 --> 00:08:58,318
when he was arrested in Norfolk.
He was returned

78
00:08:58,319 --> 00:09:00,999
to Richmond on 27 Sept.
And incarcerated in

79
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,823

of his supporters

81
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,948

John Adams said:
"Without the pen of Paine

86
00:09:21,793 --> 00:09:23,744
the sword of Washington would
have been wielded in vain."

Captain Shays served with the
Continental Army, and was

88
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:35,774

89
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:38,755

effect on the framing

91
00:09:41,634 --> 00:09:44,259

patriot, who in 1814,

came to live in Scottsburg,
New York until his death.

93
00:10:46,578 --> 00:10:49,126
"When I am gone
and my warnings are no longer

94
00:10:49,127 --> 00:10:52,625
heeded, the graft and avarice
of the white man will prevail.

95
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:56,250
My heart fails me when I think
of my people, so soon to be

96
00:10:56,376 --> 00:10:58,862

223
00:25:03,486 --> 00:25:05,402
The truth that I have
tried to make

224
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:07,452
clear will not find
easy acceptance.

225
00:25:07,595 --> 00:25:09,438
If that could be,
it would have been

226
00:25:09,653 --> 00:25:11,487
accepted long ago.
If that could be,

227
00:25:11,871 --> 00:25:13,702
it would never
have been obscured.

228
00:25:14,004 --> 00:25:15,965
But it will find friends -
those who

229
00:25:16,193 --> 00:25:18,000
will toil for it;
suffer for it;

230
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,419
if need be, die for it.
This is the power of truth.

his friends and freedom more,
that he gave his all.
