1
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,200
We're starting now?
- Yes.

2
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,320
But don't worry.

3
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,280
It will be edited,
some stuff will be cut.

4
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,120
We just talk as usual.

5
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,920
If you want to take a break,
tell me,

6
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,280
I'll stop
and we'll pick up again after.

7
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,760
I know you'll be editing.

8
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,680
Grab a chair,
or I'll won't be able to relax.

9
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,240
I'll be on edge.

10
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,760
Have that one,
take off the cushion.

11
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,800
Take it
and come and sit down.

12
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,480
I don't want to stress out.

13
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,920
If you stay standing,
I can't feel natural.

14
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,680
You're gonna fall!

15
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,600
I want us to talk
like we did last time,

16
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,160
so I don't stress out.

17
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:40,320
Delphine's Prayers

18
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,240
Did you know your mother
before she died?

19
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,280
My mother died
when I was five.

20
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,560
How could I know her?

21
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,240
I didn't know her,
I was only five.

22
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,680
She was sick?

23
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,720
No, she died in childbirth.
The child was stillborn.

24
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,760
She lost too much blood.

25
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,480
Your little brother?
- Yes, the last one.

26
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,320
You know, Africans
make one baby after another,

27
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,960
without caring
for the ones they already have.

28
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,680
We lived from day to day.

29
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,200
They dragged us around
from one place to another.

30
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,760
My father dropped us off
all over the place.

31
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,440
That's the way life was.

32
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,280
Then the ordeal began.

33
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,080
Back then, the suffering
wasn't too great.

34
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,880
We suffered because we were hungry.

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,680
We had nothing to eat.

36
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,680
When we left for school,
we got no money for food.

37
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,120
Nothing,
we were just sent to school.

38
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,000
There was an old man
in the neighborhood

39
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,000
who gave us stale bread.

40
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,720
We were happy,
because we had nothing else.

41
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,280
We would take it to school
to eat at midday.

42
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,480
Everyone wanted
to go to school,

43
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,360
nobody wanted
to stay at home.

44
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,160
At home
there was nothing to eat.

45
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,680
My little brother
cried all the time.

46
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,160
My big sister
was still a child.

47
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,760
Around the age of 15 - 16,
she starting going with boys

48
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,600
to get money to feed us.

49
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,640
My sister came back pregnant.

50
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,840
I was thirteen
when she got pregnant.

51
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,320
Then she gave birth.

52
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,440
My father refused
to pay the hospital bill.

53
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,920
He abandoned her there.

54
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,520
He didn't want
another child in his home,

55
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,800
coming from out of the blue...

56
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,280
I cried when I saw my sister.

57
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,000
We really loved each other.

58
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,160
I cried at seeing her
all alone in that situation.

59
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,240
Nobody wanted to help her.

60
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,560
I went to my uncle.
He said to me:

61
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,600
"If you want me to help,
you have to sleep with me."

62
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,720
That was the condition.

63
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,320
Your uncle?
- Yes, my uncle.

64
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,040
Your father's brother,
or your mother's?

65
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,440
On my father's side.

66
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,160
I ran away from him.

67
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,200
My sister stayed
three months in hospital.

68
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,120
I had to find money.

69
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,360
I was going on fourteen
at that time.

70
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,840
I had nothing to wear,
I didn't know what to do.

71
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,480
I went to see a friend.

72
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,080
She told me: "Use your body
to get what you want."

73
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,080
I said to her:
"At my age?"

74
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,400
Thirteen years old.

75
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,040
"Come off it!
At my age?"

76
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,400
At that time,

77
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,800
there was a young man
in my neighborhood.

78
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,560
I was out walking
one evening.

79
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,840
And that's when...

80
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,160
That stupid, useless,
good-for-nothing son of a...

81
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,280
- I don't know what to call him -

82
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,280
took my virginity.

83
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,680
You were coming back
from the hospital?

84
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,000
I was coming back
from visiting my sister in hospital.

85
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,280
There was a bush near our house.

86
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,040
He took my virginity.

87
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,200
I went home crying.
My father was there.

88
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,400
I told him
what had happened to me.

89
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,440
He told me it was my fault.

90
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,360
I wept at his feet.

91
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,240
He said: "No, you're lying,

92
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,320
you gave yourself
to that young man."

93
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,120
He pushed me away:

94
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,760
"Look what your big sister did!"

95
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,080
That day,
I looked at my father...

96
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,080
I didn't know
who I was talking to anymore.

97
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,120
"Is that my dad I'm talking to?"

98
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,400
I was angry.

99
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,400
Furious.

100
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,040
My head was spinning.

101
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,560
I left.

102
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,600
I went to the shore
of River Wouri.

103
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,000
I washed myself there.

104
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,360
I went to my friend's place,
the one who was prostituting herself.

105
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,920
I went to see her,

106
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,840
to tell her I was ready.

107
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,600
"Right here, right now,
I'm ready!"

108
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,600
She said to me:

109
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,480
"This kind of stuff
makes little fish like you grow up."

110
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,240
I said: "This rape
has forced me to grow up.

111
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,800
I'm ready."

112
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,040
"You can't go like that.

113
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,920
Look at yourself.
Your clothes aren't clean."

114
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,760
I said:
"I don't have any others."

115
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,600
These are my best clothes.
I don't have any others."

116
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,080
She went to get me some clothes.

117
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,680
I chose some pants,
I put on a T-shirt.

118
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,360
Off we went...

119
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:15,120
She made a call,
two men arrived.

120
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:22,080
One of them suggested
we go for a drink.

121
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,520
I had a soda.
I didn't dare say a word.

122
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,160
The cat got my tongue,
I didn't say a word.

123
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,960
I was embarrassed,
I bowed my head.

124
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,600
When you're not used
to doing certain things,

125
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,040
you're not in your right mind.

126
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,880
One of the men said to me:
"Let's go, I'm ready."

127
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,000
The guy was older than my father.

128
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,040
I took refuge in the toilets, to cry.

129
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,640
I told him
I wanted to wash my face.

130
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,160
He heard me crying
and told me to come out.

131
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,400
He gave me some money
and told me to get dressed.

132
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,440
He didn't feel like it anymore.
I asked him why.

133
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,320
"Some other time,
I don't feel like it anymore."

134
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,760
I took his money
and gave it to my sister.

135
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,680
I didn't know
that I was already pregnant,

136
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,960
from the rape.

137
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,040
My sister decided
to go to Yaoundé

138
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,080
to look for work,
any work.

139
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,480
She left for Yaoundé
with her daughter, Yvette.

140
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,760
I loved that kid!

141
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,520
I loved her so much!

142
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,800
In Yaoundé, the little one got malaria.

143
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,600
My sister called me

144
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,320
to ask me to take her daughter
back to Douala.

145
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,040
She was living in a village
near Yaoundé.

146
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,120
I brought her back to Douala.

147
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,080
My sister was supposed
to send me money

148
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,920
to take her daughter
to Douala hospital.

149
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,760
I took her back to Douala,

150
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,280
hoping that my sister
would send me the money.

151
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,360
Two weeks went by.
I called her:

152
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,320
"I have no money,
my boss didn't pay me."

153
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,040
Next week, same story.
The child was getting worse.

154
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,880
I bought drugs on the street,

155
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,880
the way you do in Africa,

156
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,120
with the little money I had.

157
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,680
I took her to hospital.

158
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,960
They asked me for 15,000 francs
to treat her.

159
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,640
Where would I find that much money?

160
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,480
I didn't have 15,000.

161
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,120
I went to my big brother,
who was a sewing apprentice.

162
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,720
He said he'd ask his boss
for an advance.

163
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,720
His boss refused.

164
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,880
In the end, I told my sister
the hospital wanted 15,000 francs

165
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,800
to treat the child.

166
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,440
She said: "I have no money,
my boss didn't pay me."

167
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,560
I could hear in her voice
that she had no options.

168
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,080
I was alone with my niece
and she said to me:

169
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,800
"Aunty Dé, I'm going to die."

170
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,960
"No, you won't die.

171
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,080
Stay at home,
I'll be back."

172
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,120
I wanted to reassure her.

173
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,160
I showed her her milk.

174
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,240
"Eat when you get hungry.
I'll be back.

175
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,000
I'll get someone to look after you."
She said: "OK."

176
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,560
I left,
leaving her with my little brother.

177
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,560
I went out.

178
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,880
I had to find the money,
any way I could.

179
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,160
I prostituted myself.

180
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,720
I got the money.

181
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,280
I came back late in the night.

182
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,360
You do that sort of thing at night.

183
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,600
I got back late.

184
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,280
I passed the hospital,
the gate was locked.

185
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,440
It was the hospital
near my house.

186
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,360
When I got home, I lay
next to my niece in the bed.

187
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,760
I told her I would take her to hospital
first thing in the morning.

188
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,680
I wanted to reassure her.

189
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,400
She asked me: "Aunty Dé,
did you find the money?"

190
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,520
"Yes, look, here it is."

191
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,120
She said:
"Don't worry,

192
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,880
now that you've got the money,
I'll get better."

193
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,800
She asked me:
"Why are you crying?"

194
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,800
"I'm not crying,
I just have something in my eye.

195
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,680
Do you see it? Blow!"

196
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,000
She blew in my eye.

197
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,000
I said: "All better."
Then she said:

198
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,440
"Mummy didn't send any money?"

199
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,960
I said: "She says
she didn't get paid."

200
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,600
"Aunty Dé, don't cry.
You know I love you."

201
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,920
I said: "Yes, I know.

202
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,080
You're my favorite niece
in this house."

203
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,920
She said: "Aunty Dé,
don't worry,

204
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,720
everything will be fine now."

205
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,840
I said: "Yes."

206
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,880
She said: "Hold me."

207
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,760
I took her in my arms.

208
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,720
"Kiss me."
I kissed her.

209
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,640
She said: "I love you so much",

210
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,880
then she smiled,

211
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,000
she shut her eyes
and she died.

212
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,920
Six years old!

213
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,840
Just a little girl...

214
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,800
At first, I touched her
I thought she was asleep.

215
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,880
My brother came to see how she was.

216
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,640
He saw that she was dead
and took me out of the room.

217
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,000
I told my sister.

218
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,360
When she arrived,
she said:

219
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,400
"You killed my daughter."

220
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:04,840
She had seen the 15,000 francs
under the pillow.

221
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:10,920
She accused me of killing her child
to keep this money.

222
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,120
"What are you talking about?

223
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,760
Do you know what I did
to get that money?"

224
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,520
I didn't even get a chance to explain.
She slapped me.

225
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,720
Slapped me!

226
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,680
My other big sisters arrived.

227
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,040
They all beat me.

228
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,840
They said I was a witch:

229
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,720
"You joined a sect
and sacrificed your little niece

230
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,000
for 15.000 francs."

231
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,840
My dad said:

232
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,840
"I knew something fishy
was going on.

233
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,240
I just knew it."

234
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,320
I told my sisters:

235
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,280
"As God is my witness,
I have done nothing wrong."

236
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,360
I sat by my niece's body.

237
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,560
"Yvette, you know
I did nothing wrong.

238
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,280
You told me not to cry,
that everything would be fine.

239
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,080
Yvette, I didn't harm you.

240
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,640
My hands are clean."

241
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,960
I went out.

242
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,480
I stood before the people

243
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,680
who were gathered to mourn.

244
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,840
I shouted at my sister:

245
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,400
"You gave birth to your child

246
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,640
but I sold my body
to take care of her.

247
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,240
You see the money

248
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,400
I earned by selling my body

249
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,840
and you come and accuse me?

250
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,000
May God judge you all!"

251
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,800
I left the house
and I never went back.

252
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,680
I slept on the streets,
in the bush.

253
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:19,760
And where was your daughter?
- With me.

254
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,440
I said to myself:
"If I die, so be it."

255
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,920
I didn't go to my friend's place,
where I could have slept.

256
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,720
I'd had as much as I could take.

257
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It was the last thing
I could have imagined.

258
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,440
I never thought
it could happen to me.

259
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,520
But as they say,

260
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,840
what has to happen, happens.

261
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,520
I started to work on the street
like crazy.

262
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,720
Selling my body...

263
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,480
That's how I met a European man.

264
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,040
We got together.

265
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,760
I rented a beautiful house.

266
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,760
Were you alone?

267
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,800
I was alone when I met him.

268
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,480
I met him in a bar.
He gave me lots of money.

269
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,680
Enough to rent a beautiful house
for me and my daughter.

270
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,160
Everyone who had called me a witch,

271
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,240
my own family,
who had rejected me, chased me off,

272
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,680
hit me,
dragged me through the mud,

273
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,240
came groveling,
asking me for food.

274
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,360
I'd buy a bag of rice and give it to them.
I gave them money.

275
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,680
To your sisters?
- They all came.

276
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,600
I gave without thinking.

277
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,760
When I no longer had enough money,

278
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,480
I rented a flat.

279
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,680
The house was too expensive.

280
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,080
I rented a little flat.

281
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,360
All that rancor
towards my father...

282
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,920
Let's drop it for now.
We'll talk about it next time.

283
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,960
Sit on the bed.

284
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,760
Wait...

285
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:25,200
My father sent me to my rapist

286
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,320
when he abandoned
his first daughter.

287
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,040
He sent you
to the man who raped you?

288
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,200
If he hadn't
abandoned my sister,

289
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,240
I wouldn't have left the house

290
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,000
to start looking
for money everywhere.

291
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:51,400
When I was clutching my father's foot,
groveling on the floor,

292
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,600
I said: "Dad, believe me,

293
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,920
he raped me."

294
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,360
And my father pushed me,
kicked me

295
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,640
with his big feet
I was grasping so tightly.

296
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,120
I was ready
to die at his feet.

297
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,520
I said:
"Kill me then.

298
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,520
You don't want to believe me."

299
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,000
I ran into the forest,
I touched the place I was bleeding

300
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,520
and I called out to the good Lord.

301
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,960
I said:

302
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,640
"Why?"

303
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,880
I asked God:
"Why?"

304
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,680
And I said to my father:

305
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,080
"I didn't ask you
to bring me into this world.

306
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,400
You make children

307
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,080
that you aren't capable
of looking after."

308
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,400
I said: "Why?"

309
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,960
That day, my sister...

310
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,920
My father really hurt me.

311
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,160
"You're just a slut,
like your sister."

312
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,480
He insulted me...

313
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,520
I looked at my body with disgust
and begged him:

314
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,960
"Dad, please.

315
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,720
Dad, please."

316
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,800
I remember those words,

317
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,840
like a sort of chant in my head.

318
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,920
"Dad, please."

319
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,400
My own useless father threw me out
with my daughter.

320
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,840
She is now 12,

321
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,200
and my father calls her
asking her to send him money.

322
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,480
My God!

323
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,720
We're in Europe,
we can't afford clothes,

324
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,520
and my father asks my 12-year-old daughter
to send him money.

325
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,880
I have no work.

326
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,320
If my father knew

327
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,760
that I sold my body
to send him money,

328
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,600
I'm not sure he'd accept it.

329
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,840
He has always despised me.

330
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:02,760
My dad told the whole neighborhood
that I was a whore.

331
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,680
Everyone called me a whore,
even in front of my daughter.

332
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,200
I started looking for a way
to escape the neighborhood.

333
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,120
I left my father's home,

334
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,680
I left my family.

335
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:22,600
After selling my body
to get treatment for my niece,

336
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,760
I was accused of having killed her.

337
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,720
It was the first time I sold my body.

338
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,440
I did it to get treatment
for my niece.

339
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,640
If you had seen the old man...

340
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,360
My God!

341
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,520
That old guy I slept with
to get the 15,000 francs...

342
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,960
It gives me goose bumps.

343
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,160
I washed my body over and over
with a sponge.

344
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:57,080
I couldn't cry
in front of the little one.

345
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,600
I clenched my teeth.

346
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,120
I became a mother
at the age of thirteen.

347
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,880
I don't know how
my mother didn't rise from her grave.

348
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,520
But...

349
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,040
I promised myself one thing.

350
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,800
"After all this suffering,

351
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,440
my little brother
won't suffer like me.

352
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,120
I'll send him to school."

353
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,160
My father said:
"You'll never do it."

354
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,720
I said to him: "Liar!
You're not God."

355
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,680
I said to my father:

356
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,480
"You couldn't do it,

357
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:46,800
but I, your second to last child,
I will do it."

358
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,080
He couldn't imagine
that I'd be here today.

359
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,520
He had already predicted my death.

360
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,200
I am not dead.

361
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,480
I'm still here.

362
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,320
Now that I'm here,
I can bear witness.

363
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,800
I tell people
what I've been through.

364
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,280
I tell my friends
to appreciate what they've got.

365
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:16,160
Lots of friends hope
for a different life.

366
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,560
Before, I didn't tell them
what I'd been through.

367
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,040
I couldn't talk about it
to anyone.

368
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,160
Now, I've decided to talk about it,

369
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,040
to get people thinking.

370
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,080
The suffering I feel
has horns.

371
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,120
I'll open the door.

372
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,920
That's enough for today.

373
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,560
Coming!

374
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,680
Coming!

375
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,720
I'm here.

376
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,240
It's done.

377
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,880
Finished!

378
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:43,640
OK, tell me what
we're talking about today.

379
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,320
Let's get down to business.

380
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,880
That's why we're here, right?

381
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,840
That's what we're doing.

382
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,200
People need to think
what we're doing is serious.

383
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:08,440
You know, when we were
working on the streets...

384
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,920
We were real "wakas",
as they say in Cameroon.

385
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,760
We walked along the side of the road,
we had no set spot

386
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,320
where we would stand.

387
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,200
We just walked along
the road.

388
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,440
Not like some girls
here in Belgium.

389
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,200
We'd walk,
all dressed up.

390
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,960
We chose a big avenue,

391
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,600
we pretended we were
going somewhere.

392
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,960
That way cars would stop
and offer to take us.

393
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,320
That's how it went down.

394
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,440
No precise place.

395
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,680
Sometimes,
I'd meet someone

396
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,680
who would take me for a drink
then we'd leave...

397
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,960
You know, there are
night clubs in Douala

398
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,000
where the girls turn tricks,
like the Kwassa Kwassa.

399
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:02,000
If you want to meet a white guy,
you go to the Byblos,

400
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,360
you could go to...

401
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,720
I've forgotten the names
of all those clubs.

402
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,640
There are places
like the Mediterranée,

403
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,640
in Akwa,
where all the Whites go.

404
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,280
If you want to meet a white guy,
you go there.

405
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,440
You can go for a drink there
or stand at the entrance.

406
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,880
But that's mostly
for the professional hookers.

407
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,240
Some are at the entrance,
others at the bar,

408
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,280
they have a drink.

409
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,400
Those who come for girls
know to go there.

410
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,520
We did things our own way.

411
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,400
We were four friends.

412
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,320
Jackie, Pauline, Céline...

413
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,480
We all worked the streets.

414
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:53,040
When Céline met a white guy

415
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,400
she introduced us to the city center.

416
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,320
Thanks to her, we started
going to the city center.

417
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,840
They were all with Whites.

418
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,560
Naively, I thought

419
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,200
they would get married
within weeks

420
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,600
and leave Cameroon.

421
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,720
But I'm the one who left.

422
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,920
I left them
and they're still over there.

423
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,520
Today they're married,
they don't do that any more.

424
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,480
How did you meet him?

425
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,360
We just met up.

426
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,120
I was walking in the street.

427
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:31,240
I don't remember where I was coming from.
I was alone that night.

428
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,840
I was working in a restaurant

429
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,280
near the new road.

430
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:43,080
I was coming back from work,
my boss hadn't paid me.

431
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,760
That's when I saw him,
drinking a glass of water.

432
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,400
He had choked on his smoke.

433
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,440
As I passed him,

434
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,240
he invited me to have a juice
because it was very hot.

435
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,800
I sat down,
and that's how it started.

436
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,320
Nothing happened that day.
I went home.

437
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,120
Then he invited me out to eat.

438
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,520
That's how we
got to know each other.

439
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,640
I can't give you details,
that's my secret.

440
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,760
I'm the only one
who knows the details.

441
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,760
You don't want to tell me?
- They're my details.

442
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,200
They're my little secret,
they make me happy.

443
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,080
The first time
my visa was refused

444
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,960
really made me mad.

445
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,440
I went...

446
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I was summoned
for an interview.

447
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,320
I went there.

448
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:49,560
The woman from the Belgian embassy
spoke to me in French.

449
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,320
Here's what she said.

450
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,840
She said: "Madam,
if you go to Brussels,

451
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,560
and you think Belgium
is a nice place,

452
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,000
will you stay there,
or come back here?"

453
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,280
That's the trick question
for tourist visas.

454
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,520
I said: "Excuse me,
you, who live in Cameroon,

455
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,400
if you go to a better place,
would you come back?

456
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,160
If it's better over there,
I won't come back."

457
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,240
She wanted me to lie.
I didn't lie.

458
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,520
If you leave poverty
and go towards wealth,

459
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,440
you stay there!

460
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,320
She stamped it,

461
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,960
she refused my visa,
full of rage.

462
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:36,400
Then she called me back
for another interview.

463
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,680
I was pregnant, I did all I could
for her to notice.

464
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,360
I wore a kaba,

465
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,680
but you don't see a pregnancy
when the belly is still small.

466
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,120
I tied my kaba at the back.

467
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,400
I wore my pagne like this.

468
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,520
The kaba was a bit like this dress.

469
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,920
I tucked my kaba
into my pagne.

470
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,480
I arranged the pagne like this.

471
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,360
Wait, I'll show you!

472
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,840
See? Tied like this,
you can see the belly well.

473
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,760
And I put more clothing
over my belly.

474
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,200
And I walked like this.

475
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,760
That way, she would get it.

476
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,160
And I said:

477
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,120
"Madam, if you refuse
to give me a visa again,

478
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,560
I'll leave this mixed-race child
on the embassy doorstep."

479
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,720
When my turn came,
she said to me:

480
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,920
"Come back tomorrow,
we're very busy."

481
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,800
I said: "What?!"

482
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,440
I didn't even speak French that day.

483
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,640
"Speak Pidgin
or don't speak at all,

484
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,560
because I can't explain
this situation in French."

485
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,960
"I'm going nowhere!

486
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,160
I've been here since this morning,

487
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,360
and at 2 pm you tell me

488
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,680
to go home,
in my condition."

489
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,520
I lay down on the ground.

490
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,800
I said: "Madam,
I'm going to sleep here."

491
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,120
I live in Douala,
this is Yaoundé.

492
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,640
I paid to sleep in a hotel.

493
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,360
I'm not leaving here
until I have my visa."

494
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,440
Ten minutes later,
I had my visa.

495
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,280
I arrived at the airport in Belgium.

496
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,280
The Whites were traumatized
by "monogamous option"

497
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,120
on a marriage certificate,
written in red.

498
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,480
Why traumatized?

499
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:32,320
He took me into his office
and saw "monogamous option" in red pen.

500
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,360
I didn't speak good French

501
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,640
and he didn't understand,
I used "R" in the wrong place

502
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,440
not where it should be.
I didn't even use "R"s.

503
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,280
He took me into his office

504
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,920
and started asking me
stupid questions.

505
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,120
I answered
his stupid questions.

506
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,160
He asked me: "What is
the color of the sheets

507
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,280
where you made love with your husband
for the first time?"

508
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,960
I said: "Mister,

509
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,520
isn't that a very personal question?"

510
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,320
I thought it was all sorted.

511
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,200
Years later, it became...

512
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,160
I was summoned all the time.

513
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,480
A summons here,
a summons there.

514
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,880
They called me in, accusing me
of a sham marriage.

515
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,560
What's a sham marriage?

516
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,520
It's not all black and white.

517
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,520
A Black and a White
got married.

518
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,280
It's all the same.

519
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,160
A Black and a White marry,

520
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,440
is it all black
or all white?

521
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,880
It's all black for the black girl.

522
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,680
When you saw him
for the first time,

523
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,600
did you love him?

524
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,920
I don't want to talk about it.
There was no love involved.

525
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,520
What’s your take on it?

526
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,120
You know there was no love
in that relationship.

527
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,600
I wanted to leave, to flee
the way I was living.

528
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,520
And I left.

529
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:06,000
You can't hurt
someone who has helped you.

530
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,760
I told myself
I would give him two children.

531
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:13,080
I will never abandon my children
to find happiness elsewhere.

532
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,880
I have sacrificed my happiness
for my children.

533
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,480
I stay for my children,
I've sacrificed everything for them.

534
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,200
There's no love in this marriage.
Everyone knows that.

535
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,760
My youth...

536
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,400
When I see photos from back then,
I am so cross.

537
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,040
You know?

538
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,520
When I look at these pictures...

539
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Where are they?

540
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,920
I get so angry.

541
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:48,440
Sometimes I think:
"Look how beautiful you were!

542
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:52,320
If only your father
hadn't neglected you."

543
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,800
Look at this girl.

544
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,400
Look how young I was here

545
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,800
and compare my height
with that of my daughter...

546
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,280
Imagine.

547
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,480
This is my little girl.
She comes up to my waist.

548
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:12,880
Look at my face,
I was still a child.

549
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,400
Look at this child that an old man
came asking to marry.

550
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,560
May God punish him!

551
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:33,480
An old man
who wanted to marry me.

552
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,800
He watched me
when I went to work at the cabaret.

553
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,200
He brought palm wine.

554
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,080
5 liters of palm oil.

555
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,560
He brought all that
to the house,

556
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,080
and pagnes,
pagne fabric.

557
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,400
All that to marry this kid.

558
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:04,040
In your mind, you imagine
beautiful things for yourself.

559
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,720
The way you imagine your life,

560
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,440
when you will live elsewhere.

561
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,760
You see only beautiful things.

562
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,040
You imagine
what your life could be.

563
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,400
Then disappointment
comes knocking at your door.

564
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,360
If you open, in it comes.

565
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,440
And when it enters, it stays.
It never leaves.

566
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,960
No way out,
no escape.

567
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,680
Disappointment!

568
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,720
It's a bad thing.

569
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,600
So foolish!

570
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,560
Disappointment is not good.

571
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,440
Disappointment can make you do
things you're not supposed to.

572
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,200
My husband sulks.

573
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,040
He hasn't sulked enough yet.

574
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,720
He can sulk
until his mouth freezes.

575
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,400
I don't have time
for such stupidity.

576
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,840
I don't have a milisecond
for that kind of stuff.

577
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,440
Such nonsense!

578
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,240
Let him sulk!

579
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,960
I'm not going to ask him why!

580
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,920
Let him sulk.

581
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,600
When we get a little peace,

582
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:45,520
instead of enjoying it and smiling,
he gets cross.

583
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,440
Well, he can carry on!

584
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,920
When I act
like everything is fine,

585
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,840
he can't imagine
the worries on my mind.

586
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,040
When I decide to talk to him about it,

587
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,280
he doesn't listen.
He treats me like a child.

588
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,000
So why would I talk to him?

589
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,280
I want to talk to an adult.

590
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,160
I speak to him
hoping he will listen,

591
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,480
not for him to shout at me

592
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,040
as if I was his little sister.

593
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,760
Some people come to your rescue
when you have problems.

594
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,080
They say they want to help you.

595
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,880
You accept.

596
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,560
But instead of soothing you,
they push you down.

597
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,240
Why?

598
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,000
OK, you think
there's been a misunderstanding.

599
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,760
When two people
are from different cultures,

600
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,960
you don't know
how the other person lives,

601
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,640
what their habits are.

602
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:03,080
Each person has their own way of living,
their own story.

603
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,560
He knows where he's from,
I know where I'm from.

604
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,480
I have my story,
he has his.

605
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:13,280
Why does he want me
to abandon my culture and join his?

606
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,680
You can't just wipe out
years of personal experience.

607
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:21,160
You can't change
at a snap of the fingers.

608
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,560
It's impossible.

609
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:28,680
If you want a person to improve,
you have to treat them well.

610
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:32,280
If you don't know how,
get informed,

611
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:36,960
find out how to treat
someone who comes from elsewhere.

612
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:41,920
I didn't go to school,
so he thinks I'm not intelligent.

613
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,440
I didn't go to school,
I haven't read any books,

614
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,960
I don't know how
to use a dictionary.

615
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,920
I don't go to the library.

616
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,560
I haven't read a whole library,
I admit it.

617
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,520
But I am intelligent.

618
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,200
I get people!

619
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,120
And what's more,
I'm a mother.

620
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,320
Without me,
he wouldn't have any children.

621
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,280
Being illiterate
doesn't mean I'm stupid.

622
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,680
I'm not stupid.

623
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,200
I didn't go to school,
but I'm not stupid.

624
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:21,840
I have common sense,
I have the brain God gave me.

625
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,800
Nobody can take that from me.

626
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,400
I have my own way
of looking at life.

627
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,840
Not going to school

628
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:32,160
doesn't mean I can't see
what isn't just.

629
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,800
I see.

630
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,400
And when I see it,
I act.

631
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,960
I'm a professional actress,
a gift God gave me.

632
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,320
I don't play a role
in films or on TV

633
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,680
but I act in my own life.

634
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,120
I act decisively

635
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,800
so that the other person
will understand.

636
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,520
He doesn't understand,
he thinks it's all about him.

637
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:04,440
I'm not 60, 50,
70 or 80 years old, like him.

638
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,400
I lost my young years
for nothing.

639
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,000
Now, I'm thirty years old.

640
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,480
I can't go on
living like this.

641
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,040
It's no longer possible.

642
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:38,160
I'm not stupid,
I won't let myself be manipulated.

643
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,040
I have common sense,
I have a good brain.

644
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,400
I have a mind of my own.

645
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:56,520
When I was born did I have:
"Will suffer forever" written here?

646
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,640
Do you see that on my face?

647
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,800
Is something written
on my forehead?

648
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,680
"Will suffer forever"?

649
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:18,040
I have nothing more to add
to your journal today.

650
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,200
We'll talk of other things tomorrow.

651
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,320
We're done for today.

652
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,720
Nobody will stop
this story from being told.

653
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:29,360
Not as long as I'm the pilot
of this plane.

654
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,760
This plane flies over all countries,

655
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,800
it will not crash.

656
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:41,800
If it is struck by lightning,
hands and feet will grow on it.

657
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,240
And wings.

658
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,800
If you flap your wings,
roll three times,

659
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,920
you dive,
but then you make it.

660
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:04,080
I was told I wouldn't make it.

661
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,880
I'll make it.

662
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,680
Re-read the journal.
What shall we do?

663
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,240
How are you today?

664
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,520
Fine.
Can't you see?

665
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:46,880
Doesn't the dance I just did for you
prove that?

666
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,920
Can't you tell?
- Yes, I can.

667
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,520
I'm just fine.

668
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:07,600
Journal, do you want to know
how I fell in love?

669
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,280
You fell in love?
Tell me!

670
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:13,480
Of course!
What do you imagine?

671
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:16,720
The life I've led
doesn't stop me loving.

672
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,440
I fell in love
with a Frenchman in Cameroon.

673
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,440
We were together around...

674
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:26,160
How did you meet?

675
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:30,280
I was grilling corn.
We met there.

676
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,520
I was tired of walking the streets.

677
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,400
I bought some corn
and grilled it on the roadside.

678
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,960
You stopped turning tricks?
- Yes.

679
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:43,920
I was grilling corn,
my clothes were dirty.

680
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:47,240
My hair was a mess,
full of ash.

681
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,720
You should have seen
the beautiful girls,

682
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,440
getting all dressed up
when they saw the white man.

683
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,880
Especially when they found out
he was single.

684
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:03,200
They would parade
back and forth in front of him.

685
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,240
He didn't see them.
He chose

686
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,720
the girl grilling corn
on the side of the road.

687
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,320
The way he loved me,
it wasn't just a fling.

688
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:16,440
Imagine a well-to-do man
coming to our house.

689
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,840
Whites on holiday
are afraid of our neighborhood,

690
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,840
they stay in beautiful villas.

691
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,680
He came to sleep
on a squeaky bed...

692
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,640
He slept in that bed,
just to be with me.

693
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,840
That's how I knew he loved me.

694
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,360
He came to sleep where?
- At my father's.

695
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,680
A wooden shack.

696
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,240
Surrounded by mosquitoes.

697
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,400
He'd wake up and slap them off,
but he stayed.

698
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,200
I knew he loved me!

699
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,040
He came to my place
during the floods,

700
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,160
when the water was up to here.

701
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:56,760
He walked through
that disgusting water

702
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,680
to come and see me.

703
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,840
Never mind all the beauties
in the city center,

704
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,720
he came to get me
during the floods.

705
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,520
He loved me.

706
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,120
If a man does that,
it means he loves you.

707
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,840
He'd go back and forth
to Europe,

708
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,320
then come back to see me.

709
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,880
When a person gets off the plane

710
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:21,480
then comes straight
to see you,

711
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,440
it means he loves you.

712
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,840
Even before dropping off
his luggage,

713
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,920
he'd tell his driver
to come and pick me up.

714
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,360
He brought me gifts.

715
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,880
Clothes, shoes, jewellery...

716
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,360
He even bought me nail polish.

717
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,640
American polish.

718
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,440
A youngster.

719
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,240
He was 29 or 30.

720
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,760
Good-looking fellow.

721
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,640
I swear, he was cute.

722
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,160
We were together
for the six months he was in Cameroon.

723
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,920
He stayed six months in Cameroon?
- Yes.

724
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,720
Then he came back for five months.

725
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:13,040
Then he left again
for the third time.

726
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,400
The second time he returned,
he brought me a ring.

727
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:20,840
An engagement ring.

728
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,640
He asked me to marry him.

729
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,800
After he gave me the ring,

730
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,320
he left for four years.

731
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,240
It was tough.

732
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:37,280
He came back.
I was married and pregnant.

733
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,360
I remember that day.

734
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,880
I'll never forget it.

735
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,800
He called me from
a Cameroon number.

736
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:51,520
He asked me to join him
at the Royal Palace.

737
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,160
I didn't recognize him.
"Who are you?"

738
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,560
He told me his name.

739
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,640
I didn't know that number.

740
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:02,080
He said to me:
"It's me, Blondon."

741
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,600
"What are you doing here?"

742
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:07,080
I was pregnant.

743
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,000
My belly was big.
How could I explain?

744
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,240
I had a wedding ring.

745
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:17,360
He'd been gone four years.

746
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,480
I had to carry on with my life.

747
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,680
I met my husband.
He gave me a ring too.

748
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,520
I looked at the two rings.

749
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,880
"The first guy came,
then went away again..."

750
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,600
So I made my choice.

751
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:40,360
Rosine, if I'd been patient,
I wouldn't have suffered like this.

752
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,680
I would be in love.

753
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:47,360
I would live with my real husband,
a good person.

754
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,360
Africans want everything,
right now.

755
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,600
They want to swallow
without chewing first.

756
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:07,400
I was in too much of a rush,
my sister.

757
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,240
Do you still have this T-shirt?
- No.

758
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:23,560
Idiot, you should have kept it,
as a souvenir.

759
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,480
We did each other's plaits.

760
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:31,200
Where did you buy that T-shirt?

761
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,200
At Papy's place.

762
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,440
A Pakistani place
in the shopping gallery.

763
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,880
I bought two,
red for you and black for me.

764
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:44,480
That day, I said to you:

765
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,920
"You wear this, I'll wear that one,
that way we're twins."

766
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:51,640
We did a lady's hair here that day.

767
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,760
I kept it for a long time.

768
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,200
This one comes from Papy's place too.

769
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,920
I paid 5 euros for it.

770
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,760
You tried this one,

771
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:07,120
but the sleeves were too short.

772
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,200
But this one fit you.

773
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,520
I tied Dominique
on my back.

774
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,520
Look at his teeth!

775
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,120
Rosine, look at you
in this photo.

776
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,960
How old were you?
16?

777
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,520
Sticking out your behind like that.

778
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,840
You took those photos.
- I know.

779
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,960
I had a camera.

780
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:35,560
The date isn't correct.

781
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,360
Since 19...

782
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,440
2008.

783
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,480
March 28th, 2008.

784
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,920
I remember,
you posed like that.

785
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,160
Has Geof seen this photo?

786
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:54,880
Has your husband seen it?
You were a young girl.

787
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,360
It was over there.

788
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,600
Look how empty this place was.

789
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,640
You could move around.

790
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:05,960
Not any more,
it's full of clutter.

791
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,560
Look how empty it was.

792
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,680
You could stand up
and take photos.

793
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,080
Rosine strikes a pose...

794
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:19,000
You posed.

795
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,760
That day, we did braids
for 30 euros and shared the money.

796
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,840
We went to the phone booth

797
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,840
and called our families.

798
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:33,440
We were full of joy
with our 15 euros.

799
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:40,840
There was much joy
in our hearts that day.

800
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,440
I remember.

801
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,920
Are you filming all that?

802
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,400
Is it rolling?

803
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,360
We were full of joy.

804
00:53:56,120 --> 00:54:01,320
Rosine was wearing a big smile,
she had earned 15 euros.

805
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,520
My little brother
has called me again.

806
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:47,240
That boy doesn't give me
a moment's peace.

807
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,640
Look at all these calls.

808
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:57,640
Thank God my phone
is on silent mode.

809
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,360
The problem he has right now
is because of me.

810
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,720
But I don't have any money.

811
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,080
What problem did you cause him?

812
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,840
I told him to take a loan
and buy a computer.

813
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,440
The lender is pressing him
to pay back the loan.

814
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,920
He's paying back in small installments,
as agreed.

815
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,560
Now, the lender
wants it all back at once.

816
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,320
That's why he called me this morning.

817
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:38,240
The guy is pressuring him
and it bugs him.

818
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:41,480
He doesn't want problems
with the guy.

819
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,800
I told him
to make him wait.

820
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:46,400
He knows I'm sick right now.

821
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:49,440
He doesn't want to bother me.
He got angry with the guy.

822
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,560
I told him to tell him
to wait a week.

823
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,920
I'll see what I can sell here.

824
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:08,480
When it comes to my little brother,
I don't mess around.

825
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,280
I must find
something to sell.

826
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:19,280
When I've found the money,
I'll be able to rest.

827
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:24,160
This thing makes my head ache.

828
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,160
My little brother
is a source of worry for me.

829
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:34,080
I have to work something out.

830
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,720
Looks like it's going to be a nice day.

831
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,920
The sun is hiding.

832
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,600
I don't trust this Belgian sun.

833
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:47,280
When it comes with wind,
it can sweep you off to Maroua.

834
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:57,680
One day when we were going
to a night club,

835
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:02,080
we hailed a taxi
but he couldn't take us tothe door

836
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,840
because there were works
in the street.

837
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:08,280
You remember that old street.

838
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,680
It was all bumpy in the taxi...

839
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,880
The taxi couldn't get up the street.
He dropped us off.

840
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:19,600
We got out.

841
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:24,080
There was a guy behind us,
I looked back.

842
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:28,120
I said to my friend:

843
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:32,680
"That guy behind us
looks pretty shady.

844
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,520
Let's take another street.

845
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:38,080
We'll separate. You go that way,
and I'll go this way."

846
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,560
"Don't worry,

847
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,400
perhaps he's just a client."

848
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:46,320
"A client with muscles like that?

849
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:49,040
D'you want to die?
I intend to live."

850
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,160
As I looked back,

851
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:54,960
my heart told me
something was about to happen.

852
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:58,080
I wanted to cross the street,

853
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:02,680
and the guy intercepted me
with a big knife.

854
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:05,880
Even Ali Baba
doesn't have such a big one.

855
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,520
This long...

856
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:09,120
"Get back together!"

857
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:12,400
We join up again
and he pushes us forward.

858
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:15,120
I start to beg him:

859
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,360
"Big brother,
we are your little sisters."

860
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:21,200
"Join up! That way!"

861
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,680
We went with him.

862
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:26,240
There was an abandoned car.

863
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:28,600
He took us

864
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:32,440
behind that car.

865
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,440
"Give me money!"

866
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:39,560
I told him I didn't have any.

867
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:44,160
"All I have is a few coins
for the taxi."

868
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:48,000
My friend gave him
the money she had.

869
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,120
I was wearing a necklace.

870
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:55,080
I told him: "Take this,
it's worth a lot."

871
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:56,680
I gave it to him.

872
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,320
He said:
"Get undressed!"

873
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:00,440
"Excuse me, boss?

874
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,960
Don't say I didn't warn you:

875
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:09,200
take a good look at me,
I have level 10 AIDS.

876
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,920
You fuck me,
at your own risk."

877
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:15,560
My friend asked him
to wear a condom.

878
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:18,480
He said: "I don't eat a sweet
with the wrapper on."

879
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,400
I said: "Boss,

880
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:24,400
I don't care how you eat it,

881
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:28,280
but I advise you to wear two condoms
before you fuck me,

882
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:32,280
because I have level 10 HIV.

883
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:35,520
I've warned you.
It's your choice."

884
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,800
I start to undress.

885
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,240
"No, don't bother!
I'll do your friend."

886
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:44,440
That evening,
my friend said to me:

887
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:49,640
"We're friends and you never told me
you had that disease?"

888
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,360
"What disease? Are you crazy?

889
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:54,480
Did you think
I'd do it for free?

890
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:58,480
And risk getting a disease?"

891
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,440
She was dumbfounded.
"Of course I lied."

892
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,320
The next day,
I saw our aggressor.

893
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:09,680
Where?
- In the street.

894
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:13,400
Near a woman
grilling corn and meat.

895
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:17,720
He was buying corn and meat
with our money!

896
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:26,720
Tell me what's in the journal.

897
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:31,160
Today in the journal, there is...

898
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,640
"Your father now".

899
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,920
It's been a while since I left.

900
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:43,440
How many years has it been?

901
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,360
One, two, three, four, five,

902
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,240
six, seven...

903
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:51,960
Seven and a half years
I've been away from my family.

904
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,480
I haven't seen him.

905
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,920
I don't know
what he's like today.

906
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:00,240
I know he's good deep down.

907
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:05,200
The only thing
that bothers me about him

908
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:08,520
is that he only calls me
to ask for money.

909
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:12,360
Ever seen a Cameroonian...

910
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:15,080
to ask how you are?

911
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:18,120
But if he needs something,
he'll call:

912
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:20,200
"Call me back!"

913
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:23,200
You call back,
thinking there's some problem,

914
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:25,360
but he just wants
to ask for money.

915
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:27,840
You regret calling back.

916
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,200
"What got into me?"

917
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:33,480
I can't describe my father.

918
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:36,880
He's always wanted to have money,

919
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:40,480
but when he had any,
he wasted it.

920
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:43,440
Now he has nothing.

921
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,360
He was a bricklayer.

922
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:48,720
He looked for work all day.
I felt sorry for him.

923
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:51,680
He lived like a man
without children.

924
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:56,280
If I was rich,

925
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:59,560
I would build him a house.

926
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,280
I would find someone
to cook for him.

927
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,720
These days, he's just scraping along.

928
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:10,480
I can't make myself hate him.

929
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:12,840
I just can't.

930
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:16,240
I reckon
he acted without thinking.

931
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:21,800
Some people don't realize
the impact of their actions.

932
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:25,520
If he had known
the consequences of his actions,

933
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,640
he wouldn't have acted that way.

934
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:33,520
I suppose he thinks
that if he could go back in time,

935
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,720
he would do things differently.

936
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,680
Anyone can tell themselves that.

937
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,640
Lots of people say:

938
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:47,240
"If I could go back in time,
I'd organize my life better."

939
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,600
Even prisoners must think that.

940
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:52,480
Murderers must tell themselves that.

941
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:58,800
I'll show you!

942
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:01,720
You offer them a beer
and they say:

943
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,880
"She's been in Europe
for 7 years,

944
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,640
she comes back and all we get
is a fruit juice.

945
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:10,920
She can't even buy us
a big Guiness."

946
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:15,960
They don't even know
if you have enough money.

947
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:18,120
They don't care.

948
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:22,080
"She doesn't even give us
10,000 francs to help us out."

949
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,080
Do I work at the bank?

950
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:26,160
Does the bank belong to me?

951
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:27,800
"My sister!"

952
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:29,920
They put on
their hypocritical smile:

953
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:33,720
"You left without telling us.

954
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:36,400
We would have taken you
to the airport.

955
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:39,320
You are lucky."

956
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,800
They kill me.

957
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,720
Is that what it's like
when you go back to Cameroon?

958
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:49,440
When they talk about you...

959
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:52,880
If people talk about you...

960
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:57,880
You start thinking
how you can avoid them.

961
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,880
You don't yet hear
what they say about you.

962
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:04,960
You know they're talking about you
from 5 meters away.

963
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:07,920
You get close
and they all stop talking.

964
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:12,320
"Hey, girl!
How are you?"

965
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:15,320
Flattered, you reply,

966
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:19,080
not knowing that the second before
they were calling you names.

967
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:22,880
When you move on,
they start badmouthing you again.

968
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:24,640
One will say:

969
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:29,720
"Europe suits her,
her skin is shiny."

970
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:33,000
When I walk around
my childhood neighborhood,

971
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:35,840
all the boys who insulted me

972
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,880
and called me all sorts of names

973
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:41,040
go: "Big sister!""

974
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:46,880
They get excited,
hoping you'll give them money.

975
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:48,960
"Big sister!"

976
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:51,000
"Fuck off!

977
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:54,400
'Big sister'? Do you remember
what you used to call me?

978
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:57,520
Sharon Stone!
Idiot! Moron!

979
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:00,440
Keep calling me Sharon Stone."

980
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:03,640
Some called me "Mama G".
"G" for general.

981
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:06,080
I didn't mind that.

982
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:09,960
"Just carry on calling me names,
'cos you're not getting my money!"

983
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:12,040
When I get there,
it's Christmas.

984
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:15,520
"Big sister! It's Christmas!
Throw!"

985
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,480
Shall I grab you,
throw you in the air?

986
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,160
Where should I throw you?

987
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:21,920
Am I some sort of launch base?

988
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:28,200
I get to some spot
in the neighborhood

989
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,840
and see an old papa
sitting on his doorstep.

990
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:33,680
"Mister Boniface's daughter is here.

991
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:37,440
I wonder when she's going
to build a house for her father."

992
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:40,360
Over there, you know,
your life's in danger.

993
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:45,080
"Isn't she ashamed
when she sees her father?

994
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:46,640
She lives in Europe, right?

995
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,040
Isn't she ashamed?

996
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,920
Can't she do something?"

997
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:53,320
Here, I don't have
money for food

998
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:55,080
and there they ask me
to build a house.

999
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:56,680
They come up to you
and say:

1000
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:59,680
"My girl, you came this year!

1001
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:03,560
You are pretty!
Your children are cute!"

1002
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:05,480
They give you some bread.

1003
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:08,680
Put it under your arm,
don't eat it, whatever you do.

1004
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:11,160
"I'll eat it later."

1005
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:14,760
You throw it
in the first trashcan you see.

1006
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:19,120
You can imagine their intentions
behind their fake smiles.

1007
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:28,360
I know those people
in Cameroon.

1008
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:35,360
Sister, if you listen
to what people say,

1009
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:37,840
you go mad
before your time.

1010
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,880
You lose your mind.

1011
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:46,760
You mustn't listen to them.

1012
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:28,400
Nobody can live
here in Belgium without work

1013
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:32,880
I have no one by my side,
and even if I did,

1014
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:35,560
if they don't have money,
how can they help?

1015
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:41,000
I want to show my husband
that I can cope on my own.

1016
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:46,520
Sometimes I get up in the morning
and go looking for work.

1017
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:48,840
I look for hours,

1018
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,400
I hand out my CV
in shops.

1019
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:59,240
I use what God gave me
to get a little money.

1020
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:01,880
I still turn tricks here.

1021
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:08,040
It's part of my life
here in Belgium.

1022
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:11,800
It's my life.

1023
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:19,000
If I had imagined that,
I never would have come.

1024
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,920
I'd never have come
to the Whites' paradise.

1025
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:24,080
There is only suffering here.

1026
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:27,120
I came here for a better life.

1027
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:29,080
Everyone says that.

1028
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:31,760
Some borrow money to get here,

1029
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,240
but when they do,
they discover the reality.

1030
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:36,520
They don't give up,

1031
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:39,680
they look for work
to get by.

1032
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:41,480
It's useless!

1033
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:45,080
They're scared to return
to Africa empty-handed

1034
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:47,560
and be a laughing stock.

1035
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,200
But I'm not afraid.

1036
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:51,800
I'm not ashamed
to go back to square one.

1037
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:54,840
If people mock me,
it doesn't matter,

1038
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,960
at least I went for it,
I tried.

1039
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:13,000
Wait, I'm ready.

1040
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:16,520
Is it foundation,
or fund?

1041
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,720
You know what "fund" means in our language?
- No.

1042
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:22,800
It's the vegetable
we eat with fufu.

1043
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:26,000
You know fufu?
Couscous flour. Maize.

1044
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:30,040
Is that white people's "fund"?

1045
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:33,320
It's white balance.
- Balance?

1046
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:35,880
What balance?

1047
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:39,720
The Blacks', or the Whites'?
You pick.

1048
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:43,000
Which one?
- I don't know.

1049
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:47,000
I need to shut up,
so we can get on.

1050
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:52,120
You can take it down.

1051
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,000
I can?
- Yes.

1052
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:56,280
Thank God.
May he bless you.

1053
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:00,200
So much suffering for white balance.

1054
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:28,200
Some people are afraid of death.

1055
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:30,960
Not me.

1056
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:35,560
Human beings are dust.

1057
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:39,280
We are dust,

1058
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,880
we return to dust.

1059
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:52,840
As my mother died,
did she leave a message for her children?

1060
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:57,560
Or did she just say:
"I'm sorry."

1061
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:02,600
Did she have the strength to say:

1062
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:07,120
"God, don't let this
happen to me."?

1063
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:21,080
I imagine dying
and meeting my mother.

1064
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,440
I would ask her
loads of questions.

1065
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:28,160
When you die,
do you see certain people again?

1066
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:30,880
You can't know before you die.

1067
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:33,680
You have to trust
what people say.

1068
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:39,440
Do hell and heaven really exist?

1069
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:43,160
Or does everything stop
when you die?

1070
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,600
Is there truly a spirit
within us?

1071
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:48,920
A spirit that lives within?

1072
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:51,720
Does your soul leave you

1073
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:54,480
and see how they care for your body?

1074
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:58,600
Does your soul
go to hell or heaven?

1075
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:03,600
Do we really have a destination?

1076
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:08,080
I ask you,
what is your destination?

1077
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:10,680
I wonder.

1078
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:15,440
Look at those youngsters,
22, 18, 16,

1079
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:17,320
some of them 4.

1080
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:20,880
Some don't grow up,
they die.

1081
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:23,760
What was their role?

1082
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:29,120
Father, do this for me.

1083
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:32,080
Don't leave me like this,
I beg you.

1084
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:34,640
You are my husband,

1085
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:37,320
the greatest of men.

1086
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:40,320
Don't leave me like this,
I beg you.

1087
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,040
I got married
without your agreement.

1088
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:49,040
I wasn't in love,
I have made bad choices.

1089
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:52,800
I beg you, forgive me.

1090
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:55,640
If that is what I did wrong,
forgive me.

1091
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:57,760
I beg you.

1092
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:01,160
And for all the other things
I have done,

1093
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:04,840
I beg you, forgive me!

1094
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:08,480
I beseech you, act!

1095
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:12,200
If it is because I have slept
with different men all my life,

1096
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:15,080
I beseech you, Father,
forgive me.

1097
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:17,600
If that's why
I don't have any work,

1098
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:20,040
forgive me
and give me work.

1099
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:23,880
I won't do it any more.

1100
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:27,160
OK, I have a proposal.

1101
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:30,760
I will fast.
That's my proposal.

1102
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:33,760
I will fast for six days,

1103
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:36,480
so that you change my situation,

1104
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:39,560
so my life
is like other people's.

1105
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:42,080
It's not to be like others.

1106
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:44,640
It's about my children.

1107
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:48,640
I myself need your forgiveness.

1108
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:50,760
I beg you!

1109
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:53,280
I know I messed up.

1110
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:55,520
I should have resisted.

1111
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:57,520
I messed up big time.

1112
01:14:58,120 --> 01:14:59,960
It makes me suffer,

1113
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:02,400
it's too much suffering.

1114
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,760
All that crying,
all that pain,

1115
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:07,720
all the abandonment.

1116
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:11,720
No school, no money,
no nothing.

1117
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:16,960
Everyone I asked for help
wanted to sleep with me.

1118
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:22,200
I beg you, if that's why,
forgive me.

1119
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:24,440
I beg you.

1120
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:27,600
I've never begged you so much, Father.

1121
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:30,160
You are my sole support.

1122
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:34,280
Holy Father, forgive me.

1123
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,560
This suffering is too much.

1124
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:46,480
How long can I keep
asking others for food?

1125
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:49,440
Stop this suffering

1126
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,960
so that I too
can give to others.

1127
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:54,000
I'm not bad.

1128
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:56,640
God, I'm not bad.

1129
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:01,000
I was abandoned.

1130
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,320
God!

1131
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:12,560
The way your own people
treat their peers.

1132
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:15,520
Abandonment.

1133
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,760
I have tried to survive.

1134
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:21,040
My father said:

1135
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:24,320
"Every man for himself."

1136
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:27,760
I can no longer live like this.

1137
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:30,160
I have killed no one.

1138
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:34,960
I wanted to help,

1139
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:39,600
but I made the wrong choices.

1140
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:43,640
Nobody helped me
make the right choices.

1141
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:46,560
I didn't want all this!

1142
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:52,800
If I had known,
I wouldn't have made those choices.

1143
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:55,000
Oh God,

1144
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:59,120
if I could change everything,
I would.

1145
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:03,400
I don't want to think about it anymore.

1146
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:06,840
If I could erase everything,
I would.

1147
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:08,920
Forgive me.

1148
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:12,240
Forgive me,
give me work!

1149
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:16,760
Father, I beg you,
give me work.

1150
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,280
Father, I have changed,

1151
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:22,640
I have children,
I don't want to live like this anymore.

1152
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:26,560
Look at this beautiful house!

1153
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:31,920
I'll take everything I have

1154
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:35,080
to beg you
to change my life.

1155
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:45,160
I can't take this any more.

1156
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:50,640
Look at my life,
I'm still young.

1157
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,960
Look at how people treat me.

1158
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:58,760
This isn't the life
you intended for me.

1159
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:02,000
I know I fucked up,
I messed up.

1160
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:04,480
I should have waited!

1161
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:07,080
But God,
I asked you for a sign,

1162
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:09,200
and you have given me none.

1163
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:13,760
That's why I messed up,
did any old thing.

1164
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:18,480
Father, I've ruined my life.
Please, change everything.

1165
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,720
Don't abandon me!

1166
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:23,440
I'm so sorry.

1167
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:27,280
This mouth is not clean.

1168
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:31,400
God, I wish
you would purify my body.

1169
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:34,520
Do it for months,
until it's clean.

1170
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:36,520
Change my life!

1171
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:38,520
Give me work,

1172
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:41,600
even if I'm only paid 5 euros,
I'll take it.

1173
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:45,040
I'll do it happily,
if it comes from you.

1174
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:49,640
I don't have dirty hands,
I have caused no harm.

1175
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:53,640
I'm not totally innocent,
I sold this body,

1176
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:56,400
which people say
is the temple of God.

1177
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:59,000
I sold it.

1178
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:03,920
If that's why, forgive me.

1179
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:06,040
I beg you...

1180
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:16,160
The suffering is too great,
I can't take it any more.

1181
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:20,800
If it's for all I've done,
forgive me.

1182
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:26,080
If that's what has offended you,
forgive me.

1183
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:30,200
If it's something I don't know about,
I'm sorry.

1184
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:34,840
Mom, please,
help me to ask for forgiveness.

1185
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:39,560
I have done nothing wrong,
help me ask for forgiveness.

1186
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:42,440
I don't want to live
like this any more.

1187
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:50,120
I don't know
if you're in hell or heaven.

1188
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:52,000
If you're in hell,

1189
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:55,120
come back to help me
ask for forgiveness.

1190
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:58,640
Beg him to pardon me.

1191
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:05,160
Don't leave me here like this, Mom.

1192
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:11,440
Ask forgiveness for me,
do it for your child.

1193
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:13,520
Join hands with me

1194
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:16,880
so we have more strength
to implore with.

1195
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,720
I didn't want my sister
to go to prison.

1196
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:29,600
I didn't want that.

1197
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:38,920
I was just passing
in front of that bush.

1198
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:42,960
I didn't ask to be raped.

1199
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:51,000
I just wanted to help.

1200
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:58,200
I asked my uncle for help,

1201
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:03,560
I asked my father,
my neighbors.

1202
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:06,080
Nobody wanted to help me.

1203
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,280
I begged, I implored...

1204
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:15,440
That's what I do.
I beg.

1205
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:30,880
The children are here,
I don't want to cry in front of them.

1206
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:25,360
The Lord makes possible
what seems impossible.

1207
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:31,200
He has given me joy in my life.

1208
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:36,160
The Lord has given me
joy in my life.

1209
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:40,240
He has given me joy in my life.

1210
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:45,600
Everybody come join me
and praise the Lord.

1211
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:51,200
You made me promises
and you never forget your promises.

1212
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:03,000
He promises
and he fulfils his promises.

1213
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:08,080
That is why
he's worthy of my praise.

1214
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:15,320
He has given me
joy in my heart.

1215
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:20,280
The Lord has given me
joy in my heart.

1216
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:25,240
He has given me
joy in my heart.

1217
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:30,280
Everybody come join me
and praise the Lord.

1218
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:57,040
Do you want to smoke before we start?

1219
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,640
I know you'd like me to smoke,

1220
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:04,480
but we can go ahead.

1221
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:08,520
Let's go over there to film.

1222
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:13,040
Can you look at me
without speaking?

1223
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:19,400
I don't understand.
- Look at me.

1224
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:21,920
I'm looking at you.
- Don't speak.

1225
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,040
OK, I'll be quiet.

1226
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:55,600
How many times have we sat here,
to braid each other's hair,

1227
01:26:55,767 --> 01:26:57,750
or that of our clients?

1228
01:27:00,875 --> 01:27:02,833
How many times
have we ended up here

1229
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,417
to keep each other warm

1230
01:27:04,583 --> 01:27:06,875
when winter fog
brought on loneliness,

1231
01:27:07,042 --> 01:27:08,458
memories of family.

1232
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:16,160
How many times
have we laughed about our culture,

1233
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:19,160
or this new culture
we were getting to know,

1234
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:23,200
imagining that one day
all would go well for us here?

1235
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:30,480
In Cameroon, we were at opposite ends
of the cultural spectrum,

1236
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:32,753
each assigned their place.

1237
01:27:33,042 --> 01:27:35,667
We would never have met there.

1238
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:43,000
The West forced our meeting
by reducing us to the color of our skin.

1239
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:47,880
Here, we are only Black
and African.

1240
01:27:50,583 --> 01:27:53,958
Leaving tested
everything that gave us strength:

1241
01:27:54,458 --> 01:27:57,833
our certainties, our ideas,
our vision of the world.

1242
01:27:58,583 --> 01:28:02,125
Leaving gave us the strength
to tell our story.

1243
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:08,280
Before, I would have ignored you,
judged you, as I had been taught to do.

1244
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:12,120
Today, I look at you,
I see you.

1245
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:16,600
Here, we dare to stand together.

1246
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:25,120
Your bravery has revealed
the fractures of our traditions.

1247
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:29,120
Your audacity highlights
that which is left unsaid in the West,

1248
01:28:29,287 --> 01:28:32,833
the dominance,
perpetuated in other forms.

1249
01:28:35,208 --> 01:28:38,208
Your strength brings back to life
all those ignored women

1250
01:28:38,375 --> 01:28:40,458
who left carrying their pain.

1251
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:45,960
Your courage forces us

1252
01:28:46,127 --> 01:28:49,000
to see those who wander around
here and elsewhere,

1253
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:53,240
asks us to hear their moans,

1254
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:56,320
and listen to their cries.

1255
01:30:03,333 --> 01:30:07,583
Subtitling:
Tongues Untied
