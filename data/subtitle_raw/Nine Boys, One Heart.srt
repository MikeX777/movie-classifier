1
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,095
It's 9 o'clock...

2
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:03,915
We're not going to sit here all night
being famished are we?

3
00:03:04,074 --> 00:03:06,563
It's still best we wait for her.

4
00:03:06,722 --> 00:03:10,521
We aren't going to wait all night,
are we?

5
00:03:10,675 --> 00:03:12,813
- [Babbles]
- What did he say?

6
00:03:12,976 --> 00:03:14,778
"What a start to Christmas!"

7
00:03:14,935 --> 00:03:18,536
We won't be eating better
than any other day.

8
00:03:18,695 --> 00:03:21,302
Christmas dinner is not something

9
00:03:21,456 --> 00:03:23,989
...we'll be stuffing ourselves
with tonight.

10
00:03:24,145 --> 00:03:25,715
It's... it's... it's...

11
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,167
- He's saying...
- Hell!... he can talk for himself!

12
00:03:29,324 --> 00:03:33,734
A lot of words aren't going
to fill your stomach.

13
00:03:36,117 --> 00:03:37,381
And all because of that idiot
over there.

14
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,631
Take a look at this...
Not bad, eh?

15
00:03:46,171 --> 00:03:50,581
"Wednesday, January 1...
and for the first time...

16
00:03:50,738 --> 00:03:52,341
"in Courbevoie City Hall...

17
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:55,302
"The Companions of Song."

18
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,969
I really think
I've captured our energy...

19
00:03:59,065 --> 00:04:02,024
..and our natural sense of fun.

20
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:05,239
When people see this poster,
they'll say...

21
00:04:05,434 --> 00:04:07,116
"Here are 9 merry fellows...

22
00:04:07,315 --> 00:04:08,538
"with whom...

23
00:04:08,772 --> 00:04:12,801
"...with whom you could be sure
of spending a pleasant time."

24
00:04:12,899 --> 00:04:14,032
What about our kitty?...

25
00:04:14,032 --> 00:04:15,336
Why did we trust you with it?

26
00:04:15,432 --> 00:04:16,926
It's all we've got saved.

27
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,900
What was it meant for?

28
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:21,087
For Christmas-New Year.
But I thought it better...

29
00:04:21,283 --> 00:04:23,848
He "thought it better"!

30
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:27,412
He thought it better
to buy this garbage...

31
00:04:27,577 --> 00:04:29,378
...to put his scribbles on.

32
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:32,175
This is what'll launch our careers!

33
00:04:32,335 --> 00:04:33,983
Right now we'd rather eat!

34
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:36,823
- All you think about is food!
- Be quiet!

35
00:04:37,555 --> 00:04:38,973
This is the moment of tragedy!

36
00:04:39,127 --> 00:04:42,532
As everyone knows...
hunger can lead to madness.

37
00:04:42,696 --> 00:04:46,451
And one of us is madder
than all the rest!

38
00:04:46,611 --> 00:04:48,487
See for yourselves!

39
00:04:52,021 --> 00:04:56,811
I'll put Christine between Jean-Louis
and Guy...

40
00:04:56,971 --> 00:04:59,580
- Why Guy?
- Why Jean-Louis?

41
00:04:59,735 --> 00:05:04,177
- If that makes him happy, that way...
- Will SHE be happy that way?

42
00:05:04,378 --> 00:05:07,521
But this meal's never going to happen,
is it?

43
00:05:07,678 --> 00:05:10,472
Miracles can happen
on Christmas Eve.

44
00:05:10,633 --> 00:05:12,739
There hasn't been one
for 2,000 years.

45
00:05:12,898 --> 00:05:15,886
Christine might turn up
with her arms full.

46
00:05:16,043 --> 00:05:18,575
She might've got a gig.

47
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:20,984
Here we are...
the hors-d'oeuvres...

48
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:23,216
iced pudding...,

49
00:05:23,373 --> 00:05:24,869
...fruit, coffee, liqueurs!

50
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,443
Sit up, please gentlemen!

51
00:05:26,598 --> 00:05:29,587
Charentes butter!
Isigny cream!

52
00:05:29,744 --> 00:05:33,422
<i>- Ducks from Nantes!
- Eggs from Picardy!</i>

53
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:36,833
<i>Olives from Provence...
cheese from Brie</i>

54
00:05:37,035 --> 00:05:40,515
<i>Meringues from Valence...
Grapes from Chablis...</i>

55
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,511
<i>Oysters from Marennes...
Liqueur from Fécamp.</i>

56
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,700
<i>Currants from Lorraine...
and tripes from Caen.</i>

57
00:05:47,856 --> 00:05:52,113
<i>Pullets from Bresse...
Champagne from Ay.</i>

58
00:05:52,347 --> 00:05:54,877
<i>Here is the wealth...</i>

59
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:58,367
<i>...of our country.</i>

60
00:05:58,523 --> 00:06:00,095
<i>La la la...</i>

61
00:06:00,252 --> 00:06:01,398
My dear chap...

62
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:03,165
Come and join us!

63
00:06:13,951 --> 00:06:15,706
My good friends...

64
00:06:15,869 --> 00:06:19,044
...before proceeding further
with this feast...

65
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:24,235
...I want to raise my glass to the one
we all keenly await.

66
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:28,295
I want to raise my glass to the one...

67
00:06:28,456 --> 00:06:31,480
...who's soon to be joining us.

68
00:06:34,021 --> 00:06:37,163
I want to raise my glass to the one
who is already with us...

69
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:40,765
...in our hearts and in our thoughts.

70
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:44,993
Let the party go on!

71
00:06:45,187 --> 00:06:50,633
<i>He's much admired...
Let's drink to his health!</i>

72
00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:53,856
<i>He's much admired...</i>

73
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:56,853
<i>Let's drink to his health...</i>

74
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,476
We were just trying
to cheer ourselves up.

75
00:07:08,672 --> 00:07:11,236
Just cheering ourselves up.
You understand?

76
00:07:11,436 --> 00:07:14,503
Don't worry about it...
I quite understand.

77
00:07:14,659 --> 00:07:17,191
- Is it the same for you?
- Same what for me?

78
00:07:17,383 --> 00:07:19,872
Are things going bad
for you too?

79
00:07:22,027 --> 00:07:24,635
- We just want to know.
- That's all.

80
00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:27,005
It's not important.

81
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,818
Not in the least.

82
00:07:37,109 --> 00:07:38,889
[babbles]

83
00:07:39,065 --> 00:07:40,593
So... translation?

84
00:07:40,696 --> 00:07:42,612
I'm tired of translating his nonsense.

85
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:44,705
Besides... it's irrelevant.

86
00:07:48,697 --> 00:07:50,149
Go on... what's he saying?

87
00:07:50,347 --> 00:07:55,259
He said that Christine has an uncle
who works in a nightclub.

88
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,674
Yes. So what?

89
00:07:57,869 --> 00:08:01,121
- Maybe he's the boss!
- You have to go there!

90
00:08:01,285 --> 00:08:02,813
Especially on Christmas Eve.

91
00:08:03,011 --> 00:08:05,619
- You'd be successful.
- You'll get to see the manager.

92
00:08:05,851 --> 00:08:07,956
- You'll get a contract.
- For a year.

93
00:08:08,115 --> 00:08:09,534
- You'll go on tour...

94
00:08:09,726 --> 00:08:11,653
- And to Hollywood.

95
00:08:15,023 --> 00:08:18,701
You see... your uncle
would certainly hire you.

96
00:08:18,859 --> 00:08:23,269
You have to go now...
before it's too late.

97
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,258
Alright, I'll go.

98
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,371
Poor kid.

99
00:08:44,954 --> 00:08:47,365
We should've gone ourselves.

100
00:08:47,525 --> 00:08:50,320
- That would've worked better.
- I didn't dare suggest it.

101
00:08:50,481 --> 00:08:52,815
Especially since we've got
our act perfect.

102
00:08:52,974 --> 00:08:54,961
You mean we're irresistible?

103
00:08:55,124 --> 00:08:58,192
Yes... but it's HER uncle.

104
00:08:58,347 --> 00:08:59,917
Guess so.

105
00:09:03,336 --> 00:09:05,628
I forgot something.

106
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:10,731
You remember the lucky charm
I gave you?

107
00:09:10,934 --> 00:09:14,187
Could you lend it to me?
I might need it tonight.

108
00:09:23,942 --> 00:09:25,318
Thanks.

109
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:11,747
I know what her uncle does
at the nightclub.

110
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,973
Why didn't you say anything?

111
00:10:14,135 --> 00:10:16,701
Because then
she wouldn't have gone.

112
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:42,492
<i>Listen to...</i>

113
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:46,250
<i>...these cries of joy.</i>

114
00:10:46,409 --> 00:10:49,890
<i>Listen to...</i>

115
00:10:50,056 --> 00:10:54,006
<i>...these happy songs.</i>

116
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,184
<i>Let us all sing...</i>

117
00:10:57,346 --> 00:11:01,024
<i>...Noël...</i>

118
00:11:01,567 --> 00:11:09,264
<i>Glory to the king of Heaven.</i>

119
00:11:57,939 --> 00:12:00,396
This way, madam, sir.

120
00:12:04,195 --> 00:12:05,951
Pardon, madam.

121
00:12:13,097 --> 00:12:14,930
Thank you sir.

122
00:12:17,856 --> 00:12:19,961
As I was saying...

123
00:12:20,158 --> 00:12:22,221
- Are you listening?
- I'm listening.

124
00:12:22,422 --> 00:12:24,637
This little niece of mine...

125
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:28,366
...as soon as I'd taken her in hand...
it was a triumph!

126
00:12:28,561 --> 00:12:32,774
I adjusted her voice
and I chose her repertoire.

127
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:34,238
Since then...

128
00:12:34,334 --> 00:12:36,313
...she's had the world at her feet.

129
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:38,802
London, New York...

130
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,838
Stockholm, South America...

131
00:12:41,508 --> 00:12:43,872
I'd never dare to ask her
to perform here.

132
00:12:43,968 --> 00:12:44,630
Pass me the bowler.

133
00:12:44,872 --> 00:12:46,594
-"Pass me the bowler."
- The bowler!

134
00:12:46,789 --> 00:12:47,900
Sorry... here...

135
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,446
You've got the right sort of body
for the stage...

136
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:53,990
If I took you in hand,
I could speak to Ferdinand...

137
00:12:54,158 --> 00:12:55,532
"Ferdinand"?

138
00:12:55,732 --> 00:12:58,099
He's the manager...
An old friend of mine.

139
00:12:58,302 --> 00:13:02,482
Would you mind taking care
of our guests, my good fellow?!

140
00:13:02,677 --> 00:13:05,548
If I catch you again,
you'll be out on your ear!

141
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:10,383
No... there's still a table...

142
00:13:10,543 --> 00:13:13,032
This way please...

143
00:14:06,648 --> 00:14:09,976
- Hello, uncle.
- Ah! That's amazing...

144
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,900
I was only talking about you
5 minutes ago.

145
00:14:13,055 --> 00:14:15,348
Lisa...
This is my niece.

146
00:14:15,512 --> 00:14:18,230
- My pleasure.
- I'm very proud to meet you.

147
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,682
- Your uncle's been telling me...
- That'll do!

148
00:14:20,884 --> 00:14:24,104
We haven't seen each other for ages.
Please excuse us.

149
00:14:24,684 --> 00:14:27,215
You've come at the right moment...
I've been tied up.

150
00:14:27,369 --> 00:14:30,239
- By the way... what do you think of her?
- Who do you mean?

151
00:14:30,862 --> 00:14:33,273
The girl, there...
She's crazy about me!

152
00:14:33,433 --> 00:14:35,964
Completely lost her head!

153
00:14:36,157 --> 00:14:37,499
So, what's new?

154
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:44,247
I knew you worked here,
but I didn't know as what.

155
00:14:44,408 --> 00:14:47,277
I thought you might do me a favour.

156
00:14:47,477 --> 00:14:50,927
Anything you want...
I'm the man to do it!

157
00:14:51,085 --> 00:14:53,266
The manager does nothing
without consulting with me.

158
00:14:54,001 --> 00:14:56,914
- I'm his right-hand man!
- Really?

159
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:00,062
Anything you want.
You have only to ask.

160
00:15:00,256 --> 00:15:03,814
You see, things aren't going well
for me at the moment.

161
00:15:04,017 --> 00:15:07,346
And then, you know my boys?
All 9 of them?

162
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:10,423
- Yes, of course!
- We haven't eaten in 2 days.

163
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:13,143
I see.

164
00:15:15,146 --> 00:15:18,866
No! I didn't come
to ask you for money.

165
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,817
I came to see...

166
00:15:20,978 --> 00:15:25,966
...if it might be possible to get
a singing engagement.

167
00:15:26,198 --> 00:15:28,379
You want to sing?
Whereabouts?

168
00:15:28,537 --> 00:15:30,416
- Here.
- Here?!

169
00:15:30,612 --> 00:15:33,524
- When?
- Tonight.

170
00:15:35,484 --> 00:15:39,043
Yes... It's possible.
I'll go talk to the manager.

171
00:15:39,207 --> 00:15:41,498
But you have to come to my office...

172
00:15:41,701 --> 00:15:45,073
...so I know what you can do.
Wait here.

173
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,498
Christine!

174
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,343
Come... It's this way.

175
00:16:44,445 --> 00:16:47,007
We shan't be disturbed here.

176
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,739
Well? Aren't you going to sing?

177
00:17:03,514 --> 00:17:05,579
Don't you know this?

178
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:08,612
What a shame...
It's a pretty song!

179
00:17:13,876 --> 00:17:15,633
Oh, pardon.

180
00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:20,898
So what are you going
to sing for me?

181
00:17:21,052 --> 00:17:24,501
- "A Street Song".
- Who sings on the street?

182
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,950
That's the title of my song.

183
00:17:27,998 --> 00:17:31,174
I have to tell you... I've only a few minutes..
So make it quick.

184
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:34,474
So..can I hear something?
- Right here?!

185
00:17:34,713 --> 00:17:37,354
You can sing here...
No one will mind.

186
00:17:37,553 --> 00:17:39,080
Go on... away you go!

187
00:17:42,388 --> 00:17:43,490
Go on! Go on!

188
00:17:44,537 --> 00:17:47,409
<i>To be in love, requires pride...</i>

189
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:50,439
<i>.To know when to be silent...
and dignity...</i>

190
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,548
<i>To know when to leave...</i>

191
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:57,039
One hot and cold!

192
00:17:57,202 --> 00:18:00,573
- What's hot and cold?
- That was these guys!

193
00:18:00,731 --> 00:18:02,532
Oh yes... go on.

194
00:18:03,686 --> 00:18:07,866
<i>...and keep smiling...
And as I was walking, I said...</i>

195
00:18:08,022 --> 00:18:10,315
<i>That I'd left at the right time...</i>

196
00:18:10,478 --> 00:18:12,846
Is this piece cheerful or sad?

197
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:16,269
- I don't know...
- Go on... we'll soon see.

198
00:18:17,462 --> 00:18:20,376
<i>If my heart is discouraged...</i>

199
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:22,825
You see... this thing's sad.

200
00:18:23,027 --> 00:18:25,438
I don't know anymore
if it's sad or gay.

201
00:18:25,597 --> 00:18:28,163
And I can't sing without music!

202
00:18:28,361 --> 00:18:30,237
Even the accordion would help.

203
00:18:30,433 --> 00:18:34,067
An accordion...
Well, if that'll help...

204
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:38,029
So... go on.

205
00:18:38,414 --> 00:18:41,252
- Well, play it.
- Me? I don't know how to play it!

206
00:18:41,408 --> 00:18:43,361
Wait...
I have an idea.

207
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,432
Wait here for a few minutes.

208
00:18:59,713 --> 00:19:02,552
- Émile, your chicken.
- Thanks.

209
00:19:06,928 --> 00:19:09,460
Just pass me a cover, please.

210
00:19:10,036 --> 00:19:12,982
- And the chateaubriands, rare?
- Well-done.

211
00:19:13,144 --> 00:19:15,634
I found someone, sweetie.

212
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,773
This gentleman took 1st prize
at the conservatory!

213
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:26,837
- Do you know music?
- Do I know music?!

214
00:19:26,997 --> 00:19:28,874
- Just a bit.
- This is my niece.

215
00:19:29,031 --> 00:19:30,406
- Pleased to meet you.
- Hi!

216
00:19:30,566 --> 00:19:31,908
So tell him what to play.

217
00:19:32,063 --> 00:19:35,620
Do you know a piece
called "The Street Song"?

218
00:19:35,784 --> 00:19:38,198
- Vaguely.
-"Vaguely?"

219
00:19:38,395 --> 00:19:40,958
- What key do you sing it in?
- I don't know.

220
00:19:41,118 --> 00:19:42,723
We're not worried about that!

221
00:19:42,884 --> 00:19:44,684
Go on... sing it to him.

222
00:19:51,863 --> 00:19:53,893
That's tops!
Sit down.

223
00:19:54,051 --> 00:19:55,961
Come on now, my girl...
I'm listening.

224
00:19:56,123 --> 00:19:59,953
<i>To be in love, requires pride...</i>

225
00:20:00,113 --> 00:20:02,024
Stop! Stop! One moment.

226
00:20:02,186 --> 00:20:05,516
- What do you wear, when you sing?
- My dress.

227
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,134
- No accessories?
- No.

228
00:20:08,287 --> 00:20:11,355
You need accessories.
Take off your coat.

229
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:15,233
We'll find something here.
What's this? No... not that.

230
00:20:15,388 --> 00:20:17,450
Jewellery... here we are!

231
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,678
Give me your coat.

232
00:20:20,837 --> 00:20:24,012
Here. Put on this bracelet...
put on this ring...

233
00:20:24,174 --> 00:20:26,816
...and I'll put on a little necklace.

234
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:29,345
It gives you a look... dignity...

235
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:32,608
It gives you... class!

236
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:34,495
That does it!

237
00:20:34,652 --> 00:20:36,757
Doesn't that make you
feel more comfortable?

238
00:20:36,954 --> 00:20:40,281
- Yes.
- You see... Now...1... 2... 3!

239
00:20:40,363 --> 00:20:45,658
<i>To be in love, requires pride...</i>

240
00:20:45,658 --> 00:20:45,934
<i>To know when to be silent...
and dignity...</i>

241
00:20:46,013 --> 00:20:51,458
<i>To know when to leave...</i>

242
00:20:51,554 --> 00:20:54,775
<i>i>...and keep smiling...</i>

243
00:20:54,845 --> 00:20:58,067
<i>And as I was walking, I said...</i>

244
00:20:58,101 --> 00:21:01,243
<i>That I'd left at the right time...</i>

245
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:05,294
<i>If my heart is wrenched...</i>

246
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:09,755
<i>He'll not have seen me crying.</i>

247
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:30,975
<i> My dress is faded from the sun.</i>

248
00:21:37,509 --> 00:21:40,806
<i>A song that runs in the street...</i>

249
00:21:40,963 --> 00:21:43,680
<i>Jostling the passers-by...</i>

250
00:21:44,262 --> 00:21:47,712
<i>It crept through the crowd...</i>

251
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:50,244
<i>As a small engaging song...</i>

252
00:21:50,902 --> 00:21:53,695
<i>I followed its journey...</i>

253
00:21:53,856 --> 00:21:57,109
<i>It stopped before me...</i>

254
00:22:07,441 --> 00:22:12,921
<i>There are handsome boys.</i>

255
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,263
<i>Cast your sorrows in the stream...</i>

256
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:19,639
<i>And turn the back on him...</i>

257
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:23,745
<i>If this song which runs in the street...</i>

258
00:22:23,903 --> 00:22:27,385
<i>Can chase your troubles away...</i>

259
00:22:27,549 --> 00:22:31,500
<i>Then come join the crowd...</i>

260
00:22:31,656 --> 00:22:32,833
Hey... the manager!

261
00:22:33,074 --> 00:22:34,875
Quiet! It's the manager!

262
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:37,134
It's alright!

263
00:22:38,812 --> 00:22:40,312
Bravo, young lady!... Excellent!

264
00:22:40,408 --> 00:22:42,788
You'd do an encore, I imagine?

265
00:22:44,894 --> 00:22:47,420
So I might have the pleasure of applauding you
on the stage before long?

266
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:51,412
Well, I'm delighted.

267
00:22:51,572 --> 00:22:55,071
Good luck, and once again... bravo!

268
00:23:00,814 --> 00:23:01,232
Thank you!

269
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:31,593
Good evening!

270
00:24:22,634 --> 00:24:27,000
Just keep the beggars
and flower-sellers, out!

271
00:24:27,201 --> 00:24:31,567
Any more chatting with the hat-check girl,
and you're fired!

272
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:34,981
As for your niece... she can come back
after the holidays.

273
00:24:35,144 --> 00:24:37,981
Very good sir...
thank you sir.

274
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:46,688
I've just seen the manager...
he told me ...

275
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:49,107
Don't bother... I heard it all.

276
00:24:49,304 --> 00:24:52,676
- So you listen at doors, now?
- You've been very good to me.

277
00:24:52,834 --> 00:24:55,519
You've done all you could...
Thank you.

278
00:24:55,675 --> 00:24:58,818
- I have to leave.
- But where do you want to go?

279
00:24:58,975 --> 00:25:02,653
You don't know Ferdinand the manager.

280
00:25:02,812 --> 00:25:05,343
But the real manager is me.

281
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:09,563
For Christmas Eve,
we need a long show.

282
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:14,313
You'll wait for me here...

283
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:14,554
I promise you'll sing tonight.

284
00:25:14,635 --> 00:25:16,623
You know I don't believe you.

285
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:19,282
But it makes you feel better,
I'll wait.

286
00:25:19,428 --> 00:25:22,833
Yes, it WILL make me feel better...
See you soon.

287
00:26:42,163 --> 00:26:45,842
I promise that you'll sing tonight.

288
00:26:46,001 --> 00:26:49,482
I promise... tonight...

289
00:26:49,915 --> 00:26:51,748
Tonight.

290
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,704
I promise you'll sing tonight.

291
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:59,006
Tonight.

292
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:15,499
After the holidays!

293
00:27:15,702 --> 00:27:18,726
I said "after the holidays!"

294
00:27:18,926 --> 00:27:20,224
I said...

295
00:27:20,424 --> 00:27:22,027
"after the holidays"!

296
00:27:22,226 --> 00:27:24,485
I said "after the holidays"!

297
00:27:25,872 --> 00:27:29,550
I said "after the holidays"!

298
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,736
<i>A bell is ringing, ringing...</i>

299
00:27:50,738 --> 00:27:55,683
<i>She's singing in the wind...</i>

300
00:27:55,881 --> 00:27:59,789
<i>Haunting and monotonous...</i>

301
00:27:59,949 --> 00:28:03,122
<i>She says again to us all...</i>

302
00:28:03,324 --> 00:28:07,538
<i>"Do not tremble, faithful hearts...</i>

303
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,959
<i>"God will make you a sign some day...</i>

304
00:28:11,499 --> 00:28:15,559
<i>"You'll be under His wing
with eternal life...</i>

305
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:18,596
<i>"An eternity of love!"</i>

306
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:26,019
Come forward!

307
00:29:31,241 --> 00:29:34,843
it's not possible!
You!... Here already?!

308
00:29:35,655 --> 00:29:39,059
- But where am I?
- Can't you see?

309
00:29:40,067 --> 00:29:42,097
- In Heaven?
- Yes.

310
00:29:42,255 --> 00:29:45,015
- I'm in Heaven?
- Yes, you are.

311
00:29:46,898 --> 00:29:49,157
But what is it that YOU do?

312
00:29:49,315 --> 00:29:51,531
I'm just a doorman.

313
00:29:51,695 --> 00:29:55,099
Everyone does the same here
as they did on earth.

314
00:29:55,301 --> 00:29:59,362
I'm the doorman
for the Parisian section of Heaven.

315
00:30:03,322 --> 00:30:06,542
-  That means I can come in?
- But of course!

316
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:17,899
Wait... show me what you've got
in your hand.

317
00:30:18,058 --> 00:30:20,896
- I don't have anything.
- Please... just show me!

318
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:25,230
- Where did that come from?
- I bought it.

319
00:30:25,388 --> 00:30:29,218
No. It's useless trying to lie...
I know you didn't have a penny.

320
00:30:29,378 --> 00:30:31,364
Somebody just gave it to me
out of charity.

321
00:30:31,527 --> 00:30:35,009
A man who realised I was hungry.

322
00:30:35,173 --> 00:30:36,590
-"Out of charity"?
- Yes.

323
00:30:36,746 --> 00:30:39,354
- You're sure about that?
- Yes.

324
00:30:39,509 --> 00:30:40,883
- Wait here. I'll go see.

325
00:30:41,044 --> 00:30:43,532
No!... Wait outside.

326
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:45,302
Wait for me there.

327
00:30:47,568 --> 00:30:50,137
- Excuse me, Miss Lisa...
- Yes?

328
00:30:50,293 --> 00:30:53,392
- Do you have the Paris registry?
- Certainly.

329
00:30:53,555 --> 00:30:57,079
What are the charitable deeds
registered this evening...

330
00:30:57,239 --> 00:30:59,999
...in the 18th district?
- The 18th district....

331
00:31:00,154 --> 00:31:01,726
Yes... we'll soon see.

332
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:06,364
There are some beggars
who received alms...

333
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:10,317
- Christmas presents...
- But they're obligatory!

334
00:31:10,476 --> 00:31:13,271
- Nothing else.
- That's all I need to know!

335
00:31:14,047 --> 00:31:17,343
Listen... I can explain...
I was just so hungry...

336
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:19,714
...and all these food platters
were going past...

337
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:22,247
I couldn't resist...
so I pinched it.

338
00:31:22,329 --> 00:31:24,797
I'm obliged then, to deny you entry!

339
00:31:24,797 --> 00:31:26,594
There's no place here for thieves.

340
00:31:26,672 --> 00:31:30,548
- Just for a chicken leg?
- I don't want any trouble.

341
00:31:30,644 --> 00:31:34,278
- Even though I've confessed?
- Rules are rules!

342
00:31:34,424 --> 00:31:37,065
Well, that's too bad!

343
00:31:37,685 --> 00:31:39,867
Goodbye.

344
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,701
Hey... wait there!

345
00:31:47,547 --> 00:31:50,265
You ARE my niece, after all...

346
00:31:50,463 --> 00:31:53,487
- What can I do...?
- Nobody need know.

347
00:31:53,648 --> 00:31:57,250
- They know everything, up here.
- It was the first time.

348
00:31:57,869 --> 00:31:59,779
- And the last?
- I swear.

349
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:03,048
- No swearing allowed here!
- I'll promise, then.

350
00:32:03,204 --> 00:32:05,496
Good... Get rid of that.

351
00:32:20,779 --> 00:32:22,765
Go through.

352
00:32:27,035 --> 00:32:30,865
- What was that?
- The squeaky door.

353
00:32:32,676 --> 00:32:35,317
May I introduce Miss Lisa...
My niece.

354
00:32:35,515 --> 00:32:39,313
Delighted to meet you.
Excuse me... I have a call.

355
00:32:39,468 --> 00:32:42,611
Too bad... we'll make it
another time.

356
00:32:42,769 --> 00:32:45,408
I would have liked you two
to get acquainted.

357
00:32:45,569 --> 00:32:49,323
Miss Lisa is the long-distance operator,
between the different Heavens.

358
00:32:49,484 --> 00:32:51,437
- Between the different...
- Heavens... yes!

359
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:54,660
One can even make contact
with Earth.

360
00:32:54,817 --> 00:32:56,882
- Really?
- Yes. There's the phone booth.

361
00:32:57,044 --> 00:33:00,721
And from up here we can see
what happens down there.

362
00:33:00,881 --> 00:33:02,375
- Including... that.
- Oh yes!

363
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:05,216
There's not much
going on right now.

364
00:33:05,371 --> 00:33:07,324
It's not always funny.

365
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,732
Especially with their
so-called United Nations.

366
00:33:11,837 --> 00:33:13,942
Come on... they're waiting for you,
for the show.

367
00:33:14,031 --> 00:33:15,259
What show?

368
00:33:15,355 --> 00:33:17,079
The Christmas Eve show.

369
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:19,181
You celebrate Christmas,
here too?

370
00:33:19,337 --> 00:33:24,588
Where else, if not here?
This is where it all started.

371
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:08,717
- Victor.
- Yes?

372
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,217
- Isn't it beautiful!?
- Yes.

373
00:34:12,218 --> 00:34:14,860
Looks like the cabaret just now.

374
00:34:15,558 --> 00:34:18,547
- Can it be the same one?
- Yes.

375
00:34:18,705 --> 00:34:20,079
For you, yes.

376
00:34:20,238 --> 00:34:23,688
You understand...
To each their own Heaven.

377
00:34:24,575 --> 00:34:27,141
And this one's yours.

378
00:34:34,668 --> 00:34:37,428
But the man in charge is the same.

379
00:34:37,583 --> 00:34:40,073
Yes, that's the manager.

380
00:34:40,725 --> 00:34:43,099
I'll take you over to him

381
00:34:46,295 --> 00:34:48,936
- But I'm hungry.
- You'll eat after the show.

382
00:34:49,097 --> 00:34:51,815
Unless he offers you something
right now.

383
00:34:51,975 --> 00:34:55,271
- I wouldn't dare ask him.
- The manager knows all!

384
00:34:55,428 --> 00:34:56,847
-"All"?
- All.

385
00:34:57,002 --> 00:35:00,374
You'll address him as "Your Excellency.

386
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:11,270
Your Excellency, my niece.

387
00:35:14,348 --> 00:35:17,827
- Hello, Christine.
- Hello, Your Excellency.

388
00:35:18,531 --> 00:35:20,211
How are you?

389
00:35:25,628 --> 00:35:29,350
You arrived a bit late...
We've finished eating.

390
00:35:29,505 --> 00:35:32,725
I hope you can wait until
the end of the show.

391
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,528
- I'm not at all hungry.
- Oh, but you are...

392
00:35:35,683 --> 00:35:38,936
You were complaining to Victor,
just now.

393
00:35:43,396 --> 00:35:45,306
- Over there?
- Yes.

394
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:47,500
So you DO know everything.

395
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:52,099
I thought this little snack
would do for the moment.

396
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,982
"This little snack"?
What snack?

397
00:35:58,593 --> 00:36:00,579
Aren't you eating, Christine?

398
00:36:00,779 --> 00:36:03,072
But... it's a miracle!

399
00:36:03,236 --> 00:36:06,793
No, not at all...
It's just how we do things here.

400
00:36:06,959 --> 00:36:11,063
A miracle is achieving
what you desire most.

401
00:36:11,218 --> 00:36:14,284
Is there a thing you wish for
more than anything?

402
00:36:14,441 --> 00:36:16,625
Yes, but I don't dare tell you.

403
00:36:16,782 --> 00:36:19,926
You don't need to tell me...
I know it.

404
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:22,538
Well, yes, of course...
You know all.

405
00:36:22,691 --> 00:36:26,063
So, Christine...
You shall have your miracle!

406
00:36:27,873 --> 00:36:29,095
That's a shame.

407
00:36:29,293 --> 00:36:30,285
Why?

408
00:36:30,481 --> 00:36:34,467
Because this is not the place
I need it...

409
00:36:34,627 --> 00:36:36,579
It's down THERE!

410
00:36:37,467 --> 00:36:39,680
I'll tell you a secret...

411
00:36:39,845 --> 00:36:44,636
It may be a sin...
but I'm a bit superstitious.

412
00:36:45,449 --> 00:36:46,626
For example...

413
00:36:47,214 --> 00:36:51,426
I had a lucky charm
and I gave it to a...

414
00:36:51,627 --> 00:36:54,464
To a friend... to Jean-Louis.

415
00:36:55,502 --> 00:36:58,799
I've no need to explain...
because you know it all anyway?

416
00:36:58,995 --> 00:37:02,552
Don't get angry...
I like you to tell me.

417
00:37:02,716 --> 00:37:06,088
You know... I only know you
from a great distance.

418
00:37:08,051 --> 00:37:09,883
Yes, of course!

419
00:37:11,428 --> 00:37:15,760
Anyway, I gave this lucky charm
as a present to Jean-Louis.

420
00:37:15,916 --> 00:37:18,024
This evening, I asked him for it back.

421
00:37:18,181 --> 00:37:22,089
I needed it right then
to bring me luck.

422
00:37:22,288 --> 00:37:26,697
Unfortunately I lost it,
and everything went wrong.

423
00:37:27,236 --> 00:37:28,809
But you know all about that!

424
00:37:29,042 --> 00:37:31,605
You'll find your lucky charm...

425
00:37:32,457 --> 00:37:34,105
..later.

426
00:37:36,985 --> 00:37:38,633
The show is about to commence.

427
00:37:38,827 --> 00:37:40,355
Lovely!

428
00:37:42,357 --> 00:37:45,424
Well, Christine... it's all yours.

429
00:37:45,581 --> 00:37:47,381
What's all mine?

430
00:37:47,653 --> 00:37:50,370
You'll give us the pleasure
of singing something.

431
00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:54,359
Me? Singing in front of these...

432
00:37:55,558 --> 00:37:58,199
- They're angels, aren't they?
- Yes. Why not?

433
00:37:58,397 --> 00:37:59,499
I'd be embarrassed.

434
00:37:59,702 --> 00:38:02,999
Don't be like those stars
who have to be begged.

435
00:38:03,271 --> 00:38:06,185
I don't want to be difficult...

436
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:10,980
...but don't forget my songs
didn't please everyone down there.

437
00:38:11,617 --> 00:38:13,069
What's it going to be like here?

438
00:38:13,133 --> 00:38:16,607
Careful!
False modesty is also a sin.

439
00:38:16,703 --> 00:38:17,876
No, no, no!

440
00:38:18,084 --> 00:38:21,805
- Don't keep us waiting.
- Well... you asked for it!

441
00:38:22,573 --> 00:38:26,252
Christine... you don't need
any accessories...

442
00:38:27,064 --> 00:38:29,279
Make use of the real you.

443
00:38:29,481 --> 00:38:31,741
Your simplicity...
Know what I mean?

444
00:38:32,781 --> 00:38:35,806
You'll do very well.
I know it.

445
00:38:35,967 --> 00:38:39,448
You know?
Then of course you know!

446
00:38:39,611 --> 00:38:41,642
Well... here goes!

447
00:38:41,799 --> 00:38:44,212
I still have stage fright.

448
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,008
I don't have my music.

449
00:39:24,241 --> 00:39:27,079
<i>Some time in your life...</i>

450
00:39:27,235 --> 00:39:30,869
<i>Your name was Sophie...</i>

451
00:39:31,034 --> 00:39:35,520
<i>You were so pretty...</i>

452
00:39:36,329 --> 00:39:42,081
<i>Mademoiselle Sophie</i>

453
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:51,592
<i>Oh, Sophie, Sophie
Living only for him...</i>

454
00:39:51,755 --> 00:39:54,550
<i>You left your friends...</i>

455
00:39:54,711 --> 00:39:58,314
<i>To think only of him...</i>

456
00:39:58,472 --> 00:40:01,003
<i>But he didn't understand...</i>

457
00:40:01,157 --> 00:40:04,105
<i>And one day, he is gone...</i>

458
00:40:04,266 --> 00:40:08,980
<i>Oh, mademoiselle Sophie</i>

459
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:16,115
<i>Farewell to your fantasy...
Farewell to your folly...</i>

460
00:40:17,274 --> 00:40:19,808
<i>You enjoyed life no more...</i>

461
00:40:21,035 --> 00:40:27,017
<i>Mademoiselle Sophie</i>

462
00:40:31,933 --> 00:40:34,847
<i>One sad rainy night...</i>

463
00:40:35,042 --> 00:40:38,065
<i>Gave God the desire...</i>

464
00:40:38,228 --> 00:40:43,215
<i>To take your life away...</i>

465
00:40:43,754 --> 00:40:49,735
<i>Mademoiselle Sophie</i>

466
00:40:52,234 --> 00:40:56,217
<i>Oh, Sophie, Sophie
But as he took thee...</i>

467
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:00,328
<i>To leave us like this...</i>

468
00:41:00,523 --> 00:41:04,276
<i>Without saying a word...</i>

469
00:41:05,127 --> 00:41:07,584
<i>Leaving all your friends?</i>

470
00:41:07,776 --> 00:41:11,073
<i>You have taken life...</i>

471
00:41:11,229 --> 00:41:15,945
<i>Oh, mademoiselle Sophie</i>

472
00:41:16,103 --> 00:41:18,821
<i>Some time in your life...</i>

473
00:41:18,981 --> 00:41:22,507
<i>You were known as Sophie...</i>

474
00:41:22,665 --> 00:41:28,220
<i>And you were
Oh so pretty...</i>

475
00:41:28,382 --> 00:41:33,207
<i>Mademoiselle...</i>

476
00:41:33,372 --> 00:41:37,629
<i>Sophie!</i>

477
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:21,602
Bravo, Christine!
You were wonderful.

478
00:42:21,762 --> 00:42:24,467
I told you you'd do
really well.

479
00:42:25,753 --> 00:42:28,547
- I knew you would.
- Thank you, Your Excellency.

480
00:42:28,709 --> 00:42:32,155
I'm the one who should be thanking you,
for lending your support...

481
00:42:32,315 --> 00:42:34,880
...to our evening entertainment.

482
00:42:35,078 --> 00:42:36,727
Goodbye for now.

483
00:42:58,447 --> 00:43:00,324
It's all so wonderful!

484
00:43:01,632 --> 00:43:03,618
Like a dream.

485
00:43:15,062 --> 00:43:17,552
Yes... it IS a dream...

486
00:43:17,712 --> 00:43:21,192
Dear God, please let it last
a little longer!

487
00:43:21,356 --> 00:43:24,151
Don't make me wake up, just yet!

488
00:43:35,211 --> 00:43:36,661
Oh, thank you.

489
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,607
Bon appétit!

490
00:44:03,838 --> 00:44:05,487
Of course!

491
00:44:10,476 --> 00:44:15,073
- No... I couldn't swallow a thing.
- Don't you like the food here?

492
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:18,258
- Yes.
- What's the problem? You were starving.

493
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:21,825
I'm going to explain...
I left my friends down there...

494
00:44:21,989 --> 00:44:24,521
- As we all do, here.
- Let me finish.

495
00:44:24,674 --> 00:44:28,396
They've had nothing to eat...
and they're counting on me tonight.

496
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:31,881
- Nothing I can do about that!
- I won't eat by myself.

497
00:44:31,987 --> 00:44:34,083
We're not going to make them
come up here.

498
00:44:34,179 --> 00:44:36,841
Why not?
Just for half an hour.

499
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:39,063
It wouldn't even be a miracle.

500
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:43,585
It's never been done before...
And it's against the rules!

501
00:44:44,745 --> 00:44:47,965
So I won't eat anything...
anything at all!

502
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:56,328
- What if you asked His Excellency?
- I'd never dare.

503
00:44:59,078 --> 00:45:01,905
What if I did?...
He knows all!

504
00:45:02,001 --> 00:45:04,688
If it doesn't work, it's because
he doesn't want it to.

505
00:45:04,853 --> 00:45:08,411
He knows all... If it doesn't work,
it's because he doesn't want it to.

506
00:45:08,613 --> 00:45:12,215
That makes sense.
But it's not regular at all.

507
00:45:12,413 --> 00:45:13,754
But it makes sense.

508
00:45:13,908 --> 00:45:16,932
But Lisa won't connect us.

509
00:45:17,093 --> 00:45:19,431
You'll have to fix that...
She's in love with you.

510
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:21,627
Where did you get
that idea from?

511
00:45:21,627 --> 00:45:23,503
Down on Earth, you were
in love with her.

512
00:45:23,585 --> 00:45:26,838
I imagine that here she'd love you...
as we each have our own Heaven.

513
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:28,505
You're the one
who told me that.

514
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:31,935
Lisa, interested in
an old fellow like me?!

515
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:35,012
- There is a certain logic to it, though.
- Yes.

516
00:45:36,014 --> 00:45:37,431
Leave it to me.

517
00:45:48,293 --> 00:45:52,015
Miss Lisa, may I put a call through
to Earth?

518
00:45:52,168 --> 00:45:55,966
- Do you have authorisation?
- Authorisation?.... Yes.

519
00:45:56,121 --> 00:45:59,680
- Who from?
- From... From him, of course.

520
00:45:59,844 --> 00:46:01,983
- Christine...
- Leave it to me.

521
00:46:05,484 --> 00:46:08,202
- They don't have a phone.
- Let's leave it then.

522
00:46:08,401 --> 00:46:10,049
What address?

523
00:46:10,243 --> 00:46:12,076
33 Rue Lepic, room 27a.

524
00:46:12,278 --> 00:46:14,995
"33 Rue Lepic, room 27a."

525
00:46:17,034 --> 00:46:19,294
It won't be easy
to get through to Earth.

526
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:22,598
There aren't enough lines.

527
00:46:23,137 --> 00:46:25,320
So many people are communicating
with Heaven.

528
00:46:25,478 --> 00:46:28,086
Mostly kids, with Father Christmas.

529
00:46:33,191 --> 00:46:34,992
Room 27a is busy.

530
00:46:35,187 --> 00:46:37,479
That can't be...
They don't have a phone.

531
00:46:37,682 --> 00:46:39,055
We'll see.

532
00:46:46,124 --> 00:46:48,109
<i>My God, I'm hungry!</i>

533
00:46:50,498 --> 00:46:52,909
<i>They might think of us,
up there tonight.</i>

534
00:46:53,798 --> 00:46:54,944
You see?!

535
00:46:55,141 --> 00:46:56,363
Oh, yes.

536
00:46:57,099 --> 00:47:01,278
<i>- And on Christmas Eve!
- Are you still complaining?</i>

537
00:47:01,435 --> 00:47:03,388
<i>But it's true.</i>

538
00:47:05,848 --> 00:47:08,839
It's free...
Will you take it in the booth?

539
00:47:30,905 --> 00:47:32,893
This'll really be something!

540
00:48:02,833 --> 00:48:06,894
- Should it take long?
- If it works... right away!

541
00:48:22,827 --> 00:48:26,658
- Do you know where this is?
- No!

542
00:48:26,817 --> 00:48:28,847
- In Heaven.
- In Heaven?!

543
00:48:29,043 --> 00:48:31,532
Come on...
I'll show you around.

544
00:48:32,229 --> 00:48:34,368
This is my Uncle Victor.

545
00:48:35,183 --> 00:48:37,214
And this is Lisa.

546
00:48:37,371 --> 00:48:39,357
- I'm Jean-Louis.
- I'm Fred.

547
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,931
- I'm Jo.
- I'm Paul, and that's  Albert.

548
00:48:42,091 --> 00:48:46,652
Thanks... but I don't need
your help any longer.

549
00:48:46,811 --> 00:48:50,140
I'm Albert.
Pleased to meet you.

550
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:53,097
- He's not babbling any more.
- Exactly.

551
00:48:53,257 --> 00:48:56,785
Ever since I couldn't put
3 words together...

552
00:48:56,981 --> 00:49:00,309
...I've fallen behind.
Now you're going to hear me speak.

553
00:49:02,697 --> 00:49:04,685
To each his own Heaven,

554
00:49:04,848 --> 00:49:06,494
Gentlemen, go on. '

555
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:07,916
- I'm Marc.
- Guy.

556
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,558
-  Still going!
- And I'm Gérard.

557
00:49:11,256 --> 00:49:14,932
Yes...This is exactly how
I imagined an angel.

558
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:17,466
- Hello.
- Hello, miss.

559
00:49:22,039 --> 00:49:22,954
What was that?

560
00:49:23,113 --> 00:49:27,327
Thunderclaps are made by lightning strikes...
and love at first sight!

561
00:49:29,522 --> 00:49:32,163
Well...
This IS love at first sight!

562
00:49:32,361 --> 00:49:35,615
Gentlemen...
You can't stay here...

563
00:49:35,777 --> 00:49:38,264
Follow me... but quietly.

564
00:49:44,736 --> 00:49:45,691
What a to-do!

565
00:49:45,787 --> 00:49:47,916
OUT OF ORDER

566
00:50:04,519 --> 00:50:06,167
Say...

567
00:50:06,361 --> 00:50:10,115
There's a stage through here...
What if we did our act?

568
00:50:30,076 --> 00:50:33,176
<i>Onc upon a time in our village...</i>

569
00:50:33,338 --> 00:50:36,820
<i>A huge bear rampaged through the woods...</i>

570
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,468
<i>He frightened the woodsmen</i>

571
00:50:40,629 --> 00:50:44,690
<i>And ate all the shepherd's sheep....</i>

572
00:50:44,788 --> 00:50:49,770
<i>The mayor and the priest
said in anger...</i>

573
00:50:49,866 --> 00:50:52,595
<i>This can't go on...</i>

574
00:50:52,756 --> 00:50:55,703
<i>"This bear will drive us crazy in a week...</i>

575
00:50:55,902 --> 00:50:59,929
<i>"We have to have its skin..."</i>

576
00:51:03,942 --> 00:51:06,919
<i>The set off one morning into the forest</i>

577
00:51:07,014 --> 00:51:09,784
<i>Which had a lovely scent of pine.</i>

578
00:51:22,765 --> 00:51:27,097
<i>We've been walking all day long...</i>

579
00:51:27,255 --> 00:51:30,703
I left it to you to fix things...
Let's listen to them!

580
00:51:30,862 --> 00:51:33,656
- Open the curtains.
- Yes, Your Excellency.

581
00:51:36,541 --> 00:51:40,261
<i>However at nightfall on the trail...</i>

582
00:51:47,726 --> 00:51:52,753
<i>His eyes could be seen glowing...</i>

583
00:51:52,849 --> 00:51:55,334
<i>And... Bang! The priest fired...</i>

584
00:51:59,642 --> 00:52:02,328
<i>...and scored a hit!</i>

585
00:52:02,482 --> 00:52:05,243
<i>But the bear, who was only wounded...</i>

586
00:52:05,399 --> 00:52:08,956
<i>Rolled into a ditch... just stunned.</i>

587
00:52:09,121 --> 00:52:11,958
<i>He was carried home...</i>

588
00:52:17,448 --> 00:52:20,361
<i>And imprisoned in the cellar.</i>

589
00:52:20,556 --> 00:52:22,740
<i>The whole village rejoiced.</i>

590
00:52:56,321 --> 00:52:58,537
Now the story goes on...

591
00:52:58,643 --> 00:53:01,012
<i>Since then the bear
has been tamed...</i>

592
00:53:01,108 --> 00:53:03,642
<i>...is well-behaved, happy
and well-groomed.</i>

593
00:53:03,804 --> 00:53:05,867
<i>He takes care of a heap of jobs...</i>

594
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:08,977
<i>Fetches water from the spring...</i>

595
00:53:09,177 --> 00:53:11,283
<i>He knows how to drive the tractor...</i>

596
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:15,120
<i>At New Year he helps the postman...</i>

597
00:53:15,278 --> 00:53:18,650
<i>...to hand out the prizes.</i>

598
00:53:19,499 --> 00:53:20,416
<i>Yes my friends...</i>

599
00:53:20,575 --> 00:53:24,711
<i>It was his speech
that was best understood.</i>

600
00:53:55,456 --> 00:53:57,366
And the moral of this story is...

601
00:53:57,528 --> 00:53:59,439
<i>Since he is now head
of the court...</i>

602
00:53:59,601 --> 00:54:02,668
<i>It's been found not to do any worse.</i>

603
00:54:02,824 --> 00:54:05,968
<i>Everything works better at the town hall.</i>

604
00:54:06,124 --> 00:54:11,419
<i>If only we had the same bear
in Paris!</i>

605
00:54:55,589 --> 00:54:56,854
It's all my fault.

606
00:55:02,229 --> 00:55:03,832
Be quiet!

607
00:55:04,032 --> 00:55:05,756
Be quiet!

608
00:55:05,951 --> 00:55:07,369
It's all my fault.

609
00:55:07,524 --> 00:55:08,866
but on Christmas Eve...

610
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:11,476
...I couldn't just leave them there
to starve.

611
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:13,889
So I had them brought up here.

612
00:55:14,047 --> 00:55:15,957
And then, because you are
so all-knowing...

613
00:55:16,119 --> 00:55:19,679
...I assumed that if it worked,
it was because you wanted it to.

614
00:55:19,842 --> 00:55:22,986
I'm not trying to justify myself...
I'm to blame.

615
00:55:23,182 --> 00:55:24,283
I made Victor do it.

616
00:55:24,523 --> 00:55:27,437
You can't deny I lied to Lisa...
Didn't I, Lisa?

617
00:55:27,978 --> 00:55:29,275
About the authorisation.

618
00:55:30,664 --> 00:55:33,730
You see, Your Excellency,
it's really all my fault.

619
00:55:35,153 --> 00:55:36,725
I DO see, Christine.

620
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:41,978
You're a good girl... and a salvation
for your comrades.

621
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:49,726
Besides, kindness like yours...

622
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,919
...is something rare in life.

623
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:55,292
Promise me you'll go on
being like that...

624
00:55:56,406 --> 00:56:00,090
-...when you return to Earth.
- "Return to Earth?!"

625
00:56:01,055 --> 00:56:02,857
Are you showing me the door?

626
00:56:03,474 --> 00:56:07,032
Couldn't I stay, Your Excellency...
I beg of you.

627
00:56:07,886 --> 00:56:09,840
I'll let you know later.

628
00:56:12,644 --> 00:56:15,636
Lisa, you have to always
see the authorisation...

629
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:17,783
...and do not leave the switchboard...

630
00:56:17,942 --> 00:56:19,284
...during business hours...

631
00:56:19,669 --> 00:56:20,542
Yes, Your Excellency.

632
00:56:21,624 --> 00:56:25,098
...even for reasons
as important as yours.

633
00:56:27,804 --> 00:56:31,208
Victor, you've broken the rules.

634
00:56:31,372 --> 00:56:34,592
You will need to be more disciplined
during the coming centuries.

635
00:56:35,209 --> 00:56:36,121
Another thing...

636
00:56:37,358 --> 00:56:40,905
Have you verified if Christine
had permission to enter...

637
00:56:40,988 --> 00:56:44,183
...and had definitely
left Earth?

638
00:56:44,279 --> 00:56:46,156
No, Your Excellency.

639
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:49,513
That's your answer, Christine.

640
00:56:50,866 --> 00:56:52,590
You don't belong here.

641
00:56:52,823 --> 00:56:54,045
Not yet.

642
00:56:54,665 --> 00:56:58,649
You should return to earth...
at some point.

643
00:56:59,884 --> 00:57:02,296
You'll go back some day, later on.

644
00:57:03,530 --> 00:57:05,254
I thought I might have to.

645
00:57:06,255 --> 00:57:10,816
Just now, I got the impression
that all this was only a dream.

646
00:57:11,704 --> 00:57:15,000
Your Excellency, couldn't you
make an exception?

647
00:57:15,157 --> 00:57:17,263
A teeny weeny exception.

648
00:57:17,421 --> 00:57:19,877
Life's so miserable down there.

649
00:57:20,030 --> 00:57:22,323
You're often cold and hungry.

650
00:57:23,331 --> 00:57:25,699
And it's so hard
to make a living.

651
00:57:25,864 --> 00:57:28,427
You have to be very smart
to get by.

652
00:57:29,816 --> 00:57:33,844
But it's especially hard with singing.
Nobody wants to listen.

653
00:57:34,037 --> 00:57:37,564
Whereas, here...
Well, you saw how it was.

654
00:57:37,798 --> 00:57:41,204
Yes, I know.
But you'll see, Christine,

655
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:46,922
...it will all go better for you now...
And this young man will help you.

656
00:57:47,659 --> 00:57:48,763
You love each other.

657
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:52,594
Both of  us would
have loved to stay.

658
00:57:52,957 --> 00:57:54,986
I'm sorry about that, Christine.

659
00:57:55,912 --> 00:57:57,940
My authority stops there.

660
00:57:59,057 --> 00:58:02,354
I also have to obey the orders
handed down to me from above.

661
00:58:03,433 --> 00:58:07,307
Your presence here
WAS in fact a dream...

662
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:09,991
...and every dream
has its awakening.

663
00:58:10,801 --> 00:58:15,668
What a pity.
I wanted so much to stay.

664
00:58:20,125 --> 00:58:21,347
What a pity!

665
00:58:22,273 --> 00:58:24,959
I wanted so much to stay.

666
00:58:25,152 --> 00:58:28,253
- That's it?
- Everyone's gone. We'll close up

667
00:58:29,796 --> 00:58:32,665
Hurry up!  Get your stuff...
We're leaving.

668
00:58:38,545 --> 00:58:39,996
Get moving!

669
00:58:43,073 --> 00:58:46,402
- Why are we leaving?
- They're closing up.

670
00:58:46,565 --> 00:58:48,214
How come?
You promised me.

671
00:58:48,369 --> 00:58:51,697
I'll explain in the morning.
I'll come over to your place.

672
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:54,152
Or you come here...
I don't know where you live.

673
00:58:54,316 --> 00:58:57,416
And my chance to sing?
I'm not going before I get it.

674
00:58:57,579 --> 00:59:00,418
We looked for you all over...
We couldn't find you.

675
00:59:00,612 --> 00:59:02,824
You're making that up!
I don't believe you.

676
00:59:02,988 --> 00:59:05,555
I promise you'll sing,
another time.

677
00:59:05,713 --> 00:59:08,246
You don't want to sing
to empty tables.

678
00:59:24,441 --> 00:59:26,088
Get a move on!

679
00:59:26,704 --> 00:59:29,771
I'm in a hurry...
I have to meet that girl.

680
00:59:29,928 --> 00:59:32,068
- The hat-check girl?
- Yes.

681
00:59:32,230 --> 00:59:35,068
She was so insistent...
I couldn't say no.

682
00:59:35,224 --> 00:59:39,329
An old fellow like you with Lisa?
Maybe that makes sense?

683
00:59:39,485 --> 00:59:41,469
Oh...thanks! Good night!

684
01:00:05,349 --> 01:00:07,682
- Hello.
- Good night.

685
01:00:52,433 --> 01:00:54,310
How about a bit of quiet?!

686
01:00:54,506 --> 01:00:57,418
We've nothing to eat...
At least let us sleep.

687
01:00:57,575 --> 01:00:59,606
I hurt myself!

688
01:01:00,338 --> 01:01:01,866
Poor little kid!

689
01:01:02,488 --> 01:01:04,134
Thanks for your sympathy!

690
01:01:04,943 --> 01:01:07,311
Idiot!
I wasn't talking about you.

691
01:01:08,129 --> 01:01:10,039
I was referring to Christine.

692
01:01:12,771 --> 01:01:14,224
It was stupid.

693
01:01:14,384 --> 01:01:18,063
If she hadn't got something,
she'd be back by now.

694
01:01:18,221 --> 01:01:19,640
- That's idiotic.
- Yeah.

695
01:01:19,794 --> 01:01:22,512
If she HAD got something,
she'd be back by now.

696
01:01:22,673 --> 01:01:24,583
She didn't dare... that's all.

697
01:01:24,744 --> 01:01:27,582
- It doesn't make sense!
- No, it doesn't make sense.

698
01:01:27,738 --> 01:01:29,877
Nobody thinks about Christine.

699
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:32,109
She can't have eaten either.

700
01:01:32,267 --> 01:01:34,830
[Babbles]

701
01:01:34,990 --> 01:01:37,282
- Obviously.
- Obviously what?

702
01:01:37,446 --> 01:01:40,393
- It won't have gone well for her.
- Why not?

703
01:01:40,593 --> 01:01:42,387
Because I know
what her uncle does.

704
01:01:43,546 --> 01:01:45,464
Would you like to know?

705
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:47,915
I asked you 3 times.
You wouldn't tell me.

706
01:01:48,115 --> 01:01:49,992
- He's the doorman.
- A nobody.

707
01:01:50,188 --> 01:01:52,554
It's a funny sort of job.

708
01:01:53,718 --> 01:01:57,625
What can they earn,
with tips and everything?

709
01:01:57,901 --> 01:02:01,458
- What are you saying?
- I told you an hour ago!

710
01:02:01,661 --> 01:02:04,225
There's nothing her uncle
can do for her.

711
01:02:04,386 --> 01:02:07,637
WE've got an act, but amateurs
can't get in the door.

712
01:02:07,801 --> 01:02:09,295
Don't call her "amateur".

713
01:02:09,451 --> 01:02:13,402
You're only playing white knight
because you're in love with her.

714
01:02:32,859 --> 01:02:37,575
Now we present the greatest attraction
of the year.

715
01:02:39,191 --> 01:02:43,403
You have the privilege to witness
the discovery of Albert the Redhead.

716
01:02:43,565 --> 01:02:46,971
Albert the Redhead,
the man who walks on his hands...

717
01:02:47,135 --> 01:02:50,234
...who sees the world upside down...
which is quite an advantage.

718
01:02:50,396 --> 01:02:53,540
Don't forget to show your appreciation
at the end... with a donation.

719
01:02:53,696 --> 01:02:55,071
Think that'd work?

720
01:02:55,232 --> 01:02:56,027
Yeah.

721
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:58,909
- It's got to work at Christmas.
- The streets are full of people.

722
01:02:59,069 --> 01:03:02,900
- If we get crowds, we'll do OK.
- We can give it a try.

723
01:03:03,175 --> 01:03:04,746
I'll show you what comes next...

724
01:03:04,939 --> 01:03:07,046
The time has come
to admire the man...

725
01:03:07,205 --> 01:03:09,889
....who defies the laws of gravity.

726
01:03:18,717 --> 01:03:22,350
12 plates in good condition...

727
01:03:22,515 --> 01:03:25,921
2 plates slightly used.

728
01:03:26,124 --> 01:03:30,073
2 plates slightly used...

729
01:03:30,229 --> 01:03:33,449
- Hubert, how many shirts do you have?
- Three... why?

730
01:03:33,607 --> 01:03:37,481
- Put down... one shirt... 39 collar.
- What's that about?

731
01:03:37,674 --> 01:03:40,358
It's the only way
we can raise some money.

732
01:03:40,552 --> 01:03:42,888
The pawnbrokers...
No talent needed.

733
01:03:43,046 --> 01:03:46,037
From Guy...
A brush and 10 tubes of paint?

734
01:03:46,231 --> 01:03:49,298
- Are you crazy? I need that for posters.
- Who cares?!

735
01:03:49,455 --> 01:03:54,823
Stop it! It's dawn on December 25th.
The day begins.

736
01:03:54,981 --> 01:03:55,821
How poetic.

737
01:03:55,979 --> 01:04:00,344
No hock shops are open
until tomorrow.

738
01:04:01,158 --> 01:04:02,686
- This is useless.
- So much the better.

739
01:04:02,846 --> 01:04:04,802
It's a shame.

740
01:04:04,959 --> 01:04:08,026
- So what can we do?
- We can go to bed.

741
01:04:08,182 --> 01:04:12,132
But Christine's not back yet...
Something must have happened to her.

742
01:04:12,288 --> 01:04:15,463
We need to go find her.
Where's this nightclub?

743
01:04:15,626 --> 01:04:17,230
- Montmartre.
- Where in Montmartre?

744
01:04:17,391 --> 01:04:19,684
-Montmartre.
-Montmartre?:

745
01:04:19,886 --> 01:04:21,457
We'll find it...
Are you coming?

746
01:04:21,613 --> 01:04:23,828
What's the point?

747
01:04:23,992 --> 01:04:26,098
Are you coming or not?

748
01:04:31,283 --> 01:04:34,196
Well that's too bad...
I'll go on my own.

749
01:06:34,157 --> 01:06:36,799
So, Your Excellency...
What about my miracle?

750
01:06:37,649 --> 01:06:41,786
I don't do if you can hear me,
or if your switchboard's clogged...

751
01:06:41,947 --> 01:06:45,396
...but your miracle's
a bit slow in coming.

752
01:06:50,122 --> 01:06:54,379
And the lucky charm I lost...
that I'm supposed to find?

753
01:06:57,527 --> 01:06:59,742
But I didn't lose it here..

754
01:07:01,058 --> 01:07:03,820
So I won't find it here.

755
01:07:05,664 --> 01:07:06,929
It's...

756
01:07:20,821 --> 01:07:22,086
Another one.

757
01:07:25,694 --> 01:07:28,336
- What's he doing?
- Nothing at all.

758
01:07:28,496 --> 01:07:32,371
- He doesn't want to be bothered.
- Did you tell him we've closed?

759
01:07:32,525 --> 01:07:36,629
- Yes. But he keeps ordering champagne.
- But he has to...

760
01:07:36,785 --> 01:07:39,349
- He can't sleep here.
- I don't understand...

761
01:07:39,509 --> 01:07:42,881
...He says he won't leave
until the little girl has sung.

762
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:43,837
Which girl?

763
01:07:49,448 --> 01:07:51,817
- Victor!
- Yes, sir?

764
01:07:51,981 --> 01:07:53,934
That girl you were talking about...

765
01:07:54,092 --> 01:07:56,810
- My niece?
- Yes... Is she still here?

766
01:07:56,970 --> 01:07:59,885
I'll fix it...
She's left.

767
01:08:00,039 --> 01:08:03,063
- Go and fetch her right away.
- Very well. My niece?!

768
01:08:03,225 --> 01:08:04,981
Just do what I tell you!

769
01:08:05,144 --> 01:08:07,435
But I don't know
where she lives.

770
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:09,585
If you don't bring her back,
you're fired!

771
01:08:09,749 --> 01:08:11,276
Yes sir!

772
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:22,563
Are you looking for something?

773
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:24,476
Yes, thanks...

774
01:08:24,638 --> 01:08:26,361
I thought I lost it here.

775
01:08:26,517 --> 01:08:29,694
It was just my little mascot
that I treasured.

776
01:08:29,857 --> 01:08:33,033
I must have been wrong.
It doesn't matter.

777
01:08:33,195 --> 01:08:35,070
- Goodnight again.
- Goodnight.

778
01:08:41,829 --> 01:08:43,630
Hey... wait there...
Come back!

779
01:08:43,785 --> 01:08:46,548
Quick... quick...
It's all fixed...

780
01:08:46,704 --> 01:08:50,184
What I promise, I deliver...
It's all yours in 2 minutes.

781
01:08:50,387 --> 01:08:51,685
But you said...

782
01:08:51,845 --> 01:08:55,250
You asked me for a chance to sing...
You're going to sing.

783
01:08:55,414 --> 01:08:59,703
- The room's empty.
- Don't let that deter you... come on!

784
01:09:14,523 --> 01:09:17,821
- There's no music.
- What do you expect at this hour?!

785
01:09:25,155 --> 01:09:27,030
Hurry up! Go on!

786
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:31,978
- What are you doing now?
- I'm getting ready.

787
01:09:32,139 --> 01:09:33,972
Give me your coat.

788
01:09:34,134 --> 01:09:35,127
Take it.

789
01:09:35,286 --> 01:09:37,196
- Hold this.
- You're taking off the jewellery?

790
01:09:37,396 --> 01:09:40,418
But that's what gives you...
style... class.

791
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:43,190
No longer needed...
It's about simplicity... understand?

792
01:09:43,344 --> 01:09:46,977
I just want to get it
over and done with!

793
01:10:17,497 --> 01:10:18,642
Excuse me sir...

794
01:10:22,677 --> 01:10:26,476
- Could you accompany me?
- Do you know what time it is?

795
01:10:26,629 --> 01:10:28,430
Take a look!

796
01:10:28,587 --> 01:10:30,267
How about that!

797
01:10:51,190 --> 01:10:54,485
<i>She was in love...</i>

798
01:10:54,644 --> 01:10:57,711
<i>but she lived unhappily...</i>

799
01:10:57,906 --> 01:11:00,165
<i>He did not return her love</i>

800
01:11:00,323 --> 01:11:04,383
<i>Strange that it was like that.</i>

801
01:11:04,544 --> 01:11:07,643
<i>She ran to the fountain</i>

802
01:11:07,806 --> 01:11:10,949
<i>to drown her pain</i>

803
01:11:11,106 --> 01:11:14,512
<i>and the devil and his crew</i>

804
01:11:14,675 --> 01:11:19,041
<i>encouraged her.</i>

805
01:11:19,203 --> 01:11:21,462
<i>That's the reason</i>

806
01:11:22,312 --> 01:11:26,142
<i>Cupid was crying in his corner.</i>

807
01:11:26,303 --> 01:11:29,064
<i>That's the reason</i>

808
01:11:29,219 --> 01:11:32,548
<i>Heaven understood nothing.</i>

809
01:11:32,711 --> 01:11:34,468
<i>The days still full of light...</i>

810
01:11:34,630 --> 01:11:36,005
<i>The words of the prayers</i>

811
01:11:36,166 --> 01:11:39,416
<i>all rising in procession</i>

812
01:11:39,580 --> 01:11:42,680
<i>escorted her...
But the girl is dead</i>

813
01:11:42,842 --> 01:11:46,247
<i>while crying out "Forgive me "</i>

814
01:11:46,411 --> 01:11:49,095
<i>That's the reason</i>

815
01:11:49,250 --> 01:11:50,974
<i>Cupid was crying</i>

816
01:11:51,169 --> 01:11:52,925
<i>in his corner</i>

817
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:56,154
<i>That's the reason</i>

818
01:11:56,349 --> 01:12:00,606
<i>Heaven understood nothing</i>

819
01:12:02,912 --> 01:12:06,590
<i>All the flowers withered</i>

820
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:09,773
<i>as night swallowed the Earth</i>

821
01:12:09,974 --> 01:12:12,613
<i>to sing onf the last day</i>

822
01:12:12,812 --> 01:12:16,413
<i>of this death for love.</i>

823
01:12:16,611 --> 01:12:19,831
<i>Black carousel horses</i>

824
01:12:19,988 --> 01:12:23,011
<i>are the unloved in a cortege</i>

825
01:12:23,173 --> 01:12:26,623
<i>trying to prevent</i>

826
01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:31,452
<i>the sun from rising.</i>

827
01:12:31,616 --> 01:12:33,419
<i>That's the reason why</i>

828
01:12:34,954 --> 01:12:38,862
<i>Cupid has not more friends.</i>

829
01:12:39,022 --> 01:12:41,708
<i>That's the reason why</i>

830
01:12:41,863 --> 01:12:45,190
<i>the heavens were seeking shelter</i>

831
01:12:45,392 --> 01:12:48,841
<i>Games and dances...
All the joys of the world</i>

832
01:12:49,037 --> 01:12:50,762
<i> were wanting to leave...</i>

833
01:12:52,298 --> 01:12:55,474
<i>And the hearts of men
like autumn leaves</i>

834
01:12:55,638 --> 01:12:58,891
<i>would wither.</i>

835
01:12:59,092 --> 01:13:01,885
<i>That's the reason why</i>

836
01:13:02,046 --> 01:13:05,376
<i>Cupid has not more friends.</i>

837
01:13:05,616 --> 01:13:08,604
<i>That's the reason why</i>

838
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:12,320
<i>the heavens are seeking shelter.</i>

839
01:13:15,746 --> 01:13:18,617
<i>But now my story</i>

840
01:13:18,816 --> 01:13:22,451
<i>will dance under garlands.</i>

841
01:13:22,616 --> 01:13:24,984
<i>It could not last.</i>

842
01:13:25,149 --> 01:13:29,329
<i>Cupid has arranged everything</i>

843
01:13:29,524 --> 01:13:32,698
<i>and since it is he who sings</i>

844
01:13:32,861 --> 01:13:35,851
<i>it's too bad for the tormented.</i>

845
01:13:36,046 --> 01:13:40,182
<i>You can always cry</i>

846
01:13:40,343 --> 01:13:44,831
<i>but it's better to sing.</i>

847
01:13:45,717 --> 01:13:48,783
<i>That's the reason why</i>

848
01:13:48,940 --> 01:13:52,739
<i>we listen to accordions.</i>

849
01:13:52,894 --> 01:13:55,654
<i>That's the reason why</i>

850
01:13:55,809 --> 01:13:59,335
<i>the street bursts into song.</i>

851
01:13:59,493 --> 01:14:02,822
<i>The sorrow of souls
drowned in sound</i>

852
01:14:02,985 --> 01:14:06,007
<i>is heard no more.</i>

853
01:14:06,170 --> 01:14:09,161
<i>Love is a party
that everyone joins</i>

854
01:14:09,317 --> 01:14:12,188
<i>wholeheartedly.</i>

855
01:14:12,387 --> 01:14:15,606
<i>That's the reason why</i>

856
01:14:15,763 --> 01:14:19,136
<i>we listen to accordions.</i>

857
01:14:19,371 --> 01:14:22,165
<i>That's the reason why</i>

858
01:14:22,364 --> 01:14:27,309
<i>the street bursts into song.</i>

859
01:14:38,290 --> 01:14:41,694
So what have you been doing?

860
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:50,452
I take back what I said to you.

861
01:14:50,608 --> 01:14:52,639
Thank you. Why sir?

862
01:14:52,794 --> 01:14:56,092
When we see a talent like that,
we say so.

863
01:14:56,788 --> 01:15:00,388
I'd like you to meet
my nine friends.

864
01:15:00,547 --> 01:15:01,649
Gentlemen.

865
01:15:02,695 --> 01:15:04,038
But...

866
01:15:04,193 --> 01:15:06,222
But I can only see eight.

867
01:15:06,418 --> 01:15:08,372
- Who's missing?
- HUBERT!

868
01:15:08,529 --> 01:15:12,404
- Hubert?  Damn!
He was just the one I needed.

869
01:15:12,558 --> 01:15:15,242
- Why?
- I've got something for him.

870
01:15:15,399 --> 01:15:18,465
Too late.
He's hit it off...

871
01:15:18,621 --> 01:15:21,110
...with the hat-check girl.

872
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:24,908
- The hat-check girl?
- The hat-check girl!

873
01:15:25,643 --> 01:15:28,634
It WAS love at first sight then.
Really truly!

874
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:31,476
How do you know?
Were you over there?

875
01:15:31,631 --> 01:15:34,086
I introduced them UP there.

876
01:15:34,278 --> 01:15:35,228
"Up" there?

877
01:15:40,418 --> 01:15:43,562
- I've things to do!
- Victor!

878
01:15:44,371 --> 01:15:46,980
Ye... you're right of course.

879
01:15:47,134 --> 01:15:51,543
Old fellow like me...
Doesn't make sense.

880
01:15:51,701 --> 01:15:53,729
Okay, I'm going.

881
01:15:53,887 --> 01:15:56,376
I'll go out the back door.

882
01:16:02,444 --> 01:16:06,734
Miss, gentlemen...
Can I offer you a little supper?

883
01:16:06,973 --> 01:16:08,348
Can you ever!

884
01:16:16,643 --> 01:16:20,016
Tell the chef to prepare a supper.

885
01:16:20,174 --> 01:16:21,700
Very well, sir.

886
01:16:21,862 --> 01:16:22,856
May I?

887
01:16:23,052 --> 01:16:24,427
Certaunly.

888
01:16:26,237 --> 01:16:29,303
- Miss Christine, gentlemen...
I like what you're doing...

889
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:33,094
...and I'd be happy to include you
in our entertainment.

890
01:16:33,258 --> 01:16:36,980
I'm sorry, but this will require
some consideration.

891
01:16:37,134 --> 01:16:39,427
How about we say January 1?

892
01:16:39,591 --> 01:16:42,003
January 1...
That's impossible...

893
01:16:42,162 --> 01:16:46,189
We're under contract...
A very important one.

894
01:16:46,345 --> 01:16:47,567
- All of you?
- Yes, all of us.

895
01:16:47,765 --> 01:16:50,177
- Not Christine.
- No, not Christine.

896
01:16:50,337 --> 01:16:53,097
Can you work as a soloist?

897
01:16:53,252 --> 01:16:54,125
I think I can.

898
01:16:54,290 --> 01:16:58,469
You could do the show,
until we were free.

899
01:16:58,664 --> 01:16:59,809
For sure.

900
01:17:00,007 --> 01:17:04,263
That's an idea... Show them
what you can do without us.

901
01:17:05,917 --> 01:17:09,593
Me too.  I'd very much
like to hear you.

902
01:17:30,706 --> 01:17:33,270
<i>-  "La Vie en rose".
- Certainly.</i>

903
01:17:52,118 --> 01:17:55,294
<i>With eyes which make mine lower,</i>

904
01:17:55,458 --> 01:17:58,984
<i>A smile which is lost on his lips,</i>

905
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:02,281
<i>That's the unembellished portrait</i>

906
01:18:02,443 --> 01:18:07,310
<i>Of the man to whom I belong.</i>

907
01:18:10,079 --> 01:18:14,673
<i>When he takes me in his arms</i>

908
01:18:14,837 --> 01:18:17,521
<i>He speaks to me in a low voice,</i>

909
01:18:17,676 --> 01:18:21,736
<i>I see life as if it were rose-tinted.</i>

910
01:18:21,897 --> 01:18:25,619
<i>He whispers words of love</i>

911
01:18:25,773 --> 01:18:28,874
<i>Words of the everyday</i>

912
01:18:29,036 --> 01:18:33,096
<i>And that does something to me.</i>

913
01:18:33,258 --> 01:18:37,317
<i>He has entered into my heart</i>

914
01:18:37,517 --> 01:18:40,199
<i>A piece of happiness</i>

915
01:18:40,393 --> 01:18:44,498
<i>the cause of which I know.</i>

916
01:18:44,653 --> 01:18:47,720
<i>It's him for me, me for him</i>

917
01:18:47,876 --> 01:18:50,410
<i>In life</i>

918
01:18:50,602 --> 01:18:54,432
<i>He said that to me, swore to me</i>

919
01:18:54,592 --> 01:18:59,537
<i>Forever</i>

920
01:19:01,155 --> 01:19:05,826
<i>And as soon as I see him</i>

921
01:19:05,989 --> 01:19:08,905
<i>So I feel in me</i>

922
01:19:09,098 --> 01:19:14,502
<i>My heart which beats</i>

923
01:19:19,229 --> 01:19:22,219
<i>May the nights of love never end</i>

924
01:19:22,375 --> 01:19:25,673
<i>A great joy which takes its place</i>

925
01:19:25,830 --> 01:19:29,006
<i>The trouble, the grief are removed</i>

926
01:19:29,246 --> 01:19:32,924
<i>Content, content to die of it</i>

927
01:19:33,121 --> 01:19:36,646
<i>to die of it</i>

928
01:19:38,839 --> 01:19:43,204
<i>When he takes me in his arms</i>

929
01:19:43,367 --> 01:19:46,237
<i>He speaks to me in a very low voice,</i>

930
01:19:46,398 --> 01:19:50,273
<i>I see life as if it were rose-tinted.</i>

931
01:19:50,465 --> 01:19:54,024
<i>He whispers words of love</i>

932
01:19:54,226 --> 01:19:57,293
<i>Words of the everyday</i>

933
01:19:57,450 --> 01:20:01,433
<i>And that does something to me.</i>

934
01:20:01,594 --> 01:20:05,273
<i>He has entered into my heart</i>

935
01:20:05,433 --> 01:20:08,455
<i>A piece of happiness</i>

936
01:20:08,656 --> 01:20:12,716
<i>the cause of which I recognise.</i>

937
01:20:12,878 --> 01:20:15,977
<i>It's him for me, me for him</i>

938
01:20:16,139 --> 01:20:18,505
<i>in life.</i>

939
01:20:18,670 --> 01:20:23,079
<i>He said that to me, swore to me</i>

940
01:20:23,236 --> 01:20:26,457
<i>forever.</i>

941
01:20:30,068 --> 01:20:34,936
<i>And as soon as I see him</i>

942
01:20:35,096 --> 01:20:37,813
<i>So do I feel in me</i>

943
01:20:37,973 --> 01:20:43,759
<i>My heart which beats</i>

944
01:20:43,923 --> 01:20:46,791
La la la...

945
01:21:14,237 --> 01:21:15,460
- Where is he?
- Who?

946
01:21:15,619 --> 01:21:18,413
- The manager.
- I don't know.

947
01:21:49,504 --> 01:21:51,489
I lost it, earlier on.

948
01:21:51,652 --> 01:21:55,211
- What? Your lucky charm?
- Yes, near the door.

949
01:21:55,376 --> 01:21:58,366
And now I know
he knew everything.

950
01:21:58,521 --> 01:22:00,933
- Who?
- His Excellency.

951
01:22:01,092 --> 01:22:03,931
Or rather... the "gentlemen".

952
01:22:12,105 --> 01:22:15,903
- Everything is paid for, even the champagne.
- We start on the 1st.

953
01:22:16,057 --> 01:22:18,700
Great, we'll stay here.

954
01:22:18,860 --> 01:22:22,113
- What did he say?
- To leave them alone.

955
01:22:22,276 --> 01:22:24,992
Okay, who cares?
We'll leave you alone.

956
01:22:27,455 --> 01:22:30,752
Up there, he told me
I'd get my miracle.

957
01:22:30,910 --> 01:22:35,625
You poor kid... you're tired.
You're going home to sleep.

958
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:39,003
You'll see how everything
will be better for us now.

959
01:22:39,198 --> 01:22:41,687
He said that, too.

960
01:22:41,845 --> 01:22:43,602
To each their own Heaven.

961
01:22:43,685 --> 01:22:46,784
<i>That's the reason why</i>

962
01:22:46,824 --> 01:22:50,520
<i>we listen to accordions.</i>

963
01:22:50,539 --> 01:22:53,515
<i>That's the reason why</i>

964
01:22:53,611 --> 01:22:57,570
<i>the street bursts into song.</i>

965
01:22:58,067 --> 01:23:00,491
<i>The sorrow of souls
drowned in sound</i>

966
01:23:00,588 --> 01:23:03,636
<i>is heard no more.</i>

967
01:23:03,684 --> 01:23:05,485
<i>Cupid celebrates</i>

968
01:23:05,509 --> 01:23:07,185
<i>and it's mad for us all.</i>

969
01:23:07,198 --> 01:23:10,521
<i>There's the heart
that you want.</i>

970
01:23:10,527 --> 01:23:12,834
<i>That's the reason why</i>

971
01:23:12,837 --> 01:23:17,004
<i>we listen to accordions.</i>

972
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:20,217
<i>That's the reason why</i>

973
01:23:23,111 --> 01:23:23,113
<i>the street bursts into song.</i>
