V. Yatautis, and others

27
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,270
You know,

28
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,000
For the first time it's so
hard to send you to sea.

29
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,900
Though today for the first time my
ship will have a ceremonious sendoff.

30
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
Of course.

31
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,500
The whole nation will see you on TV.

32
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,600
But understand me, Ray -

33
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,200
I can't be there any more.

34
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,500
Nine years I'm seeing you off to sea!

35
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,280
You leave, and I stay here, alone,

36
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,900
to wander around an empty house.

37
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Have you been thinking this way for long?

38
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,600
No.

39
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,900
I don't know.

40
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,600
Here is exactly how much you need.

41
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,100
I changed what's inside.

42
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,200
Now it's tuned to the Archelon's frequency.

43
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,400
Leave it always turned on.

44
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:50,100
When we are returning,
I'll play this recording.

45
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Listen:

46
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,800
Time to announce 2-hour
warning to cast off!

47
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Just never adjust the frequency,
and never turn it off.

48
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,700
I'll be waiting for you the whole time.

49
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,300
End farewells, crew below!

50
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,810
Don't worry. Everything will
be all right, I promise.

51
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,360
At least it will be fun for me!

52
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,000
What moved you to join this voyage?

53
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,300
The Navy Department approached
the Psychology Association

54
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,300
and its proposal astonished me

55
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,800
and it interested me, too.

56
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,120
Specifically, I'm interested
in interpersonal relationships

57
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,100
in a closed environment.

58
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:24,000
Ergonomics, how man chafes
against the machine,

59
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,400
You're going to study our consciousness.

60
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,900
I don't study consciousness,
but rather human behavior.

61
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,100
I read your book on psychological systems.

62
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:41,500
Nonsense, I know warriors don't read books.

63
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:46,200
Your ideas on man and
society are controversial.

64
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,800
Maybe.

65
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,300
I think they contain a threat to society.

66
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:58,600
You suffer from too narrow
a professional specialty.

67
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,910
Maybe you don't understand the humanities.

68
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I hate them.

69
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,500
The first four silos are not to
be opened even in event of war

70
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
and this is your personal cipher code.

71
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:22,860
Installation of biomaterials
on this submarine

72
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:31,400
is classified top secret and is revealed
on this ship only to you, Dr. Kokoleinen.

73
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,480
All hands to general quarters!

74
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,500
That's for later.

75
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,710
I wish to report to you that four missiles

76
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,730
aboard Archelon have a special purpose.

77
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,270
Even if they are shot down,

78
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,300
the payload will be delivered
and hit the target.

79
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,200
How to avoid...

80
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,620
I know that. I know. I think
we need to decide to expand

81
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:50,700
the program for modernization
of strategic forces

82
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,300
in the Adriatic.

83
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,400
Of course.

84
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,500
We should continue, full speed ahead,

85
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,800
with creating qualitatively
new systems, nuclear...

86
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,040
as well as more powerful
destructive weapons.

87
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,200
I envy you, Commodore. You may
have a chance take my place,

88
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,720
but I'll never have the chance
to command your vessel.

89
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,070
Permit me, Commodore, to remind you,

90
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:45,000
that over half of our
offensive strategic potential

91
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,100
is found in the ocean.

92
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,300
And on your submarine raider we place

93
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,400
especial hopes.

94
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,500
Remember, Commodore.

95
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,890
The ocean is the beam balance of the earth.

96
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,630
Your Tomahawk is the weight that
allows us to keep the scales balanced.

97
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,700
Hello, Nika!

98
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,500
Hello, come in! The broadcast has started.

99
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,600
Dear TV Viewers, this is a historic day.

100
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:49,500
The newest strategic missile submarine
goes on its maiden patrol today.

101
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,940
You will watch enviously as it goes to sea.

102
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:58,300
Inside this god of war, which can travel
underwater as fast as an express train,

103
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,500
are twenty-four missile silos,

104
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,100
and in them 24 ballistic missiles,

105
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,090
and each of them has 12 nuclear warheads.

106
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,200
This is the newest warship, and
it is specially assigned to

107
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:15,993
Commodore Rayflint,
at 33 the youngest

108
00:15:16,006 --> 00:15:19,400
commanding officer of a
ballistic missile sub.

109
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,810
Your husband is a real sea lord.
Is he the same way at home?

110
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,400
Oh, no. At home he's just himself.

111
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,500
They say all submariners - their
wives truly love them. Is that true?

112
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,600
I suppose.

113
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
What - and yours?

114
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,000
Yes, of course.

115
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:50,440
Life is iron in magnetic fields.

116
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,550
Constant stress, sensory deprivation.

117
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:00,588
Just one volley from Archelon
can turn an entire country

118
00:16:00,601 --> 00:16:04,500
to ashes, like Poland, or
Greece with all its islands.

119
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,940
Ladies and gentlemen, at this
time I am aboard the Archelon,

120
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,700
an underwater fortress in our defenses.

121
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,300
You can't hide the fact that no other
ship cost our nation this much.

122
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,900
But peace on our planet is worth much more.

123
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And God will help us!

124
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,900
The launcher is equipped with a handle

125
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,500
that resembles the butt of a Colt .45

126
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,200
except that butt has no barrel.

127
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,300
So, I squeeze the launch button, and...

128
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,900
Our civilization is the
evolution of smokes,

129
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,500
from cannon gunsmoke to the
mushroom cloud of an atomic blast.

130
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
The planet's hour of judgment

131
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,100
is marked by a launching relay.

132
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,800
The ICBM aims at a point on a trajectory
known only to an electronic memory.

133
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,540
The warheads split up, each
aimed at its own city.

134
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,088
and they carry under their
cones multiple weapons so an

135
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:18,600
enemy's territory can be
covered with a nuclear carpet.

136
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,000
That's what a nuclear attack looks like.

137
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,800
But don't worry, it's not a war.

138
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
We only showed you underwater tests.

139
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,390
At present Archelon has set course
for an island in the Atlantic

140
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,000
for topping off its food supplies

141
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,100
and a brief shore leave for the crew.

142
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,700
They should take us to that little island!

143
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,500
Russian ships, sir.

144
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,600
Helm, depth under the keel?

145
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,400
Hundred forty feet.

146
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,000
Crash dive.

147
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,900
Aye aye.

148
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,400
Evasive maneuvers.

149
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,300
Welllll....

150
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:24,500
I swear, Hippocrates! Even this hole
seems like a corner of paradise.

151
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:31,500
So, where did you hurt yourself?
Look - here -

152
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,600
I just need to wipe it with gasoline.

153
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,300
Doc, it's time for you to go.

154
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,300
Magda!

155
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I don't like it here.

156
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,950
But I just got here! It's fun here!

157
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,280
Meat's burning somewhere.

158
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,000
Nothing to worry about.

159
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:46,090
Temporary atrophy of
temperature and pain nerves.

160
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,600
A loss of sensation.

161
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,200
Not a threat to loving relations.

162
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,500
This is bad. Since reactor startup

163
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,700
the biosafety shield is failing.

164
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,800
Our steward is covered
with bronze-colored spots.

165
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Take a seat.

166
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,480
The bioshielding is nominal. An
hour ago I checked it personally.

167
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,600
Maybe confine him to sickbay?

168
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,900
Not necessary.

169
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,500
Why not?

170
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:54,140
I can't drive the ship from sickbay.

171
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,590
Radiogram to the chief of naval operations:

172
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:15,000
1-6-3-1-1-4-9-3-4-1-2-1-5-3-5-4 4-1-8-2-2

173
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:27,100
To: Submarine raider, 1900 be in quadrant
37-40, transfer to helicopter container

174
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,100
of atmospheric samples from compartments.

175
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,500
Hello, Flaggi? - Yes?

176
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,700
Have you decided to marry me yet?

177
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,900
Not yet.

178
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Too bad.

179
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:54,100
I keep telling you that
submariners are kamikazes.

180
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,970
Something wrong with Barney?

181
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,500
Not just with him.

182
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,600
Talk to me, for God's sake.

183
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,100
Not over the phone.

184
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,600
Then get over here, now!

185
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,700
Can't right now. I'll come when I can.

186
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,800
As a result of bacteriological
analysis of the biosamples

187
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,300
we observed a bacillus of a
disease unknown to science.

188
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,010
The symptoms resemble leprosy.

189
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:17,100
Probably in conditions of weak
radiation from the reactor,

190
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,860
for some reason a new breed
of microorganism emerged.

191
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:27,220
It's impossible to foresee the danger to
the world of contact with new viruses

192
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,780
with Earth, with mankind.
It's a genie in a bottle.

193
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:35,320
Therefore, contact between the
crew and land must be precluded.

194
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,740
You want to send to the bottom
an entire missile platform.

195
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,300
The essence of my suggestion
boils down to this:

196
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:50,400
in an old, abandoned concentration
camp in the Shedrups, organize

197
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,600
something like a leper colony
for the infected crew.

198
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,510
The only problem left is what
to do with the submarine.

199
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,100
Can it be disinfected?

200
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,200
Full disinfection of
Archelon is impossible.

201
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,900
Everything inside would
have to be replaced.

202
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,160
I demand at least a partial disinfection.

203
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,900
A strategic nuclear
vessel should be at sea.

204
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,100
With a new crew?

205
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,700
Then you'll have to have to find
yet another uninhabited island.

206
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,700
You don't realize what damage you are
doing to the fleet's offensive ability

207
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,230
by removing a strategic nuclear
sub from combat patrol.

208
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,800
Let's have the opinion of everyone here.

209
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,740
By old fleet tradition, the
most junior goes first.

210
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Captain O'Gregory of the Medical Service?

211
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:49,200
It seems to me senseless to
relieve the Archelon's crew.

212
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,400
There's something to that.

213
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,800
How does the disease affect

214
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,300
the victim's ability to work?

215
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,900
Practically not at all.

216
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,710
Based on our data the victims retain
full mental and physical capacity.

217
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,600
Though, many will show external symptoms.

218
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,300
Well, that's just esthetics.

219
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,900
In O'Gregory's proposal I see a solution.

220
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,600
Archeolon's energy source is
designed to last five years

221
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:29,130
of continuous service, so we
have time to find an antidote.

222
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:33,530
If the crew is at sea for some time

223
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,100
we won't need a leper colony,

224
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,870
we won't have to disinfect, and
our defenses will remain stable.

225
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,410
But people are suffering.

226
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,600
They are military people, Professor.

227
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,500
Monstrous.

228
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:09,070
Where is our democracy?

229
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,400
I request permission to take my seat.

230
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,500
Be seated, Major.

231
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,200
At least let them choose for themselves!

232
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:24,930
Either an island, or the ocean!

233
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
The leadership on humanitarian
principles proposes for your

234
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,800
consideration the following options:

235
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,300
One: proceed to North
Atlantic, to Shedrup Island

236
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:39,800
for isolation of infected
crewmen in quarantine hospitals

237
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:43,500
with transfer of ship to disinfection crew.

238
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,700
Two: proceed to station
to conduct combat patrol.

239
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:52,600
Following discovery of effective
treatment, return to base.

240
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:59,600
If you select option two,
rate of pay will be doubled.

241
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,740
Roop, set course for the North
Atlantic, Shedrup Island.

242
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,500
Roop, come in.

243
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:32,030
Attention, all hands of Archelon.

244
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:38,420
We're transmitting a special program
from your relatives and family members.

245
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:44,300
We're all proud of your courage, my dear.

246
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:49,100
And believe God won't abandon you.

247
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:53,300
Don't despair, don't give up.

248
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,400
How do you feel, Ray?

249
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,850
I'm so sorry for you.

250
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,700
Forgive me.

251
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,940
Hi, dear! I already miss you!

252
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,860
Now that you are on the main
battle line with the Red Menace,

253
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,770
we, your girlfriends, will do everything

254
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:23,300
to help you defeat the Evil Empire.

255
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:28,300
Barney, my dear, don't despair.

256
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,000
Don't think that you're already dead.

257
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,600
Even if you feel a bit sick.

258
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,100
Remember, I told you I'm happy...

259
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:58,300
You came to observe life in
an artificial environment.

260
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,200
Habits form a basis for appreciation.

261
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:09,000
What sort of habits? For all time,
a woman on board is bad luck.

262
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,870
That is subordinated to an ancient
code: enjoy life while you're alive.

263
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
As an idea, that's "moment de more".

264
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,600
I remember, of death.

265
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,900
That's the most characteristic
thing in group behavior

266
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
in a man-machine system.

267
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,800
It resembles crowning the insane.

268
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,400
Alas.

269
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:04,000
I elicit human reserves to operate
machinery under extreme conditions.

270
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:11,560
We should also offer
some sort of usefulness.

271
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,800
Off-duty personnel,
report to the upper deck!

272
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:37,300
Understand: either this
Riviera, or the ocean.

273
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:42,500
If the second choice, we'll be paid double.

274
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,200
The ocean!

275
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,680
All hands below deck!

276
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,200
There!

277
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:34,600
Hey, cutie! Why are you still red-headed?

278
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,200
And maybe you brought us this leprosy!

279
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,610
Look at her! Not one spot!

280
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,700
Get her off the ship!

281
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,840
Where is she?

282
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Open it!

283
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,100
Very well, sir.

284
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,400
Give me a pill for my headache.

285
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,440
I, the medical officer of
Archelon, reveal a secret.

286
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,700
God.

287
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:40,500
I alone in the crew knew that
among the missile warheads aboard

288
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:45,600
four contain very dangerous
bacteriological weapons.

289
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
They are loaded with arenaviruses.

290
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:53,100
Obviously the seals failed
and a leak has occured.

291
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:58,440
My mind no longer allows me to
perform my control functions.

292
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
It's hopeless.

293
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,200
I've taken potassium cyanide.

294
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,463
Attention: launch of
missiles 1 through 4 is

295
00:43:22,476 --> 00:43:24,450
authorized only on
receipt of signal "Good"

296
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,300
Roop, we need to completely
seal silos 1 through 4.

297
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,340
1, 2, 3, 4 - best just to weld them shut.

298
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,000
Weld? But they're aimed at Moscow!

299
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:47,900
Weld them. Weld them shut. Their
missiles aren't combat ready.

300
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,600
Wouldn't it be simpler to
disarm them in a safe zone?

301
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:55,000
Don't ask pointless questions.What
the hell is a safe zone?

302
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:59,100
For these missiles there are no safe zones.

303
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,200
To Raider Commander:

304
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:08,760
Proceed to quadrant 23-15.
Upon arrival dock with barge.

305
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,900
Take on board food supplies.

306
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:15,300
After loading, submerge and
proceed to patrol station and

307
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:18,300
carry out your orders.

308
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I beg you.

309
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:39,700
Please, any psalm for the
soul of the murdered.

310
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:43,060
neither Christ nor Mohammed.

311
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:46,090
If it's nice, I'll forget everything.

312
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,600
Holy Father, any kind of psalm?

313
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:51,200
I'm not a holy father.

314
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:54,890
I beg of you. She was guilty of nothing.

315
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,400
I'm sorry, but I don't know any psalms.

316
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,600
Marry us. By proxy.

317
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:08,400
No. I should first hear her agreement.

318
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:11,500
She agrees! She agrees! She agrees!

319
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,130
She had that job because she
didn't have a great life.

320
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,130
And you'll hear her agreement.

321
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:22,200
It's also impossible because I cannot
conjure the souls of the dead!

322
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,300
But try!

323
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,570
I beg you.

324
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,600
All right.

325
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:34,700
I'll do as you ask.

326
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:44,020
You wanted to see Katarina.

327
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,800
There she is.

328
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,600
Marry us.

329
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:11,530
Marry us.

330
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:19,470
Join your hands, my children.

331
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,400
Whoever plows the seas,
joins with good fortune,

332
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:29,300
for him the world dawns, and
he reaps without sowing, for

333
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,660
the sea is the field of hope.

334
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:50,510
Rejoice, my children!

335
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,650
I request assignment to the loading party.

336
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,500
A little air.

337
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:33,550
Listen closely to me, calm down!

338
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:37,830
It's not leprosy on the Archelon.
It's an unknown disease with no cure.

339
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,400
Archelon is buried at sea.

340
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,800
I hope you understand that
this is for your ears only.

341
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,200
The signal is his signal.
They're coming back!

342
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,300
Give me the keys!

343
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,400
My dear!

344
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:59,000
At the base, all radio equipment
operates on that frequency!

345
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:51,100
My wife was guilty of nothing.
Hear that, you bastard?

346
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Go there, and give her my greetings!

347
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:03,140
All hands below decks!

348
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,860
Get back!

349
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:31,500
Archelon has turned into a
giant underwater leper colony.

350
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,600
We were informed of this by the wife
of one of the infected crewmen.

351
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:38,200
To save the sick crew, the nation's best
scientific minds have been mobilized.

352
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,340
In the microbiology center intense searches
are underway to find effective medicines.

353
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,200
Major O'Gregory!

354
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:08,700
Yes. - I hope you understand
what "top secret" means.

355
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:14,700
Not to mention the damage to morale

356
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:19,600
you inflicted on the fleet
before the whole world.

357
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:26,500
Revealing top secret information
is punishable by life in prison,

358
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:33,400
and in the event of severe damage to
national security, the death penalty.

359
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,600
O'Gregory, I'm very sorry
this all happened this way.

360
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:51,400
I always considered you
an outstanding worker.

361
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:58,100
However, you have a chance, not
only to avoid a court martial,

362
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
but even to continue your career honorably.

363
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:06,100
Aboard Archelon the diving medical
officer position is vacant.

364
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,500
Think about it, O'Gregory.

365
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:11,980
You'll not only avoid shame,
you'll become a national hero.

366
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:16,060
The whole world will know about the
noble act of a military doctor.

367
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:21,000
In time, they'll find a vaccine,
and you'll return triumphantly.

368
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,200
This disease is incurable.

369
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:28,300
Only the Lord God can make
such a catogorical statement.

370
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:33,400
Make up your mind, O'Gregory:
electric chair or hero's laurels.

371
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,400
I agree.

372
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:39,200
Then sign this.

373
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:49,500
However, if the disease really
turns out to be incurable,

374
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:56,800
as they say, in such cases, medicine will
render merciful aid to the afflicted.

375
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,600
Yes, sir.

376
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:58,600
This steel tomb is starting
to get on my nerves.

377
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,070
Do you want some fresh air?

378
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,200
Mm-hm.

379
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:13,300
Let's go.  To the bridge.

380
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,400
The former wife of the commander
of Archelon, Nika Rayflint,

381
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:24,100
left today on her honeymoon with
a petroleum king from Abu Dhabi.

382
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:33,200
Receive Aesculapius! But your wives...

383
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:47,990
Commander,

384
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Underwater contact.

385
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:58,900
Most likely a foreign submarine.

386
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,200
Russian?

387
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,400
In any case not one of our types.

388
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:14,100
Hard to port!

389
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,500
Make our depth one thousand feet.
Evasive maneuvers!

390
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:36,000
God resides in the ocean,

391
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:39,100
and that means under water.

392
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,620
Hear that? That's the ocean itself.

393
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:11,400
Our common primogenitor.

394
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:14,000
All the salt we carry in our blood

395
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:16,600
is trying to tell us something.

396
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:20,200
It's possible to reason, to caution...

397
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,600
the ocean for ages feeding
billions of people...

398
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:30,300
so choose between
unacceptable life or death.

399
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:34,800
We've drifted too far.

400
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:37,250
Do you hear that?

401
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,800
That's the cry of dolphins.

402
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:43,600
They say they don't destroy each other.

403
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,200
They're not as stupid as we are.

404
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:47,800
Haven't you noticed?

405
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,500
The dolphin's profile resembles Socrates.

406
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:57,300
Maybe.

407
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:06,100
Dolphins mask screw noises well.

408
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
That's a pod of dolphins. They've
followed us almost since we left home.

409
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,600
I'm starting to tell them
apart by their voices.

410
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,200
That one - I call him Teddy.

411
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,200
You're wrong.  His name is Delph.

412
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:32,500
In Socrates' language,
that means "brother."

413
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:36,100
How do you know his name?

414
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,200
He's my dolphin.  I gave him his name.

415
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:48,400
So, maybe he's following you?

416
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,400
Following me.

417
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:58,100
I once studied problems
of biological regulation.

418
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,000
We also carried out special assignments.

419
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:09,500
Instead of torpedoes, we had dolphins.

420
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,200
It was a dirty game.

421
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:18,620
And I got out of it just in time...

422
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:23,800
And I released them to the sea.

423
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:30,410
And I myself ended up  thrown overboard.

424
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,600
Once again your luck held.

425
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:37,200
Commander, it is my duty to warn
you that remaining at this depth

426
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:39,800
will be dangerous.

427
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:42,500
Something with the reactor?

428
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:48,000
Worse.  People are refusing to stand watch.

429
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,400
Surface.

430
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:06,400
We'll heave to.

431
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:12,500
Aye.  The stealth mode?

432
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:17,500
It's morning up there...sir.

433
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:20,100
Surface, Roop.

434
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:29,100
Today we celebrate

435
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:32,200
our patrol's first anniversary.

436
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,820
We'll invite guests to celebrate.

437
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Commander, bearing: starboard 20,

438
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:44,210
screw noises of a surface target.

439
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:15,300
Roop, how much longer can our reactor
run without replacing the uranium rods?

440
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:20,600
Two or three years.

441
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,800
Wonderful.

442
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:32,200
I want to know your opinion of my
plan to send a false signal - fire

443
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:36,300
in the reactor room, loss of propulsion

444
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:40,400
and helm, radiation level rising,

445
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:47,200
so easier to believe Archelon is dead.
They'll believe we no longer exist.

446
01:07:49,400 --> 01:08:02,700
2-3-8-9-47-9-82-47 6-8-1-2-1-43-4-2

447
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:08,800
Mr. Captain, lifeboat dead ahead.
Distress flares burning.

448
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
All stop.

449
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:51,500
Take me immediately to your captain.
Your liner is in grave danger.

450
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,400
Maybe your crew needs some rest.

451
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:56,000
No! - Then they can stay below.

452
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:58,300
No!  Where is your radio room?

453
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:07,500
We found the radio room.

454
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,600
Go!

455
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:39,200
Music.

456
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:58,900
Stop! Leave my wife alone!

457
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Save me!

458
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:08,130
I have 117 million dollars in the bank.
I'll give you half.

459
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,600
Just leave her alone.  She's unwell.

460
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:15,800
I'm also unwell. Very unwell.

461
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:22,600
I'll write you a check right now.

462
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:25,000
Just leave her be.

463
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:30,900
I'll dot the i on it, now move.

464
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:26,500
Fire control, salvo!

465
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:59,600
The death of Archelon and
disappearance of the liner

466
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,660
occurred along the boundary
of the Bermuda Triangle.

467
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,400
Those damned Bermudas again.

468
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:12,500
They're not that damned.

469
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,000
At least now the press will quiet down,

470
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,000
and stop making inquiries
of the government.

471
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:22,500
Yes, it couldn't have ended better.

472
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,000
The Archelon did its duty.

473
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:28,500
The Archelon can just...

474
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:32,100
Three years on combat
patrol is unprecedented.

475
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:35,600
I honestly didn't think
they would last that long.

476
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:40,600
Mr. Secretary, I assume
that Commodore Rayflint

477
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:43,800
deserves the Order of the
Naval Chevalier, First Rank.

478
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:46,000
Posthumously.

479
01:14:48,090 --> 01:14:51,090
No doubt.

480
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:34,100
Yes,you can experiment on people
here with no impediments.

481
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:36,200
Like in Vietnam.

482
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,400
That great cause.

483
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:53,300
Your observations, your chronicles - you'll
never get to transmit them to the living.

484
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:58,980
And I, the Biblical apostle

485
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:04,000
will depart this meaningless life.
I can say to humanity such words

486
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:09,000
that millions will bow before me!

487
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:12,390
And where am I, Mister
Captain of the Archelon?

488
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:21,600
Prophet - s'chrema k'itola
in the language of Christ -

489
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:40,300
There - the only creature in the
world that hasn't abandoned us.

490
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:50,250
It will be too bad if it
gets tangled in our screw.

491
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:07,200
Heroin?

492
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:09,700
Psychomemetic, with heroin.

493
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:14,360
Well, so, a good means.

494
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:16,360
Through the system.

495
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:18,700
Mainline it.

496
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,500
In three minutes everyone's asleep.

497
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:24,400
If we were smarter we'd have
used this rat trap long ago.

498
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:29,500
Why leave anyone alive?

499
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:15,610
I found here in the Bible the words

500
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:17,800
of St. Luke.

501
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:23,500
"You are as closed coffins,
in which people walk,

502
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:26,900
and know it not."

503
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:31,100
Verily, submarines are the

504
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:35,000
grave worms of humanity.

505
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,700
Today the weather is beautiful.

506
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:44,100
Our TV cameras will help you follow

507
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:46,200
the launch of the space ship.

508
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:48,300
Ladies and gentlemen,

509
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:52,690
at this hour I am at the launchng
pad of a manned space ship,

510
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:54,700
the Star of Bethlehem,

511
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:57,200
the front line of our space defense.

512
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:01,400
Space is the balance beam of peace.

513
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:05,900
The Star of Bethlehem is one of the
weights that maintains balance.

514
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:12,600
We with God's blessing reserve the
right to advance this policy,

515
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:15,000
without wavering.

516
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:20,100
Not one ship has cost our
nation as much as this one,

517
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:24,000
but peace on the planet...

518
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,200
They'll get another Archelon.

519
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:28,200
Only in space.

520
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:30,200
...and God will help us!

521
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,200
The whole operation should take
no longer than 30 minutes.

522
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:40,300
between launch and deployment of
warheads aimed at specific targets.

523
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
To achieve maximum effectiveness,

524
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
we are developing the so-called

525
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
stratum-rotator, that is,

526
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
it's proposed to operate in particular

527
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
strata of the cosmos as well as

528
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
on land masses.

529
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
The first space ship should smash

530
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
the first wave of missiles, easing

531
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,800
the task of the second, third and fourth.

532
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:02,300
In this manner we'll create a virtually

533
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:05,800
impenetrable defense network.

534
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:10,300
Fall asleep in silence,  awaken to thunder.

535
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:18,800
Life arose on Earth about
four billion years ago.

536
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,000
And man appeared

537
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:26,100
six hundred million years ago.

538
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:29,800
By some calculations, people

539
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:36,000
will inhabit Earth another
six billion years.

540
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,500
And that means we've  gone all of one meter

541
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:45,000
out of a ten kilometer distance.

542
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,600
Which awaits us to surmount

543
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:51,100
in our history.

544
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:59,100
I read a pile of this inspired crap,

545
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,500
and I'm stunned.

546
01:21:03,630 --> 01:21:06,400
How insignificant is man's self esteem!

547
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:09,180
And his life.

548
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:15,200
How senseless is his existence itself!

549
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:22,300
I came to an obvious conclusion.

550
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Humankind is an evolutionary dead end.

551
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:37,300
And man is a mistake of Nature.

552
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:42,500
He has no future.

553
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:48,500
He is doomed to birth and death.

554
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:54,400
Isn't it reasonable to assist evolution?

555
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:57,000
To start from scratch?

556
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Twelve missiles across Eurasia

557
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Twelve on the American continent.

558
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,000
A purifying flame will ignite and

559
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:11,300
the planet will be engulfed
by a fiery tornado.

560
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,500
There will be no beginning.

561
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:22,200
Nuclear winter will set in.

562
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:25,200
The Earth will be charred,

563
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:27,200
dead,

564
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:31,400
and that will end life,

565
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:34,100
the only,

566
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:36,600
the unrepeatable,

567
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:38,900
forever.

568
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:43,490
Human life is accidental
and devoid of purpose.

569
01:22:46,490 --> 01:22:51,500
love  of humanity, in general,

570
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:54,500
are Hamlet's question,

571
01:22:55,100 --> 01:23:01,700
moral ideals don't inspire anyone any more.

572
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,490
They are powerless before death.

573
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:13,000
All the more so that no
man's life is eternal.

574
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:17,800
It is broken off, by death.

575
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:23,600
While there is still life, there is hope.

576
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:29,500
Even the man powerless
before death has a purpose.

577
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:37,100
Man is the most unique creature.

578
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:44,100
And he is obliged to be aware
by what means he can or

579
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:46,100
cannot achieve his goals.

580
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:53,300
Obligation to know his
global, his cosmic purpose,

581
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:55,200
on Earth of his universe,

582
01:23:56,730 --> 01:24:00,200
Immortality, reason, and humaneness of man

583
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:03,670
are the immortality of humanity.

584
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:07,980
Its eternity.

585
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:13,600
You view yourself like
part of an endless world,

586
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:17,900
of a living, endless time.

587
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,600
And how do you view yourself?

588
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:27,700
An animal among animals?

589
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:31,800
And now you've torn everything
that tied you to life.

590
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:35,600
You've lost your purpose,

591
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:42,000
and become a blind, death-wielding force.

592
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:47,100
Death...

593
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:50,400
is not a bad thing.

594
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:34,100
You don't dare do that, Commodore!

595
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:39,500
I didn't invite you here
to engage in a discussion.

596
01:25:43,650 --> 01:25:46,650
I, Commodore Rayflint,

597
01:25:46,650 --> 01:25:49,650
was brought to life to save the planet.

598
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:55,100
From a mold named "mankind".

599
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:45,400
Commodore, the boat is losing
control and diving rapidly!

600
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:49,900
Danger! Water leak! 45-degree angle!

601
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:52,900
Commodore, Commodore! The trim, the trim!
Commodore!

602
01:28:52,970 --> 01:28:55,970
We're diving toward the bottom!
- Depth 600 feet.

603
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
One thousand two hundred feet.

604
01:28:58,100 --> 01:29:00,100
One thousand five hundred.

605
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:02,220
One thousand seven hundred!

606
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:03,300
One thousand eight...

607
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:18,600
THE END
