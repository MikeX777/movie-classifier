1
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:22,602
Passed year 2000. No problems.

2
00:00:25,003 --> 00:00:26,269
There's disintegration.

3
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:30,335
The epicenter is in Japan, around 1570 AD.

4
00:00:30,603 --> 00:00:31,602
The Age of Civil Wars?

5
00:00:32,403 --> 00:00:34,402
This sure smells like a crime!

6
00:00:34,736 --> 00:00:35,802
Time Patrol Headquarters.

7
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,469
This is Patrol-tei T2327X.

8
00:00:38,536 --> 00:00:40,402
Rings-to-Storm.
Please reply.

9
00:00:43,136 --> 00:00:44,469
That's funny.

10
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,936
This isn't an area
with communications problems.

11
00:00:47,803 --> 00:00:49,469
Anyway, I'll go to the site.

12
00:00:58,537 --> 00:00:59,469
Autopilot.

13
00:00:59,737 --> 00:01:02,402

Roger.

15
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:06,802
Estimated time of arrival?

16
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,336
Scheduled to be one hour.

17
00:01:09,337 --> 00:01:12,536
Warning! Object at speed of light heading

Probability of contact within 25 seconds: 98%.

19
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:16,536
What?!

20
00:01:16,537 --> 00:01:17,802
Computer! Analysis!

21
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,336
Dimensional analysis.

00:01:19,337 --> 00:01:23,536

23
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:25,136
Trouble!

24
00:01:25,137 --> 00:01:27,802
Computer! Cancel auto-pilot!
Bring the controls here!

25
00:01:27,803 --> 00:01:28,469
Roger!

26
00:01:37,003 --> 00:01:39,202
Warning! Multiple objects at light speed...

27
00:01:39,203 --> 00:01:40,336
So, I've finally sighted you!

28
00:01:40,337 --> 00:01:42,402
Acceleration status check!
Current battle status reading!

29
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:49,569
Energy loss! Energy loss!

30
00:01:49,137 --> 00:01:50,536
Won't last at this rate!

31
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,469
I'm exiting into normal space.

32
00:01:53,337 --> 00:01:54,166
Engine gear!

33
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,536
It's do it or die!

34
00:02:08,604 --> 00:02:10,136
I wonder what age this is.

35
00:02:10,604 --> 00:02:11,536
Here.

<i>I'm looking forward to my future!

54
00:03:34,404 --> 00:03:37,003
Nowadays, TV games are so well done!

55
00:03:37,171 --> 00:03:38,336
It's that again!

56
00:03:38,737 --> 00:03:41,670
I'm pretty strong, aren't I?
Prepare yourself, Action Kamen!

57
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:45,536
A. B. B. A. A. B. B.
Right. Right. Left.

58
00:03:49,737 --> 00:03:51,670
No way! What was that?!

59
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:53,070
It's a special weapon!

60
00:03:56,071 --> 00:03:57,403
That's playing dirty!

61
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:58,803
It's the difference in ability.

62
00:04:00,537 --> 00:04:02,470
I guess you can't beat kids.

63
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:22,137
Get up already, you guys.

64
00:04:37,938 --> 00:04:40,003
No! No! It's all no good!

65
00:04:40,004 --> 00:04:42,137
I'm lucky I'm syill alive...

66
00:04:42,138 --> 00:04:44,670
but there isn't one system that works correctly.

67
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:47,803
Oh, and you know that while I'm doing
this, the past is in danger!

68
00:04:48,404 --> 00:04:49,537
Computer!

69
00:04:50,338 --> 00:04:51,470
This isn't going to work.

70
00:04:52,538 --> 00:04:53,337
Did it!

71
00:04:53,338 --> 00:04:55,403
I can use the Micro Machine and emergency kit!

72
00:04:55,404 --> 00:04:56,337
I'll get by with this somehow!

73
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,137
Eject Micro Machine!

74
00:05:00,604 --> 00:05:04,070
Sorry! I don't have any time today,
so bear with leftovers, okay?

75
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:05,537
Today?

76
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:07,737
Yesterday was like that, too!

77
00:05:07,871 --> 00:05:11,937
The reason you don't have any time
is because you overslept, isn't it?

78
00:05:17,405 --> 00:05:18,804
I love you, Misae.

79
00:05:19,271 --> 00:05:21,337
Really? What part of me were you attracted to?

80
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,004
That you're a bit forceful and playful?

81
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:26,274
I love the way you're so honest!

82
00:05:27,605 --> 00:05:30,004
I blame my own insecurities.

83
00:05:30,138 --> 00:05:31,670
Take that! Choco Missile!

84
00:05:32,671 --> 00:05:35,070
Kantamu Megaton Punch!

85
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:41,004
We did it, Kantamu Jr.!

86
00:05:41,138 --> 00:05:42,604
It's all because of you, John-san.

87
00:05:44,405 --> 00:05:48,270
John and Kantamu Jr. defeated
the mysterious robot, Karaku...

88
00:05:48,605 --> 00:05:49,670
but at this time, who could possibly...

89
00:05:50,698 --> 00:05:51,264
Oh?

90
00:05:52,138 --> 00:05:54,804
You don't have to watch anime
first thing in the morning.

91
00:05:54,871 --> 00:05:57,670
Hurry up and eat your breakfast,
or you'll be late to kindergarten.

92
00:05:57,738 --> 00:06:02,004
And Shiro is waiting for you
to take his breakfast to him!

93
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:04,437
First thing in the morning it's the
Old Lady Yak-Yak Monster.

94
00:06:14,671 --> 00:06:16,537
Now, hurry up and eat breakfast.

95
00:06:16,571 --> 00:06:19,271
Okay...
Save me, ButtFace Man!

96
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,271
What are you doing to Shinnosuke-kun?

97
00:06:21,538 --> 00:06:23,137
It's ButtFace Man!

98
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:25,937
What IS that?

99
00:06:26,538 --> 00:06:28,071
Shinnosuke-kun is a good boy!

100
00:06:28,072 --> 00:06:29,471
You shouldn't be mean to him!

101
00:06:31,138 --> 00:06:33,404
Okay! I get it.
Quit it, Shinnosuke!

102
00:06:33,472 --> 00:06:35,671
My name is ButtFace Man!

103
00:06:37,872 --> 00:06:39,137
I'm really going to get mad now.

104
00:06:40,672 --> 00:06:42,137
I'm mad now!

105
00:06:42,205 --> 00:06:45,137
Bishoujo Kamen Misalin, appears!

106
00:06:42,205 --> 00:06:45,137
{\an8}masked beautiful young girl

107
00:06:46,338 --> 00:06:48,937
As an adult, aren't you embarrassed
to be doing such things?

108
00:06:48,938 --> 00:06:50,737
Don't worry about it!

109
00:06:49,938 --> 00:06:52,804
Oh, I want to go to a world far away from here.

110
00:06:54,338 --> 00:06:57,337
If not that, at least let me have breakfast soon.

111
00:06:56,768 --> 00:06:57,871
Wait a minute!

112
00:06:58,138 --> 00:07:01,004
Don't you know what'll happen if you don't stop?

113
00:07:01,472 --> 00:07:03,804
Shinnosuke! Quit it!

114
00:07:12,005 --> 00:07:12,671
Lucky!

115
00:07:12,672 --> 00:07:15,071
It's a mammal!
I only have one chance.

116
00:07:15,072 --> 00:07:15,701
Contact!

117
00:07:17,572 --> 00:07:19,277
A... A...

118
00:07:20,672 --> 00:07:23,404
A E I U E O A O

119
00:07:23,405 --> 00:07:25,737
KA KE KI KU KE KO

120
00:07:25,738 --> 00:07:26,738
UNKO

121
00:07:28,272 --> 00:07:29,138
Hello?

122
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:30,071
Can you hear me?

123
00:07:30,472 --> 00:07:31,938
What year is this?

124
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:35,271
I'm "Rings to Storm" of the Time Patrol.

125
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:37,404
I'm borrowing your body for just a while.

126
00:07:37,672 --> 00:07:38,871
Please try and answer.

127
00:07:41,872 --> 00:07:45,204
Hmm... that's funny...
Did I mess up "contact"?

128
00:07:45,472 --> 00:07:47,138
Oh no! This is a dog, isn't it?!

129
00:07:47,672 --> 00:07:50,471
Shin-chan, after you eat breakfast,
bring some to Shiro too, okay?

130
00:07:50,472 --> 00:07:51,604
Oka~y!

131
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:54,004
Shiro! Shiro! Shiro!
Thanks for waiting!

132
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:55,738
Shiro, good morning!

133
00:07:56,072 --> 00:07:58,404
Here's breakfast. Eat hearty!

134
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:01,404
Before that, I have something I want to tell you.

135
00:08:01,739 --> 00:08:02,338
What?

136
00:08:04,205 --> 00:08:07,404
Um... A dog talks and you're not surprised?

137
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:12,871
Wa~h! Shi-- Shiro spoke!

138
00:08:12,872 --> 00:08:14,871
You don't have to be that surprised.

139
00:08:16,005 --> 00:08:18,138
So my name is Shiro, right?

140
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:21,671
Huh? Shiro's talking.

141
00:08:22,339 --> 00:08:24,471
It seems our conversation is just puzzling.

142
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,538
Puzzling. Not Nuzzling.

143
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:29,871
You, is your mother or father at home?

144
00:08:29,872 --> 00:08:31,604
I have something important to say.

145
00:08:31,805 --> 00:08:32,471
Huh?

146
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:34,671
Shiro! Did you forget my name?

147
00:08:34,672 --> 00:08:37,738
What happened to our friendship!?

148
00:08:37,272 --> 00:08:38,071
I can't breathe!

149
00:08:38,072 --> 00:08:39,605
Your name is?

150
00:08:39,939 --> 00:08:43,271
My name is Shinnosuke Nohara.
A 5 year old who's a bit on the shy side.

151
00:08:43,506 --> 00:08:45,271
That's was it, Shinnosuke-kun.

152
00:08:45,706 --> 00:08:46,671
What's wrong?

153
00:08:46,939 --> 00:08:48,271
You're acting like a stranger!

154
00:08:48,406 --> 00:08:51,938
It's between you and me!
You can call me Shin-chan!

155
00:08:53,206 --> 00:08:53,871
Shin-chan?

156
00:08:54,406 --> 00:08:56,471
Wha~t?

157
00:08:57,939 --> 00:08:59,205
There. Forget anything?

158
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:00,538
Nope. Nothing. Thank you.

159
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:03,205
Mom! Dad!
Shiro said he wants to talk!

160
00:09:03,206 --> 00:09:05,138
Sorry, but Dad has work.

161
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:07,338
And you go get ready for kindergarten, too.

162
00:09:08,806 --> 00:09:09,871
I have something to tell you.

163
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:12,138
Shiro!

164
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:12,871
Spoke!

165
00:09:13,672 --> 00:09:14,671
Thank goodness.

166
00:09:14,739 --> 00:09:18,471
It seems that I've come across someone
who can carry a normal conversation,
unlike Shin-chan.

167
00:09:19,472 --> 00:09:21,538
I'm not all that...

168
00:09:21,606 --> 00:09:23,605
I'm not praising you though...

169
00:09:23,606 --> 00:09:24,138
Huh?

170
00:09:25,206 --> 00:09:26,938
So let's clear this up.

171
00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:32,205
You are an employee of the Time
Patrol from the 30th century.

172
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:35,938
Your machine broke down, is buried
in the ground under Shiro's doghouse,
and you can't move it.

173
00:09:36,072 --> 00:09:38,538
So you borrowed Shiro's body,
and are talking to us.

174
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:39,805
And, the reason for all of this is...

175
00:09:39,873 --> 00:09:44,805
In Japan's Age of Civil Wars, something
is scheming to destroy something.

176
00:09:45,673 --> 00:09:46,805
Is that right?

177
00:09:47,406 --> 00:09:48,205
That's it!

178
00:09:48,539 --> 00:09:51,338
Wow! You're amazing, Dad!

179
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,378
I'm not all that...

180
00:09:52,473 --> 00:09:54,472
At this point, I have a request.

181
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:58,072
I would like you to go to the
Age of Civil Wars with me.

182
00:09:58,739 --> 00:09:59,538
Us?

183
00:09:59,739 --> 00:10:01,205
To the Age of Civil Wars?

184
00:10:01,473 --> 00:10:05,738
To pick up some older chicks and
go to a disco together and...

185
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,538
That's not what we're saying!
Not what we're saying!

186
00:10:09,873 --> 00:10:12,938
But I have to go to work before
we go to the past, and...

187
00:10:13,073 --> 00:10:15,938
Wouldn't it be better if you went to
the police for something like that?

188
00:10:15,939 --> 00:10:20,605
The Time Patrol hasn't been formed
in the 20th century yet.

189
00:10:20,673 --> 00:10:22,005
And if it's about time...

190
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,522
It's 7:50 am now.

191
00:10:24,673 --> 00:10:28,805
If we leave soon, investigate the
Age of Civil Wars together...

192
00:10:28,806 --> 00:10:34,138
Get back at this age's 7:55 am...
In actuality it's only been 5 minutes...

193
00:10:34,273 --> 00:10:35,805
You won't even be late to work.

194
00:10:36,806 --> 00:10:39,405
I'm just not that hot about science fiction.

195
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:42,672
I love it!
Action Kamen and Kantamu Robot!

196
00:10:42,739 --> 00:10:44,472
That's not science fiction.

197
00:10:44,539 --> 00:10:47,339
That's just a special hero film
and a big robot anime.

198
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,272
You're really a fanatic, huh dad?

199
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,872
Anyway, what will we get from helping you?

200
00:10:54,073 --> 00:10:57,605
If you just let this alone,
the whole world will be in chaos.

201
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,939
Your existence will no longer be guaranteed!

202
00:11:02,606 --> 00:11:07,539
Please! Now that I've become Shiro,
you are the only ones I can believe in.

203
00:11:09,806 --> 00:11:11,939
I'm going to help Shiro!

204
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,969
- Shinnosuke!
- Shinnosuke.

205
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:15,939
Cuz me and Shiro are best friends!

206
00:11:16,806 --> 00:11:20,005
World peace doesn't mean
anything to our family.

207
00:11:20,273 --> 00:11:21,939
But since Shinnosuke says so,
guess we have no choice!

208
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,672
Let's go!

209
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,272
Here!

210
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,605
Then, I'll call the Emergency Time Machine.

211
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,272
Huh? What's going on, Shinnosuke?

212
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:40,939
Shinnosuke Nohara! Start to ready!

213
00:11:41,073 --> 00:11:43,272
You mean you're ready to start.

214
00:11:43,406 --> 00:11:46,139
Leave the Action Kamen Badge
and the Kantamu Robot.

215
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,539
No way! No! No! NO!

216
00:11:50,473 --> 00:11:52,072
I wonder if we're going to be alright?

217
00:11:52,807 --> 00:11:55,139
Then, I'll call the Emergency Time Machine.

218
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,206
Come out! Come out!
Time Machine!

219
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,872
...isn't necessary to say...

220
00:12:00,007 --> 00:12:02,139
But it makes everything feel more
exciting, don't you think?

221
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,739
Please put on the time suits that
are provided with those seats.

222
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,672
The passionate red for me!

223
00:12:12,673 --> 00:12:14,872
This is really like a serious
science fiction movie!

224
00:12:14,873 --> 00:12:15,672
Yes!

225
00:12:15,373 --> 00:12:16,302
{\an8}[ Time Patrol ]

226
00:12:16,807 --> 00:12:17,872
But not really.

227
00:12:17,873 --> 00:12:20,606
THIS is a Time Patrol uniform?

228
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:21,939
It looks bad.

229
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:24,406
You look like Pyonkichi, Shinnosuke.

230
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,739
It is formatted when you wear it.

231
00:12:26,807 --> 00:12:31,339
Later when we time travel, it has the ability
to turn into the right costume for the age.

232
00:12:31,807 --> 00:12:36,739
And Shin-chan's suit has a
built-in "3x Save" feature.

233
00:12:36,807 --> 00:12:40,472
Yell, "Save me kit," when you're
in trouble to activate it.

234
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,739
No! Don't say it!

235
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,039
Save me when you're in trouble to activate it!

236
00:12:45,007 --> 00:12:46,739
Nothing happened, Shiro.

237
00:12:46,873 --> 00:12:48,939
It's because you didn't say the keyword right.

238
00:12:49,473 --> 00:12:50,606
King War!

239
00:12:50,673 --> 00:12:51,606
What's that?

240
00:12:52,207 --> 00:12:54,606
We don't have time.
Let's leave right now!

241
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:56,806
You're such a cold dog.

242
00:12:57,673 --> 00:12:58,539
Are you prepared?

243
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,606
Yeah.

244
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,206
It's squishy, Shiro!

245
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,139
It's an emergency one, so bear it.

246
00:13:05,207 --> 00:13:06,206
We're taking off!

247
00:13:20,607 --> 00:13:22,073
I'll take a quick look.

248
00:13:22,874 --> 00:13:24,939
I wonder what's happened to Shin-chan?

249
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,206
There's no doubt. He overslept again.

250
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:31,339
How troublesome.
We're always late because of this stop.

251
00:13:31,674 --> 00:13:33,269
Good morning!

252
00:13:34,074 --> 00:13:35,273
Nohara-san!

253
00:13:35,807 --> 00:13:37,606
Good morning!

254
00:13:47,074 --> 00:13:48,406
I'm bored already.

255
00:13:48,607 --> 00:13:50,073
Hold on just a little bit longer.

256
00:13:50,074 --> 00:13:51,939
It's hot!
I want some ice!

257
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:52,873
There's nothing I can do.

258
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,673
I'm even beaten by this heat!

259
00:13:54,807 --> 00:13:57,873
And when I think that we have
to ride this on the way home...

260
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,939
It isn't going to be this machine
on the way home.

261
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:03,073
This is for emergencies.
It can only go one way.

262
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,273
Then how are we going to get back?

263
00:14:07,407 --> 00:14:09,873
We'll find out why the past is changing.

264
00:14:09,874 --> 00:14:11,673
And return it to the way it should be.

265
00:14:11,674 --> 00:14:13,406
And if we can't stop it?

266
00:14:13,474 --> 00:14:14,340
We can't go back.

267
00:14:14,941 --> 00:14:17,073
We haven't heard about that part!

268
00:14:44,941 --> 00:14:46,333
What is this place?

269
00:14:46,341 --> 00:14:48,323
It seems like the remains of a fire...

270
00:14:48,607 --> 00:14:52,206
More importantly, please change your clothes
quickly before anyone sees you!

271
00:14:52,607 --> 00:14:53,540
Oh, yeah.

272
00:14:53,741 --> 00:14:55,340
What am I supposed to do with this?

273
00:14:55,474 --> 00:14:56,873
Put the collar up.

274
00:14:57,207 --> 00:14:57,940
Collar?

275
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,073
Putting up the collar of a jersey?

276
00:15:02,674 --> 00:15:03,806
Looks bad...

277
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,607
What? This isn't a samurai.

278
00:15:16,674 --> 00:15:18,407
This isn't a princess!

279
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:22,807
It's a system that automatically determines
the most suitable clothes for a person.

280
00:15:23,074 --> 00:15:25,340
Dad, Mom, it's a stenching!

281
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:26,673
You mean it's stunning.

282
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,940
Guess this is it.

283
00:15:29,008 --> 00:15:29,740
Guess so.

284
00:15:32,874 --> 00:15:36,873
It's burnt down, now, but it seems
that they had very big buildings.

285
00:15:37,141 --> 00:15:39,073
Who~a! Nice view!

286
00:15:39,141 --> 00:15:40,273
Be careful, Shin-chan.

287
00:15:43,474 --> 00:15:45,073
What's this place called? What age?

288
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,407
The latter part of the 16th Century.

289
00:15:46,508 --> 00:15:48,473
What you would call the Age
of the Civil Wars, right?

290
00:15:48,741 --> 00:15:50,807
There are no differences in the coordinates...

291
00:15:51,008 --> 00:15:53,873
So this should be Kasukabe castle
in Musashi's Country, but...

292
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,807
That there was such a castle in Kasukabe...

293
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,473
But it's all burnt down...

294
00:15:59,874 --> 00:16:01,607
Well, it is the Age of Civil Wars.

295
00:16:02,074 --> 00:16:04,673
The aftermath of the dreams of warriors, eh?

296
00:16:09,674 --> 00:16:10,407
What's that?

297
00:16:10,741 --> 00:16:11,540
What's that sound?

298
00:16:17,474 --> 00:16:19,207
Hey, what are these guys?

299
00:16:19,474 --> 00:16:20,073
Dunno.

300
00:16:20,275 --> 00:16:21,207
"Dunno"?!

301
00:16:21,341 --> 00:16:23,140
You can't be saying that after bringing us here!

302
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:28,007
But I brought you here because I wanted
to know what was going on here!

303
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,074
That's so irresponsible!

304
00:16:30,075 --> 00:16:31,740
Anyway, please calm down!

305
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:47,674
It's a game, eh?
I'm good at that, too!

306
00:16:49,628 --> 00:16:51,124
There's no way it's a game!

307
00:16:53,408 --> 00:16:54,274
Umm...

308
00:16:54,275 --> 00:16:56,407
We aren't suspicious people.

309
00:16:56,407 --> 00:16:57,141
Right! Right!

310
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,474
Just a normal salary-man
and a normal housewife!

311
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:04,140
...and a good 5 year old kid and a kinda
strange dog that can speak.

312
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:05,740
Don't say unnecessary things!

313
00:17:09,475 --> 00:17:11,474
We actually weren't talking to you...

314
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,207
We'll apologize, if we bothered you.

315
00:17:18,608 --> 00:17:21,074
Let's not bring out those dangerous things...

316
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:22,474
Where did you buy those?

317
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:23,774
- How much?
- Quit it!

318
00:17:34,475 --> 00:17:35,607
What? What?

319
00:18:07,808 --> 00:18:08,674
My bag!

320
00:18:08,675 --> 00:18:10,007
Forget your stupid bag!

321
00:18:14,008 --> 00:18:15,041
I've been waiting.

322
00:18:16,342 --> 00:18:17,207
Waiting?

323
00:18:18,275 --> 00:18:19,541
I'm Fubukimaru.

324
00:18:20,075 --> 00:18:21,874
I am the heir of Hidetsuna.

325
00:18:22,008 --> 00:18:24,541
Katsuga Hougu no Kami, the lord of the
now destroyed Kasukabe Castle.

326
00:18:25,075 --> 00:18:28,524
You are the ones in the legends handed down
through the generations of the Katsuga family.

327
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:30,741
The "Three Heroes and One Dog", right?

328
00:18:31,742 --> 00:18:33,074
Who are you?

329
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,074
Why are you acting so big?

330
00:18:35,609 --> 00:18:38,741
And I can't understand what you're saying at all.

331
00:18:39,009 --> 00:18:39,741
What?

332
00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:42,274
We are that "Three Heroes and One Dog."

333
00:18:42,542 --> 00:18:45,274
We came from another world to meet you.

334
00:18:45,742 --> 00:18:47,741
This dogs speaks?

335
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:51,008
Whoa! It's not just a dog, is it?

336
00:18:51,209 --> 00:18:52,474
He's called Shiro!

337
00:18:57,675 --> 00:18:58,874
This one's name is Enji.

338
00:18:59,142 --> 00:19:01,674
He's got a rough temperament,
but he's this country's best horse.

339
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:05,008
I'm the Yochi-Enji
(kindergartener)
Shinnosuke Nohara.

340
00:19:05,142 --> 00:19:06,208
Nice to meet you.

341
00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:08,608
Hey.

342
00:19:10,142 --> 00:19:11,008
Forgive him.

343
00:19:11,409 --> 00:19:14,674
Since Enji is so high strung,
sometimes he jokes like...

344
00:19:17,475 --> 00:19:19,341
You're haughty for a horse.

345
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:22,008
I'll teach you that I'm more important.

346
00:19:22,275 --> 00:19:23,008
Stop it!

347
00:19:23,075 --> 00:19:24,808
Enji won't let anyone but me ride!

348
00:19:28,342 --> 00:19:29,741
Quit it! Calm down!

349
00:19:29,742 --> 00:19:32,674
Please! Hey! Enji!

350
00:19:33,075 --> 00:19:35,474
Hey, why did you say that?

351
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:37,074
Yeah, yeah!

352
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:39,808
That we're the "Three Heroes and One Dog."

353
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:41,208
More importantly, Shin-chan!

354
00:19:41,942 --> 00:19:42,941
It's okay!

355
00:19:43,076 --> 00:19:46,608
If you're surprised at things like
that, you won't last long.

356
00:19:46,676 --> 00:19:47,475
But..!

357
00:19:51,342 --> 00:19:51,941
See?

358
00:19:55,009 --> 00:19:56,141
Why do you turn red?

359
00:19:56,542 --> 00:19:57,275
Who knows?

360
00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:04,208
Though a small country, my father ruled it well.

361
00:20:04,342 --> 00:20:06,075
The people were without strife...

362
00:20:07,876 --> 00:20:10,608
Until that hateful Unkokusai
(SmellsLikePooPoo) arrived.

363
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:13,678
- Smells like poo poo?
- Smells like poo poo?

364
00:20:14,276 --> 00:20:16,541
Smells like poo~ poo~!

365
00:20:18,542 --> 00:20:21,275
Trapped by Katz, who uses strange magic...

366
00:20:21,342 --> 00:20:24,941
My lord Father and my lady Mother died,
and my younger sister was taken away.

367
00:20:26,276 --> 00:20:27,275
I cried.

368
00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:28,208
Cried and cried...

369
00:20:28,542 --> 00:20:30,008
Cried until I could cry no more.

370
00:20:32,276 --> 00:20:34,608
Then, I pledged to cry no more.

371
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:39,141
Until I could avenge my parents
and defeat Unkokusai.

372
00:20:40,076 --> 00:20:42,141
And save my sister!

373
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:44,675
It's already been one year since
the council has been restored.

374
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:46,942
The time has come!

375
00:20:47,676 --> 00:20:49,608
With you, I shall attack Unkokusai!

376
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:51,208
Unkokusai.

377
00:20:51,743 --> 00:20:52,942
Strange magic.

378
00:20:54,476 --> 00:20:55,342
Strange.

379
00:20:55,409 --> 00:20:56,408
Unkokusai.

380
00:20:56,409 --> 00:20:59,008
It's a name you really don't
want to say out loud, huh?

381
00:20:59,143 --> 00:20:59,675
Yes.

382
00:21:01,676 --> 00:21:02,208
What?

383
00:21:02,743 --> 00:21:03,542
What'll I do?

384
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:07,142
In the bag they just took! It had our
savings bank book and our hanko!

385
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:10,475
{\an8}<i>Hanko = Seal used instead of
signatures in Japan. Legally binding.

386
00:21:07,209 --> 00:21:08,008
What?

387
00:21:08,509 --> 00:21:11,342
Those guys just now...
were they Unkokusai's?

388
00:21:11,476 --> 00:21:13,075
Yes. They're his henchmen.

389
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,542
That's so.

390
00:21:15,143 --> 00:21:17,142
Why did you bring such things?

391
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:20,142
I thought it was dangerous to leave them
because we were leaving the house empty...

392
00:21:20,276 --> 00:21:22,675
What are you going to do?
That's everything we own!

393
00:21:22,676 --> 00:21:24,142
We can just get them back, then!

394
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:27,675
It's difficult to understand what
these people are talking about.

395
00:21:30,343 --> 00:21:31,408
What are you doing?

396
00:21:32,076 --> 00:21:34,408
I thought you were maybe a girl.

397
00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:35,675
But I found ball-balls.

398
00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:38,675
They were bigger than Daddy's.

399
00:21:39,143 --> 00:21:39,708
Eh?

400
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:43,042
Ah... I lost.

401
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:47,342
It's only natural I have them. I'm a man.

402
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:49,042
There, there.

403
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:52,742
I couldn't sense him coming closer at all.

404
00:21:54,276 --> 00:21:55,142
We can do it.

405
00:21:55,573 --> 00:21:59,075
Stinky! Stinky!
Horse's butt! Horse's butt!

406
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:17,675
My lord Father, my lady Mother,
I shall go now.

407
00:22:21,876 --> 00:22:23,342
Shin-chan, let's try really hard, okay?

408
00:22:23,543 --> 00:22:24,542
Try what?

409
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:25,609
"What"?

410
00:22:25,743 --> 00:22:27,675
We're going to Ukokusai place.

411
00:22:27,743 --> 00:22:28,542
What?

412
00:22:28,743 --> 00:22:31,409
I don't like smelly poo poo.

413
00:22:33,476 --> 00:22:37,075
Must be nice to be the one who
commands from a safe place.

414
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:39,075
But... for me...

415
00:22:39,143 --> 00:22:43,475
If something should happen to you,
I'll be stuck in the ground and die!

416
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,142
"If something"?

417
00:22:45,543 --> 00:22:47,275
Like it'd be fair if that happened!

418
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:50,209
Hey, why don't we just tell that
Unkokusai person the circumstances...

419
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:53,175
and have him return at least
our bank book and hanko?

420
00:22:53,476 --> 00:22:57,675
Even if he returned just that, it's no use
unless we can return to our time!

421
00:22:58,143 --> 00:22:59,942
What's wrong? Let's get moving.

422
00:23:00,677 --> 00:23:02,342
We have no choice but to go.

423
00:23:03,077 --> 00:23:04,276
Shit!

424
00:23:04,477 --> 00:23:07,342
I'll show him the spirit of a salaried man!

425
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:18,009
Shinnosuke, what's with that sound?

426
00:23:18,543 --> 00:23:20,209
It sounds like all the strength is going away.

427
00:23:22,343 --> 00:23:23,409
Come on, we're ready to go.

428
00:23:23,543 --> 00:23:25,876
Oh! Ready to ho!

429
00:24:28,344 --> 00:24:32,476
Unkokusai-sama, please give
this gold object to Ginmei.

430
00:24:32,544 --> 00:24:34,276
Do as you wish.

431
00:24:34,744 --> 00:24:37,876
Then I shall dispose of those people...

432
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,609
No, I'll do it.

433
00:24:42,144 --> 00:24:44,263
It's MY prey! Don't get in my way!

434
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,476
The god of Wine and Females is Love.

435
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:49,943
I'll be wanting to whiff the smell of blood soon.

436
00:24:55,544 --> 00:24:58,343
MatatabiNekoNoShi, go.
(CatnipKillerOfCats)

437
00:25:01,877 --> 00:25:05,809
Unkokusai-sama.
Why did you not command me?

438
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:11,609
Ogin. Don't you understand Unkokusai-sama's
wish that you stay by his side?

439
00:25:15,277 --> 00:25:18,743
You say such things as do not
need to be said, Tamashiro. (WhiteBalls)

440
00:25:35,077 --> 00:25:36,610
Hmm...

441
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,504
It's so peaceful.

442
00:25:38,544 --> 00:25:39,876
It reminds me of the country.

443
00:25:39,944 --> 00:25:40,810
That's so true.

444
00:25:40,944 --> 00:25:44,343
Kasukabe used to be such
a laidback place like this.

445
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:46,543
It's quite a city now, huh?

446
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:53,343
There's a lot of people and cars, the
land is expensive, we have 32 years
left on our home loan, and...

447
00:25:57,011 --> 00:26:00,410
Misae, I'm thinking that we should
stay and live in this age.

448
00:26:00,544 --> 00:26:01,210
What?

449
00:26:01,811 --> 00:26:05,410
I'm tired of a life of working
just to pay back a loan.

450
00:26:05,477 --> 00:26:07,076
Don't say such stupid things!

451
00:26:07,077 --> 00:26:09,010
Besides how would we live?

452
00:26:09,077 --> 00:26:13,943
In this Age of Civil Wars, advancement
is determined by your wit alone.

453
00:26:14,211 --> 00:26:16,343
Section Chief... Department Head...
It's all so pretty! So pretty!

454
00:26:16,544 --> 00:26:18,810
To be king of a country, it's not a dream here!

455
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:19,476
Huh?

456
00:26:20,811 --> 00:26:23,877
Then if it happens that way, I'm a princess?

457
00:26:24,344 --> 00:26:28,810
If Unkokusai is a person from the future,
then he'd definitely think that way.

458
00:26:30,078 --> 00:26:31,343
It's a joke.

459
00:26:31,744 --> 00:26:35,343
You know, don't come out the way out
here just to talk about loans, okay?

460
00:26:35,744 --> 00:26:37,143
I know that!

461
00:26:37,478 --> 00:26:40,077
I also know that you don't have such courage.

462
00:26:40,081 --> 00:26:41,010
What?

463
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:42,477
Rude brat!

464
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:45,477
You've touched my sword with your filthy hands!

465
00:26:45,678 --> 00:26:47,143
Though you may be a child, I can't forgive this!

466
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:48,543
Sit there and bring disgrace to your family!

467
00:26:48,878 --> 00:26:50,210
Attention!

468
00:26:50,478 --> 00:26:53,677
Deflate (disgrace).
Is this okay?

469
00:26:54,811 --> 00:26:56,277
You!

470
00:26:56,611 --> 00:26:58,810
Please forgive us Samurai-sama!

471
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:03,343
Our son did something, but as you
can see, we're just farmers.

472
00:27:03,478 --> 00:27:06,743
Please forgive us! Let us go!

473
00:27:06,744 --> 00:27:09,410
Okay, since you put it that way,
then I'll forgive you.

474
00:27:09,411 --> 00:27:10,743
You're supposed to apologize!

475
00:27:10,744 --> 00:27:11,277
What?

476
00:27:12,078 --> 00:27:15,677
Unforgiven!
I'll slice the whole family then!

477
00:27:17,411 --> 00:27:18,677
It's the doings of a child.

478
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:19,677
Forgive him.

479
00:27:19,744 --> 00:27:21,077
I ask of you also.

480
00:27:21,411 --> 00:27:22,143
NO!

481
00:27:22,678 --> 00:27:24,277
Then what would you have me do?

482
00:27:25,611 --> 00:27:28,010
I should execute them.

483
00:27:28,078 --> 00:27:31,344
But there's no advantage in executing
these vulgar people.

484
00:27:31,611 --> 00:27:35,544
I would withdraw from this situation
for one silver piece. How about it?

485
00:27:41,745 --> 00:27:44,210
You. Your beard is quite overgrown.

486
00:27:44,411 --> 00:27:45,144
What?

487
00:27:51,945 --> 00:27:55,277
How about one silver piece to
pay for the beard trimming?

488
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:03,944
I was just thinking that I needed a trim, too...
Thank you so much!

489
00:28:04,611 --> 00:28:06,210
And so we've no debts now!

490
00:28:10,705 --> 00:28:13,037
He blackmails, and he calls himself a warrior?

491
00:28:13,638 --> 00:28:17,970
I dislike people with no strength,
and plenty of bluff!

492
00:28:18,705 --> 00:28:20,170
If you're a man, come with your fists!

493
00:28:20,571 --> 00:28:21,637
Come with your sword!

494
00:28:22,971 --> 00:28:24,104
So cool!

495
00:28:24,105 --> 00:28:25,570
It's just like historical TV!

496
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:28,570
But you are heroes, aren't you?

497
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:31,304
Why did you indulge in such base behavior?

498
00:28:31,438 --> 00:28:31,970
Uh...

499
00:28:32,438 --> 00:28:33,904
No, aaah... that was...

500
00:28:34,705 --> 00:28:35,571
Uh, right.

501
00:28:36,838 --> 00:28:40,237
To defeat your foe, is not the
only solution to a problem.

502
00:28:40,638 --> 00:28:42,837
Meaningless fighting should be avoided.

503
00:28:44,172 --> 00:28:46,504
He's saying something that sounds true.

504
00:28:46,705 --> 00:28:49,037
After all, Dad's good at excuses.

505
00:28:49,372 --> 00:28:50,237
You're a bit noisy!

506
00:28:51,838 --> 00:28:53,704
Victory without violence.

507
00:28:54,438 --> 00:28:56,504
Trickery, that's strategy!

508
00:28:56,638 --> 00:28:57,504
I shall remember it.

509
00:28:58,938 --> 00:29:01,237
Yes, it's a strategy. Strategy!

510
00:29:02,705 --> 00:29:03,971
What's a strategy?

511
00:29:04,205 --> 00:29:04,971
I don't know.

512
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:09,704
Oh!

513
00:30:09,772 --> 00:30:10,904
Yummy!

514
00:30:11,172 --> 00:30:13,238
What's "Oh, yummy"?

515
00:30:13,505 --> 00:30:15,304
You don't even know that?

516
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,304
Um, it's basically...

517
00:30:17,572 --> 00:30:18,504
Isn't it "delicious"?

518
00:30:18,572 --> 00:30:19,238
That's it.

519
00:30:19,372 --> 00:30:22,704
Oh. If it's delicious, then
you say, "Oh, yummy!"?

520
00:30:25,639 --> 00:30:27,171
Oh! Yummy!

521
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:28,704
Like that?

522
00:30:28,705 --> 00:30:30,238
Well, yeah. That's the way.

523
00:30:36,172 --> 00:30:38,104
Is eating stuff like grass good?

524
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:42,704
These dango are good.
(Japanese confection)

525
00:30:43,305 --> 00:30:44,238
Want to eat some?

526
00:30:50,439 --> 00:30:51,405
Hey!

527
00:30:51,639 --> 00:30:54,105
If you do stuff like that, you'll get bitten!

528
00:30:54,306 --> 00:30:58,305
Hey baby! Scold me more!

529
00:31:04,306 --> 00:31:06,571
You ate my dango!

530
00:31:07,706 --> 00:31:09,371
Then I'll eat yours, too!

531
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:15,171
Awful!

532
00:31:17,372 --> 00:31:21,171
Fubuki-maru-san, how much farther
is it to Unkokusai's castle?

533
00:31:21,506 --> 00:31:23,905
It's 15 more li's toward Inui.

534
00:31:24,906 --> 00:31:25,771
15 li?

535
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:27,371
How far is 1 li?

536
00:31:27,506 --> 00:31:32,705
1 Li is about 3.9 km, so we still
have about 58.5 km to go. (36 miles)

537
00:31:35,439 --> 00:31:37,238
It's half a day if you let your horse run...

538
00:31:37,306 --> 00:31:40,438
But since you are on foot, we should
be there by tomorrow evening.

539
00:31:40,906 --> 00:31:42,505
Why did you not come with horses?

540
00:31:49,239 --> 00:31:49,905
Oi!

541
00:31:50,372 --> 00:31:51,971
Won't you hurry and come?

542
00:31:52,572 --> 00:31:55,038
Dad! Mom!

543
00:31:56,106 --> 00:31:58,705
Well, you're riding a horse!

544
00:31:58,973 --> 00:32:00,905
Well, he was a prince before y'know.

545
00:32:01,106 --> 00:32:03,372
He doesn't understand the
feeling of the unfortunate.

546
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:05,572
Call a palanquin! Palanquin!

547
00:32:06,173 --> 00:32:07,772
They are those with weak feet.

548
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:09,372
Can they truly fight?

549
00:32:09,973 --> 00:32:12,372
In contrust, you are quite
admirable, Shinnosuke.

550
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,972
Oh! I'm quite admirable!

551
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,838
I thought it'd end up like this.
Shinnosuke, you...

552
00:32:24,373 --> 00:32:25,838
Shh...

553
00:32:29,773 --> 00:32:31,038
I'm tired.

554
00:32:32,239 --> 00:32:33,638
We shall rest here tonight.

555
00:32:33,973 --> 00:32:35,705
Be sure you leave no tiredness for tomorrow.

556
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,639
You should lay down, too.

557
00:33:08,906 --> 00:33:09,972
You need not worry for me.

558
00:33:10,106 --> 00:33:12,572
I haven't laid down to sleep once this past year.

559
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:13,439
What?

560
00:33:14,173 --> 00:33:15,172
Why?

561
00:33:15,573 --> 00:33:17,505
I don't know when I could be attacked.

562
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,572
That's such a burden for one so young...

563
00:33:21,773 --> 00:33:22,772
I'm not young.

564
00:33:22,973 --> 00:33:23,772
I'm already 15.

565
00:33:24,173 --> 00:33:26,772
It's an age where it wouldn't be strange
for me to welcome a bride anytime soon.

566
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,305
Even my mother had me when she was 16.

567
00:33:30,906 --> 00:33:32,439
Wow!

568
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,705
What?

569
00:33:39,173 --> 00:33:40,505
These are small breasts.

570
00:33:40,706 --> 00:33:43,305
It's amazing you were able
to raise a child with these.

571
00:33:45,406 --> 00:33:47,305
NO!

572
00:33:48,373 --> 00:33:49,239
What is it?

573
00:33:49,573 --> 00:33:50,505
My chest!

574
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,039
This kid touched by breasts!

575
00:33:53,173 --> 00:33:56,372
No, he didn't touch it, he grabbed it!

576
00:33:57,106 --> 00:34:00,039
Did Mom have enough breasts to grab?

577
00:34:00,373 --> 00:34:03,639
Nope! Nope!
I'm the one who knows the best!

578
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,106
Go ahead and say it again!

579
00:34:09,307 --> 00:34:11,172
Hmm... We can do it.

580
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,906
Hey, lay down.

581
00:34:17,173 --> 00:34:18,239
No. I'm fine this way.

582
00:34:18,773 --> 00:34:20,972
It bugs me when you're like that.

583
00:34:22,507 --> 00:34:25,172
It's fun when all the guys sleep together!

584
00:34:25,307 --> 00:34:26,572
Right, Dad?

585
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,572
Uh...

586
00:34:29,573 --> 00:34:30,239
Well, then...

587
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,172
Uh, not that way...

588
00:34:39,773 --> 00:34:40,772
I'm sorry about that earlier.

589
00:34:40,773 --> 00:34:41,439
Forgive me.

590
00:34:42,373 --> 00:34:44,439
It's okay since... you apologized.

591
00:34:56,707 --> 00:34:59,106
Dad, dad! He's doing "that".

592
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,506
Leave it be! He's still a kid.

593
00:35:02,507 --> 00:35:03,572
I'm an adult already.

594
00:35:04,707 --> 00:35:07,239
Dad, daddy! He's saying "that".

595
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,906
Misae, I love you.

596
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,972
What about me did you fall for?

597
00:35:14,107 --> 00:35:14,673
Huh?

598
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:18,839
Why does that stump you?

599
00:35:20,907 --> 00:35:21,506
Sorry.

600
00:35:21,974 --> 00:35:22,573
Geez!

601
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:44,973
Fubukimaru.

602
00:35:45,907 --> 00:35:48,173
My lady Mother! Here!
Please look a this!

603
00:35:48,574 --> 00:35:52,506
One whose life is so fleeting, you
must not capture it as a game.

604
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,973
You do not know whose reincarnation it may be.

605
00:36:58,041 --> 00:37:00,173
Oh, my feet are so heavy.

606
00:37:00,307 --> 00:37:01,440
Mine too.

607
00:37:01,574 --> 00:37:03,173
Misae. Is it hard for you?

608
00:37:03,241 --> 00:37:04,240
No. I'm okay.

609
00:37:04,441 --> 00:37:05,506
Don't worry.

610
00:37:06,374 --> 00:37:09,306
Don't call someone else's wife
by her first name so easily!

611
00:37:09,374 --> 00:37:10,706
Hmm? Are you jealous?

612
00:37:10,707 --> 00:37:11,223
What?

613
00:37:12,107 --> 00:37:13,706
Who'd get jealous?

614
00:37:14,241 --> 00:37:15,440
Don't be so embarrassed.

615
00:37:15,507 --> 00:37:17,373
You're wrong! Don't get so happy!

616
00:37:18,174 --> 00:37:19,706
Good. Good.

617
00:37:19,907 --> 00:37:21,173
O!

618
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:22,440
O!

619
00:37:47,374 --> 00:37:48,507
Whoa!

620
00:38:02,474 --> 00:38:04,340
What an amazing oil flower garden!

621
00:38:04,841 --> 00:38:07,107
In summer, they'll be able to get some good oil.

622
00:38:07,107 --> 00:38:07,607
What?

623
00:38:07,824 --> 00:38:09,640
You can get oil from Na flowers?

624
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,040
They wring the seeds.

625
00:38:11,224 --> 00:38:12,623
Haven't you heard of "Na seed oil"?

626
00:38:15,241 --> 00:38:16,507
Oh! A butterfly!

627
00:38:19,108 --> 00:38:19,973
Come on!

628
00:38:20,174 --> 00:38:23,040
What's with "Oh! A butterfly!"
at HER age?

629
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:23,757
Dad.

630
00:38:27,508 --> 00:38:30,773
Jealous Dad is so cu~~~te!

631
00:38:30,774 --> 00:38:32,173
It's not like that!

632
00:38:45,241 --> 00:38:46,507
It's beautiful.

633
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:50,440
It's unusual for a boy to like flowers so much!

634
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:52,240
You don't like boys like that?

635
00:38:52,508 --> 00:38:54,307
No. I think it's a good thing.

636
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:04,907
Shin-chan, someone's coming.

637
00:39:05,041 --> 00:39:06,507
Hmm... A lady?

638
00:39:27,135 --> 00:39:27,940
That man.

639
00:39:28,435 --> 00:39:28,940
Misae.

640
00:39:29,775 --> 00:39:30,440
Move!

641
00:39:35,175 --> 00:39:36,507
I'll ask to be sure.

642
00:39:36,575 --> 00:39:38,374
You're not mistaking me for someone else?

643
00:39:38,508 --> 00:39:41,707
Fubukimaru, you're lucky to be
able to die among flowers.

644
00:40:16,508 --> 00:40:17,091
He's good.

645
00:40:17,108 --> 00:40:19,241
Don't say things like that. Save him!

646
00:40:19,442 --> 00:40:21,641
But that samurai is super strong!

647
00:40:22,175 --> 00:40:24,174
Shin-chan!
Use the "3x Save" feature!

648
00:40:24,975 --> 00:40:26,441
It's finally my turn to shine!

649
00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:28,574
Hurry! Yell, "Save me kit!"

650
00:40:28,642 --> 00:40:29,841
Save me! Eat it!

651
00:40:29,908 --> 00:40:30,574
Wrong!

652
00:40:30,708 --> 00:40:32,367
Savor meat fit?!

653
00:40:32,375 --> 00:40:33,507
Wrong! Wrong!

654
00:41:03,535 --> 00:41:05,728
I killed your mother.

655
00:41:25,335 --> 00:41:27,608
Save me... kit!

656
00:41:33,375 --> 00:41:35,108
Icky! A cockroach!

657
00:41:46,975 --> 00:41:48,041
Shinnosuke?!

658
00:42:35,169 --> 00:42:36,301
I thought I was going to die.

659
00:42:36,502 --> 00:42:37,635
Shinnosuke!

660
00:42:37,702 --> 00:42:38,368
Shin-chan!

661
00:42:39,436 --> 00:42:40,968
I'm so glad that you're okay.

662
00:42:44,036 --> 00:42:44,835
Wai!

663
00:42:46,702 --> 00:42:49,768
She's cute, but it seems that she has bad habits.

664
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:53,235
That's my bag!

665
00:42:54,236 --> 00:42:54,901
This?

666
00:42:55,302 --> 00:42:56,835
This is mine.

667
00:42:56,969 --> 00:42:58,968
You must be kidding!

668
00:42:59,036 --> 00:43:00,368
Now hurry up and give it back.

669
00:43:00,902 --> 00:43:02,635
Sorry, but could you please return it?

670
00:43:02,636 --> 00:43:04,302
Why are you being so polite about it?

671
00:43:04,303 --> 00:43:06,368
You're so weak when it comes
to good-looking women!

672
00:43:06,503 --> 00:43:08,102
Give it back!

673
00:43:15,553 --> 00:43:16,668
What are those?

674
00:43:17,103 --> 00:43:18,228
I shall give these to you.

675
00:43:18,303 --> 00:43:21,168
I don't need those things!
Give me back my bag!

676
00:43:21,503 --> 00:43:22,902
You're a loud woman!

677
00:43:30,636 --> 00:43:31,835
What about Misae and Hiroshi?

678
00:43:32,969 --> 00:43:35,568
Dad and Mom became balls.

679
00:43:36,636 --> 00:43:37,568
What?

680
00:43:40,829 --> 00:43:41,729
Fubukimaru.

681
00:43:42,169 --> 00:43:46,902
Should you wish to return them to their
normal state, come to PooPoo Castle.

682
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:53,102
YOU!

683
00:44:13,236 --> 00:44:16,769
We shall rest here and leave for PooPoo
Castle in the middle of the night.

684
00:44:17,303 --> 00:44:19,635
Rest your body well.

685
00:44:22,103 --> 00:44:22,835
Shin-chan!

686
00:44:22,903 --> 00:44:23,835
Cheer up!

687
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:27,169
Let's put our strengths together
and defeat Unkokusai!

688
00:44:27,303 --> 00:44:28,169
Then...

689
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:29,435
Shinnosuke.

690
00:44:29,703 --> 00:44:32,435
I understand how you feel about having
your parents changed into balls.

691
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:35,835
But here is no use in mulling over things
that have already happened.

692
00:44:36,303 --> 00:44:38,769
It's not that Misae and Hiroshi have died.

693
00:44:38,836 --> 00:44:40,702
All will be well as long as we defeat Ukokusai!

694
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:42,302
Cheer up.

695
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:45,302
You can't get me with the Noogie-Noogie Attack!

696
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:48,635
If that makes you mad, come get me! Get me!

697
00:44:50,236 --> 00:44:51,502
This is neat.

698
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:53,702
You are...

699
00:44:56,170 --> 00:44:56,635
Here.

700
00:44:58,303 --> 00:44:59,969
Put them in there and hang it from your neck.

701
00:45:00,636 --> 00:45:02,169
Be sure that you don't lose it.

702
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:06,769
My balls have become four!

703
00:45:07,686 --> 00:45:09,769
Won't you stop that, you
"child-that-makes-your-parents-miserable"!

704
00:45:12,836 --> 00:45:13,435
What is it?

705
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:18,302
There's hot springs at the river.

706
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:19,169
Go in then.

707
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:20,969
O! Hot springs!

708
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:22,836
I'll go in!

709
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:27,502
Let's go together!

710
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:29,369
No, I'll go later.

711
00:45:29,637 --> 00:45:31,102
Go by yourself.

712
00:45:31,503 --> 00:45:33,569
I'll wash your back.

713
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:36,836
I said it's alright. Hurry and go!

714
00:45:37,103 --> 00:45:38,369
Okaaay...

715
00:45:42,303 --> 00:45:44,636
If you go now, there's a young lady in there...

716
00:45:55,637 --> 00:45:58,169
Young lady! Shall I wash your back?

717
00:45:58,770 --> 00:45:59,769
Oh yeah?

718
00:45:59,837 --> 00:46:01,236
Well, thank you kindly.

719
00:46:41,037 --> 00:46:41,969
Shin-chan!

720
00:47:00,104 --> 00:47:01,903
He's a guy but he doesn't have a wee wee!

721
00:47:02,104 --> 00:47:03,436
Maybe he got an operation?

722
00:47:04,304 --> 00:47:07,503
I think it's not that he was a guy,
but that she's a woman.

723
00:47:09,437 --> 00:47:10,236
Who's there?

724
00:47:11,237 --> 00:47:12,969
<bird noise>

725
00:47:14,704 --> 00:47:15,703
It's you, Shinnosuke.

726
00:47:16,237 --> 00:47:17,569
You needn't hide.

727
00:47:18,104 --> 00:47:19,036
Come out.

728
00:47:22,304 --> 00:47:24,103
I'm not Shinnosuke!

729
00:47:24,237 --> 00:47:25,303
I'm ButtFace Man!

730
00:47:32,371 --> 00:47:34,303
So you were a lady after all.

731
00:47:34,437 --> 00:47:35,903
I can't win against you.

732
00:47:36,171 --> 00:47:37,703
Why did you pose as a man?

733
00:47:41,304 --> 00:47:43,570
My lord father never had a heir.

734
00:47:43,771 --> 00:47:45,703
So no boys were born?

735
00:47:46,904 --> 00:47:51,103
And so he raised me as a man, and
thought to have me take his place.

736
00:47:51,971 --> 00:47:54,636
I don't know how serious my lord father was...

737
00:47:54,704 --> 00:47:56,770
but soon I shall mature into a woman's body.

738
00:47:57,904 --> 00:48:00,303
It's nothing that could be avoided.

739
00:48:00,971 --> 00:48:03,036
But I felt your ball balls!

740
00:48:03,037 --> 00:48:04,570
What happened to your ball balls?

741
00:48:05,104 --> 00:48:06,436
You mean these.

742
00:48:07,104 --> 00:48:08,370
Just like mine!

743
00:48:08,504 --> 00:48:09,770
Then, in there...

744
00:48:12,371 --> 00:48:13,636
...it's my younger sister, Yukimi.

745
00:48:13,704 --> 00:48:14,636
So it is.

746
00:48:14,771 --> 00:48:16,170
Nice to meet you.

747
00:48:16,704 --> 00:48:18,436
I didn't think that you'd believe me.

748
00:48:18,504 --> 00:48:21,103
So I said that my sister was taken away.

749
00:48:21,637 --> 00:48:23,636
But I didn't think that Misae and Hiroshi, too...

750
00:48:24,904 --> 00:48:28,770
The "Three Heroes and One Dog"
have become just you two.

751
00:48:29,037 --> 00:48:29,670
Excuse me.

752
00:48:29,771 --> 00:48:32,836
Could you tell us that Legend of the Heroes?

753
00:48:33,637 --> 00:48:36,703
Short enough so that a child
won't get bored, okay?

754
00:48:37,904 --> 00:48:40,437
When the Kasuga family is faced
with an imminent emergency...

755
00:48:40,838 --> 00:48:43,437
three heroes and one dog will appear.

756
00:48:44,438 --> 00:48:47,370
Those left with their lives, will
cast their lot with them.

757
00:48:47,504 --> 00:48:49,903
With these balls, and the protective sword...

758
00:48:50,038 --> 00:48:53,170
"Number Seven Chin-Chin-Maru",
we will stand up fight to the evil.

759
00:48:53,438 --> 00:48:55,303
"Number Seven Chin-Chin-Maru"?
(Wee Wee Maru)

760
00:49:03,371 --> 00:49:05,237
I'm glad I've met you.

761
00:49:06,238 --> 00:49:10,303
You've made me look forward to
the battle and have given my soul
courage without being broken.

762
00:49:10,504 --> 00:49:11,437
I'm peaceful.

763
00:49:12,171 --> 00:49:14,837
I think this is all because of you.

764
00:49:15,571 --> 00:49:16,837
I thank you.

765
00:49:17,504 --> 00:49:19,770
I'm not all that...

766
00:49:22,704 --> 00:49:25,837
After this, the only thing left to lose is life.

767
00:49:27,504 --> 00:49:28,570
Night has ended.

768
00:49:30,238 --> 00:49:31,103
Let us go.

769
00:49:31,371 --> 00:49:31,937
Yes!

770
00:49:41,371 --> 00:49:42,220
Who are you?

771
00:49:42,371 --> 00:49:43,637
Just as expected of you.

772
00:49:44,371 --> 00:49:46,637
I'm FreedKin WhiteBalls.

773
00:49:47,571 --> 00:49:50,104
Freed Ball Balls White?

774
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:52,437
Fubukimaru!

775
00:49:52,905 --> 00:49:55,437
I shall receive your neck.

776
00:49:57,438 --> 00:49:59,370
Shinnosuke, don't move!

777
00:49:59,838 --> 00:50:01,037
Fubukimaru!

778
00:50:01,038 --> 00:50:02,504
Shin-chan! The "3x Save" feature!

779
00:50:03,505 --> 00:50:05,037
Save me! Save me!

780
00:50:05,038 --> 00:50:05,704
Wrong.

781
00:50:05,705 --> 00:50:07,237
Save me kite kite!

782
00:50:07,238 --> 00:50:08,037
Wrong.

783
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:09,570
Save me kit!

784
00:50:09,571 --> 00:50:10,304
Right!

785
00:50:11,838 --> 00:50:12,704
Whoa!

786
00:50:15,705 --> 00:50:18,437
What use is this, Shiro?

787
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,186
Not good, the water spiders!

788
00:50:31,437 --> 00:50:33,749
It seems I won't have to play a part.

789
00:50:43,313 --> 00:50:44,249
That you, Shinnosuke?

790
00:50:44,288 --> 00:50:45,874
Ye-s!

791
00:50:47,688 --> 00:50:48,624
Why don't you ride?

792
00:50:48,625 --> 00:50:49,312
Okay!

793
00:50:54,125 --> 00:50:55,562
It's shuriken!

794
00:50:58,375 --> 00:50:59,937
Shinnosuke! Fly!

795
00:51:18,001 --> 00:51:18,875
I don't need it.

796
00:51:25,188 --> 00:51:26,187
Here I come.

797
00:51:35,876 --> 00:51:38,250
A sword will not affect me.

798
00:51:38,563 --> 00:51:40,750
What will you do, Fubukimaru?

799
00:51:47,251 --> 00:51:49,688
It seems as though you are tiring, but...

800
00:51:52,626 --> 00:51:56,938
The moment the sword blades
part, will be the moment you die.

801
00:52:37,689 --> 00:52:39,188
You're fast, Enji!

802
00:52:39,439 --> 00:52:42,438
This is the first time Enji has
let anyone other than me ride!

803
00:52:42,877 --> 00:52:45,439
It seems that he has
accepted you as one of us.

804
00:52:45,877 --> 00:52:48,439
A YochiEn-ji (kindergartener)
riding En-ji.

805
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:49,764
As if...

806
00:52:50,315 --> 00:52:52,501
Shinnosuke, is that supposed to be funny?

807
00:52:53,127 --> 00:52:55,126
No... not really...

808
00:52:55,147 --> 00:52:55,926
I see.

809
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:41,439
I'll go inside first and open the gate.
Wait here until then.

810
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,064
Okay.

811
00:53:59,753 --> 00:54:01,065
Is it going to be all right?

812
00:54:14,878 --> 00:54:15,440
Oh no!

813
00:54:15,691 --> 00:54:17,815
It's a trap!
Retreat! RETREAT!

814
00:54:35,066 --> 00:54:37,396
- There's so many coming!
- What are you going to do?

815
00:54:37,396 --> 00:54:38,490
Cut my way through!

816
00:54:38,504 --> 00:54:39,128
Begin!

817
00:55:19,254 --> 00:55:21,128
Out of my way!

818
00:55:25,942 --> 00:55:26,879
What's wrong?

819
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:28,379
The smell of fire weapons!

820
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:32,254
Tanegashima! (Muskets)

821
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:33,191
What's that?

822
00:55:33,255 --> 00:55:34,254
Guns!

823
00:56:27,226 --> 00:56:28,287
It's no use!

824
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:30,975
You can't shoot down Fubukimaru
with arrows from afar!

825
00:56:31,476 --> 00:56:32,600
Come out!

826
00:56:32,788 --> 00:56:35,225
Don't you want my neck?

827
00:56:37,213 --> 00:56:38,225
Cowards.

828
00:56:59,914 --> 00:57:03,275
Mom will get mad if you go in a
house without wiping your feet!

829
00:57:20,226 --> 00:57:22,163
We only need to cross this
bridge, and it's the castle tower!

830
00:57:23,726 --> 00:57:24,663
Wait a moment, please!

831
00:57:24,914 --> 00:57:25,475
What is it?

832
00:57:26,351 --> 00:57:29,538
I sense the enemy's
resistance isn't serious.

833
00:57:30,602 --> 00:57:32,413
They are luring us in on purpose.

834
00:57:32,789 --> 00:57:37,226
If you know, then we have to plan
something or it'll go as they planned!

835
00:57:37,226 --> 00:57:37,826
No!

836
00:57:37,914 --> 00:57:39,601
They're moving right now.

837
00:57:39,872 --> 00:57:42,601
We'll dive deep into the heart
of the trap and find an opening.

838
00:57:42,852 --> 00:57:44,976
There's no other way to victory for us!

839
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:47,788
And if the enemy doesn't
show us an opening?

840
00:57:49,289 --> 00:57:51,663
We're prepared for the
worst from the start!

841
00:57:52,289 --> 00:57:53,288
But that's...

842
00:57:53,477 --> 00:57:55,101
reckless!

843
00:58:05,477 --> 00:58:06,289
The bridge!

844
00:58:24,727 --> 00:58:25,601
Enji!

845
00:58:27,415 --> 00:58:28,351
That's enough.

846
00:58:28,352 --> 00:58:29,851
You've done well to get us this far!

847
00:58:29,915 --> 00:58:31,664
You are my pride!

848
00:58:32,665 --> 00:58:33,914
Rest here, ok?

849
00:58:34,853 --> 00:58:35,414
Let's go!

850
00:58:35,415 --> 00:58:36,039
Yes!

851
00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:41,389
Wait.

852
00:58:59,228 --> 00:58:59,914
Okay!

853
00:59:10,916 --> 00:59:12,227
Don't stop! Run!

854
00:59:12,791 --> 00:59:13,977
- Yes!
- Okay!

855
00:59:36,104 --> 00:59:36,915
Stop.

856
00:59:37,166 --> 00:59:38,103
Really!

857
00:59:38,354 --> 00:59:42,978
Run. Stop. Wait. Don't stop...
You sure are willful.

858
00:59:43,666 --> 00:59:46,853
Above us is Unkokusai-sama's pavilion.

859
00:59:47,791 --> 00:59:51,478
And the thing that noisy woman
said to return is also there.

860
00:59:54,479 --> 00:59:58,103
But, for both, you must defeat me first.

861
00:59:58,604 --> 01:00:01,728
I do not wish to kill a woman,
but I have no choice.

862
01:00:01,854 --> 01:00:03,978
Oh, you're so frightening.

863
01:00:19,729 --> 01:00:20,728
Why does it not cut?

864
01:00:21,104 --> 01:00:22,291
Really, why doesn't it?

865
01:00:22,479 --> 01:00:24,666
It is only thin, weak silk.

866
01:01:08,418 --> 01:01:10,167
You're a woman, aren't you?!

867
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:14,954
I can tell by the smell of your skin.

868
01:01:16,855 --> 01:01:17,854
A woman, eh?

869
01:01:19,418 --> 01:01:21,292
I hate women!

870
01:01:22,855 --> 01:01:26,292
Especially women who try to get
close to Unkokusai-sama!

871
01:01:46,481 --> 01:01:47,417
I am...

872
01:01:48,668 --> 01:01:50,355
I am NOT a woman!

873
01:01:48,668 --> 01:01:51,605
{\an8}<i>In Japan, there's a saying,
"a woman's hair is her life"

874
01:02:11,731 --> 01:02:13,043
It was a doll, then?

875
01:02:15,919 --> 01:02:17,043
Shinnosuke. Come.

876
01:02:17,106 --> 01:02:17,730
Okay!

877
01:02:18,231 --> 01:02:19,730
My body will not listen to me.

878
01:02:19,794 --> 01:02:20,980
It was that gas, just now!

879
01:02:22,919 --> 01:02:23,980
I beg you.

880
01:02:25,856 --> 01:02:26,980
Hurry, take it.

881
01:02:27,481 --> 01:02:30,918
But Mama said children shouldn't
have things with blades on them!

882
01:02:31,294 --> 01:02:32,605
My sister.

883
01:02:38,419 --> 01:02:39,730
Lady!

884
01:02:40,242 --> 01:02:42,106
It's alright. She's only paralyzed.

885
01:02:43,107 --> 01:02:44,856
What'll we do, Shiro?

886
01:02:45,407 --> 01:02:47,816
Luckily we have one more
use of the "3x Save" feature.

887
01:02:48,169 --> 01:02:51,356
Then we have to believe in
the power of that sword!

888
01:02:51,732 --> 01:02:54,606
I want to be a dog...

889
01:02:55,294 --> 01:02:56,418
Shin-chan! Fight!

890
01:02:56,482 --> 01:02:57,481
Aren't you a heroic warrior?

891
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,481
Take a stand against evil!

892
01:03:01,232 --> 01:03:02,231
Now!

893
01:03:06,857 --> 01:03:09,293
Damn! So what about PooPoo!

894
01:03:09,544 --> 01:03:13,044
Poo-Poo-On-The-Underwear-Rolling-Thunder!

895
01:03:34,232 --> 01:03:36,669
So you've finally come all the way here.

896
01:03:36,670 --> 01:03:39,669
One dog and one child.

897
01:03:40,795 --> 01:03:44,357
I shall praise you, though I shall
not present you with a belt.

898
01:03:44,858 --> 01:03:46,357
You're Unkokusai, right?

899
01:03:46,483 --> 01:03:47,732
And so I am.

900
01:03:48,358 --> 01:03:50,357
Smells like... PooPoo. (Unkokusai)

901
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:51,919
Show your true form!

902
01:03:52,295 --> 01:03:54,919
We already know that you
are a person from the future!

903
01:03:55,108 --> 01:03:56,419
What did you say?

904
01:03:57,420 --> 01:03:58,669
Paul McCartney?

905
01:03:58,733 --> 01:04:00,044
As if...

906
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:02,832
How about that? Isn't that a
popular gag in the 20th century?

907
01:04:04,483 --> 01:04:06,294
He's not funny, Shiro!

908
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:07,107
As I thought.

909
01:04:07,233 --> 01:04:09,357
He is a 30th Century History freak.

910
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:11,232
That is correct.

911
01:04:16,171 --> 01:04:18,045
Well, nice to meet you.

912
01:04:16,171 --> 01:04:22,107
{\an8}<i>Typical businessman introduction

913
01:04:18,233 --> 01:04:22,107
This is what kind of person I am, here.
Please treat me well.

914
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:24,295
I'm Shinnosuke Nohara, 5 years old.

915
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:25,482
{\an8}<i>Typical kindergartner introduction

916
01:04:24,608 --> 01:04:25,445
Nice to meet you.

917
01:04:25,445 --> 01:04:27,545
This isn't the time to be doing
formal introductions!

918
01:04:27,921 --> 01:04:33,545
History, Trend Creator and
Culturalist, Pierre Jakoman.

919
01:04:34,858 --> 01:04:35,982
Hurry up and put it away.

920
01:04:36,296 --> 01:04:37,482
Oka-y.

921
01:04:37,783 --> 01:04:39,420
And? What will you do?

922
01:04:39,483 --> 01:04:42,232
Quit interfering with history
right now and turn yourself in!

923
01:04:42,358 --> 01:04:43,545
Yeah! Yeah!

924
01:04:44,483 --> 01:04:45,108
I don't want to.

925
01:04:45,796 --> 01:04:47,920
I don't like violence, but...

926
01:04:48,046 --> 01:04:52,045
What would you do if I liked
picking on dogs and kids?

927
01:04:52,796 --> 01:04:53,608
Yoo Hoo.

928
01:04:54,421 --> 01:04:56,483
Shiro. What'll we do?

929
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:03,108
Number Seven Wee Wee Maru is calling!

930
01:05:03,484 --> 01:05:04,670
Draw the sword, Shin-chan!

931
01:05:04,671 --> 01:05:05,233
Okay!

932
01:05:08,234 --> 01:05:08,983
Shin-chan!

933
01:05:11,734 --> 01:05:13,733
It's too heavy. I can't hold it!

934
01:05:14,921 --> 01:05:16,296
What are you trying to do?

935
01:05:16,359 --> 01:05:18,546
Shin-chan, use the "3x Save" feature!

936
01:05:19,672 --> 01:05:22,108
Save me Todatodachichi!

937
01:05:22,234 --> 01:05:24,046
Maybe you're doing that on purpose?

938
01:05:26,734 --> 01:05:28,171
Save me Kit!

939
01:05:32,297 --> 01:05:33,983
Adult Shin-chan appears!

940
01:05:41,547 --> 01:05:43,733
Shin-chan! Hurry up and catch Pierre!

941
01:05:44,047 --> 01:05:46,296
O-kay!

942
01:05:46,422 --> 01:05:47,921
That's a foul, you guys.

943
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:49,109
He's getting away!

944
01:05:49,172 --> 01:05:49,921
Wait!

945
01:05:50,172 --> 01:05:50,921
No.

946
01:05:51,735 --> 01:05:53,921
You guys who cheat all the
time are law-breakers.

947
01:05:54,922 --> 01:05:57,459
I'll just give you the death sentence.

948
01:05:57,860 --> 01:05:58,984
I won't lose!

949
01:05:59,610 --> 01:06:01,484
Right now I am Shin-ly strong!

950
01:06:02,297 --> 01:06:03,734
At least I feel that way, probably...

951
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:05,671
I'm counting on you, Shin-chan!

952
01:06:05,697 --> 01:06:06,984
O..okay!

953
01:06:16,485 --> 01:06:17,984
Then shall we?

954
01:06:17,985 --> 01:06:20,172
There's no sense in killing
you if you're too weak.

955
01:06:20,173 --> 01:06:22,047
So make a little effort okay?

956
01:06:22,110 --> 01:06:23,484
I'm invincible!

957
01:06:23,923 --> 01:06:25,359
That's nice.

958
01:06:32,798 --> 01:06:33,734
You're good!

959
01:06:41,423 --> 01:06:44,547
You're pretty strong.
Let's change the menu.

960
01:06:45,173 --> 01:06:49,234
The things I like are hotcakes
and bouncy young girls!

961
01:06:49,735 --> 01:06:50,735
Hotcake...

962
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:54,610
Bouncy young... Ah, I messed up.
You're so irritating.

963
01:06:54,611 --> 01:06:55,235
Really...

964
01:06:55,236 --> 01:06:55,772
Really... Really...

965
01:06:55,923 --> 01:06:56,547
Really... Really... Really... Really...

966
01:06:56,548 --> 01:06:59,172
Strong... now.

967
01:07:00,173 --> 01:07:02,360
I am a hundred million times stronger!

968
01:07:03,736 --> 01:07:05,360
You are such a child.

969
01:07:05,611 --> 01:07:06,797
It's not really that much...

970
01:07:15,923 --> 01:07:17,297
You did it now!

971
01:07:28,236 --> 01:07:28,735
You're strong!

972
01:07:28,924 --> 01:07:30,360
You're strong, aren't you?

973
01:07:41,049 --> 01:07:43,173
This is the best!

974
01:07:52,012 --> 01:07:53,798
You. That's unsightly.

975
01:07:55,174 --> 01:07:57,548
And just when I thought you looked cool.

976
01:07:57,799 --> 01:07:59,298
That's no good!

977
01:07:59,924 --> 01:08:00,486
Huh?

978
01:08:00,737 --> 01:08:01,611
It ran out of time!

979
01:08:01,674 --> 01:08:03,423
I'm back to normal!

980
01:08:09,424 --> 01:08:10,236
Shin-chan!

981
01:08:20,112 --> 01:08:20,986
Ouch!!!

982
01:08:24,325 --> 01:08:28,736
That hurt!!!

983
01:08:48,237 --> 01:08:49,736
It's coming again, Shiro!

984
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,700
What is it this time, Shiro?

985
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:10,112
Shiro won't talk anymore.

986
01:09:14,925 --> 01:09:15,924
Who are you?

987
01:09:16,675 --> 01:09:20,362
Rings ToStorm, 30th Century Time Patroller.

988
01:09:20,863 --> 01:09:23,362
I was the one talking through Shiro.

989
01:09:24,363 --> 01:09:27,612
The lady who never came in handy!

990
01:09:27,738 --> 01:09:28,612
Yeah, that's it.

991
01:09:29,113 --> 01:09:30,112
I'm sorry.

992
01:09:30,426 --> 01:09:31,800
Putting you in such danger.

993
01:09:32,113 --> 01:09:34,362
Though Shin-chan, you looked really cool.

994
01:09:35,051 --> 01:09:36,175
Thank you very much.

995
01:09:36,488 --> 01:09:37,300
Shinnosuke!

996
01:09:37,738 --> 01:09:38,550
Did you do it?

997
01:09:38,926 --> 01:09:39,925
Fubukimaru-san!

998
01:09:41,426 --> 01:09:42,300
Who are you?

999
01:09:42,863 --> 01:09:45,237
I don't think you'd understand
if I told you, but...

1000
01:09:45,301 --> 01:09:47,300
I'm someone who's life you saved.

1001
01:09:47,988 --> 01:09:50,800
If it weren't for you, by now I'd be...

1002
01:09:53,238 --> 01:09:55,175
I can't think that you are a stranger.

1003
01:09:55,538 --> 01:09:56,275
Yes.

1004
01:10:01,489 --> 01:10:02,925
Shinnosuke! My sister?

1005
01:10:04,114 --> 01:10:05,925
I... don't know.

1006
01:10:07,364 --> 01:10:08,738
My chest is so hot.

1007
01:10:08,864 --> 01:10:10,675
Have I fallen in love?

1008
01:10:12,489 --> 01:10:14,050
Dynamite Boobs!

1009
01:10:23,426 --> 01:10:25,550
- Dad! Mom!
- Shinnosuke!

1010
01:10:25,614 --> 01:10:26,488
Shin-chan!

1011
01:10:26,551 --> 01:10:28,425
And then a pretty lady!

1012
01:10:28,489 --> 01:10:29,676
Yoohoo...

1013
01:10:29,802 --> 01:10:30,488
Yukino!

1014
01:10:30,739 --> 01:10:31,801
Elder sister!

1015
01:10:32,677 --> 01:10:33,488
Sister?

1016
01:10:33,677 --> 01:10:35,488
She must have meant elder brother.

1017
01:10:35,739 --> 01:10:38,113
Dad and Mom, you're so behind the times!

1018
01:10:38,364 --> 01:10:41,113
Fubukimaru was really a lady, you know.

1019
01:10:42,114 --> 01:10:43,738
Oh, is that what it was?

1020
01:10:44,177 --> 01:10:45,488
Why are you so disappointed?

1021
01:10:45,614 --> 01:10:46,213
Huh?

1022
01:10:47,052 --> 01:10:48,113
Milady elder sister...

1023
01:10:50,114 --> 01:10:52,863
I am ever grateful for the viewing of thine
face for once in such a long course of days.

1024
01:10:53,114 --> 01:10:54,926
I am understanding that you are
in extremely beautiful health.

1025
01:10:55,239 --> 01:10:57,551
Of that I am most glad because of my
extremely deep attachment to you.

1026
01:10:57,927 --> 01:10:58,738
What did she say?

1027
01:10:59,052 --> 01:10:59,738
I don't know.

1028
01:11:01,740 --> 01:11:05,676
You've been a long time prisoner.
I am in disbelief that you are so well.

1029
01:11:08,802 --> 01:11:10,301
Stupid. Don't cry.

1030
01:11:10,365 --> 01:11:11,551
It is all over.

1031
01:11:11,927 --> 01:11:13,239
Hey baby!

1032
01:11:13,302 --> 01:11:16,239
Why don't you cry all
you want on my chest?

1033
01:11:16,677 --> 01:11:19,051
Shinnosuke, Yukino is a man.

1034
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:21,864
No way!

1035
01:11:22,615 --> 01:11:26,239
From the time he was born,
Yukino's believed that he was a girl.

1036
01:11:26,552 --> 01:11:28,801
No matter how we try to fix him,
he won't get better.

1037
01:11:29,615 --> 01:11:31,802
My lord father was quite distraught.

1038
01:11:32,115 --> 01:11:34,239
So I became a man.

1039
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:35,802
You mean you're an okama-san?
(Transvestite)

1040
01:11:36,303 --> 01:11:37,364
This is a scam.

1041
01:11:38,403 --> 01:11:40,802
Everyone, let's leave the
long conversations for later.

1042
01:11:40,803 --> 01:11:43,839
We needn't overstay our welcome.
Let us part from this place now.

1043
01:11:45,615 --> 01:11:46,177
What?

1044
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:48,302
You are woman?

1045
01:11:49,115 --> 01:11:50,177
I am a woman!

1046
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:52,239
I'm so glad!

1047
01:12:00,615 --> 01:12:01,552
Daddy.

1048
01:12:01,615 --> 01:12:02,364
Mommy.

1049
01:12:02,553 --> 01:12:03,365
Ring.

1050
01:12:03,378 --> 01:12:04,365
Fubukimaru.

1051
01:12:04,491 --> 01:12:05,240
Yukino.

1052
01:12:05,428 --> 01:12:06,115
Enji.

1053
01:12:06,366 --> 01:12:07,052
Shiro.

1054
01:12:07,928 --> 01:12:09,490
Boy, are there a lot of us.

1055
01:12:11,491 --> 01:12:13,990
Everyone, thank you for working so hard.

1056
01:12:14,991 --> 01:12:16,490
Well. Let's go home.

1057
01:12:18,116 --> 01:12:20,990
Is this the horse of the
three heroes and one dog?

1058
01:12:21,116 --> 01:12:22,427
How prestigious.

1059
01:12:22,928 --> 01:12:25,865
Press to us?
That sounds kinda ecchi.

1060
01:12:25,928 --> 01:12:28,427
Don't say such stupid things.
Hurry up and come.

1061
01:12:29,866 --> 01:12:31,615
Shinnosuke. This is goodbye.

1062
01:12:32,053 --> 01:12:35,990
I can't thank you enough
for your peerless work.

1063
01:12:36,366 --> 01:12:37,428
I give you my thanks.

1064
01:12:37,491 --> 01:12:41,303
When you thank someone, you say,
"Thank you very much."

1065
01:12:41,866 --> 01:12:42,803
Like that.

1066
01:12:44,929 --> 01:12:46,740
Thank you very much.

1067
01:12:47,616 --> 01:12:48,240
How was that?

1068
01:12:48,429 --> 01:12:50,115
You're heading in a pretty good direction!

1069
01:12:50,679 --> 01:12:52,178
Won't you marry me?

1070
01:12:52,179 --> 01:12:53,115
I refuse.

1071
01:12:53,429 --> 01:12:55,115
Though I would not mind...

1072
01:12:57,491 --> 01:13:00,115
I don't want a boy lady!

1073
01:13:05,492 --> 01:13:07,491
Farewell, heroic warriors.

1074
01:13:25,804 --> 01:13:26,741
Fubukimaru.

1075
01:13:27,867 --> 01:13:28,803
Fubukimaru.

1076
01:13:32,742 --> 01:13:33,928
Milady mother.

1077
01:13:35,304 --> 01:13:36,554
And just when we are preparing for war...

1078
01:13:36,617 --> 01:13:39,116
Father is already surrouned by subjects.

1079
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:47,616
My soul feels as though I had
been gazing upon a long dream.

1080
01:13:49,617 --> 01:13:51,241
Was it a good dream then?

1081
01:13:55,367 --> 01:13:56,366
I don't know.

1082
01:14:29,655 --> 01:14:32,292
I've brought you a change of
clothes from the 20th century.

1083
01:14:32,305 --> 01:14:33,742
Please change into them later.

1084
01:14:34,055 --> 01:14:37,117
I really can't thank you enough,
but please help yourself.

1085
01:14:37,493 --> 01:14:38,805
I have to bring you all home...

1086
01:14:39,056 --> 01:14:42,742
then bring Number Seven
WeeWee Maru and their legend back
to Fubukimaru's ancestors...

1087
01:14:43,056 --> 01:14:44,305
then my job is done.

1088
01:14:44,931 --> 01:14:46,492
Bring their legend back?

1089
01:14:46,681 --> 01:14:49,492
Fubukimaru knew of us, didn't she?

1090
01:14:49,856 --> 01:14:54,355
Who do you think was the first to tell
the Kasuga Family of that legend?

1091
01:14:54,743 --> 01:14:57,430
It's my last job after this.

1092
01:14:57,806 --> 01:14:59,305
I don't understand at all.

1093
01:14:59,368 --> 01:15:00,930
You're so stupid, Misae.

1094
01:15:01,618 --> 01:15:05,117
I see, then a time paradox won't occur.

1095
01:15:06,868 --> 01:15:10,730
The main support of a family has to
have some understanding of Sci-Fi.

1096
01:15:23,869 --> 01:15:26,868
Alright! 7:55.
I'll make it to work in time!

1097
01:15:27,031 --> 01:15:29,243
Shin-chan, please hurry and
get ready for kindergarten.

1098
01:15:29,244 --> 01:15:29,930
Right.

1099
01:15:33,744 --> 01:15:37,305
Since she was bringing clothes,
she could have brought my suit.

1100
01:15:37,306 --> 01:15:39,430
Geez, people from the future
aren't very thoughtful.

1101
01:15:39,681 --> 01:15:41,368
I forgive her since she's beautiful.

1102
01:15:41,682 --> 01:15:42,743
To tell the truth, so do I.

1103
01:15:44,369 --> 01:15:45,868
The kindergarten bus is here.

1104
01:15:48,932 --> 01:15:51,556
Nohara-sama! Good morning!

1105
01:15:51,932 --> 01:15:54,368
Sorry! Good morning!

1106
01:15:54,869 --> 01:15:58,306
- Good morning!
- Good evening!

1107
01:15:59,182 --> 01:16:01,306
Everyone is waiting, so please hurry.

1108
01:16:01,682 --> 01:16:02,368
Yes.

1109
01:16:06,369 --> 01:16:07,493
Is something the mat--?

1110
01:16:11,244 --> 01:16:13,306
What's happened to your appearance?

1111
01:16:14,544 --> 01:16:15,506
But...

1112
01:16:17,245 --> 01:16:21,069
- Shinnosuke!
- Mommy! My clothes!

1113
01:16:24,795 --> 01:16:25,619
What happened?

1114
01:16:29,932 --> 01:16:32,681
Kazama-kun. Nene-chan.
Matsuo-kun. Bo-chan.

1115
01:16:33,307 --> 01:16:34,331
You're all weird.

1116
01:16:34,331 --> 01:16:35,431
What are you saying?

1117
01:16:35,495 --> 01:16:37,995
- What are you saying is weird?
- The clothes are weird!

1118
01:16:37,995 --> 01:16:39,554
Shin-chan, you're wearing
the same thing, aren't you?

1119
01:16:39,557 --> 01:16:40,994
There's nothing weird
about it at all.

1120
01:16:42,245 --> 01:16:43,869
But it's weird!

1121
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:44,994
Weird.

1122
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,432
It's not.

1123
01:16:47,058 --> 01:16:48,932
Ah.. uh.. Excuse me...

1124
01:16:49,183 --> 01:16:50,932
What's with your clothes?

1125
01:16:51,370 --> 01:16:52,557
Misae!

1126
01:16:53,683 --> 01:16:55,557
What is going on here?

1127
01:16:58,683 --> 01:17:00,682
Don't I have to go to kindergarten?

1128
01:17:00,870 --> 01:17:02,557
You'll have to miss today.

1129
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:08,182
In short...

1130
01:17:08,433 --> 01:17:08,994
This is...

1131
01:17:09,308 --> 01:17:09,994
What is this?

1132
01:17:11,058 --> 01:17:11,744
Don't know.

1133
01:17:11,870 --> 01:17:12,432
That's it!

1134
01:17:12,495 --> 01:17:13,557
Let's turn on the TV!

1135
01:17:13,933 --> 01:17:17,682
...and returning to "Arts Noh
Play Flash Wide."

1136
01:17:17,683 --> 01:17:20,307
And it's live footage of that star.

1137
01:17:20,371 --> 01:17:22,771
Ah! Matsukaza-san has
just come out of the car!

1138
01:17:22,771 --> 01:17:25,471
And in the back seat, the
rumored lover, foreign dancer...

1139
01:17:25,471 --> 01:17:29,857
Jeff, Harry, Tomas, Nick, Jerry,
Mac, Abraham, Gideon, and Charles!

1141
01:17:31,058 --> 01:17:31,495
Ume-san!

1142
01:17:31,496 --> 01:17:32,182
Just one word!

1143
01:17:32,246 --> 01:17:33,495
Ume-san, just a word, please!

1144
01:17:35,183 --> 01:17:36,620
Don't call me Ume!

01:17:37,371 --> 01:17:38,557
Matsuzaka-sensei!

1146
01:17:38,683 --> 01:17:39,682
What is this?

1147
01:17:39,683 --> 01:17:40,682
What about the other channels?

{\an8}<i>Japanese Society

1149
01:17:40,996 --> 01:17:45,745
Sensei, we're going to hear you talk
about today's modern Japan, right?

1150
01:17:45,871 --> 01:17:46,520
Yes, that's right.

1151
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:49,345
Right now Japan is in
year 7 of Hei-Hei-Ho.

1152
01:17:49,371 --> 01:18:03,683
And this is all due to the one who
began his rule over Japan, reviving
Japanese Culture... Really everything
is because of Japan's president,

1153
01:18:03,684 --> 01:18:06,933
his Excellency, Jokoman...

1154
01:18:07,684 --> 01:18:08,808
It's that bad guy!

1155
01:18:08,871 --> 01:18:09,870
What did you say?

1156
01:18:10,246 --> 01:18:11,433
...really grateful...

{\an8}<i>Special Report Program

1158
01:18:12,059 --> 01:18:13,683
We interrupt this program
with an announcement.

1159
01:18:13,684 --> 01:18:18,371
His Beloved Excellency President
Jokoman-sama's new laws for today.

1160
01:18:18,434 --> 01:18:21,308
All channels have been changed
to the government frequency.

1161
01:18:21,372 --> 01:18:25,871
And so people of the country,
his Beloved Excellency President
Pierre Jokoman-sama.

1162
01:18:26,122 --> 01:18:27,933
Please listen reverently.

1163
01:18:28,497 --> 01:18:31,121
Hey, people of my country,
are you all well?

1164
01:18:31,372 --> 01:18:32,683
No, it's okay. It's okay.

1165
01:18:32,883 --> 01:18:34,783
Then I'll announce today's laws, okay?

1166
01:18:35,372 --> 01:18:38,783
Country of Japan. Constitution #389:

1167
01:18:38,843 --> 01:18:42,663
These three, they're called Hiroshi,
Shinnosuke, and Misae Nohara, but...

1168
01:18:42,663 --> 01:18:45,183
I'll give 20 billion yen to the
person who catches them.

1169
01:18:46,622 --> 01:18:48,308
And well, that's that...

1170
01:18:48,872 --> 01:18:52,871
If they die en route, it's half.
10 billion yen, okay?

1171
01:18:52,872 --> 01:18:54,746
We are truly grateful for those words...

1172
01:18:54,810 --> 01:18:57,684
from our Beloved Excellency, our
president Pierre Jokoman-sama...

1173
01:18:58,247 --> 01:19:00,634
Why does he use such awful pictures?!

1174
01:19:01,435 --> 01:19:03,246
I don't think that's the issue here.

1175
01:19:04,372 --> 01:19:06,121
Daddy. Mommy.

1176
01:19:06,171 --> 01:19:08,772
There's something strange
about this world. It's weird!

1177
01:19:09,822 --> 01:19:11,809
You don't have to tell us,
we already know!

1178
01:19:12,122 --> 01:19:12,809
That's it!

1179
01:19:15,497 --> 01:19:16,246
Hello there.

1180
01:19:16,747 --> 01:19:17,934
This world is weird.

1181
01:19:18,185 --> 01:19:19,184
Please respond!

1182
01:19:19,747 --> 01:19:20,372
That's right!

1183
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:21,372
Please answer!

1184
01:19:21,373 --> 01:19:23,559
Hello? Save us!

1185
01:19:23,623 --> 01:19:24,747
Hey!

1186
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:29,684
You're so stupid. Shiro's a dog,
so there's no way he can talk.

1187
01:19:41,748 --> 01:19:42,497
That sound!

1188
01:19:48,373 --> 01:19:49,434
They're here!

1189
01:19:52,811 --> 01:19:54,185
Save me kit!

1190
01:19:56,373 --> 01:19:57,185
It's no good.

1191
01:19:57,436 --> 01:19:59,747
It's gotta be a lie!
Is this the end already?

1192
01:20:21,686 --> 01:20:22,372
Niyaa!

1193
01:20:28,686 --> 01:20:29,998
That was a close call!

1194
01:20:30,374 --> 01:20:31,685
What part?

1195
01:20:31,811 --> 01:20:32,935
It's true!

1196
01:20:33,374 --> 01:20:35,935
You may not have been able
to see it with human eyes...

1197
01:20:35,999 --> 01:20:40,248
but this Meow-On suit can move
at over 20 times the speed of light.

1198
01:20:41,374 --> 01:20:43,435
But the enemy's ninja stars hit it.

1199
01:20:43,811 --> 01:20:45,185
They're really frightening.

1200
01:20:47,561 --> 01:20:50,248
I won't be able to use this
suit anymore, will I?

1201
01:20:50,499 --> 01:20:52,310
Big sister Ring!

1202
01:20:52,436 --> 01:20:53,873
I'm so glad you're ok, Shin-chan.

1203
01:20:53,937 --> 01:20:54,936
You were scared, weren't you?

1204
01:20:55,062 --> 01:20:55,936
It's all right now.

1205
01:20:55,999 --> 01:20:57,311
It was scary.

1206
01:20:58,202 --> 01:20:59,201
No-

1207
01:21:00,002 --> 01:21:01,501
Kids are so lucky...

1208
01:21:01,564 --> 01:21:02,251
What do you mean?

1209
01:21:02,752 --> 01:21:03,313
Nothing...

1210
01:21:04,564 --> 01:21:06,126
I think you've already realized...

1211
01:21:06,314 --> 01:21:11,938
but now, Pierre Jokoman, Unkokusai's
real identity who didn't die in the Age of
Civil Wars and escaped to this age...

1212
01:21:12,127 --> 01:21:14,188
is changing history once again.

1213
01:21:15,377 --> 01:21:19,938
But, why did only our memories
and Misae's clothing not change?

1214
01:21:21,127 --> 01:21:25,227
The Nohara family passed three
days in the Age of Civil Wars...

1215
01:21:25,227 --> 01:21:28,064
so there is a lag of three days
before time catches up with you.

1216
01:21:28,252 --> 01:21:32,251
And then I came to get your clothing,
so there is a lag of one hour.

1217
01:21:32,752 --> 01:21:36,251
Probably Hiroshi-san and Shin-chan,
you changed in this world?

1218
01:21:36,377 --> 01:21:37,126
Now that you mention it...

1219
01:21:38,752 --> 01:21:43,576
Soon, Misae-san's clothing will
change due to the readjusted time.

1220
01:21:43,812 --> 01:21:48,176
5... 4... 3... 2... 1.

1221
01:21:54,212 --> 01:21:57,916
What? That's why I just don't
understand SciFi and I hate it!

1222
01:21:58,416 --> 01:22:01,266
Hey, isn't it strange that
you understand so much?

1223
01:22:03,565 --> 01:22:05,439
I've not talked about it to you until now...

1224
01:22:05,565 --> 01:22:08,102
During my high school days,
I was in the SciFi club.

1225
01:22:08,503 --> 01:22:10,752
Even though I look like this,
I'm a SciFi fan.

1226
01:22:11,003 --> 01:22:12,064
Oh really.

1227
01:22:13,253 --> 01:22:15,377
Hey! Don't despise me.

1228
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:17,064
We don't have time.

1229
01:22:17,315 --> 01:22:18,564
We will go to where Pierre is.

1230
01:22:19,128 --> 01:22:20,564
We're going, too?

1231
01:22:21,065 --> 01:22:22,439
How are we going to fight?

1232
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:24,314
We have a very good
chance for victory!

1233
01:22:25,065 --> 01:22:27,314
And Shin-chan holds the key.

1234
01:22:28,441 --> 01:22:32,316
"Holds" has a kind of heart-rending,
ecchi perverted ring to it...

1235
01:22:32,316 --> 01:22:34,252
It's not ecchi at all!

1236
01:22:36,316 --> 01:22:37,940
Grown ups just don't understand.

1237
01:22:39,416 --> 01:22:44,002
{\an8}<i>Capitol: Tokyo

1238
01:22:40,066 --> 01:22:40,702
We're taking off!

1239
01:23:07,129 --> 01:23:10,315
Time criminal, Pierre Jokoman,
you can't escape anymore!

1240
01:23:10,441 --> 01:23:12,378
Quietly accept the rope!

1241
01:23:13,629 --> 01:23:14,315
Not that...

1242
01:23:14,441 --> 01:23:16,815
I mean... Time Crime Dictates #12,
I will arrest you!

1243
01:23:17,316 --> 01:23:19,315
Oh. Oh. Is that so?

1244
01:23:23,379 --> 01:23:25,440
That you know my name...

1245
01:23:27,617 --> 01:23:29,866
I guess I've become a
really famous person.

1246
01:23:30,017 --> 01:23:32,866
It seems my name will
live on in history.

1247
01:23:33,817 --> 01:23:35,316
Pierre Jokoman.

1248
01:23:35,367 --> 01:23:38,556
The gentleman who governs
20th century Japans.

1249
01:23:38,817 --> 01:23:42,441
Oh, but if I get caught here, then
everything will return to normal.

1250
01:23:43,004 --> 01:23:45,066
My hard work will become
bubbles upon water.

1251
01:23:47,129 --> 01:23:49,316
Oh, I don't like it. Don't like it.
Things like this.

1252
01:23:49,692 --> 01:23:51,878
You who get in my way, I'll kill you!

1253
01:24:33,310 --> 01:24:34,434
You're so small.

1254
01:24:34,498 --> 01:24:36,684
You're so small! You're so small!

1255
01:24:43,748 --> 01:24:44,872
What is that?

1256
01:24:44,998 --> 01:24:46,747
Say, why don't we run away?

1257
01:24:46,873 --> 01:24:47,934
Don't worry.

1258
01:24:47,935 --> 01:24:50,684
As long as we have faith,
the Time Patrol won't lose.

1259
01:24:51,310 --> 01:24:53,247
Time Reactionary Hat Hat!

1260
01:24:53,435 --> 01:24:55,934
If you press the switch on the
side of this box, it will shine.

1261
01:24:55,998 --> 01:24:58,684
You have to heighten the power
of this super dramatic tool.

1262
01:25:00,498 --> 01:25:02,787
- That's nice, but...
- And so what's going to happen?

1263
01:25:03,248 --> 01:25:05,560
At this point, we need the
cooperation of a child.

1264
01:25:06,998 --> 01:25:07,810
That's me!

1265
01:25:08,061 --> 01:25:10,622
I'll wear it! I'll wear it!

1266
01:25:10,811 --> 01:25:11,685
Of course!

1267
01:25:19,873 --> 01:25:21,185
Electromagnetic waves are coming out!

1268
01:25:21,583 --> 01:25:23,935
Because we need it, you can
see the electricity of the future.

1269
01:25:24,186 --> 01:25:25,497
Oh, that makes sense.

1270
01:25:26,123 --> 01:25:26,810
Then...

1271
01:25:26,873 --> 01:25:27,747
Let's go!

1272
01:25:46,686 --> 01:25:48,623
We'll connect to Shin-chan's
sense of aesthetics and...

1273
01:25:48,624 --> 01:25:51,035
change into a robot
that can defeat Unkokusai's robot.

1274
01:25:51,311 --> 01:25:53,373
It's too convenient.

1275
01:25:53,686 --> 01:25:56,310
Normal people like us,
just can't keep up.

1276
01:25:56,936 --> 01:25:57,873
No need to worry.

1277
01:25:58,249 --> 01:26:00,873
Even if you don't keep up, time
will flow of it's own accord.

1278
01:26:01,249 --> 01:26:03,060
It's enough to just do what
we have to do now.

1279
01:26:03,436 --> 01:26:04,810
I'm counting on you, Shin-chan!

1280
01:26:14,999 --> 01:26:16,811
Kantamu Robot arrives!

1281
01:26:26,374 --> 01:26:28,248
What? What's happening?

1282
01:26:28,749 --> 01:26:31,998
This robot is created entirely
by Shin-chan's imagination.

1283
01:26:33,937 --> 01:26:35,936
What's the power supply, Shinnosuke?

1284
01:26:42,812 --> 01:26:44,374
It's Mice-san!

1285
01:26:45,687 --> 01:26:47,499
The computer is Shiro.

1286
01:26:48,250 --> 01:26:50,499
Too much! This is just too much!

1287
01:26:50,750 --> 01:26:53,061
That's why I hate SciFi!

1288
01:26:53,375 --> 01:26:55,499
It's not all that, really.

1289
01:26:55,625 --> 01:26:56,811
We're not praising you!

1290
01:27:04,437 --> 01:27:06,061
It's getting to be interesting.

1291
01:27:06,125 --> 01:27:07,374
It's getting near the end.

1292
01:27:07,750 --> 01:27:09,249
It's getting to be so I'm not bored.

1293
01:27:51,101 --> 01:27:52,862
A. B. A. B. Left. Right.

1294
01:27:53,001 --> 01:27:55,062
Buri Buri PUNCH!

1295
01:28:05,251 --> 01:28:07,625
It feels goooood!

1296
01:28:27,251 --> 01:28:28,875
Misae PUNCH!

1297
01:28:37,364 --> 01:28:38,750
Alrigth! Got him!

1298
01:28:39,001 --> 01:28:40,250
It's an amazing weapon!

1299
01:28:50,064 --> 01:28:51,876
The Misae Punch doesn't work.

1300
01:28:52,564 --> 01:28:54,313
It's not my fault.

1301
01:28:54,377 --> 01:28:55,501
What are you going to do Shinnosuke?

1302
01:28:56,002 --> 01:28:57,438
Time for the Action Beam Gun.

1303
01:28:58,002 --> 01:28:59,438
Action Beam Gun?

1304
01:28:59,627 --> 01:29:03,438
Dad. Mom.
You do the commands with me!

1305
01:29:03,939 --> 01:29:06,501
A. B. B. A. A. B.
Right. Right. Left!

1306
01:29:06,814 --> 01:29:07,876
What's that?

1307
01:29:08,064 --> 01:29:09,376
I can't learn it.

1308
01:29:09,939 --> 01:29:11,501
It's the Action Beam Gun!

1309
01:29:11,564 --> 01:29:12,581
SET!

1310
01:29:14,002 --> 01:29:16,064
I won't just sit here and lose.

1311
01:29:16,277 --> 01:29:18,001
Love and Truth-chan.

1312
01:29:19,077 --> 01:29:19,876
Fire!

1313
01:29:23,302 --> 01:29:25,926
A. B. B. A. A. B.
Right. Right. Left!

1314
01:29:26,252 --> 01:29:28,876
A. B. B. A. A. B.
Right. Right. Left!

1315
01:29:32,190 --> 01:29:33,814
Oh! A mistake!

1316
01:29:39,002 --> 01:29:40,626
We've messed up the code.

1317
01:29:41,002 --> 01:29:42,064
Oops. It's me.

1318
01:29:42,565 --> 01:29:44,001
I messed up, too.

1319
01:29:47,503 --> 01:29:49,127
It'll be over in one more shot, eh?

1320
01:29:50,003 --> 01:29:51,314
Super Effective.

1321
01:29:51,378 --> 01:29:53,597
Sin and Punishment-chan. Fire!

1322
01:29:56,702 --> 01:29:59,047
I'm counting on you, Shin-chan,
Hiroshi-san, Misae-san!

1323
01:29:59,353 --> 01:30:00,914
I love you, Misae!

1324
01:30:00,978 --> 01:30:02,289
I know!

1325
01:30:03,528 --> 01:30:06,039
I  l o v e  y o - - - u !

1326
01:30:26,166 --> 01:30:27,540
Game over.

1327
01:30:27,978 --> 01:30:29,415
Time up.

1328
01:30:41,353 --> 01:30:42,415
Is it over now?

1329
01:30:42,853 --> 01:30:43,852
It's over.

1330
01:30:44,291 --> 01:30:45,290
We can go home, right?

1331
01:30:45,853 --> 01:30:46,552
You can go home.

1332
01:30:47,228 --> 01:30:48,665
Won't you marry me?

1333
01:30:50,291 --> 01:30:51,040
I will not.

1334
01:30:57,854 --> 01:31:00,204
...and with the prevention of the
destruction of the environment...

1335
01:31:00,204 --> 01:31:02,204
and the preservation and further
propagation of nature's animals...

1336
01:31:02,204 --> 01:31:05,165
also came a bright
parent-child realtionship.

1337
01:31:05,215 --> 01:31:07,015
Why don't you just say the
"Peace of the Earth?"

1338
01:31:07,666 --> 01:31:09,103
I just wanted to say that once.

1339
01:31:09,291 --> 01:31:10,103
It's okay now.

1340
01:31:10,104 --> 01:31:13,053
I'm in debt to you, the
members of the Nohara family.

1341
01:31:13,416 --> 01:31:17,165
I'm sorry, but according to the
doctrines of time, I'm forbidden
to give you physical itmes.

1342
01:31:17,479 --> 01:31:20,728
All I can give you are words of gratitude.

1343
01:31:21,292 --> 01:31:22,853
Thank you so very much!

1344
01:31:23,917 --> 01:31:27,166
Just those words are enough.
I don't need anything else.

1345
01:31:27,354 --> 01:31:29,041
A toast to your eyes.

1346
01:31:29,042 --> 01:31:30,166
You guys!

1347
01:31:30,167 --> 01:31:32,228
Quit it already!!

1348
01:31:52,792 --> 01:31:54,041
Are we back?

1349
01:31:54,355 --> 01:31:54,916
Probably.

1350
01:31:55,605 --> 01:31:57,666
So everyone, please take your seats.

1351
01:31:58,542 --> 01:31:59,351
Please get in closer!

1352
01:32:00,382 --> 01:32:01,229
She's still here.

1353
01:32:01,605 --> 01:32:02,791
We were a bit early, then.

1354
01:32:02,980 --> 01:32:04,791
She's pretty clumsy, isn't she?

1355
01:32:05,917 --> 01:32:06,979
Is everybody ready?

1356
01:32:07,117 --> 01:32:07,779
Yeah.

1357
01:32:09,792 --> 01:32:12,229
And we didn't even know what
disasters were waiting for us!

1358
01:32:13,980 --> 01:32:15,854
Do your best, Nohara family!

1359
01:32:26,293 --> 01:32:27,917
Well, I'll be going!

1360
01:32:28,855 --> 01:32:30,229
Good morning!

1361
01:32:30,418 --> 01:32:31,479
Good morning.

1362
01:32:31,730 --> 01:32:34,917
Yoshinaga-sensei.
You're even cuter today!

1363
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:36,042
What?

1364
01:32:36,043 --> 01:32:37,167
Hey! Midori!

1365
01:32:37,605 --> 01:32:38,354
Hey!

1366
01:32:38,668 --> 01:32:41,229
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

1367
01:32:41,918 --> 01:32:43,667
Shin-chan, you're early today.

1368
01:32:43,730 --> 01:32:44,667
How admirable.

1369
01:32:45,668 --> 01:32:46,604
I'm admirable!

1370
01:32:46,730 --> 01:32:49,604
After all I protected and
preserved the peace of the earth!

1371
01:32:51,918 --> 01:32:55,042
It's just something kids say,
please don't take him seriously!

1372
01:32:55,043 --> 01:32:55,655
Of course.

1373
01:32:55,731 --> 01:32:56,917
I'm used to it.

1374
01:32:57,756 --> 01:32:59,542
Ready to Leaf! My meef!

1375
01:32:59,856 --> 01:33:10,167
My butt is cute, but Misae's butt
is big, so big! And to top it off
she's a breastless gal! Misae!

1376
01:33:10,168 --> 01:33:10,792
Hey!

1377
01:33:16,231 --> 01:33:18,417
Just when you think he made
it to the bus on time...

1378
01:33:18,668 --> 01:33:21,105
Really, those people never
make any progress.

1379
01:33:22,106 --> 01:33:23,855
So much energy for the morning.

1380
01:33:39,994 --> 01:33:43,794
<i>Everyone a paradise
you've never experienced

1381
01:33:43,794 --> 01:33:47,305
