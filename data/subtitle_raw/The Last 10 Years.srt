1
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,600
They doubted I'd live long enough

2
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,880
to see him start school.

3
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,480
But I did...

4
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,000
I was there.

5
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,640
Apparently,
he's made lots of friends.

6
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,400
He's more sociable than I thought.

7
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,680
I'd love to watch him grow up.

8
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,520
Wish I could have a little longer...

9
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,120
Although I know it won't happen.

10
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,040
Matsuri, my dear...

11
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,920
live every minute to the fullest.

12
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,080
The Last 10 Years

13
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,200
The Last 10 Years

14
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,160
August 14th, 2013.

15
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,000
It's sunny... incredibly sunny.

16
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,000
Perfect weather to leave hospital.

17
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,800
My lengthy stay is finally over.

18
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,240
What are you doing? Lend a hand.

19
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,520
Here is my totally
unsympathetic sister.

20
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,960
Mom, you're talking too much,
hurry up.

21
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,360
OK...

22
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,800
You owe her a lot.
We should thank her properly.

23
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,320
Hello.

24
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,480
Dr Hirata.

25
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,880
Thank you for everything.

26
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,680
Congratulations on
going home, Matsuri.

27
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,120
Doctor, we're so grateful
for all you have done.

28
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,200
Not at all.

29
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,560
It's a new chapter.

30
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,720
Is that the SkyTree?

31
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,640
Yep, finished last year.

32
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,480
Wow, it's massive.

33
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,840
I want to go see it.

34
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,280
Sis, let's go together.

35
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,320
No way. I can't stand heights.

36
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,560
That's not fair.

37
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:18,520
I'll write in my will
that you wouldn't take me.

38
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,800
Hey, don't guilt trip me.

39
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,640
Enough filming. Give it here.

40
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,480
Two years on, home sweet home.

41
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,080
Wait.

42
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,560
I'm home.

43
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,040
It's much tidier than when I left.

44
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,896

00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,920

Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
or PAH

48

Incidence: 1 or 2 cases per million

50
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,760
High risk of sudden mortality

Show-Your-Belly-Button contest!

52
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,120
An older woman with PAH
joins our ward

53
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,120
BFF's... Matsuri & Sanae

Matsuri!

57
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,760
Welcome back, Matsuri!

58
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,960
Thank you, guys!

59
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,480
Two, three.

60
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,960
Thank you so much...

61
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,160
This is Akira,
the restaurant manager.

62
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,600
Congratulations.

63
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,320
- Much appreciated.
- Thank you very much.

64
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,720
- Shall I cut the cake?
- Please.

65
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
- Alright.
- Thank you.

66
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,200
- Is that him?
- He's the boyfriend?

67
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,280
Yes, he is.

68
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,680
Are you serious?

69
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,880
- So?
- Put it away!

70
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,560
How annoying!

71
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:16,240
This really takes me back.
It's just like college.

72
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,360
You're right.

73
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,000
I just wish the school
had been more helpful.

74
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,480
They should've made
a special exception for you.

75
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,120
I wish we could've
graduated together.

76
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,560
Thank you.

77
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,760
But everything's good now?

78
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,240
I still need a monthly check-up.

79
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,080
I never imagined you'd be in
that long. We were so worried.

80
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,640
In any case, you're out now.

81
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:48,400
Get a boyfriend, get to work...
Your whole life's ahead of you!

82
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,880
You've got to embrace it.

83
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,280
Heck, I hate my job.

84
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,000
They want a meeting
at this hour? Forget it.

85
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,480
- Bye, gals.
- Bye-bye!

86
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,360
They haven't changed at all.

87
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,800
Taking it easy at home for a while?

88
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,440
I guess.

89
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,560
By the way, are you still writing?

90
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,120
Your novel?

91
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:34,440
I gave up while I was in hospital.
There was nothing to write about.

92
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,280
I always loved your writing.

93
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,880
I've become an editor

94
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,640
and I find we're always
short of writers.

95
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,800
If you could lend a hand,
it'd be amazing.

96
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,800
I wouldn't want to disappoint you.

97
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,520
That's not likely.

98
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,240
I'll take this.

99
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,480
Dad?

100
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,680
I see you, yeah.

101
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,160
I'd better go.

102
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,960
Thanks for today.

103
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,520
Anyway, call me
if you change your mind.

104
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,080
- See you.
- Bye-bye.

105
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,800
- I'm home.
- Welcome back.

106
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,480
Nice to see the old gang?

107
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,120
It was fun.

108
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,680
Something came for you in the mail.

109
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,200
What's that?

110
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,360
"Disability allowance"?

111
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,880
That's a lot!

112
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,360
In exchange for my body and soul.

113
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,680
Don't say that.

114
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,360
They chose a nostalgic spot.

115
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,880
What is it? A class reunion?

116
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,176
Invitation to Mishima M.S. Reunion

117
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,120
Haven't seen them
since graduating middle school.

118
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,160
Sounds like fun.

119
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:42,560
Class reunions are great for
finding your future husband.

120
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,200
I'm never falling in love.

121
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,640
You never know.

122
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,880
But it might be fun.

123
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,920
Nobody there knows about my illness.

124
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,056
2020 Summer Olympics
to be held in Tokyo

125
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,760
Tokyo will be hosting.

126
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,320
56 years since the last time.

127
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,040
The Tokyo Olympics

128
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,240
are seven years off.

129
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,560
What kind of event will it be?

130
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,480
This takes me back...

131
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,280
You haven't seen them since?

132
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,680
Right.

133
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,600
I wonder how they're doing?

134
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,200
Call if you don't feel well, OK?

135
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,880
I know that.

136
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,560
Say something.

137
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,120
It takes me back.

138
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,920
Is that all you can say?

139
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,640
Sorry.

140
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,360
I'll be fine, OK?

141
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,800
You going in?

142
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,560
Sorry, go ahead.

143
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,680
Takabayashi?

144
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,240
You are...

145
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,000
Matsuri? Is it you?

146
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,640
Miyuki?

147
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,040
It's been a while!

148
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,400
You haven't changed at all!

149
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,480
Really?

150
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,920
Matsuri...

151
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,520
Miyuki, show me your daughter...

152
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,040
- Here.
- Let me see.

153
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,040
She's grown even more.

154
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,480
But she's quite a handful.

155
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,680
But adorable, too.

156
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,480
No, she's a little monster.

157
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,000
Matsuri, you're in Tokyo, right?

158
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,440
Yes.

159
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,320
Lucky you. What do you do?

160
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,840
Well... just a regular office job.

161
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,880
Wow. An office gig in Tokyo.

162
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,960
What kind of office?

163
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:31,640
Publishing related.

164
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,600
Publishing!

165
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,880
Us Tokyo folks should hang out.

166
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,280
It'll be the three of us. Eh, Kazu?

167
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,520
Let's get together in Tokyo.

168
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,640
Sure...

169
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,520
You're still in Tokyo?

170
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,400
Didn't you take over
your dad's company?

171
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,720
It's a total mystery.
He'd be set for life.

172
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,800
Why don't you?

173
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,800
Well, it's not
as easy as you think.

174
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,800
- Unbelievable...
- What's the problem?

175
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,360
Takeru, it's time for the main event.

176
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,760
Oh, you're right.

177
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,760
Listen everyone, check this out.

178
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,000
Do you remember this?

179
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,400
Our time capsules!

180
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,120
"Letters to Our Future Selves!"

181
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,880
I'll call out your names
and hand them out.

182
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,360
Here we go!

183
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,040
Nabe, your turn!

184
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,240
Takabayashi Matsuri

185
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,520
Here you go, Matsuri!

186
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,160
Matsuri, here.

187
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,840
Manabe Kazuto, here you go!

188
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,200
To myself ten years from now:

189
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,280
How are you? I'm exhausted
with studies and sports.

190
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,640
But I'm happy and working hard.
What job do you do, I wonder?

191
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,920
Any boyfriends?
Did you become a writer?

192
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,280
Please have a great life.

193
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,920
This way to the next bar!

194
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,880
This way, everyone!

195
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,560
Manabe.

196
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,520
Everyone's going to the next place.

197
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,160
Are you OK?

198
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,320
I'll get you some water.

199
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,000
Here...

200
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,160
It's been ages since I saw anyone.

201
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,680
I was so nervous,
I drank way too much.

202
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,320
You must wonder why I even came...

203
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,680
Takabayashi...

204
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,200
You don't remember me, do you?

205
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,040
That's not true.

206
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,520
When we were in eighth grade...

207
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,960
you fixed a button for me

208
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,000
and I never forgot
how happy that made me.

209
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,960
Oh yeah, I think I remember that.

210
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,400
There's no way you'd remember.

211
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,160
You're right. Sorry.

212
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,280
We're off.

213
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Leave each other alone.

214
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,680
They've all grown up.

215
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,880
We used to have so much fun.

216
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,160
Today was fun.

217
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,360
See you.

218
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,680
Dismissal Notice

219
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,240
To myself ten years from now:

220
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,840
I guess you're slaving away
at Dad's company

221
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:06,600
busy at work and in love.
Have fun as an adult.

222
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,560
- Are you sure?
- Yes, these are the ones.

223
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,120
Yellow in the front.

224
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,920
Why are you dressed like that?

225
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,040
Job interview.

226
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,080
Anything to do with the reunion?

227
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,440
Not particularly.

228
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,400
Just don't want to die of boredom.

229
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:51,400
Don't talk about dying
in front of them, OK?

230
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,400
I know that.

231
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,000
Don't be in a rush.

232
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,920
Go at your own pace.

233
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,440
Yes. See you later.

234
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,560
Good luck.

235
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,040
Let's see.

236
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,200
You quit college in your junior year.

237
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,560
Yes.

238
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,520
Any part-time work experience?

239
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,280
None.

240
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,240
I see.

241
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:27,040
By the way, are you fully recovered?

242
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,440
Well...

243
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:41,800
Mother

244
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,000
Hello?

245
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,120
Matsuri, sorry I'm late.

246
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,920
Traffic was terrible.

247
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,560
Thank you so much for coming.

248
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,640
What's going on?

249
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,680
Well...

250
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,680
I don't really know myself.

251
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:14,840
Seems like he jumped off his veranda.

252
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,800
It's not life-threatening

253
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,800
but his folks called
asking me to go see him.

254
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,040
Why the hell don't they go?

255
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,360
Excuse me.

256
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,720
Why are you here?

257
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,840
Your dad got in touch.

258
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,920
What's going on?

259
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,800
I see.

260
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,760
Sorry to bother you.

261
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,160
Both of you.

262
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,200
Heck...

263
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,480
Did you have a fight with your folks?

264
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,760
They ought to be here.

265
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,480
Ought to...

266
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,560
I basically cut all ties.

267
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,880
They're better off
without me, I guess.

268
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,480
That's your reason?

269
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,920
I don't know.

270
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,040
Buddy.

271
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,040
Is this about your job?

272
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,880
I got fired last month.

273
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,520
That's no reason to jump...

274
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,120
I had fun the other day.

275
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,560
Seeing everyone...

276
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,120
All living a good life.

277
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,680
Except me.

278
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,800
What do you mean?

279
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,760
In my time capsule

280
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,800
I wrote, "Have fun as an adult."

281
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,520
Sounds stupid, doesn't it?

282
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,200
Here's me running away
from my parents' plans.

283
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,000
Still not knowing
the meaning of living.

284
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,680
The thought of my life going on
this way with no end in sight...

285
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,000
I just felt...

286
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,880
Felt like what, you jerk?

287
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,640
Matsuri?

288
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,480
Sorry, I'm heading home.

289
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,560
What's the matter?

290
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,560
I don't really know you...

291
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,560
but what you did
seems incredibly selfish.

292
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,480
Take care.

293
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,520
Takabayashi.

294
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:42,200
Here's your card. Take care.

295
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,040
Things are looking good.

296
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,840
No change to the meds

297
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,200
but keep your salt intake low
and don't overexert yourself.

298
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,920
Got it.

299
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,680
How is it being back home?

300
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,760
I'm bored and I can't work.

301
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,880
I'm just counting the days really.

302
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,880
Matsuri, I know you've read up
about this disease

303
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,360
but there are no absolutes.

304
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,040
Treatments are evolving,
so let's keep our spirits up.

305
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,560
I'm waiting for you
to create a wonder drug.

306
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,680
Of course, I'll do my best.

307
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,440
It's for you, Matsuri.

308
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Is it from the reunion?

309
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,360
Let me see.

310
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,200
Is that Miyuki?

311
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,760
She looks totally different.

312
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,200
They're all so grown-up...

313
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,520
Yes?

314
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,720
It's me, Manabe.

315
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:35,160
I got out of hospital last week.
I wonder if we could talk.

316
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,480
Let's celebrate his recovery!
I'll text you.

317
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,520
- Got it? I'm going now. See you.
- What... wait a sec...

318
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,600
I feel like having everything here.

319
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,320
Everything this guy cooks is amazing.

320
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,160
- There you are.
- Thank you!

321
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,200
So these are friends from
middle school.

322
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,320
Welcome.

323
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:09,480
Gen is like my Tokyo dad.
He's been my mentor forever.

324
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,520
Enjoy yourselves.

325
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,200
OK... let's make a toast.

326
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,840
Well...

327
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,880
Congratulations on
your discharge. Cheers!

328
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:37,200
Tonight, we're here to listen.
Right, Matsuri?

329
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,800
Why me?

330
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:45,360
It ended awkwardly last time.
So he said he wanted to talk.

331
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,280
Go ahead.

332
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,480
What? Am I in your way?

333
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,800
Could you... just give me a sec?

334
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,880
Sorry about this.

335
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,200
- OK...
- Sorry.

336
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,640
Sure... I get it.

337
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,320
Sorry for the other day.

338
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,560
I'm the one who should apologize.

339
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,440
I'm glad you're out of hospital.

340
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,000
I mean...

341
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:42,280
I saw you at the hospital.

342
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,640
Is it a serious illness?

343
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,440
Your poor mother...

344
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,680
I thought about what you said.

345
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,760
About being selfish...

346
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,720
Some folk want to live but can't.

347
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:22,360
I was inconsiderate and
I blabbered on like a spoiled jerk.

348
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,920
I'm truly sorry.

349
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,760
Don't kill off my mum just like that.

350
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,920
Sorry, it came out all wrong.

351
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,480
Then, tell me what you meant.

352
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,920
Well, I mean...

353
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,000
How should I put it...

354
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,360
- Hey, Takeru.
- Are you done?

355
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,560
This guy's killing off my mother.

356
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,040
What do you mean?

357
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,520
No, no, that's not it.
I didn't mean that.

358
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,160
- What the hell?
- Explain, please.

359
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,840
- What's up?
- Well, it's just...

360
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,720
- Kazu, see her home, OK?
- Yes, I get it.

361
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,200
- I'll be fine.
- Got it?

362
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,760
- You may drive. Thanks.
- See you soon.

363
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,640
Sorry, it's my dad.

364
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,120
Yes.

365
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,600
I'm heading home now.

366
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,880
Don't worry.
I can get home by myself.

367
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,400
OK.

368
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,760
You get on with your folks.

369
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,520
They're over-protective.

370
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,680
I'm an adult by now.

371
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,680
That's so beautiful.

372
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Why do you have a camera?

373
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,560
I want to leave a record
of every beautiful thing I see.

374
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,160
That's kinda nice.

375
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,000
So, what's the plan now?

376
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,560
That's unexpected.

377
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,240
The plan now...

378
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,160
I don't really know.

379
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,960
For a start...

380
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,880
get a job...

381
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,240
pay the rent...

382
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,720
What the heck?

383
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,400
Give me something more profound.

384
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,000
Something else?

385
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,200
What could it be?

386
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,080
OK then...

387
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,480
I'm going to hang in there

388
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,480
so no more thoughts of dying.

389
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,760
OK.

390
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,240
- Wow...
- That was unexpected.

391
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,000
OK.

392
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,760
Really? The guy sounds like a weirdo.

393
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,200
I wonder...

394
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,160
Over here.

395
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,000
I'm surprised.

396
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,880
If I were you, I'd be angry with him.

397
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,320
Yes. But I almost felt like
I understood him a little.

398
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,560
The feeling of wanting to run away.

399
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:07,160
Just one unemployed slacker
looking out for another.

400
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,720
But as of today, you're...

401
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:15,040
I love you so much, Sanae.
Thank you.

402
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,880
In return, you find me a cute guy.

403
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,240
Let's meet the chief editor.

404
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,360
- Chief.
- Yes?

405
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:34,240
This is Takabayashi Matsuri,
our new writer.

406
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,440
I'm Namigawa. Nice to meet you.
I'm happy you're on board.

407
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,840
Sanae's been praising your writing.

408
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,160
Well, I'll do my best.

409
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,960
Good to hear. Show her around.

410
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,240
I will. Thank you very much.

411
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,560
I hope it's good.

412
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,120
It looks tasty.

413
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,680
I've got something to tell you.

414
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,720
Anything wrong?

415
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,320
I've got a job.

416
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,520
What sort of job?

417
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,560
Writing articles. Working from
home so it's low-stress.

418
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,560
That's good. But don't overdo it.

419
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,120
I'll be fine.

420
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,840
Hey there.

421
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,360
Hi, what's going on?

422
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,960
Like this...

423
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,440
Manabe?

424
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,560
Funny, huh?

425
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,880
Welcome.

426
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,240
- Sorry for the wait.
- Thank you.

427
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,920
- A lot of froth, isn't it?
- Sorry. You're right.

428
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,480
Does it suit me?

429
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,000
I'm at a loss for words...

430
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,760
The boss is getting old
and was looking for a helper.

431
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,240
So, I presented
our unemployed buddy.

432
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,440
Right, Gen?

433
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,800
He forced him on me actually.

434
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,880
Yeah, maybe.

435
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,360
You know...

436
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,560
I've been thinking after we talked...

437
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,120
I figured...

438
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,880
it was time to do what I could.

439
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,480
That's great.

440
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,920
It does suit you.

441
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,320
Excuse me.

442
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,960
Hey, you're on duty.

443
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,320
Thanks.

444
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,520
Sorry.

445
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,160
I'd like to order
sliced onions and...

446
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,880
- Yes, sliced onions...
- potatoes...

447
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,200
- potatoes...
- mountain yams and...

448
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,440
Mountain yams...

449
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,880
- And spicy cod roe as well.
- Got it.

450
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,440
- One beer...
- You like beer?

451
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,760
Run!

452
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,880
Let's race to the water.

453
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,240
The waves are great.

454
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,520
Surf's up!

455
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,320
It's fantastic.

456
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,320
I'm soaked.

457
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,976
Book Review by Takabayashi Matsuri

458
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Awesome!

459
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,880
Reduced salt recipe.

460
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,000
Behold!

461
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,560
Congratulations.

462
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,120
You should come next year, Matsuri!

463
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,720
Are you two...

464
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,880
Are you serious? Really?

465
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,640
This book made me rethink
the meaning of summer.

466
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,560
Merry Christmas!

467
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,760
I won!

468
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,840
She did it!

469
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,840
It's time to cut the cake.

470
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:56,040
Congratulations!

471
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,000
Congratulations.

472
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,000
Now, it's the bride's turn
to give a slice to the groom.

473
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:16,520
The bigger the slice,
the more she loves him!

474
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,520
Didn't the bride look lovely?

475
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:43,560
I'm glad she's settled but it makes
you wonder about the little sister.

476
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:47,040
But I thought
Matsuri looked well today.

477
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,880
I heard...

478
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,920
she's got three to four years
at most.

479
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:55,880
Is that right?

480
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:02,680
I feel sorry for my sister
having to face the loss of a child.

481
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,160
The poor thing's so young.

482
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,880
I'm starving.

483
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,160
Your own restaurant, for real?

484
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,520
Not right away.
I need to study first.

485
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:25,400
Gen said
it'd take a couple of years.

486
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:30,360
But I'm having my doubts.

487
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:31,560
Why?

488
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,680
Because...

489
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,000
I'm happy the way things are now.

490
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:47,600
I wish everything could
stay the same.

491
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:50,680
That's your character flaw,
right there.

492
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,600
But it's endearing, too.

493
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,600
- Thanks for coming.
- Thank you, guys.

494
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,280
- I'll call you.
- Sure.

495
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,240
Make sure you seal the deal.

496
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,800
- Leave him alone.
- See you.

497
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,400
Good night.

498
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,600
Good night, then. Bye.

499
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,560
Good night, thanks.

500
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,520
Let me do that.

501
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,200
It's OK.

502
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:33,480
Takeru and Sanae make a nice couple.

503
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,360
I knew they'd get along well.

504
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,920
It's all thanks to you, Matsuri.

505
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,800
Thank you.

506
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:11,240
You're being weird.

507
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,200
The thing is...

508
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,560
What do I mean to you?

509
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,240
"Mean"?

510
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:52,760
I don't know.

511
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,200
I should tidy up.

512
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,680
Sorry, I've got to go.

513
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,400
We'll try different medication.

514
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:18,800
I'll up the furosemide
and let's add another drug.

515
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,760
Nothing to worry about.

516
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:29,560
Sometimes you develop a tolerance
so it's best to try another.

517
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:34,800
This new one is called Uptravi...

518
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:09,400
Kazu: I need to talk.
Meet tomorrow?

519
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:26,240
Sorry things got weird the other day.

520
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,400
I just want things to be clear.

521
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,400
I like how we are now.

522
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:42,360
You yourself said you wanted
things to stay the same.

523
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,520
That's something totally different.

524
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,480
That's just personal opinion.

525
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,000
Wait a second, will you?

526
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,520
Did I do anything to upset you?

527
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,000
I'm not upset.

528
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,880
It's odd to drag things on like this.

529
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,280
If I'm not boyfriend material to you,
just tell me so.

530
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:11,320
Because... I really like you.

531
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,120
I want to be with you.

532
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,000
That's just how you feel right now.

533
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:26,440
Your life is full.
It's nice having me around.

534
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:29,200
How could you even say that?

535
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,000
I'm warning you.

536
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:38,560
You might regret
meeting this odd woman.

537
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,480
That's not a normal thing to say.

538
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:44,680
- "Normal"... what is that?
- It's just... normal is normal.

539
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:48,320
You don't know me,
so don't make assumptions!

540
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,680
Matsuri, are you OK?

541
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,120
Sorry...

542
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,160
Wait...

543
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:09,360
Hey, Matsuri...

544
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,200
What's going on, Matsuri?

545
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,080
Matsuri?

546
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,520
Matsuri?

547
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,760
What's going on, Matsuri?

548
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:22,840
Matsuri?

549
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:02,360
Matsuri?

550
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,120
Kazu...

551
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:09,800
Are you OK?

552
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:16,320
It's just a touch of anemia.

553
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,240
Your dad told me...

554
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,280
"Stick with her through this."

555
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,480
Talk to me.

556
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:48,000
I got really sick when I was 20.

557
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,880
I had two operations.

558
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,120
I have the scars here.

559
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:05,480
There's a risk of seizure...

560
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,680
so I can't play sports or anything.

561
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:14,760
Sorry.

562
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,480
I acted all tough but look at me.

563
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,880
It's like a joke.

564
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:26,680
Not at all.

565
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,160
First, get some rest.

566
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,520
You don't understand.

567
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:44,760
I'm not who you think I am.

568
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,560
Don't come see me anymore.

569
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,400
I don't want to see you.

570
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:47,640
See you later.

571
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,040
Where are you off to?

572
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:51,480
Just around the corner.

573
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,520
You've only just got out of hospital.

574
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,680
It's fine. Stop worrying.

575
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:56,800
Matsuri...

576
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,440
Can we talk?

577
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,160
What is it?

578
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:04,560
I've had an idea. Dad, come too.

579
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:20,520
This place has opened
a transplant facility.

580
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,880
What is a lung transplant?

581
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:28,520
I thought I'd have a chat
with your doctor.

582
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:31,920
See if it's a good idea
to switch hospitals.

583
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:38,800
What do you think?

584
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:46,000
My body can't handle this.
We've already tried so much.

585
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,480
That may be so but...

586
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:53,360
every day medical knowledge advances

587
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,600
and maybe
your prognosis changes too?

588
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:02,000
If it makes sense to you,
I'd like to talk to him.

589
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,880
- Even a slim chance...
- Let it go.

590
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:14,240
If there's a cure, I don't mind
toughing out any treatment.

591
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,400
But what I've got is incurable.

592
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,240
It's not that I gave up the fight.

593
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,200
There's just no way to fight.

594
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:32,880
Matsuri...

595
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,640
What you're saying isn't wrong.

596
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:43,520
And I'm so proud of
how you're bearing up.

597
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,760
But try to understand
how your sister feels.

598
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,680
She's always thinking of you...

599
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,360
Of course I know that!

600
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:06,920
Sometimes I wonder...

601
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,880
who deserves
the sympathy in this family.

602
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:22,800
Sorry, I take that back.

603
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:29,200
I've got to go meet my friends.

604
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:34,680
Wait, Matsuri...

605
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:58,400
Congratulations on tying the knot!

606
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,800
- Congratulations, buddy.
- Thank you.

607
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:05,880
Surely she hasn't
tricked you into it?

608
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:07,120
Shut up!

609
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,440
What does that mean?

610
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,320
- Look, it's the real deal.
- Yeah, whatever.

611
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,440
- Cute, right?
- Yeah, sure.

612
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:15,520
By the way...

613
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:19,880
Matsuri, you're not
seeing anyone, right?

614
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:25,120
We want you to meet someone.

615
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,280
Right...

616
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:29,080
a friend from middle school.

617
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:32,360
He did the design work on this place.

618
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:36,000
A first-class architect,
a really great guy.

619
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:38,480
No way... I'm jealous!

620
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:43,720
Although there's one thing...

621
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:48,160
It's no big deal really...

622
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:52,680
Since he was a kid...

623
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:55,200
How can I put it?

624
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,200
He's had this heart defect...

625
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,640
It doesn't affect
his daily life at all.

626
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:10,160
We figured you might
understand his struggle

627
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,760
and find a mutual connection.

628
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:17,000
But I thought you were seeing...

629
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:19,680
Sounds great. Hook us up.

630
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:23,680
I'm so glad.

631
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,520
How old? Is he good-looking?

632
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:28,080
- I think so...
- We've got a recent photo.

633
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:30,640
Where is it? Show me, show me.

634
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:39,200
Kazu...

635
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:41,600
you've spaced out.

636
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:44,360
Sorry.

637
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,480
Having trouble with Matsuri?

638
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:52,560
Yes.

639
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:56,680
I see.

640
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:01,040
Well then, it's time
to move on to the next.

641
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:02,440
Next?

642
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,040
There is no next for me.

643
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,360
That's a good line.

644
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,200
But I know just what you mean.

645
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:22,640
Ending up with regrets or not,
you only live once.

646
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:29,920
Meeting the one you love...

647
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,080
that's a miracle in itself.

648
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,040
You're a lucky lad...

649
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:44,200
to have even come across her.

650
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:02,600
Kazu.

651
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:05,880
You can knock off for the day.

652
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:16,320
Thank you so much.

653
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:44,880
Damn.

654
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:24,320
Matsuri.

655
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:33,200
I'm so glad I found you.

656
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:35,880
What are you doing?

657
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:41,360
I...

658
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:46,800
I don't know your address,
only your nearest train station

659
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,880
so I've been going around
hoping to run into you.

660
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:01,560
Matsuri, are you OK?

661
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:06,720
Yes.

662
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:10,200
What's up?

663
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:17,200
Matsuri, listen.

664
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:20,560
I've figured things out.

665
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:23,520
What do you mean?

666
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,400
My life...

667
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:38,040
might just look like
nothing special.

668
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,560
Just a regular boring
existence perhaps.

669
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:48,520
But you'll always be with me.

670
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:00,560
When I wanted to die...

671
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,320
you gave me a reason to live.

672
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:11,200
I'm not gonna give up on life.

673
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:21,520
From now on...

674
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:25,760
I'll look after you, Matsuri.

675
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:29,920
So...

676
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,000
please stay with me.

677
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:50,360
You idiot.

678
01:08:58,440 --> 01:08:59,520
Matsuri.

679
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:03,920
I love you.

680
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:10,040
I shouldn't have gone
to that reunion.

681
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:25,520
You're warm.

682
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:30,760
You're cold.

683
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:04,840
When I was 20

684
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:12,920
I stared death in the face.

685
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,680
I stared death in the face.

686
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,520
The law now allows
post-brain death transplants.

687
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:41,320
However, these legal changes...

688
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:48,320
Tip the glass and pour it slowly.

689
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,520
Then push forward to make froth.

690
01:10:52,280 --> 01:11:00,240
It's like the limits of my future
were being shoved in my face.

691
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:27,440
If you only had ten more years...

692
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:34,800
what would you do?

693
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:36,600
Right this instant,
what would you do?

694
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:40,000
Matsuri...

695
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,080
Matsuri...

696
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:43,160
Matsuri!

697
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:45,280
- Matsuri, are you okay?
- Matsuri...

698
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:46,696
- Honey...
- Honey, get her oxygen.

699
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:49,200
- Yes.
- Matsuri!

700
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:14,320
Clock's ticking...

701
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:53,240
Come on.

702
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:55,400
What's the point in you crying?

703
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,120
Sorry.

704
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:04,520
Matsuri, I'll leave
the details to you guys.

705
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:06,920
OK.

706
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,800
Your writing is as amazing as ever.

707
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:20,120
We'll definitely publish this.

708
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:25,480
Thank you.

709
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:39,320
Matsuri, are things OK?

710
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:42,600
I guess...

711
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:45,480
maybe not.

712
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,360
That's why I had to write.

713
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:06,160
I can't wait for Kazu to read it.

714
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:11,240
We'll go snowboarding next week.

715
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:14,360
He's really excited.

716
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:18,520
He's changed so much.

717
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:20,360
He's became so much more dependable.

718
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:22,640
It's all thanks to you.

719
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:30,880
He thinks there's a cure
for my illness.

720
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:44,000
Please always stay
within cell phone range.

721
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:47,200
Familiarize yourself
with the local hospital.

722
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:49,560
And don't forget your oxygen.

723
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:56,640
Doc, did you find
the miracle drug yet?

724
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:08,680
Use me as a guinea pig all you like.

725
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:14,720
Thank you.

726
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:17,520
I appreciate the sentiment.

727
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:26,760
If I can help people like me
avoid this fate...

728
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:29,880
even if it's just one person...

729
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:34,920
then I'd feel my life had meaning.

730
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,200
Matsuri...

731
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:50,320
There's one more thing I have to do.

732
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:55,040
When that's done, we'll meet again.

733
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:35,600
You want to try it?

734
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:38,800
You know I can't. I'm a sick girl.

735
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,400
In that case...

736
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:43,680
Let's do that.

737
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:48,000
That's embarrassing.

738
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,560
- Don't worry...
- No, I can't.

739
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:55,040
We're going so fast!

740
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:02,080
Oh, no!

741
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:10,200
- Are you OK, Matsuri?
- I'm fine.

742
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:11,280
Good.

743
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,800
I was scared.

744
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:54,160
I was going to choose
a cool moment...

745
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:05,560
You know...

746
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:11,320
With you...

747
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,400
I feel I can conquer anything.

748
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:19,200
So...

749
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,800
please marry me.

750
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:43,960
No, because it wasn't a cool moment.

751
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:49,120
No way!

752
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:58,960
Matsuri!

753
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Matsuri!

754
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:02,880
Wait for me.

755
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:08,560
What's wrong?

756
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:13,120
Did I do anything to upset you?

757
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,320
What's going on?

758
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:26,320
It's no fault of yours.

759
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:29,320
It's all me.

760
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:42,760
I've been lying to you.

761
01:22:58,520 --> 01:22:59,880
My illness is terminal.

762
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,040
That's why...

763
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,000
I can't be with you anymore.

764
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:16,480
I'm sorry.

765
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:32,640
It can't be cured?

766
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:40,760
There must be a drug
or some kind of treatment...

767
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:42,520
It's no use.

768
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:49,240
No one survives more than ten years.

769
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:56,280
Goodbye.

770
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:03,080
Wait, just wait...

771
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:05,400
Sorry, wait a moment.

772
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:10,480
I'm not thinking clearly.

773
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:15,160
Why?

774
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:17,240
Why you, Matsuri?

775
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:21,600
That's what I kept asking.

776
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:25,480
Why me?

777
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:30,000
Ten years left is like
some kind of joke.

778
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:36,120
I mean, a decade... is that
a long time or no time at all?

779
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:41,480
I was so bored I thought I'd go mad.

780
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:47,560
I just wanted to be left alone
to get it over with.

781
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:03,560
But then...

782
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:11,120
I met you, Kazu.

783
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:15,760
Every day was such fun.

784
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:22,920
But I guess this is it.

785
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:34,240
If I stay with you any longer...

786
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:38,400
I'll be too scared to die.

787
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:46,560
It's just...

788
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:49,480
It's just...

789
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,760
I love you, Matsuri.

790
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:11,520
Kazu...

791
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:20,240
Thank you for being my boyfriend.

792
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:23,320
Don't do this.

793
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:29,160
You keep on living a good life.

794
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:32,840
I don't want to.

795
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:38,880
Please, just say "OK, I get it."

796
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:45,240
I need to get ready to die.

797
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:50,760
This is my last wish.

798
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:04,480
OK...

799
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:10,480
Thank you.

800
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:43,440
Welcome back.

801
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:44,560
I'm home.

802
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:47,000
Welcome home, Matsuri.
You're back early.

803
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:15,880
Looks tasty.

804
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:18,680
It'll be ready soon.

805
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:21,040
How was your trip?

806
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:42,520
Matsuri?

807
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:48,760
Mom...

808
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:07,200
I...

809
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:13,560
I want more life.

810
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:27,360
I want to travel more.

811
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:33,800
More time with my friends.
To work more.

812
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:38,000
To know what it's like to be married.

813
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:49,040
I never had the chance
to do stuff for you guys.

814
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:54,920
I've just been a burden to you.

815
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:00,680
Matsuri...

816
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:05,920
I've always felt so bad.

817
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:12,120
That day when we got your diagnosis,
your father and I went to pieces.

818
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:17,200
We couldn't help bursting into tears.

819
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:24,040
I'm sorry if that made you feel you
always had to put on a brave front.

820
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:29,400
You know...

821
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:34,360
it's OK to let go.

822
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:39,880
To cry, to scream, to yell out.

823
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:45,040
Your mother has got you.

824
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:58,920
I don't want to die.

825
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:05,640
I really don't...

826
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:48,920
The new imperial era's name
has been officially announced.

827
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:53,360
It will be called
"Reiwa" (Auspicious Harmony).

828
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:56,040
This is the dawn of a new era.

829
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:28,920
I think it's good.

830
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:32,000
It suits you.

831
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:36,680
I felt the same.

832
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:40,000
I'll take it.

833
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:43,560
Good.

834
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:51,920
We're nearly there.

835
01:32:53,080 --> 01:32:56,200
As supervising editor,
I'll make sure it's a hit.

836
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:01,200
Looking forward to it.

837
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:03,760
OK.

838
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:10,400
How's Takeru doing?

839
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:14,160
Well...

840
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:19,240
We split up.

841
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Why?

842
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:26,400
How can I put it?

843
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:33,680
I just love my work so much

844
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:36,560
and I want to put everything
into your book.

845
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:44,320
Sanae...

846
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:50,320
Thank you.

847
01:33:57,880 --> 01:33:59,040
I should thank you.

848
01:34:09,680 --> 01:34:15,880
Yakitori "Gen"

849
01:34:18,120 --> 01:34:19,320
It's a little early but...

850
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:21,480
here's to you.

851
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:23,800
Thank you.

852
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:35,800
Remember the first time
you came here?

853
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:41,920
Yes, I was on crutches.

854
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:47,880
You were like a pitiful little puppy.

855
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:54,000
But you turned out pretty cool, Kazu.

856
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:02,920
Thanks to those around me.

857
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:07,480
Have you chosen a name
for the place?

858
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:14,880
I'm thinking of calling it "Matsuri".

859
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:21,200
I see.

860
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:27,400
Make sure you go tell her
about your shop.

861
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:43,080
Did you finish your novel?

862
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:48,200
I wrote lots of bad things about you.

863
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:51,920
Like how you didn't
take me to the SkyTree.

864
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,680
That's not nice.

865
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:57,680
Doesn't matter.
It's a work of fiction.

866
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:01,560
You also have a child in the story.

867
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:07,080
Are you psychic?

868
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:09,720
No way.

869
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,040
I'm pregnant.

870
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:24,320
Only two months now
so I'm due next summer.

871
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:31,680
Wonder if I can hold the baby...

872
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,680
Of course you can.

873
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:39,760
You can even think of a name.

874
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:48,520
Sis, I'm so sorry.

875
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:57,360
I always regretted it
after I said mean things to you.

876
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:02,880
You've always been by my side.

877
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:07,400
You've never given up hope.

878
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:10,240
Thank you.

879
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:20,320
I'm really glad
to have you as my sister.

880
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:30,400
Why are you crying?

881
01:37:31,120 --> 01:37:32,160
Shut up.

882
01:37:40,440 --> 01:37:41,480
Thanks.

883
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:48,080
- Long time, no see.
- Good evening.

884
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:49,320
"Matsuri"

885
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:51,480
Wow, it's so busy.

886
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:54,120
- Good evening.
- Hi, guys!

887
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:55,680
What a great place.

888
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:56,856
- Excuse me.
- You can sit over there.

889
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:59,280
Squeezing through.

890
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:01,720
Kazu, congratulations.

891
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:04,160
- Well done.
- Thank you.

892
01:38:04,240 --> 01:38:06,080
Remember that chick
who dumped me?

893
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:07,200
Don't be mean.

894
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:14,320
A celebration gift.

895
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:16,360
Open it after work.

896
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:19,480
It'll be published in two months.

897
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:24,240
- Two beers.
- Coming up.

898
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:26,760
- Excuse me.
- Coming.

899
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:33,200
He's always got people
looking out for him.

900
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:36,080
You're right.

901
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:40,160
I hope the book reaches
a lot of people.

902
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,560
It will. For sure.

903
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:14,200
You want to try it?

904
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,520
You know I can't. I'm a sick girl.

905
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:20,200
In that case...

906
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:22,560
Let's do that.

907
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:25,480
That's embarrassing.

908
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:30,120
Delete file?

909
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:37,720
Yes

910
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:39,720
Deleting scene

911
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:42,200
Deleted

912
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:55,000
Deleting scene

913
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:56,160
Deleted

914
01:40:38,360 --> 01:40:43,920
Deleted

915
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:01,000
So, what's the plan now?

916
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:03,560
That's unexpected.

917
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:07,160
I don't really know.

918
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:13,640
OK then...

919
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:19,880
I'm going to hang in there.

920
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:25,640
So no more thoughts of dying.

921
01:41:32,040 --> 01:41:33,200
OK.

922
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:52,080
Delete file?
(Deleted files cannot be recovered)

923
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:38,040
It's so nice!

924
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:49,760
How beautiful.

925
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:53,200
There's Tokyo Tower!

926
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:17,880
A good first day.
Tomorrow, you're on your own.

927
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:20,000
Gen...

928
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:26,360
Thank you for all you've done for me.

The Last 10 Years
by Takabayashi Matsuri

930
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:15,320
- Let's get her to the ICU.
- Yes, Doc!

931
01:45:21,720 --> 01:45:26,600
At night, I get scared
to close my eyes.

932
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:31,080
It always plays back in my mind.

933
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:33,600
Unforgettably.

934
01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:47,040
Tell me I was not wrong.

935
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:03,760
That I made the right choice.

936
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:14,680
I broke up with him
to make my pain bearable.

937
01:46:22,160 --> 01:46:23,280
Hey, Kazu.

938
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:28,680
My life was full of happiness.

939
01:46:44,920 --> 01:46:46,680
Although it was shorter than most.

940
01:46:49,160 --> 01:46:50,800
To have met you.

941
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,760
To be loved by you.

942
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:59,280
It made me sure of my existence.

943
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:03,840
So, I guess...

944
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:07,480
this was for the best
after all, right?

945
01:47:16,240 --> 01:47:20,480
I miss you and
want to see you, Kazu.

946
01:47:36,720 --> 01:47:37,880
Kazu...

947
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:50,880
I love you so much.

948
01:48:33,320 --> 01:48:34,720
I'm sorry.

949
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:25,680
Matsuri?

950
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,120
Listen.

951
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:38,360
I opened my own restaurant.

952
01:49:44,640 --> 01:49:45,880
I named it...

953
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:49,680
"Matsuri".

954
01:49:53,680 --> 01:49:58,040
I figured you'd be mad
that I didn't ask you but...

955
01:50:00,200 --> 01:50:02,200
it's the only name I could think of.

956
01:50:14,640 --> 01:50:15,800
Matsuri...

957
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:26,040
You fought hard.

958
01:50:38,640 --> 01:50:39,920
My dear Matsuri...

959
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:47,480
You really fought hard.

960
01:51:25,160 --> 01:51:26,360
Dear Matsuri...

961
01:51:38,360 --> 01:51:39,560
You fought really hard.

962
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:49,000
You really, really did...

964
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:44,040
OK, I'll be there in a minute.

965
01:52:44,120 --> 01:52:45,400
See you soon.

966
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:53,760
Dedicated to the memory of
Kosaka Luka
