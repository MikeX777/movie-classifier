1
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:31,615
[Tiesto] <i>You can't compare Steve</i>
<i>to any other DJs.</i>

2
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,575
He has his own role in the DJ world.

3
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,746
He's one of the first entertainers

4
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,499
that took DJing to a different spot.

5
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,510
I think Steve is like a force of nature.

6
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:53,595
<i>That's what made him stand out,</i>

7
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,472
<i>he's a larger-than-life character.</i>

8
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:04,940
[Diplo] <i>Dance music doesn't really</i>
<i>have a personality.</i>

9
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:08,860
Steve has an overabundance of personality.

10
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:28,130
[Travis] <i>It's very much elements</i>
<i>of punk rock shows.</i>

11
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:34,428
But he's flipped them
and made them his own.

12
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,147
[Diplo]
<i>If you don't know Steve personally,</i>

13
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,107
you're gonna have
a perception of him right away.

14
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:59,995
I don't know how he can be in a rowboat
in the middle of a crowd and be a DJ.

15
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:05,834
[crowd cheering wildly]

16
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:15,927
If you're doing something
that people are afraid of or against,

17
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:18,055
I think you're doing something right.

18
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:32,653
That's what EDM is now,
it's more of a big spectacle show.

19
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:45,123
One... two... three!

20
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,383
[Pete] <i>Everybody asks the question,</i>

21
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:57,719
<i>"Where is it going?"</i>
<i>And I think the evolution of the scene</i>

22
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:01,390
<i>will be more about characters</i>
<i>and personalities.</i>

23
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,226
Steve was always more than a DJ.

24
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:13,402
[Tiernan] <i>I forgot that</i>
<i>your mom moved here without your dad.</i>

25
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,154
<i>How often would you see him in the year?</i>

26
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:20,075
[Steve] <i>We'd do two trips,</i>
<i>usually like summer and winter time.</i>

27
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,536
I would always look forward to it.
I'd just wait to see him again

28
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,622
and look forward to these trips.
I used to skate right there.

29
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:31,962
<i>Growing up, my brother and sister</i>
<i>already were in college.</i>

30
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:35,173
<i>So from eight on,</i>
<i>it was like my mom raising me.</i>

31
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:38,385
<i>You know, I'd see my dad whenever I could.</i>

32
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:43,265
My father divorced my mother

33
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,851
<i>when Steven was very young.</i>

34
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,938
<i>So my mother really raised us...</i>

35
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,481
<i>in the Japanese culture...</i>

36
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:52,858
<i>in American setting.</i>

37
00:03:56,528 --> 00:04:00,824
[in Japanese]
He didn't have any Japanese friends.

38
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:05,036
[Dan] <i>He was stuck</i>
<i>in this whitewashed world.</i>

39
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,747
<i>He didn't have...</i>

40
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,541
Asian peers of his own
that he could connect with.

41
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,004
[Steve] When I grew up, I was like,

42
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,381
-"Which clique can I be a part of?"
-Yeah.

43
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:17,841
And I tried a bunch.

44
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:23,138
<i>Freshman year, I was trying</i>
<i>to find something I could be a part of.</i>

45
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:26,016
-[Tiernan] <i>Yeah.</i>
-<i>So I joined the football team.</i>

46
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:31,980
<i>But they were all jocks and big</i>
<i>and I was only, like, 100 pounds.</i>

47
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:35,734
-Never let me play, no matter--
-Why did they bring you on the team?

48
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,528
Because they have to,
it's like affirmative action.

49
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:41,823
They have to let everyone have a chance.

50
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,535
I tried other sports,
none of them worked out.

51
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,329
They were always big fails.

52
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:51,041
[Tiernan] <i>Did you get teased</i>
<i>or picked on a lot?</i>

53
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,043
[Steve] <i>The only real fight I had</i>

54
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,879
<i>was playing badminton,</i>
<i>I was a badminton player,</i>

55
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,048
<i>and there was this one fucking asshole.</i>

56
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,051
<i>He's just saying just a tirade</i>
<i>of racial slurs.</i>

57
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,553
"Hey you, fuckin' Nip!

58
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,056
You fucking gook, you slant eye.

59
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,767
Yeah! You think you're gonna fucking win?"

60
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,770
-So blatant, he was like out of a movie.
-Yeah.

61
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:15,357
All his friends were laughing behind him.
I couldn't believe it,

62
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,442
and I was sitting there
and kept looking back,

63
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:20,278
getting, like, so angry, so angry.

64
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:24,241
Just so angry that his friends
are laughing and they're allowing this.

65
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,410
And no one's doing shit, man.
No one's doing shit.

66
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,334
[Steve] <i>You know, especially</i>
<i>when you're a kid growing up</i>

67
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,127
and you're the benchwarmer,

68
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,507
and you're the kid
that has a hard time making friends,

69
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:45,220
you definitely don't think you're gonna be
someone of any influence at all.

70
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,641
<i>I wanted to be a popular kid.</i>

71
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:53,019
<i>I wanted everyone to like me.</i>
<i>I wanted to fit in.</i>

72
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:58,942
[Chizuru, in Japanese]
<i>Steven never said anything to me...</i>

73
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:02,028
but he really missed his father.

74
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,913
[Tiernan] <i>I think he's always gonna be</i>
<i>trying to prove himself to his father.</i>

75
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:14,040
As much as he may not want to admit it,

76
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:15,875
I think Rocky is the main driving force

77
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,086
behind all of his
passion projects in life.

78
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:25,343
<i>He had such a major influence,</i>
<i>or lack thereof, in Steve's life,</i>

79
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:28,054
which drove Steve to want to strive

80
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:32,475
to be something greater
than any other human being wants to be.

81
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,498

<i>I'd like to introduce Steve Aoki.</i>

00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:04,382
[Steve] <i>When I think of playing here,</i>
<i>I think about...</i>

84
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:08,428
<i>this long journey </i>
<i>from when I first started playing music.</i>

85
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:13,350
<i>Going from small clubs,</i>
<i>to bigger venues, to festivals.</i>

86
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:18,146
<i>And now to the point where,</i>
<i>as an artist, as an electronic artist,</i>

87
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:24,277
<i>actually playing at Madison Square Garden</i>
<i>is one of those rare moments.</i>

88
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:28,531
<i>And I'm just completely humbled by it.</i>

89
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,327
<i>And with that,</i>

90
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:36,414
<i>I'm proud to announce that I'm gonna</i>
<i>be releasing my two-part album,</i>

91
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:40,752
<i>"Neon Future," something I've been</i>
<i>working on for over two years now.</i>

92

<i>My dad lived here all my life.</i>

<i>So I have a very big heart</i>
<i>for New York City.</i>

95
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:53,932
<i>And I know how proud he would be</i>
<i>if he was here...</i>

96
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,727
<i>that his son is fuckin' playing</i>
<i>Madison Square Garden.</i>

<i>It's very Japanese.</i>

111
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,632
<i>That kind of drive and ambition</i>

112
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:17,432
[Chizuru, in Japanese]
<i>Steven's father had a very big heart.</i>

<i>But he could be selfish too.</i>

114
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,442
He would be so focused

115
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,488
<i>he would forget about his family.</i>

116

<i>We want Rocky!</i>

119

Our father first came to the US as
a wrestler on the Japanese Olympic team.

120
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,930
<i>When he was in New York,</i>
<i>he defected from the group</i>

<i>With the money he saved </i>
<i>from being an ice cream man in Harlem,</i>

123
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:05,772
he opened his first Benihana in New York.

<i>I'm Rocky Aoki.</i>

00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,319
<i>When I came to this country</i>
<i>nine years ago,</i>

<i>I had a dream.</i>

127
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,448
<i>I introduced Hibachi cuisine to America.</i>

128
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:16,616
<i>The people loved it.</i>

129

<i>If you haven't eaten at the Benihana,</i>

131
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,998
<i>you've missed out</i>
<i>on a great American institution.</i>

132
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:25,625
[Steve] <i>He was a genius with marketing.</i>

133
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:30,130
<i>He brought over chefs from Japan</i>
<i>and had them cook right at the table.</i>

134
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:34,050
<i>He injected entertainment and showmanship</i>
<i>into Japanese cuisine.</i>

[gasping in awe]

136
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,849
His work ethic was unparalleled
to anyone I've met in my life.

137
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,312
[Rocky] <i>I don't have to sleep.</i>
<i>I sleep four hours a day.</i>

138
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,273
<i>I work 16 to 17 hours a day.</i>

139
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,066
Very nice, very nice.

140
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,860
[Steve] <i>It seemed like he knew everyone.</i>

141

<i>Hanging out with Muhammad Ali,</i>

<i>John Lennon, you know,</i>
<i>all these influential people.</i>

143
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,325
He was right in the middle of it.

144
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,578
<i>Rocky, how you doing?</i>

145
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:05,456
[Steve] <i>Everything he did</i>
<i>was always focused on one thing,</i>

146
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,625
<i>Benihana.</i>

147
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:12,046
Besides being a restaurateur,
he was a sportsman.

148
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:15,967
He was a daredevil.

149
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,016
The guy was fucking crazy like that.

150
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,352
<i>He broke a world record</i>
<i>for hot-air ballooning.</i>

151
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,688
He didn't know what the fuck
he was doing, he just did it.

152
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,149
[Rocky] <i>I'm not afraid of dying.</i>

153
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,358

156
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,030
[Steve] <i>I'm not as crazy,</i>

157
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,407
'cause he really was fucking nuts.

158
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,992
<i>Aoki was thrown into the water--</i>

<i>It looks like the boat may go--</i>

161
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,582

00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,836
<i>Aoki said he plans to push ahead</i>

164
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,797
<i>with his quest to become</i>
<i>the fastest man on water.</i>

165
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,635
[Dan] <i>His dad was almost like...</i>

166
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,386
a superhero to Steve.

167
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,098
<i>That's probably a huge inspiration</i>
<i>to look up to.</i>

168
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:09,437
This dad that I don't really know too well
but here he is, just crushing it. [laughs]

169
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:13,399
[Steve] <i>He had balls bigger</i>
<i>than anyone I've ever seen.</i>

170
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,821
I'm so proud that's my father
who did those things.

171
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,464
[Steve] I had a lot of these photos.

172
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:40,093
These are like his early years.

173
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,470
Look at his mustaches.

174
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,681
[woman] You have that too, now.

175
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,766
[laughing]

176
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:51,312
[in Japanese] Do you have
any interesting memories of our father?

177
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,691
I remember the first time
we went in the balloon,

178
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,235
we got caught in a tree and fell.

179
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,155
Six months later,
we were ready to try again.

180
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,992
That's when we flew to San Francisco.

181
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:08,121
[Kevin] That was the second attempt
to cross the Pacific.

182
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:13,209
[in Japanese] Did you believe
that Rocky would make it to the US?

183
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,294
[Kojima] To the US?

184
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,464
I thought he would make it.

185
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:27,140
He said that Mt. Fuji looked
very beautiful during his flight.

186
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:32,020
Before they got to San Francisco,
the balloon went up too high.

187
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:38,026
So the balloon froze
and it started descending.

188
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:41,446
It descended almost
to the ocean's surface.

189
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:45,783
So they dropped their cameras
and all their belongings...

190
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:50,204
<i>and the balloon finally</i>
<i>started rising again...</i>

191
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,291
<i>and they made it to North America.</i>

192
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,542
[Steve, in English] <i>Wow.</i>

193
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:58,087
[Chizuru] <i>He was around 35 years old.</i>

194
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,672
-Like my age.
-Yeah, your age.

195
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,133
Doing all these things, it's insane.

196
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,219
[Kojima, in Japanese] <i>Nobody in Japan</i>
<i>was doing stuff like that back then.</i>

197
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:08,473
Now Steven is like Rocky.

198
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,351
He's just jumping and I worry about him.

199
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:15,438
I don't want to be like second Rocky,
you know?

200
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,483
So, I said, "Wow! Another Rocky."

201
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:24,906
[Steve] <i>It was incredible,</i>
<i>what was happening with just one person.</i>

202
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:28,159
<i>It makes sense that he did Benihana.</i>

203
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:31,746
<i>He was trying to create a show</i>
<i>for the American audience,</i>

204
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,957
<i>not just at the restaurant,</i>
<i>but in his own personal life.</i>

205
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,878
<i>He was a showman.</i>

206
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:59,732
[alarm beeping]

207
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:05,738
[beeping gets louder]

208
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,913
[Matt] <i>I've been Steve's manager</i>
<i>for over ten years.</i>

209
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,626
<i>I've never seen anyone</i>
<i>that works this hard.</i>

210
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:22,505
<i>I remember a couple years into it,</i>

211
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,298
people would tell me
I need to get him to slow down,

212
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:28,219
'cause he can't keep at this pace
and he'll burn out in a year or two.

213
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:31,347
Here we are, eight, nine years later,
he's only picked up steam.

214
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,439
[Steve] <i>No one asked me about that.</i>

215
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:42,692
Dillon's shaking his head.
He said there was no miscommunication.

216
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,527
-He's in front of me.
-[Dillon] It's on Google Docs.

217
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,320
It's on Google Docs, he says.

218
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:48,823
If we can be efficient with the time,

219
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,783
then let's be efficient with the time.

220
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,368
And Matt, you should know that.

221
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:55,413
You know how we are with LA time.

222
00:15:57,165 --> 00:16:00,960
Yeah, but you're fucking manager,
you need to deal with this shit.

223
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,962
Don't fucking throw it off your hands

224
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,631
and say, "I don't know
what the fuck's going on."

225
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,968
[Matt] <i>This morning we had</i>
<i>an argument with Steve.</i>

226
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,846
He's upset that he flew
from Sweden to Vegas yesterday.

227
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,265
He had a three o'clock set.

228
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,351
<i>Then he had an interview for PBS.</i>

229
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:18,811
-[man] Wedding cake?
-[Steve] Yeah.

230
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:21,481
Then he had a set at Hakkasan in Vegas.

231
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,983
<i>He finishes at, like, 4:30.</i>

232
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,985
Got a 6:00 a.m. lobby call.

233
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,278
[Steve] Barely surviving.

234
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,863
<i>Flies to LA, lands at 9:30.</i>

235
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,949
<i>At 11:30, he has to be</i>
<i>at a music video shoot.</i>

236
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:33,326
[singing]

237
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,495
<i>-It's a ten-hour shoot.</i>
-[man] Cut!

238
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,580
Then he has a studio session
with Will.i.am.

239
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,833
Tomorrow he's got radio at eight
in the morning.

240
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,294
Steve Aoki, welcome back
to the neighborhood.

241
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,879
<i>Interviews all day long.</i>

242
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,047
One... two... three!

243
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,925
Then he has a flight at six o'clock
back to Ibiza.

244
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,301
-[engine sounding]
-Whoo!

245
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,137
The argument today? He's like,

246
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:54,680
"When do I sleep?"

247
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:08,277
[Steve] <i>Last year,</i>
<i>I cracked over 300 shows</i>

248
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,695
across the world.

249
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:16,494
[Gary] <i>I've never seen anyone play...</i>

250
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,412
as many shows as that guy fucking plays.

251
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:21,999
His work ethic is amazing.

252
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,294
Oh, Steve is a machine.

253
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,924
He's the quintessential grind of DJs.

254
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,928
[Matt] Guinness Book of World Records

255
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:38,516
<i>contacted us and said, by miles flown,</i>
<i>Steve was the most traveled musician...</i>

256
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,559
in the world.

257
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,521
[Afrojack] <i>Steve works too hard.</i>

258
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,232
<i>Like, right now, Steve,</i>
<i>I'm telling you right now...</i>

259
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,733
Relax.

260
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:57,451
[Tiernan] <i>He's so driven</i>
<i>and he's so passionate about his work</i>

261
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:00,830
that he sort of forgets he needs
to have a bit of a personal life.

262
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,337
[crowd cheering wildly]

263
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,172
Every opportunity he had, he took it.

264
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,008
To do that many shows,
you have to play everywhere.

265
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,594
-<i>We are in Europe.</i>
-<i>We made it to Torreón, Mexico.</i>

266
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:15,678
<i>Traveling around the world.</i>

267
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,139
<i>Came all the way to Beijing</i>
<i>to have this duck.</i>

268
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,807
[Diplo]<i> Steve was the first guy to go,</i>

269
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,351
<i>"I'm gonna go to Vietnam,</i>
<i>everywhere in Asia</i>

270
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,520
that's gonna book me, and I'm gonna
make my name bigger there."

271
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:28,107
<i>He was the first guy I remember</i>
<i>that went to Kuala Lumpur.</i>

272
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,776
He was just going there to like...

273
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,903
<i>put his flag down.</i>

274
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,198
<i>By doing that for three or four years,</i>

275
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,075
we've become able to tour all the time.

276
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,580
We got three shows on that day.
Three shows on this day.

277
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,874
This day here,
we have to drive a bit anyway.

278
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:49,045
That walkway just turns
into a really nice bed<i> </i>for the world tour.

279
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,468
<i>He's like a prophet</i>
<i>that actually wants to go out</i>

280
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,637
and go to as many cities as possible

281
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,889
and have as many people
see him as possible.

282
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,309
Every year he's magnifying
what he was doing.

283
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:07,188
<i>I wish I had done that because</i>
<i>he was putting his name out there.</i>

284
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:12,777
[Steve] <i>I am addicted to that feeling</i>
<i>of being on the road</i>

285
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,988
and having that connection
with all these fans.

286
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,745
[Tiernan] <i>His fans are everything to him.</i>

287
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:26,207
<i>I don't think he would ever</i>
<i>say no to someone.</i>

288
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,541
[woman] I'm gonna cry.

289
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,211
Without that energy,
I don't know what he would do.

290
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:36,926
Steve Aoki is probably the most recorded
human being on the planet.

291
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,970
<i>He has become one of</i>
<i>the largest celebrities in the world</i>

292
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:41,931
<i>inside of the Internet.</i>

293
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,975
[Pete] <i>He's 24/7 Mr. Entertainment.</i>

294
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,769
Quite an unusual guy to hang around with.

295
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:50,940
<i>And if you get to mid-30s, 40 years old,</i>

296
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,608
<i>and you're at the top of your game,</i>

297
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,735
<i>it's dangerous to your competition</i>

298
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:57,029
<i>'cause you're 24/7.</i>

299
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,156
And it's dangerous for the artist himself.

300
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:24,390
<i>I've never seen him sit still</i>
<i>for longer than maybe a couple of hours.</i>

301
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,143
<i>He can't stop.</i>

302
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,270
It's just not in his nature.

303
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,734
<i>To stop, for him,</i>

304
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:37,278
<i>and start to be in his head</i>
<i>and think about things</i>

305
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,363
<i>really kind of almost scares him.</i>

306
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:44,577
<i>He always has to have people around</i>
<i>when I'm not there.</i>

307
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:47,580
<i>He'll have people in his room</i>
<i>until he goes to sleep</i>

308
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:50,082
<i>just because he doesn't want to be alone.</i>

309
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:53,294
[birds squawking]

310
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:05,222
[Matt] Have you actually not said
a single word in two weeks now?

311
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,516
Have you been able to get
even a whisper out?

312
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:11,395
[automated voice] <i>I have been taking notes</i>
<i>on my experience</i>

313

<i>on how I have enriched my life</i>

314
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:17,735
Really? Did you feel this kind of,
sort of coming on

315
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,403
seven, eight years ago?

316
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:22,531
<i>Not really, because back then</i>
<i>I thought it was natural</i>

317
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:25,409
<i>that I should lose my voice</i>
<i>after screaming.</i>

318
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:26,952
That's weird.

00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,005
<i>-</i>[doctor] <i>How you doing?</i>
<i>-</i>[Matt] <i>Floor is yours.</i>

320

All right, Steve, you ready?

321
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:43,093
Everything's going well?
The cough is better?

322
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,846
Good. Not too much irritation?

323
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:47,681
Tongue out.

324
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,058
Okay.

325
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,268

you guys take really good care of him.

335

In an ideal scenario, when's
the next time he would be able to speak?

336
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:19,672
Like two more days

337
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:23,676
of not speaking, no voice lessons,
nothing like that for three weeks.

338

[Steve] <i>As I was growing up,</i>
<i>I found hardcore as, like, my salvation.</i>

355
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:26,822
After I graduated from high school,
I chose UC Santa Barbara

356
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:30,576
because there was a thriving
DIY hardcore community there.

357
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,419
From that moment on, music was my life.

358
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,632
<i>Through the music, I was able</i>
<i>to find ways to express</i>

360
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:51,096

[Mike] <i>Four of us decided to move into</i>
<i>this two-bedroom apartment.</i>

363
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:06,945
It was probably like...

364
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,907
five hundred square feet
between two floors.

365
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:13,118
[Steve] <i>The space was small,</i>
<i>so we cleared it out</i>

366
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:14,662
<i>and we threw in</i>
<i>as many people as we could.</i>

367
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:16,538
<i>And we started throwing shows.</i>

368
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,582
We called it "The Pickle Patch."

369
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,798
<i>We did over 450 bands.</i>

370
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:33,764
[Dan] <i>Steve was having shows there</i>
<i>three, four times a week.</i>

371
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,934
<i>He was developing personal relationships</i>
<i>with these people.</i>

372
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:41,188
<i>It was easy for him to be like, </i>
<i>"Hey, I really like your band."</i>

373
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:44,608
<i>I'm gonna start a record label.</i>
<i>I wanna put out a record for you."</i>

374
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:47,778
And his contribution was starting Dim Mak.

375
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:53,992
[Steve] <i>The label started when I was 19.</i>

376
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:58,747
<i>I was delivering greasy food</i>
<i>and doing telemarketing.</i>

377
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,291
I didn't know how to run a label.

378

<i>One of the most important things</i>

<i>in college and being part</i>
<i>of this community and this scene,</i>

380
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,719

-[Rocky] <i>Good. Thank you.</i>

392
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:55,971
[Steve] <i>He was very much</i>
<i>a flashy symbol of extravagance.</i>

393
00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:01,185
[in Japanese]
He had everything that I didn't have.

394
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,397
<i>That's what attracted me to him.</i>

<i>driving powerboats,</i>

397
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:15,199
He had his own way of doing things.

[Devon] <i>There was no family</i>
<i>without my mother and Steve's mother.</i>

[Chizuru, in Japanese] <i>I never knew</i>

<i>Business comes number one.</i>
<i>And health comes number two.</i>

409

410
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:15,717
[Mike] <i>You're dejecting</i>
<i>what your parents stand for.</i>

411
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:21,849
<i>But, eventually, you presume that he's</i>
<i>trying to prove something to his dad.</i>

412
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:25,727
Like, "Look, I'm not the kid
that you either wanted to abandon

413
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:28,647
or just didn't care about. I am somebody."

414
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,067

<i>push him a little bit hard.</i>

419
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,877

<i>all day until he was crying</i>

421
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,716

422
00:27:56,967 --> 00:28:00,721
<i>But he probably realized that </i>
<i>he didn't like the restaurant business</i>

[clap beats]

425
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:15,736
I told Steve, "If you're not involved
in the business,

426
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,321
it's risky."

427
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,579
[Steve] <i>At 22, I moved to LA.</i>

428
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:30,459
<i>And my main focus here was to turn</i>
<i>Dim Mak into a business.</i>

429
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:32,961
My father...

430
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:36,048
he didn't really support the idea.

431
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:41,637
<i>He'd always say, "You need to get a job.</i>

432

<i>You need to do something with your life."</i>

433
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:49,228
I wanted to prove to him
that I could be successful with music.

434
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:57,486
<i>During that time,</i>
<i>I got my first investment</i>

435
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,363
from these two friends of mine.

436
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,531
We both really believed in Steve.

437
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:04,409
We didn't invest,
we just let him borrow some money.

438
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:10,999
They are able to pay for an office space
in this, kind of, abandoned house.

00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,001
[Danny] <i>It was a shithole.</i>

440
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,088
You'd never know that he came from...

441
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,422
any kind of wealth.

442
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:21,760
[Devon] <i>I find it difficult</i>

Steve Aoki, you know, silver spoon DJ.

444
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:29,017
<i>He got absolutely no help</i>
<i>from our father, financially.</i>

445
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:33,438
He struggled.
He struggled in the beginning.

446
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,360
[Steve] <i>In 2003, I first heard Bloc Party.</i>

447
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:43,156
The next year, we released the EP
and it changed the label forever.

448
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:46,994
Bloc Party put us on the map

449
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:49,955
in a way that attracted comparable bands.

450
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:01,300
[Steve] <i>By the time 2005 rolled around,</i>

451
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,554
at least the industry knew
what Dim Mak was and they knew about me.

[music playing on headphones]

453
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,856
I'm not sure what his aspirations
of being a DJ were,

454
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:19,985
but as far as him being
this huge international, like, DJ,

455
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,070
<i>that was just not even imaginable.</i>

456
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:27,159
To go and become a DJ
in the LA night scene...

457
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,785
made no sense to us.

458
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:36,293
[Steve] <i>My friend was throwing</i>
<i>a party called Fucking Awesome.</i>

459
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:39,963
He was like, "OK, why don't we team up.

460
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:43,425
You could DJ
and we'll call it the Dim Mak Party."

461
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:48,513
<i>When I started DJing, I started playing </i>
<i>punk and hardcore records.</i>

462
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,974
I knew nothing about the DJ world.

463
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:53,393
[Danny] <i>He partnered with Cobrasnake,</i>

464
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:57,397
<i>who was taking these incredible photos</i>
<i>of these beautiful kids going crazy.</i>

465

Everything looked like New Years.

466
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,575
Most of the time
he was shirtless, sweating.

<i>Crowd surfing into this tight group,</i>

468
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,747
pouring vodka and Red Bull

469
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,254
Dim Mak Tuesdays was, like,

<i>We were DJing for free.</i>

478
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,990

[Will.i.am] <i>It was an amazing scene.</i>

480

Since then, there hasn't been
anything like it.

481
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:11,847
Steve brought a rock and roll attitude
to dance music that didn't exist.

482

One, two...

[The Bloody Beetroots]
<i>It was crunchy, over-compressed,</i>

487
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:32,409
and it was all about punk rock.

00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:14,206
and, to jump to the end,
it's gonna take us that long

653
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:15,416
to try and get one back.

654
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:18,252
We tried to get one for this year,
nothing's available--

655
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:20,296
You're saying MSG is totally out?

656
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,177
MSG is out for the foreseeable future.

657
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,220
Basically, we can get back in line.

658
00:47:28,304 --> 00:47:31,849
The next foreseeable option
would be next summer.

659
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,267
But then you go to Europe.

660
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,019
By then, both albums are out.

661
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:38,064
As far as album one goes,
it would be a full year later.

662
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,025
I just don't understand
how there's no other--

663
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:43,069
[Matt stammers] Because, I mean--

664
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:47,865
Obviously, this is our first time doing
something of this size and scale.

665
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:51,327
People book this stuff out
a year and a half out.

666
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:54,121
There was a date in January,

667
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:56,999
there was a date in February
and a date in April.

668
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:58,793
All of them fell through.

669
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:03,422
We lost our bid to whatever other...

670
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:07,760
Ice Capades or, you know,
Bieber concert was happening.

671
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:12,640
I wish I had better news.

672
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,561
I know this show meant a lot to you.

673
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:34,954
[Matt] <i>With his dad, from day one,</i>

674
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:39,166
<i>it was always about, "Look what I did.</i>

675
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,335
<i>Look what I'm accomplishing."</i>

676
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:46,382
<i>Everything he accomplished,</i>
<i>"Send it to my dad.</i>

677
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:49,009
<i>Can you frame this and send it to my dad?"</i>

678
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:51,053
<i>I think it was about showing his dad that,</i>

679
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:54,223
"Look, in many ways,
I can uphold the Aoki legacy."

680
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:59,395
[Steve] <i>By '06-'07,</i>
<i>I started making money.</i>

681
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:04,024
<i>I would show him,</i>
<i>"Look, I made my first $10,000</i>

682
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:08,112
and I'm working this much this month
and I'm getting booked here and there."

683
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:15,161
[Matt] <i>I remember during</i>
<i>the summer of '08,</i>

684
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:20,916
by then he had become a popular DJ,
by no means a household name.

685
00:49:23,002 --> 00:49:25,087
<i>And then his dad's health started failing.</i>

686
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,425
[Steve] <i>We found out</i>
<i>that he got hepatitis C.</i>

687
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:33,888
We realized that this is something
that's very difficult to walk away from.

688
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:39,768
<i>He later got diabetes</i>
<i>and then liver cirrhosis,</i>

689
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:43,022
<i>and liver cirrhosis,</i>
<i>which led to tumors.</i>

690
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:49,528
[Dan] <i>Steve definitely, at that time,</i>
<i>made it a point to go and see his dad</i>

691
00:49:49,612 --> 00:49:51,405
and spend more time with him.

692
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:55,367
<i>And really get to know his dad</i>

693
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:59,955
<i>because he didn't really have much</i>
<i>of an opportunity to do that growing up.</i>

694
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:08,505
[Kevin] <i>The last few years</i>
<i>of my father's life,</i>

695
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:12,218
all of us kids were always trying
to rally together.

696
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:15,054
<i>When we all got together,</i>

697
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:20,184
<i>Steven would always try to bring</i>
<i>a positive note to all his kids.</i>

698
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:26,065
He had this thing called
"positive go," and he would point.

699
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:30,986
<i>Even to this day, I remember my dad,</i>

700
00:50:32,488 --> 00:50:35,991
remembering that "positive go"
that Steven has.

701
00:50:41,497 --> 00:50:45,542
[Steve] <i>I remember being</i>
<i>in the hospital and...</i>

702
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:48,128
<i>This is like his last couple of days.</i>

703
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:55,094
There was one moment
when I finally had time with him.

704
00:50:55,678 --> 00:50:57,221
It was just me and him.

705
00:50:57,721 --> 00:51:01,225
It was actually the first time when

706
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:04,353
I ever cried so much.

707
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:07,815
I never cried in front of my dad.
I never did that, and...

708
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,442
And, I just...

709
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:15,072
Like, all those years...
I think everything all came out.

710
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:21,996
<i>'Cause he's not the kind of guy to--</i>
<i>You don't cry with him. He doesn't--</i>

711
00:51:22,663 --> 00:51:25,582
<i>He's very much a patriarch,</i>
<i>very masculine.</i>

712
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:28,669
<i>He's very Japanese in that way.</i>
<i>You know, you don't...</i>

713
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,840
You just can't show that side
if you're a guy.

714
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,258
If you're the daughter--

715
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:36,969
If you're Devon, Echo or Grace,
you could do that but...

716
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:41,140
You can't do that with him as a son.

717
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:43,350
And...

718
00:51:44,143 --> 00:51:47,980
[stammers] I'm just so happy
that I was able to show him that.

719
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:50,107
It was really...

720
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:54,153
It was really...

721
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:59,241
one of the most emotionally connected
moments I ever had with him.

722
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:01,160
And there's...

723
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:04,246
There's no words exchanged at all.

724
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:05,956
It was just...

725
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:11,086
Yeah, it was...

726
00:52:12,004 --> 00:52:15,924
Something that...
I'm so happy that happened.

727
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:18,010
Just so he could...

728
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:21,555
feel how much he meant to me.

729
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:46,080
It affected Steve really, really badly.

730
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:57,633
<i>We never really believed</i>
<i>that my dad could be...</i>

731
00:52:58,634 --> 00:53:00,594
taken down by anything.

732
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:06,225
<i>He was such a challenger,</i>

733
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:09,895
I thought he was indestructible.
Thought he would live forever.

734
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:20,531
I believed that up until the day he died.

735
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:28,205
<i>The last thing that he did was...</i>

736
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:31,041
<i>he wrote the words,</i>
<i>"I'm going to challenge this"</i>

737
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:32,501
<i>on a piece of paper.</i>

738
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,308
[Diplo]<i> When I first met Steve,</i>

739
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:50,310
<i>I spoke to him almost</i>
<i>every night about his dad</i>

740
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:52,104
<i>because I was fascinated by it.</i>

741
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:55,441
I was like,
where you come from is fucking crazy.

742
00:53:57,568 --> 00:53:59,695
<i>I think he's motivated</i>
<i>by whatever weird...</i>

743
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:03,198
passion his father had. His father seemed
like an insane person too.

744
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:18,338
[Matt] <i>He's an adrenaline junkie.</i>

745
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:22,718
<i>Whether he is competing</i>
<i>as a snowboarder to cliff diving,</i>

746
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:24,595
<i>skydiving,</i>

747
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,680
he just loves adrenaline.

748
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:34,146
<i>And the biggest high he gets</i>
<i>is the live performance.</i>

749
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:41,612
[Steve] <i>Performing your music</i>
<i>and having that connection,</i>

750
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:45,824
with those thousands of people,
that is the ultimate rush.

751
00:54:45,908 --> 00:54:48,869
And that is the truest of addictions.

752
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:55,250
[Matt] <i>Steve's a relentless addict.</i>

753
00:54:55,334 --> 00:54:57,461
He jumps from addiction to addiction.

754
00:55:00,506 --> 00:55:03,133
<i>He gets obsessed with things.</i>
<i>Right now, it's health.</i>

755
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:04,426
Thank God.

756
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:09,306
I'd much rather be yelling at promoters
for not delivering alkaline water

757
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:12,893
than yelling at promoters because
he needs another bottle of vodka.

758
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:17,940
For a while, he was a big drinker.

759
00:55:28,242 --> 00:55:31,078
[Steve] <i>I was always nervous</i>
<i>when I would start DJing,</i>

760
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,247
<i>and I would get drunk all the time.</i>

761
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:38,460
I mean, I was drinking all the time.

762
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:44,675
[Matt] <i>To the point</i>
<i>that me and Adam talked about</i>

763
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,093
just a step below an intervention.

764
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:53,809
Adam had been sober for a dozen years.

765
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,938
<i>He was like the king of sobriety.</i>

766
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,067
He's gotten so dark in his life

767
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:06,363
from being so controlled
and consumed by drugs

768
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:08,365
that he tried to take his life.

769
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:14,413
<i>In one instance</i>
<i>that he did put the gun to his head,</i>

770
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:16,790
<i>the latch didn't go.</i>

771
00:56:16,957 --> 00:56:21,503
It spoke to him in a way
that he needed to completely change.

772
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:27,342
<i>It's crazy that you have to get</i>
<i>to that dark, deep place...</i>

773
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:29,511
<i>in order for you to change.</i>

774
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:38,687
<i>I get this BBM</i>
<i>from a poker friend of mine.</i>

775
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:43,275
"Yo, did you hear about AM?"

776
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:47,738
It hit me pretty hard.

777
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:52,868
I remember closing the door
to my office and calling Steve back.

778
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:54,786
And I just said that...

779
00:56:57,456 --> 00:56:58,957
"You know, Adam's dead."

780
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:03,211
It was... [sighs]

781
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:11,845
[Travis] <i>After he passed away,</i>
<i>it was like...</i>

782
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:16,183
I can't believe I lost him.
You know, it was like...

783
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,103
Uh...

784
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:27,527
[Matt] <i>I remember</i>
<i>Steve had a show that night.</i>

785
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:31,531
[Steve] <i>I didn't understand</i>
<i>how to express myself.</i>

786
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:33,408
How to, like, to deal with it.

787
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:37,537
<i>But there was this really dark place.</i>

788
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:48,173
<i>And then I just played.</i>

789
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:53,637
<i>And 30 minutes in,</i>
<i>I played this Daft Punk record.</i>

790
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:59,434
<i>And Daft Punk was the artist</i>
<i>that me and AM, we bonded over.</i>

791
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:04,314
That's when I just broke down.
I just broke down.

792
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:11,279
I was crying like... I couldn't believe
I was crying and playing it and...

793
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:26,628
I had a hard time DJing,
I couldn't... I had to cut my set short.

794
00:58:29,965 --> 00:58:33,760
That same moment with my father,
it was like it all kinda came out.

795
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:45,856
He took it harder than almost
he took his father's passing.

796
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:50,027
[Steve] <i>That was it for me</i>
<i>as far as drinking. I was done.</i>

797
00:58:52,738 --> 00:58:56,074
There's no reason why
the two very close people of my life died.

798
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:04,750
I think about it still,
it's so shocking that he's gone.

799
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:16,386
He's one of the best human beings
I actually ever met.

800
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:24,227
<i>So I feel very grateful</i>
<i>to have had someone like that in my life.</i>

801
00:59:25,437 --> 00:59:28,774
[Travis] <i>There were so many other people</i>
<i>that he touched.</i>

802
00:59:28,857 --> 00:59:33,737
He was always so positive
and always helping everyone around him.

803
00:59:37,616 --> 00:59:39,618
[Steve] <i>He always said one thing,</i>

804
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:42,996
<i>"Starve the ego, feed the soul."</i>

805
00:59:44,456 --> 00:59:47,084
I mean, that's one thing
everyone can live by.

806
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:11,608
[Steve] <i>I needed to go through a disaster</i>
<i>like MSG not happening</i>

807
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:18,657
in order to see why
and what makes Steve Aoki.

808
01:00:22,202 --> 01:00:26,248
And that's LA. That's going back to LA,
going back to my roots.

809
01:00:27,916 --> 01:00:29,459
<i>All the people supporting me,</i>

810
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:32,504
those are the people
I really need to be cherishing

811
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:34,923
and I really need to be investing my time

812
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:38,009
and, you know, obviously,
this is a big show tour.

813
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:45,559
[Eric] <i>What I loved when we collaborated</i>
<i>together when I was running...</i>

814
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:48,603
It was the most hilarious
fund-raiser I've ever done

815
01:00:48,687 --> 01:00:52,399
because half of the people were your fans,
who had no idea who I was.

816
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:54,192
The others were a bunch of my supporters

817
01:00:54,276 --> 01:00:56,194
who probably had never heard
of Steve Aoki.

818
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:59,573
And it was this mix of
the craziest combinations of people

819
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:03,618
suddenly finding champagne on their face
and cakes in their hair

820
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:05,579
and it's not just politics,

821
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:09,332
but getting involved in the city.
I love this friendship to do that.

822
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:11,042
-Absolutely.
-If we can get your fans

823
01:01:11,126 --> 01:01:13,503
to help be part of their city,
they're gonna love it.

824
01:01:13,587 --> 01:01:15,589
That's exactly the vibe.

825
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:18,091
I don't want this to be
an ordinary Aoki show.

826
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:22,470
I want this to be on the streets of LA.
I want it to be free.

827
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:24,764
Downtown would be a hot place to do it

828
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:27,350
because the revitalization
that's going on,

829
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:29,269
especially in the old corridors.

830
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:32,063
Spring Street,
where you guys have your office.

831
01:01:32,147 --> 01:01:36,526

Broadway has all those old theaters.

832
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:38,737
I don't know.
I think it would be a great place.

833
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:40,113
That would be amazing.

834
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:43,491
That's a win-win for everybody
and a homecoming for you.

835
01:01:43,575 --> 01:01:44,951
Yeah, big time.

836
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:47,329

840

841
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:56,379

<i>and he's really going for it.</i>

979
01:15:19,807 --> 01:15:22,435
I don't think I was
supposed to succeed as a DJ.

980
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:24,979
<i>And somehow I'm in a place where</i>

981
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:29,900
I've kind of made it, but I feel like
there's a lot more to go for me.

982
01:15:30,818 --> 01:15:35,740
[man] <i>Rocky Aoki</i>
<i>in his first comeback race since 1979,</i>

983
01:15:35,823 --> 01:15:40,411
<i>when he was almost mortally injured</i>
<i>in San Francisco in a bad accident.</i>

984
01:15:40,494 --> 01:15:43,039
I don't really know if I can chill out.

985
01:15:43,122 --> 01:15:45,499
<i>I don't know if I have the capacity.</i>

986
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:48,669
I'm always thinking,
"I got a lot more to go.

987
01:15:48,753 --> 01:15:50,046
I got a lot more to do."

988
01:15:50,129 --> 01:15:53,716
[man] <i>They told him he'd never do it.</i>
<i>They said he was crazy.</i>

989
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:56,719
<i>The man with nine lives.</i>

990
01:15:57,344 --> 01:16:01,682
[Steve] <i>I'm 35 years old right now</i>
<i>and I just don't want to waste any time.</i>

991
01:16:01,766 --> 01:16:06,562
[man] <i>I think he's gonna go on to win</i>
<i>his own race today, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

992
01:16:06,645 --> 01:16:10,399
I just feel so fucking fortunate
and lucky that I'm in this position.

993
01:16:10,483 --> 01:16:13,569
And I don't wanna... sleep on it.
