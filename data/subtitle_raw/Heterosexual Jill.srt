a beast that needs to

106
00:05:19,534 --> 00:05:21,903
Jill, I think going out and
finding another man to date is

the best course
of action for you.

108

keep your willingness.

that door on possibility.

wasn't deceiving you.

181

I got cast as a man in a film.

182

confidentiality agreement,

183
00:09:00,725 --> 00:09:01,893
they told me that
if I told anybody -

184
00:09:01,926 --> 00:09:03,595
JILL: Listen, it doesn't matter
why you were deceiving me.

185
00:09:03,628 --> 00:09:06,665
The fact is that you were.

186
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:10,069
JILL: What is that?

187
00:09:10,102 --> 00:09:12,072
Did you just have
surgery or something?

188
00:09:12,105 --> 00:09:13,240
JAMIE: Yeah.

189
00:09:13,273 --> 00:09:15,008
JILL: Maybe I should have
been able to read the signs.

190
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,810
But when you
tried to seduce me -

191
00:09:16,843 --> 00:09:18,980
JAMIE: Ok, wait -
no, you seduced me.

192
00:09:19,013 --> 00:09:19,847
JILL: I don't think so.

193
00:09:19,881 --> 00:09:20,948
JAMIE: No, I'm
pretty clear on this.

194
00:09:20,982 --> 00:09:22,216
You seduced me.

195
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:26,622
JILL: Do you think I
have that kind of power?

196
00:09:26,655 --> 00:09:29,893
JAMIE: I wouldn't...I
wouldn't say "power"...

197
00:09:29,926 --> 00:09:31,027
I mean, you know.

198
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:34,731
JILL: Jamie, if I were a
lesbian I would be totally in

199
00:09:34,764 --> 00:09:35,900
love with myself too.

200
00:09:35,933 --> 00:09:39,003
So it's OK - I get it.

201
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,172
Stop trying to seduce me!

202
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,174
JAMIE: It was an accident.

203
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,576
JILL: You say
accident, I say Freudian slip.

204
00:09:44,609 --> 00:09:46,978
JAMIE: You can go at
anytime, you know.

205
00:09:47,012 --> 00:09:49,248
JILL: I have a
favor to ask you.

206
00:09:49,282 --> 00:09:51,083
I came up with a
plan that's going to

207
00:09:51,117 --> 00:09:54,254
solve all of my problems.

208
00:09:54,288 --> 00:09:55,289
JAMIE: Uh huh.

209
00:09:55,322 --> 00:09:57,291
JILL: I think we should date.

210
00:09:57,324 --> 00:10:00,094
I think we should date so that
I know I was only attracted to

211
00:10:00,128 --> 00:10:04,098
you as a man and
not as a woman.

212
00:10:04,132 --> 00:10:05,668
So what do you think?

213
00:10:05,701 --> 00:10:06,735
JAMIE: ...No.

214
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:07,837
JILL: You don't have to
make a decision right now.

215
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:08,971
You know what?

216
00:10:09,004 --> 00:10:11,675
Sleep on it.

217
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:12,642
JAMIE: No.

218
00:10:12,676 --> 00:10:13,577
JILL: Ok, I should get going.

219
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,478
JAMIE: Jill -

220
00:10:14,511 --> 00:10:15,312
JILL: Thank you so
much for the water.

221
00:10:15,345 --> 00:10:16,213
It was really good!

222
00:10:16,246 --> 00:10:17,281
Thank you.

223
00:10:17,315 --> 00:10:18,716
Bye!

224
00:10:18,749 --> 00:10:19,717
Call me!

225
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,785
JAMIE: She's the
craziest person I've ever met.

226
00:10:20,818 --> 00:10:21,719
I mean, come on.

227
00:10:21,752 --> 00:10:22,920
David - who does that?

228
00:10:22,954 --> 00:10:24,756
Who wants to date a lesbian
to turn themselves straight?

229
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,158
DAVID: I thought you were
in love with her anyway.

230
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:27,793
JAMIE: She's crazy.

231
00:10:27,826 --> 00:10:30,096
DAVID: Well the crazy ones
are always the best in bed.

232
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,031
JOSÉ: One minute to places!

233
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,733
DAVID: How about one
minute at your place.

234
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:36,303
JAMIE: This film is
such a friggin' joke.

235
00:10:36,337 --> 00:10:38,873
DAVID: What is
that bitch doing.

236
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:41,041
He's gay, you know!

237
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:43,879
And he's mine.

238
00:10:43,912 --> 00:10:45,280
JAMIE: Do you think
I owe this to her?

239
00:10:45,313 --> 00:10:46,615
DAVID: Who?

240
00:10:46,648 --> 00:10:47,884
JAMIE: Forget it.

241
00:10:47,917 --> 00:10:49,118
DAVID: Jill?

242
00:10:49,151 --> 00:10:50,586
JAMIE: I kinda
feel like I messed up

243
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,988
her brain or something.

244
00:10:52,021 --> 00:10:54,024
DAVID: Because you lied
about not having a pussy?

245
00:10:54,057 --> 00:10:57,728
JAMIE: Yeah, you're a pussy.

246
00:10:57,761 --> 00:11:02,267
JILL: Jamie used to lie a lot,
and that was really painful.

247
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,202
I even thought I
was in love with him.

248
00:11:04,235 --> 00:11:07,907
So I needed to see
him to sort things out.

249
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,910
Wipe the slate clean so
that I could really move

250
00:11:10,943 --> 00:11:14,214
forward with other men.

251
00:11:14,247 --> 00:11:19,320
So I went to his apartment
last Saturday, and I -

252
00:11:19,353 --> 00:11:21,322
SANDY: Hi there.

253
00:11:21,355 --> 00:11:23,892
Are you here for
better day tomorrow?

254
00:11:23,926 --> 00:11:25,027
JAMIE: Ex-lesbians?

255
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,895
SANDY: Yes, welcome.

256
00:11:26,929 --> 00:11:27,863
Have a seat.

257
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:28,764
JAMIE: Thank you.

258
00:11:28,797 --> 00:11:30,033
SANDY: Sure.

259
00:11:30,066 --> 00:11:32,135
We started a little while ago,
but if you'd like to introduce

260
00:11:32,168 --> 00:11:34,337
yourself before we continue.

261
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,306
JAMIE: Sure.

262
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:38,275
My name's Stephanie.

263
00:11:38,309 --> 00:11:40,277
LeBlanc.

264
00:11:40,311 --> 00:11:43,081
You can call me Ms. LeBlanc.

265
00:11:43,114 --> 00:11:46,184
Or Stephanie's probably fine.

266
00:11:46,217 --> 00:11:51,424
Anyway I'm not an ex-lesbian,
just a real lesbian.

267
00:11:51,457 --> 00:11:54,361
SANDY: So are you
a pre-ex-lesbian?

268
00:11:54,394 --> 00:11:59,367
JAMIE: No, just a
pre...futuristic lesbian.

269
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:04,072
Or a post....modern lesbian.

270
00:12:04,105 --> 00:12:06,408
But I have a friend
who's an ex-lesbian and

271
00:12:06,442 --> 00:12:10,012
I'm convinced it's a phase.

272
00:12:10,045 --> 00:12:10,980
SANDY: Is that right.

273
00:12:11,013 --> 00:12:13,149
Well let's just see if
we can broaden your

274
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,218
viewpoints a little bit.

275
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:17,120
Welcome, Stephanie.

276
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,290
GROUP: Welcome, Stephanie.

277
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:20,691
JAMIE: Thank you.

278
00:12:20,725 --> 00:12:22,059
SANDY: Now Jill
here was just telling us

279
00:12:22,093 --> 00:12:24,129
about her ex-boyfriend Jamie.

280
00:12:24,162 --> 00:12:26,765
JAMIE: Oh - well I'm
sorry to have interrupted.

281
00:12:26,798 --> 00:12:28,233
SANDY: Not a problem.

282
00:12:28,266 --> 00:12:30,737
She was just telling us how
she showed up at his apartment

283
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,873
after having not
seen him in four years.

284
00:12:33,906 --> 00:12:37,444
JAMIE: Oh...four
years is a long time, Jill.

285
00:12:37,478 --> 00:12:40,047
To still be
thinking about him.

286
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,384
SANDY: It is never too
late to rekindle an old flame

287
00:12:42,417 --> 00:12:44,419
with an eligible bachelor.

288
00:12:44,452 --> 00:12:45,954
Isn't that right, ladies!

289
00:12:45,987 --> 00:12:47,122
GROUP: That's right!!

290
00:12:47,156 --> 00:12:49,025
JAMIE: He must be
quite a catch, Jill.

291
00:12:49,058 --> 00:12:51,193
SANDY: Any man we can
catch is worth catching.

292
00:12:51,227 --> 00:12:52,495
Isn't that right, ladies!

293
00:12:52,528 --> 00:12:53,864
GROUP: That's right!!

294
00:12:53,897 --> 00:12:55,332
SANDY: So you went
to his apartment...

295
00:12:55,365 --> 00:12:58,201
JILL: Yep, and that's it.

296
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:00,104
That's the end of the story.

297
00:13:00,138 --> 00:13:02,907
SANDY: Well was he there?

298
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,509
What did he say,
what did you say?

299
00:13:04,542 --> 00:13:06,745
JILL: No, he wasn't there.

300
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:11,151
SANDY: Ok then...good for you,
for taking that first step

301
00:13:11,184 --> 00:13:16,022
toward getting back on track
with your heterosexual life.

302
00:13:16,056 --> 00:13:18,225
Alright, we have a few
minutes before break.

303
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:20,394
If you'd all just
sit back please.

304
00:13:20,428 --> 00:13:24,966
Close your eyes, relax.

305
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,903
We'll start with a
few deep breaths.

306
00:13:27,936 --> 00:13:30,106
Inhale...

307
00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:33,976
and exhale...

308
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:36,814
Inhale...

309
00:13:36,847 --> 00:13:40,784
and exhale...

310
00:13:40,818 --> 00:13:45,824
I like the dick,
pussy be gone.

311
00:13:45,857 --> 00:13:50,229
GROUP: I like the
dick, pussy be gone.

312
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:55,469
I like the dick,
pussy be gone!

313
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,370
SANDY: Balls.

314
00:13:57,404 --> 00:13:59,140
GROUP MEMBERS: Cunt.

315
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:00,308
Penis.

316
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:01,876
Lactose intolerant.

317
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:03,544
Erect penises in my mouth.

318
00:14:03,578 --> 00:14:04,946
Jello!

319
00:14:04,979 --> 00:14:07,483
Tahini.

320
00:14:07,516 --> 00:14:09,351
Penis.

321
00:14:09,384 --> 00:14:10,486
Hummus.

322
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:12,188
Melty cheese!

323
00:14:12,222 --> 00:14:13,423
Coal miners.

324
00:14:13,456 --> 00:14:15,058
Wet pussy!

325
00:14:15,091 --> 00:14:19,997
Yes!

326
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,433
Rectum.

327
00:14:29,242 --> 00:14:30,376
JILL: What are
you doing here?!

328
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:31,844
JAMIE: I wanted
to check it out.

329
00:14:31,878 --> 00:14:33,079
JILL: This isn't
a joke, Jamie.

330
00:14:33,112 --> 00:14:35,215
JAMIE: I'm not laughing, Jill.

331
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,518
JILL: I would like it very
much if you would leave.

332
00:14:37,551 --> 00:14:39,620
JAMIE: I'm going to
stay until I get my turn.

333
00:14:39,653 --> 00:14:42,056
JILL: What are
you going to say?

334
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,625
JAMIE: You'll see.

335
00:14:43,658 --> 00:14:47,630
JILL: Don't embarrass me.

336
00:14:47,663 --> 00:14:51,834
JAMIE: You'll see!

337
00:14:54,971 --> 00:14:56,273
SANDY: So Stephanie,
would you like to tell us a

338
00:14:56,306 --> 00:15:00,244
little more about your friend?

339
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:05,551
Stephanie?

340
00:15:05,584 --> 00:15:06,552
Stephanie!

341
00:15:06,585 --> 00:15:09,421
Would you like to tell
us about your friend?

342
00:15:09,454 --> 00:15:10,389
JAMIE: Uh - yeah.

343
00:15:10,422 --> 00:15:12,492
Yeah, sure.

344
00:15:12,525 --> 00:15:16,095
So my friend...ish, came
to me the other day wanting

345
00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:18,566
me to help her
with her ex-lesbianism.

346
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:19,967
Call me
old-fashioned, but I really

347
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,834
don't believe in this stuff.

348
00:15:20,868 --> 00:15:24,439
I believe that God
created lesbians.

349
00:15:24,472 --> 00:15:26,541
God created man,
and He created woman,

350
00:15:26,575 --> 00:15:30,279
but He also created two
women, hence lesbians.

351
00:15:30,313 --> 00:15:32,415
MEMBER Yeah, but he made it
so their parts don't match.

352
00:15:32,448 --> 00:15:33,449
JAMIE: What do you mean?

353
00:15:33,482 --> 00:15:34,350
They match perfectly.

354
00:15:34,383 --> 00:15:35,686
They're like a pair
of furry slippers.

355
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:37,387
MEMBER: God did not
create two women.

356
00:15:37,421 --> 00:15:40,524
He created Adam and
Eve, and they had kids.

357
00:15:40,557 --> 00:15:42,193
JAMIE: Yeah, but Adam
and Eve had two boys.

358
00:15:42,227 --> 00:15:43,361
Where did their
wives come from?

359
00:15:43,394 --> 00:15:44,996
MEMBER: Their wives
weren't lesbians.

360
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:47,499
JAMIE: John 18:12,
and on the seventh day,

361
00:15:47,533 --> 00:15:49,235
God created lesbians.

362
00:15:49,268 --> 00:15:51,370
MEMBER: You're an idiot.

363
00:15:51,403 --> 00:15:54,040
SANDY: Stephanie,
this is a secular group.

364
00:15:54,074 --> 00:15:56,710
We try to help
women become heterosexual

365
00:15:56,743 --> 00:15:59,714
outside of conventional
religious teachings.

366
00:15:59,747 --> 00:16:00,848
JAMIE: How come?

367
00:16:00,882 --> 00:16:03,150
SANDY: Well ex-lesbians
come from all different faiths.

368
00:16:03,184 --> 00:16:05,387
And some from no faith at all.

369
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,723
JAMIE: Oh.

370
00:16:07,756 --> 00:16:10,525
I guess that's kinda cool.

371
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:13,329
SANDY: So how did you
leave things with your friend?

372
00:16:13,363 --> 00:16:16,599
JAMIE: Well I told Jill....O.

373
00:16:16,633 --> 00:16:18,202
Jill-O.

374
00:16:18,235 --> 00:16:19,370
That I don't know
if I could help her do

375
00:16:19,403 --> 00:16:20,504
something that's so unnatural.

376
00:16:20,537 --> 00:16:23,008
JILL: What's so unnatural
about wanting to be happy?

377
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,075
JAMIE: But what
does being straight

378
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:25,110
have to do with being happy?

379
00:16:25,143 --> 00:16:29,048
JILL: Maybe being
accepted, maybe fitting in.

380
00:16:29,081 --> 00:16:31,183
Maybe not having
to be ashamed,

381
00:16:31,217 --> 00:16:32,652
maybe not having to hide.

382
00:16:32,685 --> 00:16:34,988
Maybe not having your
friends and family desert you

383
00:16:35,022 --> 00:16:37,424
for being some kind of freak.

384
00:16:37,457 --> 00:16:39,726
Not everyone's
life was like yours.

385
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,430
Some of us didn't
have it so easy.

386
00:16:42,463 --> 00:16:47,469
You can't compare your life to
mine, or anyone else here.

387
00:16:47,503 --> 00:16:51,774
You can't even begin to
compare those things.

388
00:16:51,807 --> 00:16:54,244
DAVID: You are so whipped.

389
00:16:54,277 --> 00:16:56,146
JAMIE: I just think that
maybe I can help her, you know?

390
00:16:56,179 --> 00:16:58,548
I mean maybe she'll end up a
lesbian or maybe she won't,

391
00:16:58,581 --> 00:17:00,384
but I feel like
either way she just needs my

392
00:17:00,418 --> 00:17:04,088
help to get out of this limbo.

393
00:17:04,121 --> 00:17:05,791
DAVID: You just want
to get into her pants.

394
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:07,326
JAMIE: Yeah right
David, I wouldn't

395
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,627
touch her with a 10 foot pole.

396
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,329
DAVID: But you would
if it was 9 inches!

397
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,331
Eh?

398
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,231
Get it?

399
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:12,799
See what I did?

400
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:13,633
JAMIE: Yeah, hmm.

401
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:14,434
More like 4.

402
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:16,369
DAVID: OK mine is
at least 5 or 6!

403
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,238
JAMIE: I don't want
to know about it.

404
00:17:18,272 --> 00:17:21,608
DAVID: You brought it up!

405
00:17:21,642 --> 00:17:27,682
(Lola and José talk in Spanish)

406
00:17:27,716 --> 00:17:29,552
DAVID: She's such a hussy.

407
00:17:29,585 --> 00:17:33,723
JAMIE: Don't I know it.

408
00:17:33,756 --> 00:17:35,392
DAVID: Tell her to keep
her hands off my man!

409
00:17:35,425 --> 00:17:43,668
(talking in Spanish).

410
00:17:43,701 --> 00:17:45,103
JOSÉ: Hi.

411
00:17:45,136 --> 00:17:45,803
JAMIE: Hey.

412
00:17:45,837 --> 00:17:46,838
LOLA: Hey.

413
00:17:46,871 --> 00:17:48,474
(talking in Spanish).

414
00:17:48,507 --> 00:17:49,541
JAMIE: Oh don't
let me interrupt.

415
00:17:49,575 --> 00:17:52,378
I'm just walking by.

416
00:17:52,411 --> 00:17:54,681
So Spanish.

417
00:17:54,714 --> 00:17:57,083
Flavor of the month, is it?

418
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,284
LOLA: Excuse me?

419
00:17:58,318 --> 00:17:59,787
JAMIE: Well, it's obvious
what kind of tactics you have.

420
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,189
First German, now Spanish.

421
00:18:02,223 --> 00:18:06,261
I'd say it was clever but
I don't think that it is.

422
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:07,729
LOLA: I like languages.

423
00:18:07,763 --> 00:18:09,131
JAMIE: José's gay anyway.

424
00:18:09,164 --> 00:18:10,832
LOLA: No he's not.

425
00:18:10,867 --> 00:18:12,368
JAMIE: Don't start.

426
00:18:12,402 --> 00:18:13,302
LOLA: Don't start what?

427
00:18:13,336 --> 00:18:14,504
He's not gay.

428
00:18:14,537 --> 00:18:15,505
He winked at me.

429
00:18:15,538 --> 00:18:16,739
JAMIE: Oh he winked at you.

430
00:18:16,773 --> 00:18:18,742
You know I do expect
more from you than that.

431
00:18:18,776 --> 00:18:20,644
LOLA: Not all
effeminate men are gay.

432
00:18:20,677 --> 00:18:22,713
JAMIE: Ok, here we go...

433
00:18:22,746 --> 00:18:25,150
LOLA: Well it's true.

434
00:18:25,183 --> 00:18:26,151
JAMIE: Ok I'll
give you that, Lola.

435
00:18:26,184 --> 00:18:27,552
Not all
effeminate men are gay.

436
00:18:27,585 --> 00:18:28,553
The rest are from Europe.

437
00:18:28,586 --> 00:18:30,656
But since José is from
Mexico, he's actually

438
00:18:30,689 --> 00:18:32,491
exempt under that clause.

439
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:35,228
You think that's funny?

440
00:18:35,262 --> 00:18:37,564
LOLA: It's kinda funny.

441
00:18:37,597 --> 00:18:39,566
You're still an
asshole though.

442
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:40,534
JAMIE: What did I do?

443
00:18:40,567 --> 00:18:41,602
I never did anything.

444
00:18:41,636 --> 00:18:42,537
LOLA: That's right.

445
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,472
You never did anything.

446
00:18:44,505 --> 00:18:48,277
JAMIE: That's the end
of this conversation.

447
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,344
LOLA: Have you
found anyone desperate

448
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,879
enough to date you yet?

449
00:18:50,913 --> 00:18:56,186
JAMIE: Yes, I did.

450
00:19:20,414 --> 00:19:21,381
JILL: Hi.

451
00:19:21,415 --> 00:19:23,551
What's that?

452
00:19:23,585 --> 00:19:24,786
JAMIE: It's a rose.

453
00:19:24,819 --> 00:19:25,987
JILL: What are
you doing with it?

454
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,958
JAMIE: I thought you wanted
this to be like a real date?

455
00:19:28,991 --> 00:19:31,894
JILL: Yeah, a
real lesbian date.

456
00:19:31,927 --> 00:19:33,262
Try again.

457
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:45,409
Jamie, when was the last
time you gave a girl flowers?

458
00:19:45,443 --> 00:19:48,213
JAMIE: I gave my mom
flowers for Mother's Day.

459
00:19:48,247 --> 00:19:49,181
JILL: Exactly.

460
00:19:49,214 --> 00:19:51,884
So plant that in the
ground and try again.

461
00:19:51,917 --> 00:19:53,586
JAMIE: You can't plant - ugh.

462
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,256
I've given
girlfriends flowers before, OK?

463
00:19:56,289 --> 00:19:58,859
And my friend gives her
girlfriend flowers every week,

464
00:19:58,893 --> 00:19:59,760
so you just can't -

465
00:19:59,793 --> 00:20:02,396
JILL: And take off
that ridiculous tie!

466
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,241
Who is it?

467
00:20:12,275 --> 00:20:13,643
JAMIE: It's your lesbian date.

468
00:20:13,676 --> 00:20:15,878
I'm wearing a backpack
and carrying a BPA-free

469
00:20:15,912 --> 00:20:19,883
refillable water bottle.

470
00:20:19,917 --> 00:20:22,452
JILL: Jamie, we are
not going on a hike.

471
00:20:22,486 --> 00:20:24,355
And a real lesbian
would never knock.

472
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,926
A real lesbian would use
the keys that I gave her.

473
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:28,861
JAMIE: Jill -

474
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,262
JILL: Let's do that.

475
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:40,307
It's the big silver one.

476
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,276
The big silver one!

477
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:48,717
JAMIE: They're
all big and silver!

478
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,353
JILL: It's this one.

479
00:20:51,386 --> 00:20:53,323
JAMIE: Jill, I'm a
lesbian - a real one.

480
00:20:53,356 --> 00:20:54,657
I don't know what
you've been doing,

481
00:20:54,691 --> 00:20:56,926
but I'm a real lesbian and
we don't do any of this,

482
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,663
so get your
purse - we're going!

483
00:20:59,697 --> 00:21:02,700
JILL: A real lesbian
woman who takes charge.

484
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:03,801
I like it!

485
00:21:03,834 --> 00:21:05,070
Alright!

486
00:21:05,103 --> 00:21:06,338
JAMIE: Let's go.

487
00:21:06,371 --> 00:21:08,340
JILL: Ok!

488
00:21:08,373 --> 00:21:09,908
What, nothing?

489
00:21:19,753 --> 00:21:23,925
JAMIE: What do lesbians say
when they go out on a date?

490
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:24,859
You tell me Jill.

491
00:21:24,892 --> 00:21:27,929
JILL: I don't know -
you're the lesbian.

492
00:21:37,507 --> 00:21:39,743
JILL: Rule #1 - I
call all the shots.

493
00:21:39,776 --> 00:21:42,413
Rule #2 - First base only.

494
00:21:42,446 --> 00:21:45,016
Rule #3 - No means no.

495
00:21:45,049 --> 00:21:46,985
Do you know what that means?

496
00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:49,955
It means that if you make a
move and I think it's too

497
00:21:49,988 --> 00:21:54,727
much, and I say no, that
means you have to back off, OK?

498
00:21:54,761 --> 00:21:56,562
JAMIE: Yeah, I got it.

499
00:21:56,596 --> 00:22:01,435
JILL: Rule #4 - have fun being
my last lesbian girlfriend!

500
00:22:01,468 --> 00:22:03,370
Because we're
going to get married!

501
00:22:03,404 --> 00:22:07,742
LOL - we're so not
getting married.

502
00:22:07,776 --> 00:22:09,044
We're breaking up
as soon as I'm ripe

503
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:11,514
for the heterosexual picking.

504
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,795
JILL: Women are pigs.

505
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,664
BARTENDER: You
should try dating men.

506
00:22:54,697 --> 00:22:56,065
JILL: I've tried.

507
00:22:56,099 --> 00:22:57,200
Tried with no success.

508
00:22:57,233 --> 00:22:59,136
BARTENDER: Well you know
what they say - If at first you

509
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:03,607
don't succeed -
try, try, try again.

510
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,809
Then quit.

511
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:10,548
'Cuz there's no point in being
- you know, dumb about it.

512
00:23:10,582 --> 00:23:11,851
JAMIE: Ooh - look at that.

513
00:23:11,884 --> 00:23:13,452
The bartender's
flirting with you.

514
00:23:13,486 --> 00:23:14,453
JILL: Who, Yentl?

515
00:23:14,487 --> 00:23:15,621
She's not my type.

516
00:23:15,654 --> 00:23:18,458
JAMIE: You sound disappointed.

517
00:23:18,492 --> 00:23:22,797
JILL: Ok, here's to...us.

518
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:25,500
May our relationship be
short and to the point.

519
00:23:25,533 --> 00:23:28,102
May it end
effortlessly and painlessly,

520
00:23:28,136 --> 00:23:29,505
and - oh shit!

521
00:23:29,538 --> 00:23:30,205
JAMIE: What?

522
00:23:30,239 --> 00:23:36,479
JILL: Shit, shit, shit...

523
00:23:36,513 --> 00:23:37,781
JAMIE: Uh, hello?

524
00:23:37,814 --> 00:23:40,785
JILL: Shhh.

525
00:23:40,818 --> 00:23:41,585
Don't talk to me!

526
00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:42,553
I'm not here!

527
00:23:42,586 --> 00:23:44,121
I'm sorry - I'm so sorry.

528
00:23:44,155 --> 00:23:45,823
I think I dropped my quarter.

529
00:23:45,856 --> 00:23:47,492
JAMIE: It's OK...honey.

530
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:49,728
Come back up - I
have more quarters.

531
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:50,962
JILL: Is she still there?

532
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:52,799
JAMIE: Who?

533
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:55,802
JILL: The girl with the red tank
top and the huge big boobs.

534
00:23:55,835 --> 00:23:57,236
JAMIE: Ohhh....

535
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,940
JILL: She's in my
ex-lesbian group.

536
00:23:59,973 --> 00:24:01,275
JAMIE: Ohhhhh....

537
00:24:01,308 --> 00:24:03,243
JILL: What is she doing doing?

538
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:05,213
JAMIE: Probably the
same thing you are.

539
00:24:05,246 --> 00:24:06,781
JILL: Here.

540
00:24:06,815 --> 00:24:08,216
Go try to buy her a drink.

541
00:24:08,249 --> 00:24:09,517
Flirt with her or something.

542
00:24:09,551 --> 00:24:10,853
JAMIE: Why?

543
00:24:10,886 --> 00:24:12,888
JILL: Because I want to
know what she's doing here.

544
00:24:12,922 --> 00:24:17,828
JAMIE: What if she
recognizes me from the meeting?

545
00:24:17,861 --> 00:24:20,096
JILL: Jamie,
don't flatter yourself.

546
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,798
All you dykes look the same.

547
00:24:21,832 --> 00:24:23,000
JAMIE: That wasn't nice!

548
00:24:23,034 --> 00:24:24,068
JILL: Just go!

549
00:24:24,101 --> 00:24:26,070
JAMIE: Not until you tell
me that I'm a unique and

550
00:24:26,103 --> 00:24:28,039
original-looking lesbian, Jill.

551
00:24:28,072 --> 00:24:34,079
JILL: Jamie...

552
00:24:34,112 --> 00:24:37,217
JAMIE: Fine.

553
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:48,063
JAMIE: Hey.

554
00:24:48,096 --> 00:24:48,964
RUBY: Hi.

555
00:24:48,997 --> 00:24:49,898
JAMIE: How's it goin'.

556
00:24:49,931 --> 00:24:50,799
RUBY: It's going....

557
00:24:50,832 --> 00:24:52,033
JAMIE: Yeah?

558
00:24:52,067 --> 00:24:53,002
RUBY: What's your name?

559
00:24:53,035 --> 00:24:53,936
JAMIE: Jamie.

560
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:54,804
RUBY: Ruby.

561
00:24:54,837 --> 00:24:58,709
JAMIE: Oh, Ruby -
that's very nice.

562
00:24:58,742 --> 00:25:00,677
RUBY: It rhymes with booby...

563
00:25:00,711 --> 00:25:01,645
JAMIE: Huh?

564
00:25:01,678 --> 00:25:02,746
RUBY: Did you come here alone?

565
00:25:02,779 --> 00:25:04,682
JAMIE: No, I came
with my friend.

566
00:25:04,716 --> 00:25:06,851
She's straight.

567
00:25:06,885 --> 00:25:09,153
Are you straight?

568
00:25:09,187 --> 00:25:10,723
RUBY: What do you think?

569
00:25:10,756 --> 00:25:15,160
JAMIE: I think
you're...very pretty.

570
00:25:57,076 --> 00:26:03,283
RUBY: Jill??

571
00:26:03,317 --> 00:26:07,021
JILL: Let's go.

572
00:26:07,055 --> 00:26:10,325
JAMIE: I'll call you.

573
00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:20,270
JAMIE: Woah, wait - stop.

574
00:26:20,303 --> 00:26:21,171
Stop.

575
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:22,405
JILL: Why?

576
00:26:22,439 --> 00:26:23,441
JAMIE: Because you're drunk and
you're going to regret this.

577
00:26:23,474 --> 00:26:24,742
JILL: I'm not drunk.

578
00:26:24,775 --> 00:26:26,877
JAMIE: Then I'm
going to regret it.

579
00:26:26,911 --> 00:26:28,245
JILL: You don't
think I'm sexy?

580
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:29,414
JAMIE: You're very sexy, Jill.

581
00:26:29,448 --> 00:26:32,017
But you're also a little nuts.

582
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:34,119
You're a little crazy.

583
00:26:34,152 --> 00:26:37,790
And this is counter-productive
to whatever you want to do.

584
00:26:37,824 --> 00:26:38,958
JILL: Just fuck me.

585
00:26:38,992 --> 00:26:40,093
JAMIE: No!

586
00:26:40,126 --> 00:26:41,128
JILL: Please?

587
00:26:41,161 --> 00:26:42,096
JAMIE: Jill...no...

588
00:26:42,129 --> 00:26:47,002
JILL: Pretty please
with a cherry on top?

589
00:26:47,035 --> 00:26:48,269
JAMIE: No means no.

590
00:26:48,303 --> 00:26:49,337
Remember?

591
00:26:49,371 --> 00:26:51,940
Your rules?

592
00:26:51,973 --> 00:26:53,442
JILL: You're no fun.

593
00:26:53,476 --> 00:26:56,712
Male Jamie was
so much more fun.

594
00:26:56,746 --> 00:26:58,982
He was up for anything!

595
00:26:59,016 --> 00:27:00,317
JAMIE: Yeah well, he didn't
have sex with you either.

596
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,785
JILL: Well he had a
heart problem and that

597
00:27:01,818 --> 00:27:03,053
was a whole other issue.

598
00:27:03,086 --> 00:27:05,356
Do you have a heart problem?

599
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,791
JAMIE: I don't, no.

600
00:27:06,824 --> 00:27:07,859
JILL: No?

601
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:08,993
What was his problem then?

602
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:10,896
JAMIE: His problem
was he had boobs.

603
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:14,299
JILL: Oh...man boobs.

604
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:15,401
Those aren't sexy.

605
00:27:15,434 --> 00:27:16,836
JAMIE: No, they're not sexy.

606
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,038
JILL: But lady boobies are!

607
00:27:18,071 --> 00:27:19,339
JAMIE: Ok.

608
00:27:19,372 --> 00:27:20,373
Right.

609
00:27:20,407 --> 00:27:21,374
Yeah.

610
00:27:21,408 --> 00:27:22,375
You know what?

611
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:23,044
God gave you some
lady boobies so you could

612
00:27:23,077 --> 00:27:23,711
enjoy them all by yourself.

613
00:27:23,744 --> 00:27:25,112
So you don't need me there!

614
00:27:25,146 --> 00:27:26,047
JILL: Oh yeah?

615
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,847
JAMIE: Yeah, just...no no no.

616
00:27:26,881 --> 00:27:28,049
JILL: OH YEAH!!!

617
00:27:28,082 --> 00:27:29,951
JAMIE: Ok, why
don't you lay down?

618
00:27:29,985 --> 00:27:31,286
JILL: Oh yeah?

619
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:32,454
With you on top of me?

620
00:27:32,487 --> 00:27:33,789
JAMIE: With a blanket on top.

621
00:27:33,822 --> 00:27:36,359
JILL: What's the
blanket going to do?

622
00:27:36,392 --> 00:27:37,860
JAMIE: It's going
to keep you warm.

623
00:27:37,894 --> 00:27:39,062
JILL: Like hot?

624
00:27:39,095 --> 00:27:40,129
JAMIE: Sure.

625
00:27:40,163 --> 00:27:42,232
JILL: Very hot?

626
00:27:42,266 --> 00:27:43,233
JAMIE: Yeah.

627
00:27:43,267 --> 00:27:46,303
JILL: Yeah!

628
00:28:05,593 --> 00:28:07,462
JILL: Why is my shirt off?

629
00:28:07,495 --> 00:28:09,230
JAMIE: You took it off.

630
00:28:09,263 --> 00:28:10,499
JILL: Did you touch
my boobs last night?

631
00:28:10,532 --> 00:28:11,567
JAMIE: No!

632
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,536
JILL: Oh.

633
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:16,238
Did you want to?

634
00:28:16,271 --> 00:28:19,876
JAMIE: Your shirt's on
the living room chair.

635
00:28:19,909 --> 00:28:21,478
JILL: Thanks, I saw it.

636
00:28:25,583 --> 00:28:28,820
Did you want to touch
my boobs last night?

637
00:28:28,854 --> 00:28:31,423
JAMIE: You can go put it on.

638
00:28:31,456 --> 00:28:34,894
JILL: Jamie, just because
you're a lesbian doesn't mean

639
00:28:34,927 --> 00:28:37,263
everything has to be sexual.

640
00:28:37,296 --> 00:28:39,899
A bra's basically
like a bikini top.

641
00:28:39,932 --> 00:28:42,936
JAMIE: Yeah, and a
pussy's a patch of hair.

642
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:45,873
JILL: Not mine; I shave.

643
00:28:45,906 --> 00:28:49,544
JAMIE: Ok...do you
want some coffee, Jill?

644
00:28:49,577 --> 00:28:51,412
JILL: Yes please.

645
00:28:51,446 --> 00:28:52,882
JAMIE: Hand me the mug by you.

646
00:28:52,915 --> 00:28:56,385
I'll pour some in there.

647
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,592
JILL: So this guy, a couple
of days ago, he came up and

648
00:29:02,626 --> 00:29:05,930
he was like - "Does the
carpet match the drapes?"

649
00:29:05,963 --> 00:29:09,834
And I was like -
"Hard wood floors, baby!"

650
00:29:17,143 --> 00:29:19,078
I don't wear underwear either.

651
00:29:19,112 --> 00:29:20,980
JAMIE: Don't your
pants get gross?

652
00:29:21,014 --> 00:29:23,217
JILL: Why would
they get gross?

653
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,352
JAMIE: Cream?

654
00:29:29,391 --> 00:29:30,158
I meant in your coffee.

655
00:29:30,192 --> 00:29:31,526
Do you want cream
in your coffee.

656
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,295
JILL: Jamie, you
need to lighten up.

657
00:29:33,328 --> 00:29:34,564
God you're a prude.

658
00:29:34,597 --> 00:29:35,998
JAMIE: Cream, sugar?

659
00:29:36,032 --> 00:29:37,066
JILL: Yes please.

660
00:29:37,099 --> 00:29:40,136
Both.

661
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:43,440
JAMIE: I'm surprised
you're not hungover.

662
00:29:47,178 --> 00:29:49,647
JILL: Did we kiss last night?

663
00:29:49,681 --> 00:29:51,282
JAMIE: Yes.

664
00:29:51,316 --> 00:29:52,985
JILL: Did I like it?

665
00:29:53,018 --> 00:29:55,020
JAMIE: Well, since you are
a sex-starved lesbian...

666
00:29:55,054 --> 00:29:57,356
JILL: I am not sex-starved.

667
00:29:57,389 --> 00:29:58,692
I've gone five
years without sex.

668
00:29:58,725 --> 00:29:59,960
Big deal.

669
00:29:59,993 --> 00:30:03,129
I've gone longer
without carbs.

670
00:30:06,534 --> 00:30:08,603
Let's kiss.

671
00:30:08,636 --> 00:30:09,971
Let's kiss!

672
00:30:10,004 --> 00:30:11,139
Get on my lap.

673
00:30:11,173 --> 00:30:12,174
JAMIE: I'm not
sitting on your lap!

674
00:30:12,207 --> 00:30:13,175
JILL: Get on my lap.

675
00:30:13,208 --> 00:30:14,109
I want to know what it's like.

676
00:30:14,142 --> 00:30:17,647
JAMIE: You haven't
even brushed your teeth.

677
00:30:22,218 --> 00:30:23,721
JAMIE: How did I let
you talk me into this.

678
00:30:23,754 --> 00:30:25,322
JILL: You don't even know
what we're going to do.

679
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:26,690
JAMIE: It doesn't matter.

680
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:28,493
JILL: Ok.

681
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:30,262
This is good.

682
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:34,199
Promise me that you'll
kiss me whenever I say go.

683
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:35,568
JAMIE: No.

684
00:30:35,601 --> 00:30:36,502
JILL: Jamie,
this is part of it.

685
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:38,037
You've kissed me
before so it shouldn't be

686
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,538
a problem doing it again.

687
00:30:39,572 --> 00:30:42,009
JAMIE: Yeah, like the
time you spit afterward?

688
00:30:42,042 --> 00:30:44,111
JILL: I was trying something.

689
00:30:44,144 --> 00:30:45,312
JAMIE: Are you going
to spit afterward?

690
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:46,347
Because if you're
going to spit afterward,

691
00:30:46,381 --> 00:30:47,315
I don't want to do it.

692
00:30:47,348 --> 00:30:48,216
That's just insulting.

693
00:30:48,249 --> 00:30:50,051
JILL: I'm not going
to spit afterward.

694
00:30:50,084 --> 00:30:51,219
JAMIE: So you're
going to swallow?

695
00:30:51,252 --> 00:30:52,388
JILL: Don't be gross.

696
00:30:52,421 --> 00:30:54,156
JAMIE: Do you think you'll
ever give a guy a blow job?

697
00:30:54,189 --> 00:30:55,190
JILL: Don't be gross!

698
00:30:55,224 --> 00:30:56,191
JAMIE: I won't.

699
00:30:56,225 --> 00:30:58,728
Thank God.

700
00:30:58,762 --> 00:30:59,763
Oh, God.

701
00:30:59,796 --> 00:31:01,231
That shit stinks.

702
00:31:01,264 --> 00:31:02,132
JILL: Yeah, it does.

703
00:31:02,165 --> 00:31:03,366
Ok - go!

704
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,502
JAMIE: What are you doing?

705
00:31:04,535 --> 00:31:05,636
JILL: Aversion therapy.

706
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,338
JAMIE: Oh my God.

707
00:31:07,371 --> 00:31:08,539
JILL: What, you
have a better idea?

708
00:31:08,572 --> 00:31:10,642
JAMIE: I do.

709
00:31:10,676 --> 00:31:11,643
Yeah, come here.

710
00:31:11,677 --> 00:31:12,544
JILL: Ok.

711
00:31:12,577 --> 00:31:13,679
OW!

712
00:31:13,712 --> 00:31:15,213
JAMIE: Oh, I
think it's working.

713
00:31:15,247 --> 00:31:16,114
JILL: That wasn't nice.

714
00:31:16,148 --> 00:31:16,983
JAMIE: Come here,
let's try it again.

715
00:31:17,016 --> 00:31:18,318
I think this is
really going to help.

716
00:31:18,351 --> 00:31:20,053
JILL: Ok, yeah.

717
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:20,720
JAMIE: Ow!

718
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:21,587
JILL: Yeah.

719
00:31:21,621 --> 00:31:22,556
JAMIE: Yeah!

720
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:23,424
JILL: Yeah.

721
00:31:23,457 --> 00:31:24,391
JAMIE: Yeah!

722
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:25,092
JILL: OW!!

723
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:26,160
JAMIE: Come on, straight girl.

724
00:31:26,193 --> 00:31:26,927
Aversion therapy.

725
00:31:26,961 --> 00:31:28,028
This is very
effective I think.

726
00:31:28,062 --> 00:31:29,130
JILL: Take that!

727
00:31:29,164 --> 00:31:30,365
What is that?

728
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:36,505
What is that?

729
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:37,640
JAMIE: I'm doing my defense.

730
00:31:37,673 --> 00:31:38,741
JILL: You're doing
your chicken dance.

731
00:31:38,774 --> 00:31:39,742
You're not even fighting.

732
00:31:39,775 --> 00:31:41,678
JAMIE: It's my defense.

733
00:31:45,382 --> 00:31:47,552
JILL: It's my defense!

734
00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:54,693
JAMIE: You got to admit,
last night was way more fun.

735
00:31:54,727 --> 00:31:56,795
If that dumpster and
Girl Club had a fight,

736
00:31:56,829 --> 00:31:59,099
that dumpster would
so kick Girl Club's ass!

737
00:31:59,132 --> 00:32:02,135
No, no, no - Girl Club would
so kick the dumpster's ass!

738
00:32:02,168 --> 00:32:03,236
JILL: Jamie, I've
been thinking -

739
00:32:03,269 --> 00:32:05,072
JAMIE: Hey, would do you
get when you offer a blonde

740
00:32:05,106 --> 00:32:06,407
a penny for her thoughts?

741
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,110
JILL: I know that we're
not in a real relationship -

742
00:32:09,143 --> 00:32:11,179
JAMIE: Change!

743
00:32:11,213 --> 00:32:12,280
JILL: But I think
the both of us should

744
00:32:12,314 --> 00:32:13,749
start taking it more seriously.

745
00:32:13,782 --> 00:32:14,716
JAMIE: I'm
taking it seriously.

746
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:15,684
JILL: Good.

747
00:32:15,717 --> 00:32:17,286
Then you'll have no
problem being exclusive.

748
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,222
No Ruby, no hot girls.

749
00:32:19,255 --> 00:32:20,156
JAMIE: Why can't I
have any hot girls?

750
00:32:20,189 --> 00:32:22,226
JILL: Because that
makes me feel jealous,

751
00:32:22,259 --> 00:32:23,794
and that makes me
feel like a lesbian.

752
00:32:23,827 --> 00:32:26,263
So no hot girls.

753
00:32:26,296 --> 00:32:28,266
And no un-hot girls either.

754
00:32:28,299 --> 00:32:29,334
And no boys.

755
00:32:29,367 --> 00:32:30,535
JAMIE: Gross.

756
00:32:30,568 --> 00:32:31,636
JILL: And no Lola.

757
00:32:31,669 --> 00:32:33,304
JAMIE: Lola's not even human.

758
00:32:33,338 --> 00:32:35,307
JILL: Well I thought
maybe you guys had a thing.

759
00:32:35,341 --> 00:32:36,342
JAMIE: Yeah we used to.

760
00:32:36,375 --> 00:32:38,644
But it's over.

761
00:32:38,677 --> 00:32:40,480
JILL: Do you still talk?

762
00:32:40,514 --> 00:32:41,882
JAMIE: Yeah but
even when we do talk,

763
00:32:41,915 --> 00:32:44,718
I just try to insult her
and make her feel bad.

764
00:32:44,751 --> 00:32:46,287
JILL: What happened?

765
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,322
JAMIE: Nothing really.

766
00:32:48,356 --> 00:32:50,391
It just didn't end well.

767
00:32:50,425 --> 00:32:52,461
She doesn't think I'm
good enough for her.

768
00:32:52,494 --> 00:32:54,329
She doesn't think
I'm smart enough.

769
00:32:54,363 --> 00:32:55,397
JILL: She said that?

770
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:58,301
JAMIE: Yeah, kind of.

771
00:32:58,334 --> 00:33:00,370
She used to talk during sex.

772
00:33:00,403 --> 00:33:01,337
JILL: Like dirty talk?

773
00:33:01,371 --> 00:33:08,546
JAMIE: No, talk like
quote facts and stuff.

774
00:33:08,579 --> 00:33:09,880
JILL: So that's why
you guys broke up.

775
00:33:09,914 --> 00:33:12,784
The sex was bad.

776
00:33:12,818 --> 00:33:14,786
JAMIE: It wasn't bad.

777
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,290
I mean, how bad could it be.

778
00:33:17,323 --> 00:33:19,258
JILL: I've had
some really bad sex.

779
00:33:19,292 --> 00:33:20,726
JAMIE: Yeah?

780
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,362
With men?

781
00:33:22,396 --> 00:33:23,330
JILL: No.

782
00:33:23,363 --> 00:33:24,331
Not yet.

783
00:33:24,364 --> 00:33:25,399
JAMIE: Yeah me neither.

784
00:33:25,432 --> 00:33:27,501
Not yet, not ever,
never, for as long as I live,

785
00:33:27,534 --> 00:33:28,770
so God help me!

786
00:33:28,803 --> 00:33:30,238
JILL: That's
pretty closed minded.

787
00:33:30,271 --> 00:33:31,272
JAMIE: Closed minded?

788
00:33:31,306 --> 00:33:32,540
Don't fucking get me
started on closed minded.

789
00:33:32,574 --> 00:33:34,777
JILL: If you're
referring to me,

790
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:36,445
I am not closed minded.

791
00:33:36,479 --> 00:33:38,881
I am just strong willed.

792
00:33:38,914 --> 00:33:40,584
JAMIE: Strong
willed in a lesbian way.

793
00:33:40,617 --> 00:33:46,390
JILL: No, strong willed in
a...Hillary Clinton way.

794
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:50,328
JAMIE: You do
realize that you just said

795
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:54,566
the exact same thing I did.

796
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:57,269
Ok, good.

797
00:33:57,302 --> 00:33:58,805
As long as you realize.

798
00:34:01,774 --> 00:34:02,642
It's the same as yours.

799
00:34:02,675 --> 00:34:04,445
JILL: I know.

800
00:34:10,819 --> 00:34:13,288
DAVID: Ooh - quinoa's on sale.

801
00:34:13,321 --> 00:34:14,723
JOSÉ: I like your shirt.

802
00:34:14,756 --> 00:34:15,857
DAVID: Thank you.

803
00:34:15,891 --> 00:34:17,693
JOSÉ: It fits you well.

804
00:34:17,727 --> 00:34:19,362
DAVID: Thank you!

805
00:34:19,395 --> 00:34:20,296
JAMIE: Thank you!

806
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:21,297
DAVID: Shut up.

807
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:22,666
What am I supposed to say?

808
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:24,434
JAMIE: I don't
know - want to fuck?

809
00:34:24,468 --> 00:34:25,769
DAVID: You're such a dude.

810
00:34:25,802 --> 00:34:29,674
JAMIE: You're such a girl.

811
00:34:29,707 --> 00:34:31,809
DAVID: Is that pot?

812
00:34:31,843 --> 00:34:32,844
JAMIE: No, dumb ass.

813
00:34:32,877 --> 00:34:34,513
It's catnip.

814
00:34:34,547 --> 00:34:36,015
Oh.

815
00:34:36,048 --> 00:34:36,882
LOLA: Hello David.

816
00:34:36,916 --> 00:34:38,350
Hello Jamie.

817
00:34:38,384 --> 00:34:40,654
I did some research.

818
00:34:40,687 --> 00:34:44,524
Yesterday at 8:24am, José
made himself a cup of coffee.

819
00:34:44,558 --> 00:34:45,759
Black.

820
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,695
Only straight men
drink black coffee.

821
00:34:47,728 --> 00:34:49,497
JAMIE: Oh come on.

822
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:52,801
LOLA: 9:30 am - José makes
himself a regular bagel,

823
00:34:52,834 --> 00:34:54,002
not the low carb kind.

824
00:34:54,036 --> 00:34:56,438
And he uses regular
cream cheese, not light.

825
00:34:56,471 --> 00:34:57,239
JAMIE: So?

826
00:34:57,272 --> 00:34:59,976
LOLA: 10:15 am -
José says to Time,

827
00:35:00,009 --> 00:35:02,845
and I quote "I could jump
start your car blindfolded

828
00:35:02,879 --> 00:35:05,983
with my hands tied
behind my back."

829
00:35:06,016 --> 00:35:07,985
11:30 am -

830
00:35:08,018 --> 00:35:10,322
JAMIE: Wait a minute, Lola.

831
00:35:10,355 --> 00:35:12,290
Since when do you
believe in stereotypes?

832
00:35:12,324 --> 00:35:13,692
LOLA: Jamie, I think if you're
honest with yourself about

833
00:35:13,725 --> 00:35:15,393
this, you'll see that
you're just jealous that I've

834
00:35:15,427 --> 00:35:16,829
moved on and you haven't.

835
00:35:16,862 --> 00:35:18,364
JAMIE: Oh really?

836
00:35:18,397 --> 00:35:19,332
OK.

837
00:35:19,365 --> 00:35:20,266
Well then why don't
you tell that to Jill?

838
00:35:20,299 --> 00:35:22,569
Because she spent
the night on Saturday.

839
00:35:22,603 --> 00:35:23,737
LOLA: No she didn't.

840
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:24,404
JAMIE: Yes she did!

841
00:35:24,438 --> 00:35:25,839
And she's good in bed, too -

842
00:35:25,872 --> 00:35:27,574
just like you
always were afraid of!

843
00:35:27,608 --> 00:35:30,378
LOLA: I wasn't afraid!

844
00:35:30,411 --> 00:35:31,312
Why would she say that?

845
00:35:31,346 --> 00:35:32,413
I mean, how immature
does one need to be.

846
00:35:32,447 --> 00:35:34,383
Really.

847
00:35:34,416 --> 00:35:36,585
DAVID: José likes my
body in this shirt.

848
00:35:36,619 --> 00:35:39,555
LOLA: Did Jamie ever tell
you if I was good in bed?

849
00:35:39,588 --> 00:35:41,391
DAVID: No.

850
00:35:43,026 --> 00:35:48,799
I mean...yes?

851
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:50,067
LOLA: She's just jealous.

852
00:35:50,101 --> 00:35:51,035
I mean, José gay?

853
00:35:51,068 --> 00:35:52,070
Come on.

854
00:35:52,104 --> 00:35:54,906
If that man's gay, then I'm...

855
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,575
I don't know -
what would I be?

856
00:35:56,608 --> 00:35:57,576
DAVID: A hussy?

857
00:35:57,609 --> 00:35:58,378
LOLA: Ok, sure.

858
00:35:58,411 --> 00:36:03,650
If he's gay,
then I'm...a hussy.

859
00:36:03,683 --> 00:36:05,886
You don't think
he's gay, do you?

860
00:36:05,919 --> 00:36:07,588
DAVID: I think
he's in love with me.

861
00:36:07,621 --> 00:36:10,492
LOLA: Yeah.

862
00:36:10,525 --> 00:36:12,394
Sure.

863
00:36:19,535 --> 00:36:21,570
JAMIE: How much
time do we have left?

864
00:36:26,677 --> 00:36:29,447
JILL: Well, you
just ruined it.

865
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,415
JAMIE: Good job, Jill.

866
00:36:30,448 --> 00:36:32,717
We did good.

867
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:35,888
We didn't kiss - you're on
your way to being straight!

868
00:36:35,921 --> 00:36:37,656
JILL: I know.

869
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:38,590
JAMIE: I think you
can win at this.

870
00:36:38,624 --> 00:36:40,927
JILL: Well I am
straight - not on my way.

871
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,128
JAMIE: Right, of course.

872
00:36:42,162 --> 00:36:43,163
What are you
doing in bed with me?

873
00:36:43,196 --> 00:36:46,133
JILL: It's like a sleepover.

874
00:36:46,167 --> 00:36:48,903
JAMIE: We should like braid
each other's hair and stuff.

875
00:36:48,936 --> 00:36:53,975
JILL: Well I have a
feeling you don't know how.

876
00:36:54,009 --> 00:36:55,711
JAMIE: I can braid hair.

877
00:36:55,744 --> 00:36:56,545
JILL: Really?

878
00:36:56,578 --> 00:36:57,746
JAMIE: Yeah.

879
00:36:57,779 --> 00:36:59,082
JILL: Ok, well we'll do that -

880
00:36:59,115 --> 00:37:00,083
JAMIE: I don't
think I want too, though.

881
00:37:00,116 --> 00:37:03,653
I'd rather go to
the strip club.

882
00:37:03,987 --> 00:37:05,689
Wouldn't you want to?

883
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,091
Wouldn't you rather do that?

884
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:10,628
We'll have fun.

885
00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:15,734
We'll get you drunk
and get you a lap dance.

886
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:58,785
JAMIE: Yeah
show us your vagina!

887
00:38:02,588 --> 00:38:04,992
DAVID: Yesterday, 10:51am -
José smiles at me and not

888
00:38:05,025 --> 00:38:07,761
Sarah, who was closer
to him in proximity.

889
00:38:07,795 --> 00:38:09,596
LOLA: That's just
because Sarah's a bitch.

890
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:12,534
DAVID: 11:28am - José sits
down and crosses his legs,

891
00:38:12,567 --> 00:38:14,235
but keeps them together.

892
00:38:14,269 --> 00:38:16,005
LOLA: That's just a
cultural difference.

893
00:38:16,038 --> 00:38:19,208
DAVID: Ok, 12:45pm José
makes himself a salad.

894
00:38:19,241 --> 00:38:21,076
He uses light salad dressing.

895
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,012
A diet salad?

896
00:38:22,045 --> 00:38:23,246
Really?

897
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,281
LOLA: That's because
he gained so much

898
00:38:24,314 --> 00:38:25,649
weight from all the bagels.

899
00:38:25,682 --> 00:38:26,917
JAMIE: Why don't
one of you wimps just

900
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:29,120
ask that guy out on a date?

901
00:38:29,153 --> 00:38:30,555
LOLA: This is more fun.

902
00:38:30,588 --> 00:38:32,757
Besides - I'm winning.

903
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:34,593
DAVID: That's because you
totally discounted everything

904
00:38:34,626 --> 00:38:36,028
that happened yesterday.

905
00:38:36,061 --> 00:38:37,596
LOLA: Yesterday
was an anomaly.

906
00:38:37,629 --> 00:38:38,730
José is getting a cold.

907
00:38:38,764 --> 00:38:39,665
DAVID: So?

908
00:38:39,698 --> 00:38:41,701
He still bought that
scarf at some point,

909
00:38:41,734 --> 00:38:43,303
and has it in his wardrobe.

910
00:38:43,336 --> 00:38:46,040
LOLA: Well today
he's wearing socks

911
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:47,708
that don't match his outfit.

912
00:38:47,741 --> 00:38:48,742
DAVID: They're black.

913
00:38:48,776 --> 00:38:49,710
LOLA: Exactly.

914
00:38:49,743 --> 00:38:51,245
And his pants are off-black.

915
00:38:51,278 --> 00:38:53,782
JAMIE: You guys are dumb.

916
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:58,988
LOLA: Not as dumb as
you in that outfit.

917
00:39:00,089 --> 00:39:02,058
Sparkle buns.

918
00:39:04,995 --> 00:39:07,831
Hello, 1984 called and
they want their outfit back...

919
00:39:11,102 --> 00:39:13,238
JAMIE: Well you seem to
know from experience.

920
00:39:13,271 --> 00:39:14,739
JILL: I'm not bisexual.

921
00:39:14,772 --> 00:39:15,673
JAMIE: Why not?

922
00:39:15,707 --> 00:39:17,877
JILL: Because I'm
not attracted to men.

923
00:39:20,746 --> 00:39:25,785
Except - I was
attracted to male Jamie.

924
00:39:28,322 --> 00:39:29,156
JAMIE: Yeah, I know.

925
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:29,857
Male Jamie was
the love of your life

926
00:39:29,891 --> 00:39:33,160
and I'm a huge disappointment.

927
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,298
JILL: Don't say that.

928
00:39:37,165 --> 00:39:39,101
JAMIE: Can we go to sleep now?

929
00:39:40,236 --> 00:39:43,373
JILL: Jamie, don't say that.

930
00:39:43,406 --> 00:39:47,044
You're not a disappointment.

931
00:39:47,077 --> 00:39:49,113
JAMIE: Can we just
go to sleep now?

932
00:39:49,146 --> 00:39:50,247
JILL: What's wrong?

933
00:39:50,281 --> 00:39:51,282
JAMIE: Nothing.

934
00:39:51,315 --> 00:39:53,151
I'm just tired.

935
00:39:54,753 --> 00:39:57,222
JILL: You look sad.

936
00:39:57,255 --> 00:40:00,293
JAMIE: I'm just tired.

937
00:40:00,326 --> 00:40:03,997
JILL: Look at me.

938
00:40:13,174 --> 00:40:16,011
JAMIE: I don't think
that we should do this.

939
00:40:16,045 --> 00:40:18,714
JILL: You don't want to?

940
00:40:18,747 --> 00:40:20,349
JAMIE: I don't want to
if you don't want to.

941
00:40:22,118 --> 00:40:24,321
JILL: I want to.

942
00:41:45,014 --> 00:41:46,350
JAMIE: Hey.

943
00:41:46,383 --> 00:41:47,351
JILL: Hi!

944
00:41:47,384 --> 00:41:48,352
Want some eggs?

945
00:41:48,385 --> 00:41:51,055
JAMIE: Yeah, that sounds good.

946
00:41:53,291 --> 00:41:55,260
Um...what are you doing today?

947
00:41:55,293 --> 00:41:58,497
JILL: Just running
errands, looking for work.

948
00:41:58,531 --> 00:41:59,532
JAMIE: Cool.

949
00:41:59,565 --> 00:42:02,234
Sounds fun.

950
00:42:02,268 --> 00:42:05,839
Pretty good day lined up.

951
00:42:05,872 --> 00:42:10,445
JILL: I'd kiss you, but I
haven't brushed my teeth yet!

952
00:42:10,478 --> 00:42:14,048
JAMIE: Yeah, it's not a
problem...I mean uh...

953
00:42:14,082 --> 00:42:18,087
you know uh...me too!

954
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:22,826
Me too...

955
00:42:24,327 --> 00:42:27,564
JILL: Why are you being weird?

956
00:42:27,597 --> 00:42:31,869
JAMIE: I just um...I
just...want to make sure

957
00:42:31,902 --> 00:42:36,208
you're OK with everything.

958
00:42:36,241 --> 00:42:37,409
JILL: Yeah.

959
00:42:37,442 --> 00:42:38,410
I'm OK.

960
00:42:38,443 --> 00:42:39,344
JAMIE: Good.

961
00:42:39,377 --> 00:42:41,147
Because it doesn't
need to mean anything.

962
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:44,350
I'm not saying that it
doesn't mean anything to me.

963
00:42:44,383 --> 00:42:48,255
I'm just saying that
it doesn't need to.

964
00:42:48,288 --> 00:42:49,156
It could.

965
00:42:49,189 --> 00:42:50,224
But it could not, too.

966
00:42:50,257 --> 00:42:52,360
I mean, it is what it is.

967
00:42:52,393 --> 00:42:59,201
Or it's not...that.

968
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:02,104
JILL: You're pretty
cute when you stammer.

969
00:43:02,138 --> 00:43:05,108
Pretty cute!

970
00:43:12,416 --> 00:43:17,356
JAMIE AND DAVID:
AAAAAAAAHHH!!!!!!

971
00:43:22,095 --> 00:43:23,163
DAVID: Why are
you still here?!

972
00:43:23,196 --> 00:43:23,797
JAMIE: Who does that?!

973
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:24,731
DAVID: We need five days!

974
00:43:24,764 --> 00:43:25,798
Five days before we
can see each other!

975
00:43:25,832 --> 00:43:28,102
JAMIE: Who masturbates
in an unlocked bathroom?!

976
00:43:28,135 --> 00:43:29,303
DAVID: No one ever
uses that bathroom!

977
00:43:29,336 --> 00:43:30,104
JAMIE: I use that bathroom!

978
00:43:30,137 --> 00:43:30,738
You know that I
use that bathroom!

979
00:43:30,771 --> 00:43:31,906
DAVID: The lock's broken.

980
00:43:31,939 --> 00:43:32,973
JAMIE: I know it's broken,
that's why I like using it!

981
00:43:33,007 --> 00:43:35,043
It keeps everyone else
away from using it, David!

982
00:43:35,076 --> 00:43:37,979
You picked an unlocked
bathroom to masturbate in.

983
00:43:38,013 --> 00:43:39,281
Who the fuck does that?

984
00:43:39,314 --> 00:43:41,951
You couldn't wait
until you got home?

985
00:43:41,984 --> 00:43:43,152
DAVID: José's
wearing a tank top today.

986
00:43:43,186 --> 00:43:44,020
JAMIE: Ew!

987
00:43:44,053 --> 00:43:44,854
DAVID: You asked!

988
00:43:44,887 --> 00:43:45,989
JAMIE: It was a
rhetorical question!

989
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:46,657
DAVID: Fine.

990
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:48,258
Let's just forget it.

991
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,093
Let's just stop
talking about it.

992
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:52,997
JAMIE: Fine.

993
00:43:53,031 --> 00:43:54,465
DAVID: Agreed.

994
00:44:02,274 --> 00:44:03,242
DAVID: Hey Guys.

995
00:44:03,275 --> 00:44:04,177
What's up?

996
00:44:04,211 --> 00:44:05,145
JOSÉ: Hey.

997
00:44:05,178 --> 00:44:06,580
Lola was just practicing
her Spanish with me.

998
00:44:06,613 --> 00:44:10,284
LOLA: Hablas Español?

999
00:44:10,318 --> 00:44:12,453
DAVID: So I was taking this
new Spanish cooking class.

1000
00:44:12,486 --> 00:44:16,925
You should come over
sometime and uh - sample.

1001
00:44:16,959 --> 00:44:19,261
JOSÉ: That sounds
delicious, thank you.

1002
00:44:19,294 --> 00:44:22,498
Maybe Lola can come
and add some flavor.

1003
00:44:22,532 --> 00:44:29,540
(talking in Spanish)

1004
00:44:29,573 --> 00:44:32,109
LOLA: That sounds like
fun - thanks for the invite!

1005
00:44:32,142 --> 00:44:34,079
DAVID: You know
Jamie's going to be there,

1006
00:44:34,112 --> 00:44:36,414
so you probably don't
want to deal with that.

1007
00:44:36,448 --> 00:44:38,416
LOLA: I think I
can handle her.

1008
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:40,353
Thanks though.

1009
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:43,923
DAVID: Mother fucker.

1010
00:44:52,333 --> 00:44:54,469
JAMIE: Is everything OK?

1011
00:44:54,502 --> 00:44:58,040
JILL: Yeah, I'm fine.

1012
00:44:58,073 --> 00:45:00,276
JAMIE: Is it OK
we're going to David's?

1013
00:45:00,309 --> 00:45:04,047
JILL: Of course.

1014
00:45:06,082 --> 00:45:15,359
(José and Lola
talk in Spanish).

1015
00:45:15,393 --> 00:45:16,461
DAVID: So here's an
idea - why don't we speak in

1016
00:45:16,495 --> 00:45:21,133
English so we can all join in?

1017
00:45:21,166 --> 00:45:23,169
Or I could talk in Chinese.

1018
00:45:23,202 --> 00:45:31,345
(David talks in Chinese).

1019
00:45:52,337 --> 00:45:56,040
DAVID: Lola, can I see
you in the other room?

1020
00:45:56,074 --> 00:45:59,378
LOLA: Why?

1021
00:46:03,483 --> 00:46:06,453
LOLA: What is going on?

1022
00:46:06,486 --> 00:46:08,121
DAVID: I'd like to
ask you the same thing.

1023
00:46:08,154 --> 00:46:09,824
LOLA: Ok...

1024
00:46:09,857 --> 00:46:11,225
DAVID: You're
purposely talking to him in

1025
00:46:11,258 --> 00:46:13,127
Spanish to leave me out!

1026
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,562
LOLA: David, you're
being hypersensitive.

1027
00:46:17,299 --> 00:46:21,036
DAVID: Jamie, can you
come here for a second?

1028
00:46:24,173 --> 00:46:25,375
DAVID: Please tell Lola
that talking to José in

1029
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:28,545
Spanish in front of us is rude.

1030
00:46:28,579 --> 00:46:29,747
LOLA: David,
this is very mature.

1031
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:31,815
Bringing Jamie in
here to gang up on me.

1032
00:46:31,849 --> 00:46:34,119
JAMIE: You guys, this
is stupid and I'm bored.

1033
00:46:34,152 --> 00:46:35,587
Can I go?

1034
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:41,460
DAVID: No.

1035
00:46:45,799 --> 00:46:47,100
JOSÉ: Jill.

1036
00:46:47,134 --> 00:46:50,170
Just the woman I
was hoping to see.

1037
00:46:51,506 --> 00:46:52,573
Smoke?

1038
00:46:52,607 --> 00:46:53,574
JILL: No thanks.

1039
00:46:53,608 --> 00:46:55,276
I quit.

1040
00:46:55,309 --> 00:46:57,345
JOSÉ: That's good.

1041
00:46:57,378 --> 00:47:00,249
Quitting is sometimes
the best thing to do.

1042
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:05,255
JILL: Yeah...

1043
00:47:08,324 --> 00:47:09,794
JOSÉ: So tell me
something about yourself, Jill.

1044
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:12,430
What makes you tick?

1045
00:47:12,463 --> 00:47:13,764
JILL: Oh, I don't know.

1046
00:47:13,798 --> 00:47:16,668
Not much, really.

1047
00:47:16,701 --> 00:47:17,636
JOSÉ: Oh come on.

1048
00:47:17,669 --> 00:47:20,705
You're holding out on me.

1049
00:47:20,739 --> 00:47:23,676
JILL: No, I'm
probably just really boring.

1050
00:47:23,709 --> 00:47:25,678
JOSÉ: Boring!

1051
00:47:25,711 --> 00:47:30,384
I don't believe
that for a second.

1052
00:47:33,588 --> 00:47:39,294
You know, you have
really pretty eyes.

1053
00:47:41,497 --> 00:47:43,566
JILL: Woah!

1054
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:45,635
JOSÉ: Oh I'm sorry.

1055
00:47:45,669 --> 00:47:48,205
I have mints here.

1056
00:47:48,238 --> 00:47:52,276
It'll clear that right up.

1057
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:53,444
I'm sorry.

1058
00:47:53,478 --> 00:47:55,646
JAMIE: Well I really don't
think that José's attracted

1059
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,883
to either one of you guys.

1060
00:47:57,916 --> 00:47:59,451
LOLA: Do you
think he's asexual?

1061
00:47:59,485 --> 00:48:00,252
JAMIE: No.

1062
00:48:00,285 --> 00:48:01,620
He just thinks
you're repulsive.

1063
00:48:01,653 --> 00:48:05,458
LOLA: Jamie!

1064
00:48:05,492 --> 00:48:06,759
JAMIE: So can I go now?

1065
00:48:06,793 --> 00:48:08,328
I think this is settled.

1066
00:48:08,361 --> 00:48:09,195
DAVID: No.

1067
00:48:09,229 --> 00:48:10,231
It's not settled.

1068
00:48:10,264 --> 00:48:11,699
We're not leaving
until you're friends again.

1069
00:48:11,732 --> 00:48:13,934
JILL: I thought you were gay.

1070
00:48:13,968 --> 00:48:20,242
JOSÉ: Excuse me?

1071
00:48:20,275 --> 00:48:21,276
Oh, that's funny.

1072
00:48:21,309 --> 00:48:23,946
Me gay?

1073
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:25,481
Oh that's funny.

1074
00:48:25,515 --> 00:48:26,415
JILL: Yeah...

1075
00:48:26,449 --> 00:48:27,885
JOSÉ: Oh, you're funny.

1076
00:48:27,918 --> 00:48:29,686
You're really funny Jill.

1077
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,655
You want a mint?

1078
00:48:31,688 --> 00:48:33,223
JILL: No thank you.

1079
00:48:39,398 --> 00:48:40,766
JOSÉ: Well why don't
you get closer so you

1080
00:48:40,799 --> 00:48:43,936
can smell my fresh breath.

1081
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:47,674
JILL: That sounds
like a trick question.

1082
00:48:47,707 --> 00:48:52,346
JOSÉ: Maybe the trick is
that it's not a question.

1083
00:48:54,382 --> 00:48:57,419
JILL: Then what if I say "no"?

1084
00:48:57,452 --> 00:49:01,657
It must be a
question if I can say "no."

1085
00:49:02,457 --> 00:49:04,227
JOSÉ: What are
you so afraid of?

1086
00:49:05,028 --> 00:49:06,296
JILL: I'm not afraid.

1087
00:49:06,329 --> 00:49:08,898
Maybe I just don't
want to kiss you.

1088
00:49:08,932 --> 00:49:11,835
JOSÉ: Maybe doesn't
sound like a "no" to me.

1089
00:49:11,869 --> 00:49:13,537
DAVID: Because you
used to be in love,

1090
00:49:13,571 --> 00:49:14,772
and now all you do is fight.

1091
00:49:14,805 --> 00:49:16,041
JAMIE: That's how life works.

1092
00:49:16,074 --> 00:49:17,309
LOLA: It doesn't need to.

1093
00:49:17,342 --> 00:49:18,743
JAMIE: Yeah, and that's what I
told you - that lesbians stay

1094
00:49:18,777 --> 00:49:19,678
friends after they break up.

1095
00:49:19,711 --> 00:49:20,712
But you didn't want
to go along with it!

1096
00:49:20,745 --> 00:49:22,415
LOLA: Maybe because
you inherently excluded me

1097
00:49:22,448 --> 00:49:23,816
when you said "lesbians."

1098
00:49:23,849 --> 00:49:24,684
JAMIE: Oh, that's right.

1099
00:49:24,717 --> 00:49:26,485
We have to give
Lola special treatment

1100
00:49:26,519 --> 00:49:27,955
because she's "bisexual."

1101
00:49:27,988 --> 00:49:29,790
LOLA: You don't have to
put it in air quotes.

1102
00:49:29,823 --> 00:49:31,858
JAMIE: We have to have a whole
special language for her,

1103
00:49:31,892 --> 00:49:32,926
make special considerations.

1104
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,295
You're just like those
people on the airplane who

1105
00:49:34,329 --> 00:49:35,630
get their own special meal!

1106
00:49:35,663 --> 00:49:37,832
LOLA: You can order
a special meal too.

1107
00:49:37,865 --> 00:49:40,402
JAMIE: ...I don't want to.

1108
00:49:40,436 --> 00:49:41,537
LOLA: Then who cares?

1109
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:42,371
JAMIE: Yeah!

1110
00:49:42,404 --> 00:49:42,905
Right, exactly!

1111
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:43,706
Who cares?

1112
00:49:43,739 --> 00:49:44,873
We don't care.

1113
00:49:44,907 --> 00:49:45,942
So you and all your special
meal people can go form a

1114
00:49:45,976 --> 00:49:48,044
colony on some island
together, for all we care!

1115
00:49:48,078 --> 00:49:49,646
LOLA: Do you see what
I have to put up with?

1116
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:51,081
JAMIE: Now if
you'll excuse me,

1117
00:49:51,114 --> 00:49:52,483
I'm going to go
home and have sex

1118
00:49:52,516 --> 00:49:55,019
with my hot blonde girlfriend.

1119
00:49:55,052 --> 00:49:57,489
LOLA: And I am going to go
have sex with my non-asexual,

1120
00:49:57,522 --> 00:49:59,324
hot Latin lover!

1121
00:49:59,358 --> 00:50:01,326
DAVID: Yeah me too.

1122
00:50:14,541 --> 00:50:16,645
JOSÉ: Jill!

1123
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:21,016
JILL: It didn't mean anything.

1124
00:50:21,951 --> 00:50:22,752
JAMIE: It doesn't matter.

1125
00:50:22,785 --> 00:50:24,420
We were never
really a couple, so

1126
00:50:24,453 --> 00:50:26,856
you can't really cheat on me.

1127
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:29,426
JILL: Why can't I
just go to your place?

1128
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:31,795
JAMIE: Don't ask
stupid questions.

1129
00:50:32,396 --> 00:50:34,499
JILL: So you're just
breaking up with me?

1130
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:35,933
JAMIE: We never had a
real relationship Jill,

1131
00:50:35,967 --> 00:50:37,135
so we don't need to break-up.

1132
00:50:37,168 --> 00:50:38,202
JILL: Can you
stop saying that?

1133
00:50:38,236 --> 00:50:41,440
Stop saying we didn't
have a real relationship.

1134
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,610
JAMIE: Well did we?

1135
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:46,613
JILL: Look, that
was in the beginning.

1136
00:50:46,646 --> 00:50:47,881
Things are different now.

1137
00:50:47,914 --> 00:50:50,583
JAMIE: It's different now why?

1138
00:50:50,617 --> 00:50:52,987
Because you have sex with
me, and now you're such a huge

1139
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:55,122
dyke that you can't even
keep your hands off other men.

1140
00:50:55,156 --> 00:50:58,060
JILL: Look, I freaked
out about last night.

1141
00:50:58,093 --> 00:51:00,629
And I was talking to José
and he smelled really nice.

1142
00:51:00,662 --> 00:51:02,564
I think he wears your cologne.

1143
00:51:02,597 --> 00:51:03,633
JAMIE: Oh right.

1144
00:51:03,666 --> 00:51:04,801
Yeah, and the cologne
confused you - of course,

1145
00:51:04,834 --> 00:51:08,504
I understand Jill.

1146
00:51:08,905 --> 00:51:11,809
JILL: Look, I made a mistake.

1147
00:51:12,843 --> 00:51:14,945
JAMIE: Right, because
you're obviously blind and deaf

1148
00:51:14,978 --> 00:51:16,715
and you need to rely on
your keen sense of smell

1149
00:51:16,748 --> 00:51:18,016
to lead you to your mate.

1150
00:51:18,049 --> 00:51:20,485
I mean, it could've
happened to anybody, really.

1151
00:51:20,518 --> 00:51:22,621
JILL: What do you
want me to say?

1152
00:51:22,655 --> 00:51:23,656
I'm confused.

1153
00:51:23,689 --> 00:51:24,623
I'm fucked up.

1154
00:51:24,657 --> 00:51:26,459
I made a mistake!

1155
00:51:26,492 --> 00:51:28,128
JAMIE: Yeah well, now you can
make all the mistakes you want.

1156
00:51:28,161 --> 00:51:30,764
But you're not
going to do it with me.

1157
00:51:34,569 --> 00:51:37,705
JILL: Fine.

1158
00:51:37,739 --> 00:51:39,208
JAMIE: José's gay anyway.

1159
00:51:39,241 --> 00:51:40,609
JILL: Good.

1160
00:51:40,642 --> 00:51:43,645
Then I guess we
belong together!!!

1161
00:52:12,279 --> 00:52:13,647
DAVID: José's
wearing a tank top today.

1162
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,784
JAMIE: Ew!

1163
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:18,953
DAVID: Jamie, I'm
getting so desperate,

1164
00:52:18,987 --> 00:52:22,458
you're starting to
look good to me.

1165
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,662
JAMIE: AAAAAAAAHHH!!!

1166
00:52:30,267 --> 00:52:32,502
JAMIE: Ha ha Howard.

1167
00:52:32,536 --> 00:52:33,571
This is so hilarious.

1168
00:52:33,604 --> 00:52:34,672
You're so funny, Howard.

1169
00:52:34,705 --> 00:52:38,910
You gotta - stop
making me laugh, ha ha.

1170
00:52:38,943 --> 00:52:41,046
GLEN: Cut!

1171
00:52:41,079 --> 00:52:44,116
James, come with me.

1172
00:52:51,725 --> 00:52:55,529
GLEN: James, what
is going on today?

1173
00:52:55,563 --> 00:52:57,732
JAMIE: I just have
some girl trouble.

1174
00:52:57,766 --> 00:52:59,100
GLEN: PMS?

1175
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,702
JAMIE: No Glen.

1176
00:53:00,735 --> 00:53:01,803
Trouble with girls.

1177
00:53:01,837 --> 00:53:03,606
I slept with this girl.

1178
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:04,740
She's an ex-lesbian.

1179
00:53:04,774 --> 00:53:05,808
And -

1180
00:53:05,842 --> 00:53:06,976
GLEN: And Howard
reminds you of her.

1181
00:53:07,009 --> 00:53:10,013
JAMIE: No.

1182
00:53:10,047 --> 00:53:11,882
GLEN: I'm sorry about
what you're going through.

1183
00:53:11,915 --> 00:53:14,718
But this isn't about you.

1184
00:53:14,751 --> 00:53:15,987
This is about Howard.

1185
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:19,657
Our whole day
revolves around Howard.

1186
00:53:19,691 --> 00:53:22,761
This whole movie
revolves around, who?

1187
00:53:22,795 --> 00:53:23,796
JAMIE: Howard.

1188
00:53:23,829 --> 00:53:25,598
GLEN: Howard.

1189
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:29,202
And you know what the greatest
thing about Howard is, Jame-O?

1190
00:53:29,236 --> 00:53:30,570
JAMIE: What.

1191
00:53:30,604 --> 00:53:33,641
GLEN: It's the
purity in his heart.

1192
00:53:33,674 --> 00:53:41,650
When you look at his face,
doesn't it just melt your soul?

1193
00:53:54,899 --> 00:53:56,901
JAMIE: I'm coming in.

1194
00:53:59,671 --> 00:54:02,040
I'm coming in!!

1195
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:14,988
AAAAAAAAHHH!!

1196
00:54:15,022 --> 00:54:18,226
LOLA: Jesus Jamie, calm down.

1197
00:54:18,259 --> 00:54:19,260
JAMIE: Why do you
even use this bathroom?

1198
00:54:19,294 --> 00:54:20,228
The lock doesn't work.

1199
00:54:20,261 --> 00:54:22,097
LOLA: I like it
because no one else uses it.

1200
00:54:22,131 --> 00:54:22,932
JAMIE: Listen Lola.

1201
00:54:22,965 --> 00:54:23,832
I got to talk to
you about something.

1202
00:54:23,866 --> 00:54:24,733
LOLA: Can I go to
the bathroom first?

1203
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:27,103
JAMIE: No, because -
no, no, you can't!

1204
00:54:27,137 --> 00:54:29,005
We don't have enough time
before we start shooting.

1205
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:30,040
LOLA: Then we'll talk after.

1206
00:54:30,073 --> 00:54:32,642
JAMIE: No, I have to
talk to you about it now!

1207
00:54:32,676 --> 00:54:33,678
LOLA: Can't it wait?

1208
00:54:33,711 --> 00:54:35,212
JAMIE: It can not wait!!

1209
00:54:35,246 --> 00:54:35,780
LOLA: Fine.

1210
00:54:35,813 --> 00:54:38,983
We'll talk while I go.

1211
00:54:39,016 --> 00:54:43,855
JAMIE: So I need to ask you
about something but you got to

1212
00:54:43,889 --> 00:54:45,692
promise not to make fun of me.

1213
00:54:45,725 --> 00:54:47,093
LOLA: Huh?

1214
00:54:47,126 --> 00:54:49,295
JAMIE: You got to
promise not to make fun of me!

1215
00:54:49,329 --> 00:54:50,797
LOLA: Why would I
make fun of you?

1216
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:53,667
JAMIE: Just open the door!

1217
00:54:53,701 --> 00:54:55,169
LOLA: Fine.

1218
00:54:55,202 --> 00:55:02,010
JAMIE: So I recently saw
David's...male anatomy.

1219
00:55:02,344 --> 00:55:03,346
LOLA: Uh huh.

1220
00:55:03,379 --> 00:55:04,313
JAMIE: Twice.

1221
00:55:04,347 --> 00:55:07,249
And it was my first
time seeing a real one.

1222
00:55:07,283 --> 00:55:09,820
And it's not like seeing one
in a movie or looking at the

1223
00:55:09,853 --> 00:55:13,190
statue of David - no
pun intended with that.

1224
00:55:13,223 --> 00:55:14,391
LOLA: Uh huh.

1225
00:55:14,424 --> 00:55:17,462
JAMIE: But I have this vision
of it that won't go away.

1226
00:55:17,495 --> 00:55:19,998
And it haunts me in
my dreams at night.

1227
00:55:20,031 --> 00:55:23,435
And there's activity.

1228
00:55:23,469 --> 00:55:25,404
LOLA: Activity?

1229
00:55:25,437 --> 00:55:28,441
JAMIE: You know,
um...not paranormal activity.

1230
00:55:28,475 --> 00:55:32,412
But um...sexual activity.

1231
00:55:32,445 --> 00:55:37,184
LOLA: So what
you're saying is,

1232
00:55:37,218 --> 00:55:39,755
is that you dream about
having sex with David.

1233
00:55:39,788 --> 00:55:40,489
JAMIE: No, not with David!

1234
00:55:40,522 --> 00:55:42,124
Just men in general.

1235
00:55:42,157 --> 00:55:43,125
LOLA: Men in general?

1236
00:55:43,158 --> 00:55:44,259
JAMIE: No, not men in general!

1237
00:55:44,292 --> 00:55:48,965
Just individual, specific
- can you not look at me?!

1238
00:55:48,998 --> 00:55:51,835
So...are you done?

1239
00:55:51,869 --> 00:55:53,837
LOLA: Yes.

1240
00:55:53,871 --> 00:55:56,807
Let's switch.

1241
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:02,147
JAMIE: So this is
obviously bothering me.

1242
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:05,785
And I want to ask you
what you think it means,

1243
00:56:05,818 --> 00:56:07,820
but I know what
you're going to say.

1244
00:56:07,853 --> 00:56:10,123
LOLA: What.

1245
00:56:10,157 --> 00:56:11,525
JAMIE: I don't want to say it.

1246
00:56:11,558 --> 00:56:12,526
LOLA: So you
want me to say it.

1247
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:13,193
JAMIE: No!

1248
00:56:13,226 --> 00:56:14,161
I don't want you to say it.

1249
00:56:14,194 --> 00:56:16,130
I just want to tell
you that you're wrong.

1250
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:19,167
That what you're going
to say is just not true.

1251
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,835
LOLA: You don't even
know what I'm going to say!

1252
00:56:20,868 --> 00:56:22,905
JAMIE: Yes I do!

1253
00:56:22,938 --> 00:56:24,840
LOLA: Jamie, you just
broke up with Jill.

1254
00:56:24,873 --> 00:56:25,841
JAMIE: Can you not look at me?

1255
00:56:25,874 --> 00:56:26,642
Please!

1256
00:56:26,675 --> 00:56:28,011
LOLA: You hate
doing this movie.

1257
00:56:28,044 --> 00:56:30,447
You fight with me
every chance you get.

1258
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,514
JAMIE: You fight with me!

1259
00:56:31,548 --> 00:56:33,217
LOLA: Would you
just listen to me!

1260
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:34,819
JAMIE: No, because I know
what you're going to say!

1261
00:56:34,852 --> 00:56:36,253
LOLA: What am I going to say?!

1262
00:56:36,287 --> 00:56:37,321
JAMIE: I don't want to say it!

1263
00:56:37,354 --> 00:56:41,359
LOLA: What I am saying is,
is that I think you're

1264
00:56:41,393 --> 00:56:44,997
just under a lot of stress.

1265
00:56:45,031 --> 00:56:47,500
JAMIE: Oh.

1266
00:56:51,105 --> 00:56:56,443
So...what you're saying
is...that it doesn't actually

1267
00:56:56,477 --> 00:56:58,980
mean that I want to
have sex with men.

1268
00:56:59,013 --> 00:57:02,317
LOLA: No.

1269
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:04,487
Unless you think
there's something more to it?

1270
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,088
JAMIE: No.

1271
00:57:06,122 --> 00:57:07,323
LOLA: Ok.

1272
00:57:07,356 --> 00:57:08,858
Because if there's more to it,

1273
00:57:08,891 --> 00:57:10,393
then there's
probably more to it.

1274
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:11,094
JAMIE: No.

1275
00:57:11,128 --> 00:57:12,863
There's not more to it, Lola.

1276
00:57:12,896 --> 00:57:14,898
LOLA: Ok.

1277
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:16,501
JAMIE: So does this mean
that we're friends now?

1278
00:57:16,534 --> 00:57:19,904
I know I've been kind
of an asshole lately.

1279
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:23,876
LOLA: I know, I've
been a bitch too.

1280
00:57:23,909 --> 00:57:25,911
JAMIE: So does that
mean we're both sorry and

1281
00:57:25,944 --> 00:57:29,582
we both forgive each other?

1282
00:57:29,616 --> 00:57:32,385
LOLA: Come here.

1283
00:57:46,169 --> 00:57:49,372
DAVID: Sorry, I thought there
would be more women here.

1284
00:57:49,405 --> 00:57:52,075
JAMIE: I should go.

1285
00:57:52,109 --> 00:57:55,412
DAVID: Stay for
awhile, please?

1286
00:57:55,445 --> 00:57:57,615
I don't know anyone.

1287
00:57:57,649 --> 00:57:59,551
JAMIE: Then why
don't you come with me?

1288
00:57:59,584 --> 00:58:02,988
DAVID: Because I was
hoping I'd meet someone.

1289
00:58:05,391 --> 00:58:06,926
Sorry.

1290
00:58:06,959 --> 00:58:08,394
About Jill.

1291
00:58:10,463 --> 00:58:11,998
JAMIE: Now she's
gallivanting with José,

1292
00:58:12,032 --> 00:58:13,300
so there you go.

1293
00:58:14,201 --> 00:58:18,206
Who knew we'd both get
screwed by the same bitch.

1294
00:58:21,176 --> 00:58:23,345
DAVID: You in love with her?

1295
00:58:26,381 --> 00:58:29,986
Well, let's dance.

1296
00:58:30,019 --> 00:58:33,958
You know, just have some
fun and not think about it.

1297
00:58:33,991 --> 00:58:36,260
JAMIE: I don't want to
dance with a bunch of men.

1298
00:58:36,293 --> 00:58:38,295
DAVID: OK it's just
dancing; it's not sex.

1299
00:58:38,329 --> 00:58:40,131
You don't even
have to touch anyone.

1300
00:58:40,165 --> 00:58:41,399
JAMIE: Why would
I touch anyone?

1301
00:58:41,433 --> 00:58:44,302
DAVID: Jamie, it's a joke.

1302
00:58:44,336 --> 00:58:45,304
JAMIE: If you ever
catch me with a man, David,

1303
00:58:45,338 --> 00:58:48,341
you got to really do something.

1304
00:58:48,374 --> 00:58:49,609
DAVID: Ok...

1305
00:58:49,642 --> 00:58:50,676
JAMIE: No, I'm serious.

1306
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:51,345
I'm not joking on
this one, David.

1307
00:58:51,378 --> 00:58:52,246
You got to really intervene.

1308
00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:55,148
I'm talking about
major intervention.

1309
00:58:56,516 --> 00:58:58,486
Do you promise me?

1310
00:58:58,519 --> 00:58:59,621
DAVID: Promise what?

1311
00:58:59,654 --> 00:59:01,356
JAMIE: That you will intervene
if I get too drunk and I

1312
00:59:01,389 --> 00:59:02,624
start mackin' on some guy?

1313
00:59:02,657 --> 00:59:04,093
DAVID: Jamie, stop
being so ridiculous.

1314
00:59:04,126 --> 00:59:05,127
JAMIE: Do you promise me?

1315
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:06,996
DAVID: OK, I promise!

1316
00:59:13,370 --> 00:59:15,072
JOSÉ: I hope I didn't
interfere with things

1317
00:59:15,106 --> 00:59:16,707
between you and Jamie.

1318
00:59:16,741 --> 00:59:18,442
JILL: No, not at all.

1319
00:59:18,476 --> 00:59:20,444
Jamie and I were
just good friends who

1320
00:59:20,478 --> 00:59:23,115
went down the wrong path.

1321
00:59:23,148 --> 00:59:26,285
But let's talk about you.

1322
00:59:26,318 --> 00:59:27,687
Tell me about Mexico.

1323
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:29,389
JOSÉ: Oh I'm from Brazil.

1324
00:59:29,422 --> 00:59:34,995
JILL: Ok, tell
me about Brazil.

1325
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:36,997
JOSÉ: Brazil is home
to the Brazilian wax.

1326
00:59:37,031 --> 00:59:38,732
Have you had one?

1327
00:59:38,766 --> 00:59:40,135
JILL: No.

1328
00:59:40,168 --> 00:59:44,039
JOSÉ: Oh, there're the best.

1329
00:59:44,072 --> 00:59:46,609
JILL: Well, I
shave down there.

1330
00:59:46,642 --> 00:59:49,312
JOSÉ: No, this is way
better than shaving.

1331
00:59:49,345 --> 00:59:53,417
Plus it reaches places
a razor could never go.

1332
00:59:54,584 --> 00:59:56,586
JILL: Maybe I'll
have to try it.

1333
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:58,723
JOSÉ: I have a home wax kit...

1334
01:00:03,128 --> 01:00:04,063
JILL: AAAHHH!

1335
01:00:04,096 --> 01:00:07,599
Fuck!

1336
01:00:07,633 --> 01:00:10,337
Mmmm...

1337
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:11,504
JOSÉ: You like that?

1338
01:00:11,538 --> 01:00:13,239
JILL: Mmhmm.

1339
01:00:13,273 --> 01:00:17,678
Fuck!

1340
01:00:18,612 --> 01:00:21,016
FUCK!!

1341
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:39,070
GAY DUDE: How's it goin'?

1342
01:00:44,275 --> 01:00:45,177
RUBY: Hi.

1343
01:00:45,211 --> 01:00:46,545
JILL: Aaaaaah!

1344
01:00:46,579 --> 01:00:47,680
Aaaaaaah!

1345
01:00:47,713 --> 01:00:52,719
AAAAAAAAHHH!

1346
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,589
Yeah...

1347
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:01,729
JOSÉ: You make me so
horny when you scream.

1348
01:01:01,763 --> 01:01:03,198
JILL: I should go.

1349
01:01:03,232 --> 01:01:04,199
JOSÉ: I thought you liked it.

1350
01:01:04,233 --> 01:01:05,300
JILL: No, I do.

1351
01:01:05,334 --> 01:01:06,502
I just need to go.

1352
01:01:06,535 --> 01:01:08,604
JOSÉ: I promise to make it
feel better when it's over.

1353
01:01:08,637 --> 01:01:10,740
JILL: I think we
should take things slower.

1354
01:01:10,774 --> 01:01:12,442
JOSÉ: It's just a wax job.

1355
01:01:12,475 --> 01:01:13,676
I mean, you'd pay
some lady 50 bucks

1356
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:16,714
to do what I did, plus tip.

1357
01:01:16,747 --> 01:01:18,649
JILL: No, I loved it.

1358
01:01:18,682 --> 01:01:20,518
It's just late and I'm tired.

1359
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:22,087
So let's take a rain check.

1360
01:01:23,255 --> 01:01:24,656
RUBY: I knew you'd be back.

1361
01:01:24,689 --> 01:01:25,757
JAMIE: Oh yeah?

1362
01:01:25,791 --> 01:01:27,894
RUBY: I did.

1363
01:01:27,927 --> 01:01:29,762
JAMIE: Um, let me
buy you a drink.

1364
01:01:29,796 --> 01:01:30,897
RUBY: You can buy me
anything you want,

1365
01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:34,568
as long as you don't buy
your time getting into my bra.

1366
01:01:34,601 --> 01:01:35,602
JAMIE: Huh?

1367
01:01:35,636 --> 01:01:38,873
RUBY: Sure, whatever you want.

1368
01:01:38,907 --> 01:01:40,708
JAMIE: Hey, we'll
have a couple of drinks.

1369
01:01:40,742 --> 01:01:42,243
Whatever you recommend.

1370
01:01:42,277 --> 01:01:43,778
BARTENDER: How about a
couple of lemon drops?

1371
01:01:43,812 --> 01:01:44,747
JAMIE: Yeah.

1372
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:45,548
You want one of those?

1373
01:01:45,581 --> 01:01:49,752
RUBY: I want
you...inside of me.

1374
01:01:59,864 --> 01:02:01,632
SANDY: So we've
missed you, Jill.

1375
01:02:01,666 --> 01:02:03,202
Anything new?

1376
01:02:03,235 --> 01:02:04,536
JILL: I started dating a man.

1377
01:02:04,570 --> 01:02:05,704
SANDY: Congratulations!

1378
01:02:05,737 --> 01:02:07,372
GROUP: Congratulations, Jill!

1379
01:02:07,406 --> 01:02:08,607
SANDY Tell us about him.

1380
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,277
JILL: He's from Brazil,
and he has an accent,

1381
01:02:11,311 --> 01:02:12,946
and he wears cologne.

1382
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:14,782
SANDY: He sounds
perfect for you.

1383
01:02:14,815 --> 01:02:16,484
Have you guys been
to third base yet?

1384
01:02:16,517 --> 01:02:18,185
JILL: Sort of.

1385
01:02:18,219 --> 01:02:19,286
SANDY: And you liked it.

1386
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,689
JILL: Yes.

1387
01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:24,493
Until I was reminded
that it was him that

1388
01:02:24,526 --> 01:02:28,764
I was with instead of my ex.

1389
01:02:28,798 --> 01:02:31,667
Girlfriend.

1390
01:02:31,701 --> 01:02:32,703
Jamie.

1391
01:02:32,736 --> 01:02:35,973
Jamie is my ex-girlfriend,
not my ex-boyfriend.

1392
01:02:36,006 --> 01:02:39,677
SANDY: I see...

1393
01:02:41,813 --> 01:02:44,783
Transformation
takes time, Jill.

1394
01:02:44,817 --> 01:02:46,752
It takes time.

1395
01:02:46,785 --> 01:02:48,587
JILL: That's it?

1396
01:02:48,621 --> 01:02:51,291
That's all you
have to say to me?

1397
01:02:51,324 --> 01:02:55,395
I had sexual and emotional
relations with another woman,

1398
01:02:55,428 --> 01:03:00,501
and all you have to say is that
"Transformation takes time?"

1399
01:03:00,535 --> 01:03:02,704
SANDY: I don't know what
you want me to say, Jill.

1400
01:03:02,738 --> 01:03:05,407
JILL: Why am I still here?

1401
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,309
SANDY: To
become an ex-lesbian.

1402
01:03:07,342 --> 01:03:08,477
JILL: No.

1403
01:03:08,510 --> 01:03:10,914
Why am I still here?

1404
01:03:10,947 --> 01:03:13,516
I've been coming to these
longer than most of the other

1405
01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:17,288
women, and everyone's moved on
with their heterosexual lives!

1406
01:03:17,321 --> 01:03:21,359
Why am I still here?

1407
01:03:21,393 --> 01:03:22,827
SANDY: I'm not
going to lie to you.

1408
01:03:22,861 --> 01:03:23,995
Most of the
women who have left,

1409
01:03:24,029 --> 01:03:27,833
we've lost to the gay agenda.

1410
01:03:27,867 --> 01:03:29,402
But you.

1411
01:03:29,435 --> 01:03:33,907
You have commitment,
passion, perseverance.

1412
01:03:33,941 --> 01:03:38,846
If anybody can do
this Jill, it's you.

1413
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:39,814
GROUP: Jill!

1414
01:03:39,847 --> 01:03:40,615
Jill!

1415
01:03:40,648 --> 01:03:41,516
Jill!

1416
01:03:41,549 --> 01:03:42,517
Jill!

1417
01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:43,985
Jilly likes the dick!

1418
01:03:44,018 --> 01:03:44,954
Jill!

1419
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:45,888
Jill!

1420
01:03:45,921 --> 01:03:47,323
Jilly likes the dick!

1421
01:03:48,557 --> 01:03:50,025
CASSANDRA: Welcome everyone,
to Reclaiming Your Lesbianism.

1422
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:52,429
As most of you know,
my name is Cassandra,

1423
01:03:52,462 --> 01:03:53,930
and I've been living
the lesbian lifestyle

1424
01:03:53,964 --> 01:03:55,699
for the last 30 years.

1425
01:03:55,732 --> 01:03:57,902
Looks like we have a
bunch of brand new faces,

1426
01:03:57,935 --> 01:04:00,338
so why don't we
start to my right.

1427
01:04:00,371 --> 01:04:02,808
MARY: Hi, thanks.

1428
01:04:02,841 --> 01:04:05,410
My name's Mary.

1429
01:04:05,444 --> 01:04:06,612
CASSANDRA: Hi Mary.

1430
01:04:06,645 --> 01:04:08,648
MARY: And I went to a series
of ex-lesbian meetings where

1431
01:04:08,681 --> 01:04:11,017
they showed gay
male pornography.

1432
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:12,852
They said it would
be twice as effective.

1433
01:04:12,885 --> 01:04:15,456
You know, men times two.

1434
01:04:15,489 --> 01:04:16,757
And it was hot.

1435
01:04:16,790 --> 01:04:20,527
Those gay men fucking
each other was really hot.

1436
01:04:20,562 --> 01:04:22,330
I had never really
seen a penis before,

1437
01:04:22,364 --> 01:04:24,532
and now - I just can't
get it out of my head.

1438
01:04:24,566 --> 01:04:26,669
It's all I think
about, is just penis.

1439
01:04:26,702 --> 01:04:29,939
You know, it's everywhere -
just penis, penis, penis!

1440
01:04:29,972 --> 01:04:31,440
JAMIE: Can we not
talk about penis?

1441
01:04:31,474 --> 01:04:32,475
CASSANDRA: Just one moment.

1442
01:04:32,508 --> 01:04:33,644
You'll have your
chance to speak.

1443
01:04:33,677 --> 01:04:34,678
JAMIE: Sorry.

1444
01:04:34,711 --> 01:04:35,879
CASSANDRA: That's OK.

1445
01:04:35,912 --> 01:04:38,048
I know penis is a sensitive
topic to a lot of lesbians.

1446
01:04:38,081 --> 01:04:39,017
JAMIE: That's right.

1447
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:41,853
I'm sensitive.

1448
01:04:41,886 --> 01:04:43,087
CASSANDRA: Mmhm.

1449
01:04:43,121 --> 01:04:44,657
Continue Mary.

1450
01:04:44,690 --> 01:04:47,559
MARY: Anyway, I think
about penis so much,

1451
01:04:47,593 --> 01:04:51,464
I'm afraid that I
may be bisexual.

1452
01:04:51,498 --> 01:04:53,667
I wanted to be straight
because being gay isn't

1453
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:55,869
accepted into society.

1454
01:04:55,902 --> 01:04:59,473
But if I'm
bisexual, and I love penis,

1455
01:04:59,507 --> 01:05:00,474
then everybody hates me.

1456
01:05:00,508 --> 01:05:03,578
So really I just want
to be a lesbian again.

1457
01:05:03,612 --> 01:05:06,148
CASSANDRA: Well you see, we
try to focus here on accepting

1458
01:05:06,181 --> 01:05:07,816
yourself into the
lesbian lifestyle.

1459
01:05:07,849 --> 01:05:10,820
We don't actually
change people's sexuality.

1460
01:05:10,853 --> 01:05:12,922
MARY: But if the porn
changed my sexuality,

1461
01:05:12,955 --> 01:05:16,393
then why can't I just find
a way to change it back?

1462
01:05:16,427 --> 01:05:19,563
CASSANDRA: I don't think
porn changed your sexuality.

1463
01:05:19,596 --> 01:05:21,132
I think it just
helped you discover

1464
01:05:21,166 --> 01:05:22,767
a hidden part of yourself.

1465
01:05:22,801 --> 01:05:26,605
And perhaps we can help
you with accepting that.

1466
01:05:45,928 --> 01:05:47,096
RUBY: So I see you've
been hanging out with

1467
01:05:47,129 --> 01:05:48,731
that dykey friend of yours.

1468
01:05:48,764 --> 01:05:50,132
JILL: Well I saw
you rubbing your

1469
01:05:50,165 --> 01:05:52,035
big huge boobs in her face.

1470
01:05:52,068 --> 01:05:53,903
RUBY: Well I saw you
pull her away aggressively

1471
01:05:53,937 --> 01:05:55,705
and make out with her.

1472
01:05:55,739 --> 01:05:58,676
Then I suppose you went back
to her place for some sex,

1473
01:05:58,709 --> 01:06:00,611
but you must not
have been very good,

1474
01:06:00,644 --> 01:06:02,981
because she came
looking for me last weekend.

1475
01:06:04,950 --> 01:06:07,686
JILL: No she didn't.

1476
01:06:10,523 --> 01:06:11,991
What did you guys
do with each other?

1477
01:06:12,024 --> 01:06:13,226
RUBY: What does
it matter to you?

1478
01:06:13,259 --> 01:06:15,095
JILL: It doesn't.

1479
01:06:15,129 --> 01:06:16,230
RUBY: When I didn't
see you come back here,

1480
01:06:16,263 --> 01:06:18,065
I thought you must have
switched to that lesbo group.

1481
01:06:18,098 --> 01:06:20,869
JILL: What's that?

1482
01:06:20,902 --> 01:06:23,671
RUBY: Just some group in
Hollywood that Mary joined.

1483
01:06:23,705 --> 01:06:26,107
JILL: Does she like it?

1484
01:06:26,141 --> 01:06:27,977
RUBY: I don't know.

1485
01:06:28,010 --> 01:06:31,847
I don't talk to her know that
she decided to go gay again.

1486
01:06:31,881 --> 01:06:34,718
JILL: But you go to lesbian
clubs and pick up on girls.

1487
01:06:34,751 --> 01:06:37,220
RUBY: Jill, I'm a lesbo-holic.

1488
01:06:37,254 --> 01:06:39,257
If an alcoholic goes to a
bar and has some drinks,

1489
01:06:39,290 --> 01:06:41,559
doesn't it makes sense
that he would stay in AA,

1490
01:06:41,592 --> 01:06:45,998
and not go to some wine tasting
festival down the street?

1491
01:06:46,665 --> 01:06:49,568
JILL: So does that mean you
didn't have sex with Jamie?

1492
01:06:49,601 --> 01:06:51,771
RUBY: You know, if you look
sex up in the dictionary,

1493
01:06:51,805 --> 01:06:56,577
it doesn't describe
anything that lesbians do.

1494
01:07:08,891 --> 01:07:09,959
JAMIE: She has
these huge tits.

1495
01:07:09,992 --> 01:07:14,297
Like huge beacons of
light to a lost sailor at sea.

1496
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:15,599
And they talked to me, too.

1497
01:07:15,632 --> 01:07:18,035
Kinda like -
"wah wah wah wah."

1498
01:07:18,068 --> 01:07:21,573
But in actual words, you know.

1499
01:07:21,606 --> 01:07:23,107
Then she took my hand and she
tried to - not really insert

1500
01:07:23,141 --> 01:07:24,809
it inside of her, but you know -
kind of put it in the region.

1501
01:07:24,843 --> 01:07:31,584
Then I looked down at my
hand and I saw this big,

1502
01:07:31,617 --> 01:07:33,220
bulging package!

1503
01:07:33,253 --> 01:07:35,622
Like a - like a - like a penis!

1504
01:07:35,655 --> 01:07:37,157
MEMBER: She was a
pre-op transsexual?

1505
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:38,860
JAMIE: No, she
wasn't a transsexual!

1506
01:07:38,893 --> 01:07:39,927
I was having visions.

1507
01:07:39,961 --> 01:07:41,162
CASSANDRA: Ok, Jamie.

1508
01:07:41,195 --> 01:07:45,033
It sounds to me that you have
a problem objectifying women

1509
01:07:45,067 --> 01:07:47,569
and dealing with a
phobia of male sexuality.

1510
01:07:47,603 --> 01:07:50,840
Does that sound
accurate to you?

1511
01:07:50,874 --> 01:07:54,310
JAMIE: I don't see
why that's a problem.

1512
01:07:54,344 --> 01:07:56,045
CASSANDRA: Well the first
step to solving a problem is

1513
01:07:56,079 --> 01:07:58,148
admitting that you have one.

1514
01:07:58,182 --> 01:07:59,116
JAMIE: Well I don't.

1515
01:07:59,149 --> 01:08:00,918
CASSANDRA: Then I'm
afraid I can't help you.

1516
01:08:00,951 --> 01:08:02,787
JAMIE: Yeah but I
mean - you don't think

1517
01:08:02,821 --> 01:08:04,656
I'm attracted to men, do you?

1518
01:08:04,689 --> 01:08:07,092
CASSANDRA: I'm afraid
I can't answer that.

1519
01:08:07,125 --> 01:08:09,228
JAMIE: Yeah but come on,
I mean have you ever met a

1520
01:08:09,262 --> 01:08:12,832
butch lesbian who
was attracted to a man?

1521
01:08:14,701 --> 01:08:15,969
I mean guys -
look at me, right?

1522
01:08:16,003 --> 01:08:19,106
Come on!

1523
01:08:19,873 --> 01:08:21,342
I mean come on, that would
have to go in the Guinness

1524
01:08:21,376 --> 01:08:23,678
Book of World
Records or something.

1525
01:08:23,711 --> 01:08:25,313
That'd be kind of cool.

1526
01:08:25,346 --> 01:08:27,583
I could maybe do
that...no, I couldn't do that.

1527
01:08:28,684 --> 01:08:35,659
Anyway, so as I said, I'm
basically here to meet chicks.

1528
01:08:40,064 --> 01:08:41,065
JAMIE: Oh, I had to go.

1529
01:08:41,098 --> 01:08:43,000
Had a booty call to tend to.

1530
01:08:43,034 --> 01:08:44,770
Got me some pussy.

1531
01:08:44,803 --> 01:08:46,338
DAVID: Cool.

1532
01:08:46,371 --> 01:08:47,472
JAMIE: Yeah, you know.

1533
01:08:47,506 --> 01:08:49,675
Just another day in the
life of a lesbian, that's all.

1534
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:52,178
DAVID: That's good.

1535
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:54,981
I got myself some
penis action as well.

1536
01:08:55,014 --> 01:08:56,850
JAMIE: You know David, what
you do in the bedroom is your

1537
01:08:56,884 --> 01:08:59,286
business, but - I don't
need to know about it.

1538
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:01,689
DAVID: You can
tell me about pussy,

1539
01:09:01,722 --> 01:09:04,726
but I can't tell
you about penis?

1540
01:09:04,759 --> 01:09:07,395
JAMIE: David, please stop.

1541
01:09:07,429 --> 01:09:08,664
DAVID: What about cock?

1542
01:09:08,698 --> 01:09:10,766
JAMIE: You know, I asked you to
stop and now you're continuing.

1543
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:13,102
So it's called
sexual harassment.

1544
01:09:13,135 --> 01:09:13,970
DAVID: Oh yeah?

1545
01:09:14,003 --> 01:09:15,772
What about dick?

1546
01:09:15,806 --> 01:09:16,773
JAMIE: Lesbians
don't like dick!

1547
01:09:16,807 --> 01:09:17,374
DAVID: Dick?

1548
01:09:17,407 --> 01:09:18,208
You like dick?

1549
01:09:18,241 --> 01:09:20,177
How about dick?

1550
01:09:27,987 --> 01:09:30,255
JOSÉ: Is your
hair stubbly yet?

1551
01:09:30,289 --> 01:09:33,293
JILL: No.

1552
01:09:33,326 --> 01:09:35,795
JOSÉ: Can I see?

1553
01:09:36,262 --> 01:09:38,899
Or not see.

1554
01:09:38,933 --> 01:09:42,269
I could touch without seeing?

1555
01:09:42,303 --> 01:09:44,906
JILL: Maybe we
should start with a kiss?

1556
01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:47,009
JOSÉ: Of course.

1557
01:09:47,042 --> 01:09:51,381
Where are my manners.

1558
01:10:01,191 --> 01:10:03,328
Feel this?

1559
01:10:05,230 --> 01:10:08,267
Smooth as silk.

1560
01:10:10,169 --> 01:10:13,072
You could eat dinner
off of these babies.

1561
01:10:13,105 --> 01:10:14,374
JILL: I should go.

1562
01:10:14,408 --> 01:10:16,143
JOSÉ: What's wrong?

1563
01:10:16,176 --> 01:10:17,811
JILL: This isn't working.

1564
01:10:17,844 --> 01:10:21,516
JOSÉ: It'll grow back.

1565
01:10:21,549 --> 01:10:22,884
JILL: I'm gay.

1566
01:10:22,917 --> 01:10:23,951
JOSÉ: You think I'm gay?

1567
01:10:23,985 --> 01:10:25,053
JILL: No.

1568
01:10:25,086 --> 01:10:27,990
I'm gay.

1569
01:10:28,023 --> 01:10:29,425
JOSÉ: But you're so pretty.

1570
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:31,126
JILL: So...

1571
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:32,762
JOSÉ: Did I do
something wrong?

1572
01:10:32,796 --> 01:10:33,997
JILL: No.

1573
01:10:34,030 --> 01:10:35,465
JOSÉ: Is it because
you think I'm gay?

1574
01:10:35,498 --> 01:10:37,033
JILL: No.

1575
01:10:37,067 --> 01:10:39,070
Are you?

1576
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:41,072
JOSÉ: Jill, how
can you ask me that?

1577
01:10:41,105 --> 01:10:42,773
Aren't I a good kisser?

1578
01:10:42,807 --> 01:10:44,476
JILL: I don't see
what that has to do with -

1579
01:10:44,509 --> 01:10:45,944
JOSÉ: Don't I
treat you like a lady?

1580
01:10:45,977 --> 01:10:47,212
JILL: Well...

1581
01:10:47,245 --> 01:10:49,047
JOSÉ: Didn't I
seduce you like a man?

1582
01:10:49,081 --> 01:10:52,919
JILL: Maybe you're
overcompensating.

1583
01:10:55,088 --> 01:10:58,325
JOSÉ: Maybe we
should have sex.

1584
01:10:58,358 --> 01:10:59,560
Just to make sure.

1585
01:10:59,593 --> 01:11:01,228
JILL: I need to go.

1586
01:11:02,196 --> 01:11:03,932
CASSANDRA: I want to guide
each one of you toward a

1587
01:11:03,965 --> 01:11:06,835
fearless approach of
understanding and accepting

1588
01:11:06,868 --> 01:11:08,571
yourselves, all
parts of yourselves,

1589
01:11:08,604 --> 01:11:11,841
no matter how much it might
scare you or repulse you.

1590
01:11:11,874 --> 01:11:12,708
Close your eyes.

1591
01:11:12,742 --> 01:11:14,411
You're inside the
belly of a whale.

1592
01:11:14,444 --> 01:11:19,382
Now imagine what would
happen if - someone left

1593
01:11:19,416 --> 01:11:22,787
your class without asking...

1594
01:11:26,992 --> 01:11:28,193
JAMIE: Wait - Jill!

1595
01:11:28,227 --> 01:11:29,194
What are you doing here?

1596
01:11:29,228 --> 01:11:31,463
JILL: No, you do not get
the pleasure of knowing

1597
01:11:31,497 --> 01:11:33,099
what I'm doing here
until you tell me what the

1598
01:11:33,133 --> 01:11:34,834
hell you're doing here?

1599
01:11:34,868 --> 01:11:36,302
JAMIE: I'm...here
to meet chicks.

1600
01:11:36,336 --> 01:11:37,971
JILL: Don't lie to me.

1601
01:11:38,004 --> 01:11:39,173
JAMIE: Why are you so mad?

1602
01:11:39,206 --> 01:11:40,574
JILL: Why am I mad?

1603
01:11:40,608 --> 01:11:43,878
The fact that you came to
a support group for people

1604
01:11:43,911 --> 01:11:45,180
who are trying to be
comfortable with the

1605
01:11:45,213 --> 01:11:46,882
fact that they're lesbians?

1606
01:11:46,915 --> 01:11:49,484
The fact that you're such a
cocky bastard who thinks she's

1607
01:11:49,518 --> 01:11:52,121
got her shit together,
and dumps me for an honest

1608
01:11:52,155 --> 01:11:54,023
mistake, when she
doesn't even know who or

1609
01:11:54,056 --> 01:11:56,960
what the hell she even wants!

1610
01:11:56,994 --> 01:11:59,897
JAMIE: I want chicks.

1611
01:12:00,297 --> 01:12:02,099
JILL: Why are you here?

1612
01:12:02,132 --> 01:12:03,535
JAMIE: I'm here
to meet chicks.

1613
01:12:03,568 --> 01:12:04,502
Chicks like you.

1614
01:12:04,536 --> 01:12:08,474
I'm here to meet you
and...and here we are.

1615
01:12:09,942 --> 01:12:12,945
JILL: You're here because
you're a hypocrite who can't

1616
01:12:12,978 --> 01:12:15,482
even be honest with
herself right now.

1617
01:12:27,062 --> 01:12:28,430
DAVID: So did you
hear that Jill and José

1618
01:12:28,463 --> 01:12:31,366
broke up because he's gay?

1619
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:34,437
LOLA: That's because
he's straight and Jill's gay.

1620
01:12:34,470 --> 01:12:38,976
DAVID: That's because
Jill and José are gay.

1621
01:12:39,009 --> 01:12:40,477
JOSÉ: You think I'm gay?

1622
01:12:40,511 --> 01:12:41,545
DAVID: Oh, José.

1623
01:12:41,579 --> 01:12:42,913
I didn't know you were...

1624
01:12:42,947 --> 01:12:44,216
JOSÉ: Why does
everybody think I'm gay?

1625
01:12:44,249 --> 01:12:45,951
DAVID: ...there.

1626
01:12:46,518 --> 01:12:51,324
JOSÉ: Ladies and Gentlemen, I
have an announcement to make.

1627
01:12:54,093 --> 01:12:56,463
I am not gay!

1628
01:12:56,496 --> 01:12:59,032
I am a heterosexual man.

1629
01:12:59,066 --> 01:13:00,534
I love women.

1630
01:13:00,567 --> 01:13:03,171
I love women
underneath me, on top of me,

1631
01:13:03,204 --> 01:13:05,707
naked, in the shower.

1632
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:08,109
I love them all the
time, in all the seasons,

1633
01:13:08,143 --> 01:13:10,512
in every way!

1634
01:13:10,546 --> 01:13:12,715
LOLA: A straight man
would never do that.

1635
01:13:12,748 --> 01:13:15,452
DAVID: A gay man
would never do that.

1636
01:13:16,386 --> 01:13:20,157
JOSÉ: I'm starting a blog
site at José not gay dot com.

1637
01:13:20,524 --> 01:13:21,993
18 and over only please.

1638
01:13:22,026 --> 01:13:25,429
Thank you.

1639
01:13:26,331 --> 01:13:28,233
DAVID: How unfortunate.

1640
01:13:30,369 --> 01:13:32,405
LOLA: I can see you now!

1641
01:13:33,573 --> 01:13:35,008
CASSANDRA: So what made
you decide to leave the

1642
01:13:35,041 --> 01:13:37,277
ex-lesbian group and join us?

1643
01:13:37,310 --> 01:13:39,713
JILL: It was time.

1644
01:13:39,747 --> 01:13:42,616
I dated a man for
awhile and then I

1645
01:13:42,650 --> 01:13:44,719
just couldn't do it anymore.

1646
01:13:44,753 --> 01:13:46,621
A real man.

1647
01:13:46,655 --> 01:13:50,192
Not to be confused with the
man that I dated who turned

1648
01:13:50,226 --> 01:13:52,528
out to be a woman, who
turned out to be an unforgiving

1649
01:13:52,561 --> 01:13:55,164
hypocrite, who started
showing up at Reclaiming Your

1650
01:13:55,197 --> 01:13:57,601
Lesbianism when
Lord knows why,

1651
01:13:57,634 --> 01:14:00,504
because she's supposedly
she's such a die hard dyke,

1652
01:14:00,537 --> 01:14:04,475
and she claims that
she's here to meet chicks!

1653
01:14:04,509 --> 01:14:08,046
Meanwhile, it's obvious to
everyone but herself that

1654
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:13,352
she's too insecure to be
honest about her own issues.

1655
01:14:13,385 --> 01:14:14,654
JAMIE: Yeah well,
it sounds like you're

1656
01:14:14,688 --> 01:14:16,556
the one with the problems!

1657
01:14:16,589 --> 01:14:22,096
CASSANDRA: Ladies, the number
one rule here is respect.

1658
01:14:22,129 --> 01:14:23,597
And rule number two
is we all have problems

1659
01:14:23,631 --> 01:14:25,232
or else we wouldn't be here.

1660
01:14:25,266 --> 01:14:27,703
MEMBER: Yeah, and any idiot
knows the best place to meet

1661
01:14:27,736 --> 01:14:30,205
chicks it at a
political rally.

1662
01:14:30,238 --> 01:14:31,106
JAMIE: Oh.

1663
01:14:31,139 --> 01:14:31,840
Really?

1664
01:14:31,873 --> 01:14:33,576
MEMBER: No, they
don't put out.

1665
01:14:33,609 --> 01:14:35,378
You got to go to a bar.

1666
01:14:35,411 --> 01:14:36,779
JAMIE: Well, not if you're
looking for an emotionally

1667
01:14:36,813 --> 01:14:41,418
committed LTR,
long-term relationship.

1668
01:14:41,518 --> 01:14:43,253
JILL: The only way that you
would be emotionally committed

1669
01:14:43,287 --> 01:14:46,224
is if you were
committed to a mental hospital!

1670
01:14:46,257 --> 01:14:47,826
JAMIE: Yeah well, the only way
you could be in an LTR is if

1671
01:14:47,859 --> 01:14:49,627
it stood for
"Lesbian Traitor Retard"!

1672
01:14:49,661 --> 01:14:51,297
CASSANDRA: Ladies!

1673
01:14:51,330 --> 01:14:52,498
Woah, please!

1674
01:14:52,531 --> 01:14:53,699
Ok.

1675
01:14:53,733 --> 01:14:55,768
I think what needs to happen
between the two of you is a

1676
01:14:55,801 --> 01:14:58,171
good
old-fashioned heart to heart.

1677
01:14:58,205 --> 01:14:59,072
Right?

1678
01:14:59,106 --> 01:15:02,110
Honesty, respect,
clarity, acceptance.

1679
01:15:02,143 --> 01:15:04,345
Do you think you
ladies can manage that before

1680
01:15:04,379 --> 01:15:06,814
the next session tomorrow?

1681
01:15:06,848 --> 01:15:09,151
JAMIE: Yeah, whatever.

1682
01:15:09,184 --> 01:15:10,219
JILL: Yeah, ok...

1683
01:15:10,252 --> 01:15:11,387
CASSANDRA: Thank you!

1684
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:12,421
Alright, who wants to sing?

1685
01:15:12,454 --> 01:15:13,455
Here we go.

1686
01:15:13,489 --> 01:15:16,326
Pass that over that way.

1687
01:15:16,359 --> 01:15:17,594
Happy place, everyone.

1688
01:15:17,627 --> 01:15:19,162
Happy place!

1689
01:15:19,195 --> 01:15:22,833
Pass them out.

1690
01:15:22,867 --> 01:15:24,668
Everyone have one?

1691
01:15:24,702 --> 01:15:25,703
Good.

1692
01:15:25,736 --> 01:15:27,706
Let's start from the top, OK?

1693
01:15:27,739 --> 01:15:30,642
OK.
