1
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,525
The train bound for

2
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:25,777
Shibuya will arrive shortly.

3
00:00:27,195 --> 00:00:31,157
Please stand behind the yellow line.

4
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:04,941
The next station is Shimbashi.
Doors will open on your left.

5
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:14,534
Every day, I see the same view from the window,

6
00:01:14,784 --> 00:01:18,246
but it's not imprinted in my memory.

7
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:26,754
If that building,
that billboard were gone tomorrow,

8
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:29,382
it would make no difference to me.

9
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:40,226
But you were different.

10
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,855
So every Tuesday,

11
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:47,233
I'd stand in the same spot

12
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:51,154
in the same car at the same time.

13
00:01:53,156 --> 00:01:58,369
The same spot in the same car
at the same time just to see you.

14
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:02,165
And I don't even know your name.

15
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:38,117
"Commencement Speech"

16
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:42,246
- What's up?
- Morning.

17
00:02:43,456 --> 00:02:48,002
It's nothing important.
Checking just in case you overslept.

18
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:53,216
Overslept? Not when I'm
graduating with top honors!

19
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:55,176
Do you have the speech?

20
00:02:58,429 --> 00:03:01,557
Almost forgot it! Thanks.

21
00:03:03,518 --> 00:03:05,395
On the last day I'd ride that train,

22
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,024
I took a chance to see
if I could change anything.

23
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:27,709
Doors are closing on track 4.

24
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:42,265
The next station is Shimbashi.

25
00:03:45,852 --> 00:03:47,019
It's her...

26
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:08,708
Doors are closing on track 4.

27
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:12,128
Excuse me.

28
00:04:21,179 --> 00:04:25,516
You were nowhere to be found.

29
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:35,985
Maybe you live in a parallel world,
and our paths are never meant to cross.

30
00:04:37,612 --> 00:04:42,867
That's how I justified it
as my love came to an end.

31
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:47,246
Or so I thought.

32
00:04:48,164 --> 00:04:58,163
@

33
00:04:59,342 --> 00:05:00,092
Parallel world?

34
00:05:01,636 --> 00:05:03,513
You've heard of virtual reality.

35
00:05:03,513 --> 00:05:06,224
Where you wear goggles and stuff?

36
00:05:06,224 --> 00:05:10,144
Right. But our research is far more advanced.

37
00:05:10,603 --> 00:05:17,151
Reality isn't experienced by the senses,
but by the brain itself.

38
00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:21,364
For instance, give me your hand.

39
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:27,370
You feel me holding your hand, right?

40
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,499
But it's not your hand that validates it.

41
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:35,586
It's the sensors in your brain that
receive the signal from your hand.

42
00:05:36,212 --> 00:05:40,716
So if I sent that signal directly
to your brain, I could make you

43
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:43,511
think I'm holding your hand even if I'm not.

44
00:05:43,928 --> 00:05:44,887
In other words...

45
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:47,098
OK, that's enough.

46
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:49,767
Where's your friend?

47
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:51,394
You're so...

48
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,439
Here he is.

49
00:05:56,232 --> 00:05:58,234
Over here, Tomohiko.

50
00:05:58,568 --> 00:05:59,610
Welcome.

51
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:01,612
Sorry I'm late.

52
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:04,115
- You're alone?
- She's running late.

53
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:07,577
They're announcing the research groups today.

54
00:06:07,577 --> 00:06:08,286
Right.

55
00:06:08,578 --> 00:06:10,162
This is Tomohiko Miwa.

56
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:13,291
I'm Takashi's friend.

57
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,585
- This is Natsue.
- Natsue.

58
00:06:15,585 --> 00:06:16,878
- Hello.
- Hi.

59
00:06:16,878 --> 00:06:18,588
- Natsue, sit over here.
- OK.

60
00:06:19,255 --> 00:06:20,715
- Have a seat.
- Excuse me.

61
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:31,267
Thanks.

62
00:06:34,604 --> 00:06:35,271
What?

63
00:06:35,855 --> 00:06:37,148
Nothing.

64
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:41,986
Sorry.

65
00:06:43,738 --> 00:06:44,697
Hello?

66
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:47,116
Yeah.

67
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:50,202
You guys are so different.

68
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:51,329
Right?

69
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:54,332
But we really get along.

70
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:58,002
I've known him since middle school.

71
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,670
Right?

72
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:02,006
Yeah, right.

73
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:06,135
Is she coming? Your "first love"?

74
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:08,804
Cut it out. It's embarrassing.

75
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:12,016
I can't wait to meet her.

76
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:14,810
Welcome.

77
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,396
Mayuko.

78
00:07:18,314 --> 00:07:19,690
She's adorable!

79
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,987
This is Mayuko Tsuno.

80
00:07:25,738 --> 00:07:28,491
I'm sorry I'm late. I'm Mayuko.

81
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,201
Nice to meet you.

82
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:32,370
Sit down.

83
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:35,414
She's really cute.

84
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:09,991
- Morning.
- Morning.

85
00:08:16,122 --> 00:08:17,915
I just had a weird dream.

86
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,501
Weird dream? Like what?

87
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:25,297
I can't remember any of it,
but I think you were in it.

88
00:08:33,431 --> 00:08:34,598
Thanks.

89
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:46,777
Why do you always look sad when I kiss you?

90
00:08:47,445 --> 00:08:49,280
Why do you always say that?

91
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:46,462
- Morning.
- Good morning.

92
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:07,233
Morning.

93
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:08,943
Good morning, Keiko.

94
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:10,111
Here.

95
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:12,780
What is it?

96
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:16,033
I went to the College. You left it there.

97
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:20,496
Thanks. I thought I sent everything over.

98
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:24,375
Osanai said you should come by.

99
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:26,836
He misses your cheeky face.

100
00:10:27,253 --> 00:10:30,172
No thanks. He drones on and on.

101
00:10:30,673 --> 00:10:33,050
Like there's no concept of time there.

102
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:34,718
Exactly.

103
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:39,140
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

104
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:40,724
Morning.

105
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,186
Morning, Woopy.

106
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:47,106
Shall we get started?

107
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:23,642
You're zoning, Tsuruga.

108
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:26,312
Dr. Osanai.

109
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:27,771
How about some lunch?

110
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,148
Sure.

111
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,996
It's not even pork cutlet.

112
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:48,250
Well, ham is pork.

113
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,752
I guess.

114
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:52,755
Yeah.

115
00:11:53,214 --> 00:11:55,132
It tastes good without sauce.

116
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:59,094
I guess I could do with less salt.

117
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:01,222
It's not good for you.

118
00:12:17,488 --> 00:12:19,949
Aren't you eating in the cafeteria?

119
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,409
I have some work to finish.

120
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,495
Is it urgent?

121
00:12:25,246 --> 00:12:26,205
No.

122
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:30,501
Do you want coffee, Tomohiko?

123
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:32,044
That sounds good.

124
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:37,466
For Takashi, too.

125
00:12:38,217 --> 00:12:39,843
- I'll pay.
- I got it.

126
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:41,971
Thanks.

127
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,480
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

128
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:53,399
What? Say it.

129
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:56,819
- She's nice, huh?
- Yeah.

130
00:12:57,403 --> 00:12:59,280
Too good for me, I'd say.

131
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:04,285
What do you think of Mayuko?

132
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:07,288
Where did that come from?

133
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:11,333
I feel like you're avoiding her.
You never eat in the cafeteria anymore.

134
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:15,754
We're just crossing paths.
We're in different groups after all.

135
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,299
I want you two to get along.

136
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,594
I'm an amateur at this kind of thing.

137
00:13:23,429 --> 00:13:28,434
We run out of stuff to talk about.
And we can't play sports or anything.

138
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:33,022
It would help if you were around.

139
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:34,690
- Thank you.
- Yes.

140
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:38,152
That's if you don't mind, of course.

141
00:13:38,444 --> 00:13:39,862
Why would I mind?

142
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:50,247
We'll get started on the data analysis.

143
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,832
Thanks.

144
00:13:57,171 --> 00:14:01,091
An interesting thing happened today.

145
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:03,093
With that guy.

146
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,262
- Shinozaki?
- Yeah.

147
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:10,684
I was compiling images of
his brain activity with the MRI.

148
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:15,022
I tried a little irradiation experiment.

149
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:19,943
Don't you need approval
from the ethics committee?

150
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:22,279
Are you free tonight?

151
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,338
Excuse me.

152
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:06,198
I'm home.

153
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:08,450
Hi. You're late.

154
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:12,496
I have to decide on my research thesis soon.

155
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:15,040
Already? So soon.

156
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:16,917
Looks good.

157
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:19,545
I'll go change.

158
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:21,672
Hey...

159
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:25,092
What's Tomohiko doing?

160
00:15:26,135 --> 00:15:29,346
Mr. Miwa? Why?

161
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,765
He transferred to L.A. last month.

162
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:33,517
Right.

163
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:35,811
What was that about?

164
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:40,190
He just popped into my head.

165
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:44,445
It's like he was deleted from my memory.

166
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:46,321
That's creepy.

167
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:50,409
Isn't it strange he went to L.A.
without telling me?

168
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:53,996
Maybe it was unexpected
and he didn't have time.

169
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:56,123
You were busy in April, too.

170
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:02,838
Are you overworked?

171
00:16:03,464 --> 00:16:06,758
Let's go somewhere this weekend.
You need a break.

172
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:08,469
That sounds good.

173
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:11,430
I'll help you.

174
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:18,687
Faulty memory?

175
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:25,235
When I stimulated the two groups
of nerve cells simultaneously

176
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:29,406
he claimed his school teacher
was a tall, young woman.

177
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:30,908
And in reality?

178
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:35,454
A fat middle-aged man.
He said so before the experiment.

179
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:36,914
That's interesting.

180
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:38,332
Right?

181
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:42,961
If that's true, then his memory
must have been rewritten somehow.

182
00:16:43,212 --> 00:16:46,924
Right? I knew you'd understand!

183
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:48,967
But is he all right?

184
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:50,177
Sure.

185
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:52,930
It was just a little irradiation.

186
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,849
I'll report it to Dr. Sudo later.

187
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,230
Thanks.

188
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:03,774
I'll have these if you're done.

189
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,361
I never liked oysters.

190
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:09,696
But they're delicious.

191
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:13,951
So how did you two meet?

192
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:15,827
Well,

193
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:21,333
she was really interested in a
thesis I wrote in graduate school.

194
00:17:22,668 --> 00:17:26,588
I looked him up and persuaded him
to come lecture at my seminar.

195
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:27,923
And...?

196
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:31,927
Before that, tell me how you two met.

197
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:35,180
I guess I never told you.

198
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:37,432
We met in our middle school gym.

199
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:40,102
Takashi is my hero.

200
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:42,729
You're drunk. Stop digging up the past.

201
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:45,065
- Tell me.
- Sure.

202
00:17:45,524 --> 00:17:47,985
My leg was always lame.

203
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:53,282
So I never had any friends
and I always ditched P.E.

204
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,617
Until that day. What was it again?

205
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:56,243
Basketball.

206
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:59,663
Right, basketball. One class against another.

207
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:03,500
I was sitting in a corner reading
a book on quantum theory.

208
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:10,173
A few of the guys started teasing me
about my leg. I was used to it.

209
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:15,804
But Takashi told them to cut it out.
He stopped them.

210
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:18,307
Then he asked me a question.

211
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,560
"Think monopoles actually exist?"

212
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:26,690
I was shocked! Another middle schooler
was interested in quantum theory.

213
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:31,820
That's how I became friends with
the most popular guy in the grade.

214
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:35,490
I see. That sounds really nice.

215
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,451
- Right?
- Really?

216
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:39,328
Yes. Really nice.

217
00:18:39,578 --> 00:18:43,498
You have this unspoken bond of trust.

218
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:46,209
I don't know about that.

219
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:49,087
What? Is this a one-way love?

220
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:56,053
Thank you for coming today.

221
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:58,972
How about a group photo?

222
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:03,769
That would be great! The three of us!

223
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:05,562
Someone's in a good mood.

224
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:09,191
All right. Get in closer.

225
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,154
More towards the middle.

226
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:18,533
OK, ready?

227
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:51,817
Look at the time.

228
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:55,570
Let's take a break before we sort the data.

229
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:56,947
OK.

230
00:20:01,243 --> 00:20:04,329
I haven't been sleeping well.

231
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:05,914
I see.

232
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:12,462
I heard you're living with a College student.

233
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:13,839
Wow.

234
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,384
Where do you hear these things?

235
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:21,555
From Osanai. I told you
I visited the College last week.

236
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:24,391
Well, we have nothing to hide.

237
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:26,685
How long were you dating?

238
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:28,895
About a year.

239
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:32,441
We rented a place when I
moved to this research lab.

240
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:36,945
So you had your eye on her
since she entered the College.

241
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:38,697
Sort of.

242
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:44,494
A friend introduced us right
before she started at the College...

243
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:45,704
Tomohiko Miwa.

244
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:49,082
Miwa? The guy who went to L.A.?

245
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,919
They attended the same seminar.

246
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:58,592
She was interested in a thesis that
I wrote in graduate school.

247
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:01,261
She wanted to know more about it.

248
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:03,013
Takashi! Over here!

249
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:10,187
Let me introduce you. She's from my seminar.

250
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:13,231
How do you do. I'm Mayuko Tsuno.

251
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:19,321
Miwa brought you two together?
That's not like him.

252
00:21:19,738 --> 00:21:21,364
I suppose.

253
00:21:23,658 --> 00:21:24,868
Wait.

254
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:28,288
Did I just say "Miwa"?

255
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:29,956
Huh?

256
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:50,936
What's wrong?

257
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:53,688
Nothing.

258
00:21:56,733 --> 00:22:00,779
Tomohiko introduced us, right?

259
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:02,197
Yeah.

260
00:22:02,572 --> 00:22:03,573
You were his junior.

261
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,158
That's right.

262
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:09,287
I know. Strange question.

263
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,040
Yeah. Strange question.

264
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:18,463
Where should we go tomorrow?
The weather should be nice.

265
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:23,009
Yeah. Shopping in Shibuya?

266
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:24,135
OK.

267
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,810
How about a group photo?

268
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:16,104
That would be great!

269
00:23:16,897 --> 00:23:19,024
- Get in closer.
- OK.

270
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:22,736
OK, ready?

271
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,870
Is something wrong?

272
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:35,040
No, nothing.

273
00:23:40,962 --> 00:23:43,673
You're tired. Let's go to sleep.

274
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:48,637
Sorry.

275
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:50,180
It's OK.

276
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:18,249
Takashi.

277
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:25,590
Tomohiko is in bed with a cold.

278
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:28,969
He wants us to go visit him.

279
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:58,456
You have the key?

280
00:24:58,456 --> 00:25:03,461
Tomohiko gave it to me a while ago.
In case he gets sick.

281
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:07,007
But I should return it, now that he has you.

282
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:12,470
How are you?

283
00:25:14,723 --> 00:25:16,182
Tomohiko.

284
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:22,397
Don't get up.

285
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:32,282
I feel like I make porridge for you
at least once a year.

286
00:25:34,075 --> 00:25:35,702
Thanks.

287
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:41,916
I'll help him.

288
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:44,002
Let Takashi do it.

289
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:45,462
I can't.

290
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:49,591
His lazy style of cooking
is strangely addicting.

291
00:25:50,925 --> 00:25:54,471
Then I'll learn from him. You get some rest.

292
00:26:06,274 --> 00:26:08,526
Did you read this thesis?

293
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:12,781
It was published last month
by NYU's Kukushkin Group.

294
00:26:13,698 --> 00:26:15,241
It's really interesting.

295
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:21,706
It says that "Memory..."

296
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:27,921
"is the neural system itself,
formed by the brain's network of neurons."

297
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:32,092
Plus, it claims that the brain
doesn't store memories anywhere...

298
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:37,347
by presenting a unique argument
that "memory has a concept of time".

299
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:41,184
Take the mollusk aplysia...

300
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:52,195
What do you see in Tomohiko?

301
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:57,033
You must see something since you're dating him.

302
00:26:57,575 --> 00:26:58,827
He's sweet.

303
00:27:00,203 --> 00:27:01,246
Is that all?

304
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:06,668
Maybe you feel obligated
because he's so fragile.

305
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:10,255
Maybe it's just sympathy.

306
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:15,301
What a terrible thing to say.

307
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:23,601
It changed again.

308
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:33,570
This window display changes weekly.

309
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:37,532
I love the beautiful designs.

310
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:40,743
They're cute.

311
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,580
So this is your taste.

312
00:27:52,172 --> 00:27:53,089
Hey.

313
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:56,801
Can I ask you something?

314
00:27:57,969 --> 00:27:58,845
What?

315
00:28:07,812 --> 00:28:10,481
The light's going to change. Let's cross.

316
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:17,071
See you tomorrow.

317
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:19,073
Yeah.

318
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:23,870
I hope Tomohiko feels better soon.

319
00:28:26,122 --> 00:28:30,001
Doors closing on platform 1.

320
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:13,878
Thank you for calling.
This is BITECH L.A. Central Research Centre.

321
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:15,588
How may I help you?

322
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:20,802
This is Tsuruga from Japan Regional Office,
Tokyo Research Laboratory

323
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:26,099
I would like to speak with Mr. Tomohiko Miwa
who was assigned from this year.

324
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:28,351
May I have your ID?

325
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:37,610
Thank you. Hold a moment please.

326
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:46,661
Thank you for holding.

327
00:29:46,661 --> 00:29:48,079
Tomohiko Miwa is part of

328
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:52,625
Central Research Center B7, but he's not here.

329
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:56,087
What does that mean?

330
00:29:56,629 --> 00:30:02,135
He's involved in a top-secret project.
I can't divulge his location.

331
00:30:02,135 --> 00:30:04,304
I can pass on a message, though.

332
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:07,473
So I can't speak to him directly?

333
00:30:07,932 --> 00:30:09,142
That's correct.

334
00:30:09,142 --> 00:30:13,896
If you want to reach him, please e-mail B7.

335
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:16,065
It will be forwarded to him.

336
00:30:16,316 --> 00:30:19,527
May I have that e-mail address?

337
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:22,238
I will give it to you now.

338
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,187
You have the key?

339
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:42,652
Here it is.

340
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:49,922
It's a new discovery that will
change neuroscience as we know it.

341
00:34:58,139 --> 00:34:59,348
Shinozaki.

342
00:34:59,348 --> 00:35:00,391
Don't worry.

343
00:35:12,987 --> 00:35:13,946
Miwa?

344
00:35:15,156 --> 00:35:17,366
You mean Tomohiko Miwa?

345
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:19,160
Yes.

346
00:35:21,162 --> 00:35:23,581
That's what you came here to ask me?

347
00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:26,500
He's at the L.A. headquarters.

348
00:35:29,253 --> 00:35:30,504
I thought so.

349
00:35:32,882 --> 00:35:36,636
Aren't you in touch with him?
I thought you two were close.

350
00:35:37,136 --> 00:35:38,804
I guess.

351
00:35:39,138 --> 00:35:40,181
I see.

352
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:46,187
By the way, I heard you're
living with Mayuko Tsuno.

353
00:35:47,021 --> 00:35:48,939
How's that going?

354
00:35:49,523 --> 00:35:50,858
Fine.

355
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:52,485
That's good.

356
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:55,613
I was under the impression

357
00:35:56,489 --> 00:36:01,952
that Miwa was dating Tsuno.
I guess I was mistaken.

358
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,457
The news took me by surprise.

359
00:36:09,126 --> 00:36:12,296
I guess my observation skills
aren't that great.

360
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:14,840
Well...

361
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:19,845
We didn't want people to know at the time.

362
00:36:22,223 --> 00:36:24,975
By the way, which group is he on?

363
00:36:24,975 --> 00:36:25,893
Who?

364
00:36:26,102 --> 00:36:27,937
Shinozaki, the guy who worked under Miwa.

365
00:36:28,604 --> 00:36:30,940
He quit about a year ago.

366
00:36:32,316 --> 00:36:33,234
What?

367
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:37,238
What are you talking about? You were there.

368
00:36:39,657 --> 00:36:41,617
He didn't show up for a while.

369
00:36:42,118 --> 00:36:45,996
In the end, he just quit.
We never even saw him leave.

370
00:36:47,707 --> 00:36:50,751
Typical of young people nowadays.

371
00:37:02,555 --> 00:37:03,639
Hey, Shinozaki.

372
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:05,391
Listen. This is big.

373
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,559
What?

374
00:37:07,184 --> 00:37:08,728
Mr. Miwa did it!

375
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,566
It's a new discovery that
will change neuroscience as we know it.

376
00:37:13,941 --> 00:37:14,984
It's insane.

377
00:37:14,984 --> 00:37:16,652
What? Like what is it?

378
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:18,654
I can't go into it yet,

379
00:37:18,946 --> 00:37:20,197
but if it's proven,

380
00:37:20,197 --> 00:37:21,157
Mr. Miwa may become

381
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:24,660
the youngest Japanese Nobel Prize winner!

382
00:37:25,703 --> 00:37:29,915
And they're considering him
for a transfer to L.A. headquarters.

383
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:32,042
Seriously? That's an elite career path!

384
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:35,337
They were considered our top two geniuses,

385
00:37:35,337 --> 00:37:38,758
but Mr. Tsuruga might be left in the dust.

386
00:37:40,384 --> 00:37:43,387
Don't be a tease. Tell me!

387
00:37:43,387 --> 00:37:44,680
What's going on?

388
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:47,141
I happened to overhear you.

389
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:53,105
Is this about Tomohiko's research?
Are there new developments?

390
00:37:53,606 --> 00:37:54,940
Shinozaki.

391
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:05,951
Sorry, I can't disclose details, even to you.

392
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:07,828
You're being so secretive.

393
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:10,080
It's not confirmed yet, that's all.

394
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:12,541
Whatever.

395
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:15,377
I'll find out soon enough at the presentation.

396
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:17,213
I'm looking forward to your presentation, too.

397
00:38:18,464 --> 00:38:20,257
No need to act.

398
00:38:21,175 --> 00:38:23,594
My group doesn't have
anything exciting to present.

399
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:25,679
Don't be bitter, Takashi.

400
00:38:27,473 --> 00:38:29,892
Bitter? Me?

401
00:38:33,187 --> 00:38:36,315
Sorry, I take that back.

402
00:38:40,027 --> 00:38:44,949
Oh yeah. I need some advice.
Mayuko's birthday is on the 10th.

403
00:38:45,825 --> 00:38:48,536
What should I get her as a present?

404
00:38:48,911 --> 00:38:50,329
I have no idea.

405
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:52,414
That's up to you.

406
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:59,839
You're right. Sorry. I depend on you too much.

407
00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:06,679
Oh, you still have the key to my place.
Can I have it back?

408
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,432
Are you moving in together?

409
00:39:10,432 --> 00:39:14,270
No way. But I may give it to her.

410
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:18,023
Just in case.

411
00:39:19,608 --> 00:39:22,903
Maybe this will help
move our relationship forward.

412
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:29,243
Sure. I'll bring the key next time.

413
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:31,245
Thanks.

414
00:39:33,414 --> 00:39:34,748
I'm going back.

415
00:40:00,024 --> 00:40:01,150
Is this OK?

416
00:40:01,525 --> 00:40:02,443
Is what OK?

417
00:40:02,735 --> 00:40:04,612
We're presenting in two days.

418
00:40:04,612 --> 00:40:09,408
It's fine. They say
the best ideas come when you're relaxed.

419
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:11,452
Oh, no!

420
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:13,287
Wait.

421
00:40:13,287 --> 00:40:14,747
You're daydreaming.

422
00:40:38,354 --> 00:40:39,355
No way!

423
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:23,524
Stay focused!

424
00:41:48,257 --> 00:41:54,763
Our test from now is matching the visual
and auditory information processes.

425
00:41:54,763 --> 00:41:57,766
we have analyzed the integration mechanism

426
00:41:57,766 --> 00:42:02,021
from the visual and
auditory areas of the cerebral cortex.

427
00:42:06,066 --> 00:42:07,276
- That was good.
- Thanks.

428
00:42:07,276 --> 00:42:08,444
Thanks.

429
00:42:08,652 --> 00:42:10,988
Now for the Memory Mechanism Group.

430
00:42:10,988 --> 00:42:11,697
Yeah.

431
00:42:12,281 --> 00:42:15,492
I can't wait to hear about
Mr. Miwa's discovery.

432
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:22,958
Next is Takaaki Sudo, Senior Researcher
of the Memory Mechanism Group.

433
00:42:23,459 --> 00:42:25,002
The next report will be by

434
00:42:25,002 --> 00:42:27,921
the Senior Researcher
of the Memory Mechanism Group,

435
00:42:28,047 --> 00:42:30,966
Dr. Sudo. Please step onto the stage.

436
00:42:35,304 --> 00:42:38,515
Today, I would like to talk to you,

437
00:42:38,891 --> 00:42:45,481
about the treatment of PTSD by
using next generation virtual reality.

438
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:49,860
What the hell? That's old news.

439
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:53,906
We've focused on the function
of the prefrontal region X

440
00:42:53,906 --> 00:42:58,660
of the brain to suppress memories of fear.

441
00:43:05,042 --> 00:43:06,126
Tomohiko.

442
00:43:07,836 --> 00:43:10,255
- What was that about?
- What do you mean?

443
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:13,258
What about your new research?

444
00:43:14,468 --> 00:43:16,428
We're not ready yet.

445
00:43:16,804 --> 00:43:20,182
We need more samples.

446
00:43:20,516 --> 00:43:21,850
Is it so groundbreaking...

447
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:27,189
Hey, Takashi.
Do I have to report everything I do to you?

448
00:43:28,398 --> 00:43:29,942
Sorry, I need to go.

449
00:43:39,993 --> 00:43:42,037
- Iced coffee.
- Me, too.

450
00:43:42,246 --> 00:43:43,330
Right away.

451
00:43:45,457 --> 00:43:48,168
I know you can't talk about it,
so I don't need details.

452
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:50,546
Just answer "Yes" or "No".

453
00:43:54,216 --> 00:43:57,302
Tomohiko made some sort of discovery.

454
00:44:03,058 --> 00:44:06,019
Yes, I think so.

455
00:44:10,607 --> 00:44:11,733
I see.

456
00:44:13,944 --> 00:44:15,028
But...

457
00:44:16,446 --> 00:44:19,575
he's become obsessed with it.

458
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,328
He argues with Dr. Sudo sometimes.

459
00:44:24,121 --> 00:44:25,330
It scares me.

460
00:44:25,664 --> 00:44:27,207
If you could talk to him...

461
00:44:27,207 --> 00:44:29,793
That's the nature of cutting-edge research.

462
00:44:41,722 --> 00:44:43,891
It's a little early, but happy birthday.

463
00:44:46,101 --> 00:44:48,270
I'm not giving this to you as a friend.

464
00:44:51,148 --> 00:44:52,316
Here you go.

465
00:45:08,665 --> 00:45:09,583
I can't.

466
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,418
I know.

467
00:45:13,295 --> 00:45:14,671
But please take it.

468
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:19,509
If you keep doing this,
I won't be able to talk to you anymore.

469
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:23,847
We passed that point a long time ago.

470
00:45:29,269 --> 00:45:30,687
I can't take this.

471
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:35,567
Spending your birthday with Tomohiko?

472
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:39,029
Is this what you wanted to say?

473
00:45:39,029 --> 00:45:41,698
Of course you are. He's your boyfriend.

474
00:45:46,245 --> 00:45:47,287
I'm going.

475
00:45:56,546 --> 00:45:57,839
Wait!

476
00:46:00,175 --> 00:46:02,219
Do you have feelings for me at all?

477
00:46:05,889 --> 00:46:07,015
I'm serious.

478
00:46:08,892 --> 00:46:14,189
You're saying that
because I'm Tomohiko's girlfriend.

479
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,406
Mayuko!

480
00:46:27,828 --> 00:46:32,332
I fell in love with you before he did.

481
00:46:36,253 --> 00:46:40,090
Two years ago, you were
riding the Keihin-Tohoku Line.

482
00:46:43,302 --> 00:46:45,262
I was on the Yamanote Line.

483
00:46:45,554 --> 00:46:49,266
We met on passing trains. I know you remember.

484
00:46:58,775 --> 00:47:01,028
I don't remember that.

485
00:47:01,361 --> 00:47:02,029
No.

486
00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:04,239
You knew it since we met at that cafe.

487
00:47:04,489 --> 00:47:06,616
You just pretended not to know.

488
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:10,662
I tried to pretend, too.

489
00:47:11,621 --> 00:47:12,789
For him.

490
00:47:14,458 --> 00:47:15,459
I don't remember.

491
00:47:15,792 --> 00:47:16,626
That's a lie.

492
00:47:18,462 --> 00:47:19,671
It's not!

493
00:47:45,405 --> 00:47:47,741
Thanks for contacting me, Takashi.

494
00:47:49,242 --> 00:47:53,789
I'm with B7 at the
L.A. Central Research Center.

495
00:47:53,789 --> 00:47:56,166
My research involves functional connectomics.

496
00:47:57,918 --> 00:48:01,922
It all happened so fast.
I'm sorry I didn't say good-bye.

497
00:48:04,341 --> 00:48:08,762
I'm not at the Center,
but at a lab of an affiliate company.

498
00:48:09,388 --> 00:48:11,890
I can't tell you where that is.

499
00:48:13,392 --> 00:48:16,061
It's not groundbreaking research,

500
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,605
but Americans are cautious.

501
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:21,525
The workplace is all right but

502
00:48:21,525 --> 00:48:23,860
I haven't been able to
adapt to the American lifestyle.

503
00:48:24,903 --> 00:48:27,114
Especially the home parties.

504
00:48:28,698 --> 00:48:31,159
At least the food is good.

505
00:48:32,869 --> 00:48:35,872
I ate raw oysters yesterday.
They were delicious.

506
00:48:38,208 --> 00:48:41,628
Anyways, I'm doing fine. Don't worry.

507
00:48:43,255 --> 00:48:45,799
I'll call you when I return to Japan.

508
00:48:47,467 --> 00:48:48,593
Tomohiko Miwa.

509
00:48:56,893 --> 00:48:58,311
Any discrepancies to report?

510
00:49:00,313 --> 00:49:01,982
By this afternoon.

511
00:49:03,775 --> 00:49:06,445
Tsuruga, I feel like
you're out of focus lately.

512
00:49:07,863 --> 00:49:09,114
No, I'm not.

513
00:49:10,949 --> 00:49:11,992
All right, then.

514
00:49:28,675 --> 00:49:31,887
If you're not happy
about the research, come talk to me.

515
00:49:33,305 --> 00:49:35,807
OK. But I'm fine.

516
00:49:49,154 --> 00:49:52,240
Excuse me, Dr. Sudo.

517
00:49:58,663 --> 00:49:59,664
Keiko.

518
00:50:02,834 --> 00:50:05,629
What would you think if you received an e-mail

519
00:50:06,713 --> 00:50:09,466
saying that oysters are delicious

520
00:50:10,133 --> 00:50:11,176
from a guy who hated them?

521
00:50:11,801 --> 00:50:13,094
Well...

522
00:50:14,721 --> 00:50:15,889
An intended joke,

523
00:50:16,848 --> 00:50:20,435
or someone else is writing that e-mail.

524
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:26,650
Is this a quiz?

525
00:50:30,529 --> 00:50:32,614
I guess not...

526
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:40,956
"Tomohiko Miwa"

527
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:11,319
I'm home.

528
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:17,617
Sorry, I was daydreaming.

529
00:51:26,042 --> 00:51:29,254
No, sorry I didn't call.

530
00:51:31,298 --> 00:51:32,632
I lost track of time...

531
00:51:32,757 --> 00:51:34,301
I'll go to the market.

532
00:51:34,301 --> 00:51:36,928
Let's just eat out.

533
00:51:38,597 --> 00:51:39,431
OK.

534
00:51:46,938 --> 00:51:48,189
What shall we eat?

535
00:51:49,733 --> 00:51:50,775
Whatever.

536
00:51:52,986 --> 00:51:54,237
No appetite?

537
00:52:30,857 --> 00:52:31,775
Takashi!

538
00:52:32,651 --> 00:52:33,943
What a coincidence.

539
00:52:33,943 --> 00:52:35,278
Hey, Natsue.

540
00:52:35,487 --> 00:52:36,529
Long time, no see.

541
00:52:37,781 --> 00:52:38,948
What's it been, two years?

542
00:52:40,617 --> 00:52:41,910
What are you talking about?

543
00:52:42,243 --> 00:52:44,287
We saw each other last year in Meguro.

544
00:52:45,664 --> 00:52:46,581
Last year?

545
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:49,751
Yeah. With your friend with the glasses.

546
00:52:50,168 --> 00:52:52,879
He introduced us to
his girlfriend at the cafe, remember?

547
00:52:54,047 --> 00:52:54,923
Sit down.

548
00:52:56,591 --> 00:52:57,884
She's really cute.

549
00:52:59,302 --> 00:53:01,805
She was really beautiful.

550
00:53:02,722 --> 00:53:03,723
What's wrong?

551
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:06,643
No, nothing.

552
00:53:07,602 --> 00:53:08,603
I'm Tsuruga.

553
00:53:09,187 --> 00:53:13,191
Takashi, right? Tomohiko told me all about you.

554
00:53:14,234 --> 00:53:15,360
So which group are you on?

555
00:53:15,985 --> 00:53:17,237
The same group as you.

556
00:53:18,738 --> 00:53:21,366
Wait. Wait a second.

557
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:26,621
How do you do. I'm Mayuko Tsuno.

558
00:53:29,165 --> 00:53:31,167
Takashi?

559
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:33,878
What's wrong? Are you OK?

560
00:53:34,879 --> 00:53:37,215
Get me a taxi...

561
00:53:37,757 --> 00:53:39,217
I'm Tsuruga.

562
00:53:39,217 --> 00:53:42,345
I heard from Tomohiko that you're very smart.

563
00:53:42,345 --> 00:53:44,180
Not at all.

564
00:53:52,564 --> 00:53:55,233
How about a group photo?

565
00:53:55,233 --> 00:53:57,193
That would be great!

566
00:53:57,569 --> 00:53:59,320
Get in closer.

567
00:54:01,573 --> 00:54:06,035
OK, ready?

568
00:54:10,457 --> 00:54:12,751
To Meguro, please.

569
00:54:37,317 --> 00:54:40,612
We open at 6 pm. Please wait outside.

570
00:54:42,822 --> 00:54:44,157
Excuse me, sir.

571
00:54:46,743 --> 00:54:47,952
Sir!

572
00:55:04,302 --> 00:55:07,096
"Mayuko Tomohiko Takashi"

573
00:55:07,096 --> 00:55:08,181
This...

574
00:55:10,433 --> 00:55:11,810
...is the real world.

575
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:28,660
You're home.

576
00:55:37,293 --> 00:55:40,922
Whose girlfriend are you?

577
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:44,509
Mine?

578
00:55:46,469 --> 00:55:48,179
Or Tomohiko's?

579
00:55:55,895 --> 00:55:57,105
Answer me.

580
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,778
What are you saying? You're acting weird.

581
00:56:03,778 --> 00:56:05,613
No! You are!

582
00:56:08,074 --> 00:56:09,450
What about this?

583
00:56:11,411 --> 00:56:13,204
We took this together!

584
00:56:21,004 --> 00:56:22,422
Don't play dumb.

585
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:25,925
No.

586
00:56:27,552 --> 00:56:28,511
This is...

587
00:56:29,762 --> 00:56:30,805
This is what?

588
00:56:32,473 --> 00:56:33,766
What the hell is this?

589
00:56:37,812 --> 00:56:40,148
Explain it so I'll understand!

590
00:56:48,656 --> 00:56:50,450
Where is Tomohiko?

591
00:56:53,494 --> 00:56:55,663
Why are you with me?

592
00:57:04,923 --> 00:57:06,174
I love you.

593
00:57:28,279 --> 00:57:29,781
I love you, that's why.

594
00:57:42,001 --> 00:57:43,753
Wait! Don't go!

595
00:57:48,549 --> 00:57:49,634
Get away from me.

596
00:57:53,721 --> 00:57:55,932
I don't want to hurt you.

597
00:58:51,362 --> 00:58:53,281
- Are you OK?
- Leave me alone!

598
00:59:07,462 --> 00:59:09,088
"I need you to come to"

599
00:59:09,088 --> 00:59:10,298
"the Experiment Lab."

600
00:59:14,469 --> 00:59:20,058
Research Center B1. Experiment Lab...

601
00:59:22,226 --> 00:59:27,732
Research Center B1. Experiment Lab...

602
01:00:15,696 --> 01:00:17,824
Mayuko is my girlfriend.

603
01:00:23,329 --> 01:00:25,414
Mayuko is my girlfriend.

604
01:00:30,419 --> 01:00:31,462
Mayuko is...

605
01:01:05,454 --> 01:01:06,455
Did I...

606
01:01:11,252 --> 01:01:12,879
kill...

607
01:01:15,631 --> 01:01:16,924
Tomohiko?

608
01:02:06,807 --> 01:02:08,100
I'll get some coffee.

609
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:09,268
Thanks.

610
01:02:29,372 --> 01:02:30,831
Did you sleep with him yet?

611
01:02:31,666 --> 01:02:33,918
What are you saying?

612
01:02:33,918 --> 01:02:35,336
Thanks.

613
01:02:36,087 --> 01:02:39,840
You haven't. Is it because of me?

614
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:43,552
It has nothing to do with you.

615
01:02:45,846 --> 01:02:48,224
I'm telling Tomohiko how I feel.

616
01:02:49,016 --> 01:02:52,270
Don't. Your friendship will be...

617
01:02:52,270 --> 01:02:53,479
Ruined?

618
01:02:55,606 --> 01:02:59,277
I don't need him. I need you.

619
01:03:02,029 --> 01:03:04,448
Why does it have to be a choice?

620
01:03:17,712 --> 01:03:19,714
What's wrong, Shinozaki?

621
01:03:22,758 --> 01:03:24,969
Shinozaki?

622
01:03:24,969 --> 01:03:26,929
I'm from Tokyo!

623
01:03:26,929 --> 01:03:29,640
Can you hear me, Shinozaki?

624
01:03:29,765 --> 01:03:30,683
Shinozaki!

625
01:03:30,683 --> 01:03:32,393
I'm from Tokyo!

626
01:03:32,393 --> 01:03:33,185
Shinozaki!

627
01:03:33,185 --> 01:03:34,937
What happened to him?

628
01:03:34,937 --> 01:03:36,230
I don't know.

629
01:03:36,814 --> 01:03:39,066
He insisted he was from Tokyo,

630
01:03:39,608 --> 01:03:41,193
so I said, "You're from Hiroshima."

631
01:03:41,944 --> 01:03:43,529
But he really is from Hiroshima.

632
01:03:43,529 --> 01:03:44,780
Calm down, Shinozaki.

633
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:46,073
Tomohiko. Is he all right?

634
01:03:46,782 --> 01:03:48,159
Don't worry.

635
01:03:49,785 --> 01:03:51,370
Help me, Yanase.

636
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:52,413
Sure.

637
01:03:53,247 --> 01:03:54,206
Can you stand?

638
01:03:57,460 --> 01:03:59,628
I'm from Tokyo.

639
01:05:06,112 --> 01:05:08,948
Something's going on with Mr. Miwa's group.

640
01:05:10,908 --> 01:05:15,246
They lock the door
and experiment on animals all day.

641
01:05:16,539 --> 01:05:18,874
They won't let anyone in.

642
01:05:18,874 --> 01:05:21,085
That's nothing new.

643
01:05:21,669 --> 01:05:27,133
But I never see Shinozaki anymore.
He used to call me all the time.

644
01:05:30,594 --> 01:05:33,013
From the day he freaked out?

645
01:05:33,222 --> 01:05:34,056
Yes.

646
01:05:35,224 --> 01:05:39,478
And Mr. Miwa is acting creepy.

647
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:44,733
He just sits there.

648
01:05:45,734 --> 01:05:49,321
Not eating or anything.
Just staring out the window.

649
01:05:50,489 --> 01:05:54,160
When I said "Hi"
he looked at me like I was a murderer.

650
01:05:56,036 --> 01:05:59,248
I think something really weird
is going on with that group.

651
01:06:30,821 --> 01:06:34,158
The person you have called
is unavailable right now.

652
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:38,245
He's not answering.

653
01:06:39,288 --> 01:06:40,331
I see.

654
01:06:44,043 --> 01:06:46,128
How much does Tsuruga remember?

655
01:06:47,296 --> 01:06:49,798
Nothing about the data yet.

656
01:06:55,930 --> 01:06:57,556
What's with the look?

657
01:07:00,226 --> 01:07:04,355
Don't let your feelings
interfere right now. Understand?

658
01:07:04,688 --> 01:07:09,777
This is a top-secret Bitech project.
L.A. has signed off on it.

659
01:07:11,654 --> 01:07:14,448
That makes wiretapping OK?

660
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:17,785
Yes, it does.

661
01:07:20,204 --> 01:07:21,705
That's unethical.

662
01:07:24,583 --> 01:07:26,293
Don't be naïve.

663
01:07:27,962 --> 01:07:32,466
You may have wanted this
situation to last forever, but it can't.

664
01:07:36,011 --> 01:07:36,762
Where are you going?

665
01:07:37,888 --> 01:07:39,515
To find him.

666
01:07:42,476 --> 01:07:44,812
He's acting just like Shinozaki.

667
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:47,690
I'm worried about him.

668
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:48,899
Stay here.

669
01:07:50,776 --> 01:07:56,407
I only asked you to monitor him
and investigate the data.

670
01:07:57,783 --> 01:07:59,577
You can't do whatever you want.

671
01:08:42,202 --> 01:08:43,704
What are you doing here?

672
01:08:45,873 --> 01:08:47,249
Sorry to bother you.

673
01:08:50,836 --> 01:08:52,004
What's wrong?

674
01:08:55,466 --> 01:08:56,759
Come in.

675
01:08:56,759 --> 01:08:57,843
No, it's OK.

676
01:08:58,385 --> 01:08:59,595
What's OK?

677
01:09:01,555 --> 01:09:02,765
You're acting weird.

678
01:09:04,808 --> 01:09:06,101
Just come in.

679
01:09:16,779 --> 01:09:19,114
Mayuko's in love with you, right?

680
01:09:24,036 --> 01:09:27,623
And you're in love with her.

681
01:09:41,303 --> 01:09:42,262
Yes.

682
01:11:09,391 --> 01:11:10,350
What is it?

683
01:11:13,937 --> 01:11:15,606
Wait! Stop!

684
01:11:18,442 --> 01:11:20,068
What's gotten into you?

685
01:11:23,572 --> 01:11:25,949
I said stop!

686
01:11:28,118 --> 01:11:29,077
No!

687
01:11:30,746 --> 01:11:31,955
What's wrong with you?

688
01:11:48,555 --> 01:11:50,140
I love you.

689
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,102
Ever since the day I met you.

690
01:12:00,067 --> 01:12:02,361
Wait! Stop!

691
01:12:04,071 --> 01:12:04,988
Don't!

692
01:13:26,403 --> 01:13:27,779
Thank you for your work.

693
01:13:45,881 --> 01:13:47,466
Send all this to the lab.

694
01:13:48,133 --> 01:13:49,426
Got it.

695
01:13:51,803 --> 01:13:55,474
You and Mr. Miwa
are both leaving me. I'll miss you.

696
01:13:56,183 --> 01:13:58,644
Especially since Shinozaki quit.

697
01:13:59,019 --> 01:14:02,689
A year will go by in no time.
We'll work together again.

698
01:14:03,523 --> 01:14:04,524
Well, OK.

699
01:14:07,986 --> 01:14:11,156
Are you almost done?
Let's go to the farewell party.

700
01:14:11,615 --> 01:14:12,407
OK.

701
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,080
You're dragging.

702
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:19,706
No, I'm not.

703
01:14:19,748 --> 01:14:21,792
"Tomohiko Miwa"

704
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:24,711
Sorry, I'll meet you later.

705
01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:38,600
"I need you to come to"

706
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:41,687
"the Experiment Lab."

707
01:15:10,549 --> 01:15:12,092
I'm outside the room.

708
01:15:29,985 --> 01:15:33,155
Hi. Thanks for coming.

709
01:15:35,657 --> 01:15:38,535
Come in. This is my lab.

710
01:15:43,874 --> 01:15:45,834
The company's letting me use it.

711
01:16:02,976 --> 01:16:07,397
With this device, any memory can be rewritten.

712
01:16:15,447 --> 01:16:16,281
Here.

713
01:16:22,537 --> 01:16:23,830
Are you sure?

714
01:16:24,289 --> 01:16:25,999
Isn't it confidential?

715
01:16:26,333 --> 01:16:27,959
Of course it's top-secret.

716
01:16:28,919 --> 01:16:30,087
But in the end,

717
01:16:30,504 --> 01:16:33,715
I wanted you to know what I had achieved.

718
01:16:41,014 --> 01:16:45,102
Remember when Shinozaki's memory
was accidentally rewritten?

719
01:16:45,936 --> 01:16:48,021
The "young teacher" incident?

720
01:16:48,522 --> 01:16:51,608
His desires were a key factor.

721
01:16:52,692 --> 01:16:54,653
We do this all the time.

722
01:16:54,903 --> 01:17:00,200
We have a tendency to "spin" things,
bend the facts in our favor.

723
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:04,121
Eventually, we start
believing that's the truth.

724
01:17:05,455 --> 01:17:09,167
It's driven by our subconscious desire.

725
01:17:09,626 --> 01:17:13,672
The brain processes memories
in line with those desires

726
01:17:13,672 --> 01:17:17,092
then shapes them into the "true version".

727
01:17:18,385 --> 01:17:20,387
I was researching that mechanism

728
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:25,183
and succeeded in artificially
recreating that phenomenon.

729
01:17:28,770 --> 01:17:30,480
The subject first visualizes

730
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,232
his actual memory.

731
01:17:33,024 --> 01:17:36,361
In Shinozaki's case,
"the middle-aged, fat teacher".

732
01:17:36,778 --> 01:17:40,574
I identify the group of
activated brain cells. Call it A.

733
01:17:41,116 --> 01:17:43,160
Now his strong wish

734
01:17:43,326 --> 01:17:46,163
to see a

735
01:17:46,163 --> 01:17:47,414
"tall, young female teacher."

736
01:17:47,747 --> 01:17:50,584
I identify that group of
activated brain cells. Call it B.

737
01:17:50,917 --> 01:17:57,340
I genetically manipulate A and B,
then activate them using photic stimulation.

738
01:17:58,258 --> 01:18:01,011
The "memory" and the "wish"

739
01:18:01,344 --> 01:18:05,348
which would normally be
on two different circuits merge

740
01:18:05,599 --> 01:18:08,226
and become indistinguishable.

741
01:18:08,226 --> 01:18:11,188
It forms a new, artificial memory C.

742
01:18:12,731 --> 01:18:15,358
In short, the memory is rewritten.

743
01:18:17,027 --> 01:18:19,905
What about the gap between memory and reality?

744
01:18:19,905 --> 01:18:21,573
Surprisingly,

745
01:18:21,907 --> 01:18:27,412
because the new memory C merges
with the subject's subconscious desire

746
01:18:27,412 --> 01:18:33,585
the surrounding memories
are triggered to sync with reality as well.

747
01:18:34,336 --> 01:18:40,884
The brain continues doing this until
the memory and reality become one.

748
01:18:42,177 --> 01:18:46,723
This change in memory happens
one after another, like dominoes.

749
01:18:46,723 --> 01:18:49,226
So I named it the "Domino Effect".

750
01:18:56,149 --> 01:18:59,903
You're a genius all right.

751
01:19:06,576 --> 01:19:07,452
Takashi...

752
01:19:10,914 --> 01:19:16,586
I want you to use this to rewrite my memory.

753
01:19:22,968 --> 01:19:27,597
I want to erase memories
with Mayuko from my memory.

754
01:19:31,268 --> 01:19:36,064
Don't worry. The domino effect
and this device have been perfected.

755
01:19:37,816 --> 01:19:41,987
By the time I awake,
I'll have forgotten everything.

756
01:19:43,238 --> 01:19:46,574
Then I can be sincerely happy for both of you.

757
01:19:54,249 --> 01:19:55,959
That's wrong.

758
01:19:58,420 --> 01:20:02,090
You have no right to refuse.

759
01:20:09,889 --> 01:20:14,477
I'll visualize my wish
which will be the trigger point. Record that.

760
01:20:22,235 --> 01:20:24,237
The image is from a year ago

761
01:20:26,072 --> 01:20:28,450
when we met at the café.

762
01:20:31,953 --> 01:20:36,541
Mayuko isn't my girlfriend.

763
01:20:39,044 --> 01:20:44,549
I want to bring you and Mayuko together.

764
01:20:49,137 --> 01:20:53,516
So? Is the prefrontal area flashing?

765
01:20:56,436 --> 01:20:57,562
No...

766
01:20:57,854 --> 01:20:59,064
I see.

767
01:21:01,191 --> 01:21:05,820
The image isn't strong enough.
I need to focus more.

768
01:21:07,781 --> 01:21:09,115
Let me try again.

769
01:21:13,036 --> 01:21:14,371
A year ago,

770
01:21:16,331 --> 01:21:18,666
the three of us met at a café.

771
01:21:29,552 --> 01:21:31,888
I want you to bear the burden with me.

772
01:21:36,810 --> 01:21:37,936
Hold onto this.

773
01:21:40,397 --> 01:21:43,024
Change the photo to whatever you like.

774
01:21:50,407 --> 01:21:54,661
Love Mayuko enough for both of us.

775
01:22:08,925 --> 01:22:11,594
OK. Let's start.

776
01:22:24,899 --> 01:22:25,984
Click "Record".

777
01:22:35,785 --> 01:22:37,120
Click "LED".

778
01:22:47,964 --> 01:22:51,843
The password is "0710".

779
01:23:10,570 --> 01:23:15,450
Now press enter. The irradiation will begin.

780
01:23:29,672 --> 01:23:30,798
I can't.

781
01:23:31,341 --> 01:23:32,258
Do it.

782
01:23:35,512 --> 01:23:37,597
Do it for me.

783
01:24:14,217 --> 01:24:15,301
Thank you.

784
01:24:41,744 --> 01:24:42,745
Huh?

785
01:24:45,039 --> 01:24:46,833
Tomohiko, something's wrong.

786
01:24:48,668 --> 01:24:50,128
Tomohiko, what is this?

787
01:24:55,341 --> 01:24:57,260
What's going on, Tomohiko!

788
01:25:01,639 --> 01:25:02,849
Tomohiko!

789
01:25:03,808 --> 01:25:06,644
Tomohiko! Wake up!

790
01:25:06,894 --> 01:25:07,729
Hey!

791
01:25:08,229 --> 01:25:11,649
Tomohiko! Wake up! Wake up, Tomohiko!

792
01:25:20,825 --> 01:25:22,201
Dr. Sudo.

793
01:25:23,161 --> 01:25:25,496
Tsuruga, what's going on?

794
01:25:26,706 --> 01:25:28,583
This wasn't supposed to happen!

795
01:25:30,710 --> 01:25:32,837
He's in a "deep sleep".

796
01:25:35,214 --> 01:25:38,760
Tell me step by step what happened.

797
01:25:39,636 --> 01:25:41,554
Please help him.

798
01:25:43,931 --> 01:25:45,600
Help Tomohiko!

799
01:25:57,528 --> 01:26:03,618
This was set to induce a
"deep sleep" in the first place.

800
01:26:05,078 --> 01:26:06,412
What do you mean?

801
01:26:08,539 --> 01:26:10,416
It's like suicide.

802
01:26:14,587 --> 01:26:15,838
Suicide?

803
01:27:40,590 --> 01:27:42,717
I rewrote Tsuruga's memory.

804
01:27:51,476 --> 01:27:52,894
What do you mean?

805
01:27:55,354 --> 01:27:56,773
He was tormented.

806
01:27:58,441 --> 01:28:02,570
He asked me to erase the past that
drove Miwa to take such an action.

807
01:28:05,490 --> 01:28:06,866
He knew too much.

808
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:11,120
His decision suited the company as well.

809
01:28:14,707 --> 01:28:15,750
Tsuno.

810
01:28:18,044 --> 01:28:19,921
There's a reason I called you here

811
01:28:19,921 --> 01:28:21,672
and told you the truth.

812
01:28:22,924 --> 01:28:23,758
Yes.

813
01:28:26,177 --> 01:28:31,098
The revision of surrounding memory
induced by the domino effect

814
01:28:31,599 --> 01:28:36,979
made Tsuruga believe that
you were his girlfriend.

815
01:28:40,650 --> 01:28:43,319
I want you to live with Tsuruga.

816
01:28:46,030 --> 01:28:48,533
Monitor him 24 hours a day.

817
01:28:50,117 --> 01:28:51,994
The domino effect was validated,

818
01:28:52,870 --> 01:28:55,706
but there's always the unexpected.

819
01:28:57,583 --> 01:29:02,797
If anything happens,
Tsuruga's life could be in danger.

820
01:29:03,297 --> 01:29:04,423
And it's very possible that

821
01:29:04,799 --> 01:29:10,930
something could prompt him
to recall the location of the data.

822
01:31:36,867 --> 01:31:38,869
You remembered everything.

823
01:31:40,705 --> 01:31:41,580
Yes.

824
01:31:43,791 --> 01:31:46,627
Give me the data that Miwa gave you.

825
01:31:48,462 --> 01:31:49,505
Data?

826
01:31:51,382 --> 01:31:52,717
Don't you remember?

827
01:31:56,512 --> 01:32:02,018
Before the experiment,
Miwa gave you some vital data.

828
01:32:10,818 --> 01:32:13,195
I want you to bear the burden with me.

829
01:32:14,530 --> 01:32:17,241
Change the photo to whatever you like.

830
01:32:19,368 --> 01:32:20,661
Remember it now?

831
01:32:23,581 --> 01:32:28,002
Miwa used himself to experiment
on the reversal of "deep sleep"

832
01:32:28,794 --> 01:32:31,172
and to prove the procedure was valid.

833
01:32:33,132 --> 01:32:35,342
He experimented on himself?

834
01:32:38,637 --> 01:32:41,390
Miwa's sleep wasn't suicide.

835
01:32:43,517 --> 01:32:45,478
He put his own body into

836
01:32:45,770 --> 01:32:48,522
a "deep sleep" in order to save Shinozaki.

837
01:32:49,482 --> 01:32:53,736
To validate the reversal mechanism.

838
01:32:55,237 --> 01:32:57,323
He gave that data to you.

839
01:32:59,116 --> 01:33:02,369
Such vital data. Why me?

840
01:33:05,831 --> 01:33:09,752
The company would never
approve of such a risky experiment.

841
01:33:10,127 --> 01:33:11,796
I wouldn't either.

842
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:17,593
But maybe he thought his best friend would.

843
01:33:17,968 --> 01:33:19,553
That's my guess.

844
01:33:23,182 --> 01:33:24,308
Do it.

845
01:33:27,228 --> 01:33:28,771
Do it for me.

846
01:33:32,316 --> 01:33:35,277
You remember, right?

847
01:33:36,445 --> 01:33:37,947
Where's the data?

848
01:33:46,038 --> 01:33:47,832
I promise to bring it.

849
01:33:49,917 --> 01:33:51,335
But before I do,

850
01:33:52,795 --> 01:33:56,132
I need time to speak to Mayuko Tsuno alone.

851
01:33:59,802 --> 01:34:00,845
All right.

852
01:34:18,654 --> 01:34:19,697
Hi.

853
01:34:21,490 --> 01:34:22,491
I'm home.

854
01:34:27,288 --> 01:34:28,289
Mayuko...

855
01:34:33,210 --> 01:34:34,336
I'm sorry.

856
01:34:38,007 --> 01:34:42,511
Don't apologize. It wasn't all your fault.

857
01:34:44,638 --> 01:34:48,517
No, it was all my fault.

858
01:34:52,021 --> 01:34:53,856
I was worried you'd say that.

859
01:34:55,232 --> 01:35:00,613
Blame yourself for everything
once your memory came back.

860
01:35:36,690 --> 01:35:39,860
Tomohiko entrusted me

861
01:35:41,362 --> 01:35:44,240
with the means to awaken Shinozaki,

862
01:35:45,741 --> 01:35:47,117
and with you...

863
01:35:50,621 --> 01:35:52,331
But what have I done?

864
01:35:56,293 --> 01:35:58,545
I'm such a weak person.

865
01:36:02,049 --> 01:36:03,342
I am, too.

866
01:36:05,928 --> 01:36:11,392
I was living with you, pretending that
I forgot everything about Tomohiko.

867
01:36:26,031 --> 01:36:27,700
Let's start over.

868
01:36:32,037 --> 01:36:34,373
Let's forget everything.

869
01:36:44,717 --> 01:36:48,804
You mean erase our memories?

870
01:36:51,307 --> 01:36:52,224
Yes.

871
01:36:55,728 --> 01:36:57,271
Let's move forward.

872
01:37:18,917 --> 01:37:20,419
Takashi...

873
01:37:23,088 --> 01:37:24,340
I see you on that train.

874
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:33,140
You're far away at first,
but gradually, you come closer.

875
01:37:35,059 --> 01:37:39,605
Then you're there in front of me,
just the windows between us.

876
01:38:02,669 --> 01:38:03,962
I was happy...

877
01:38:06,507 --> 01:38:09,259
Just knowing

878
01:38:10,511 --> 01:38:13,430
you would always be there,
at the same time and place.

879
01:38:15,599 --> 01:38:18,310
I felt that I existed in this world.

880
01:38:26,443 --> 01:38:28,278
I didn't even know your name.

881
01:38:31,365 --> 01:38:32,741
But I already loved you.

882
01:38:37,538 --> 01:38:38,705
Huh?

883
01:38:40,958 --> 01:38:46,255
That's the only truth there was between us.

884
01:38:58,475 --> 01:39:00,018
I'm not scared.

885
01:39:09,611 --> 01:39:10,737
Mayuko...

886
01:39:17,828 --> 01:39:20,372
Find me again.

887
01:41:22,202 --> 01:41:24,538
- Morning.
- Good morning.

888
01:41:24,913 --> 01:41:26,957
You stayed all night again?

889
01:41:27,332 --> 01:41:30,335
There's no one waiting for me at home.

890
01:41:31,336 --> 01:41:35,799
It's fine. I wanted to
verify this data by today.

891
01:41:35,799 --> 01:41:36,758
Really?

892
01:41:37,092 --> 01:41:38,719
Well, take a break.

893
01:41:39,553 --> 01:41:41,930
I'll go rest for a while.

894
01:41:49,980 --> 01:41:51,106
Tsuruga, look!

895
01:41:59,531 --> 01:42:01,408
I'll call Dr. Sudo.

896
01:42:39,196 --> 01:42:42,157
"U.S. Bitech Co. partially suspends"

897

898
01:42:51,917 --> 01:42:52,959
Hello?

899
01:42:54,127 --> 01:42:55,253
What's up?

900
01:42:57,631 --> 01:42:59,424
What are you talking about, Tomohiko?

901
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:01,218
Yeah, OK.

902
01:43:02,094 --> 01:43:04,513
Come over for a drink tonight.

903
01:43:06,556 --> 01:43:08,350
Call me when you're done.

904
01:43:08,934 --> 01:43:12,688
Yeah, sure. OK.

905
01:44:09,077 --> 01:44:14,499
