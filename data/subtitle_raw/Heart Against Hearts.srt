1
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:21,708
What color is good for the bedroom?

2
00:01:22,167 --> 00:01:23,042
How about yellow?

3
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,042
Not so good

4
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,042
What about pink?

5
00:01:25,167 --> 00:01:26,250
No!

6
00:01:26,417 --> 00:01:27,208
Pasted Blue?

7
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:28,708
Oh! Always get stuck with colours

8
00:01:28,917 --> 00:01:30,542
You're so picky, why don't you choose one?

9
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:31,917
OK. Green then?

10
00:01:31,917 --> 00:01:34,583
Green bedroom? Are you crazy?

11
00:01:34,917 --> 00:01:37,292
Sometimes I can't stand Alex

12
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:39,875
How can he stand out of the preparation?

13
00:01:40,042 --> 00:01:41,292
I can't image

14
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:43,292
how he would be after setting married

15
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:45,333
So give him a good lesson

16
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:46,667
You shit!

17
00:01:47,167 --> 00:01:49,958
You know his boss has just migrated to Canada

18
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:51,542
And Alex look over the business

19
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:53,417
It's understandable that

20
00:01:53,417 --> 00:01:54,875
he's got so busy recently

21
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:58,542
Busy? So you do all the stuff

22
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:00,917
And getting so weary?

23
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:04,333
I've made up my mind from now on

24
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,542
I've to be the woman behind a successful man

25
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:11,292
I want to talk to Mr. Lui

26
00:02:11,792 --> 00:02:14,083
He's not in, I'm his wife

27
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:16,083
See how eager you want to marry him!

28
00:02:16,167 --> 00:02:18,042
There's still a week to go!

29
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,000
You haven't paid the
management fee for several months

30
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:22,000
Also, all these bills are past due

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,667
Really?

32
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,750
Didn't the ex-tenant settle them?

33
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,250
You rent this flat?

34
00:02:27,417 --> 00:02:30,583
We bought it last year and pay
the installments from the rent received

35
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:32,167
Oh shit! We've just re-occupied it last month

36
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,375
So many bills to settle!

37
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,792
Rates, telephone, electricity

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,458
Home installments and the car!

39
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:38,833
I'm busy!

40
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:41,292
Madam the line has been disconnected

41
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:43,750
OK! Thanks!

42
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:47,542
Hurry up! This thing is heavy

43
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:51,833
It's here, not enough space

44
00:02:52,292 --> 00:02:54,167
Going straight! Don't be too pushy

45
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:57,333
It's too heavy. Let's put it down first

46
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:01,375
It's new bed! Please take it with care!

47
00:03:01,917 --> 00:03:02,833
Hey!

48
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,625
-Please sign here.
-Me?

49
00:03:04,792 --> 00:03:05,875
OK. Alright

50
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,125
What? He's not answering your call

51
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,458
He's busy, OK, give me. I'll sign it

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,917
Thanks!

53
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:19,125
Hey! Aren't you guys
going to take it in for me?

54
00:03:19,292 --> 00:03:21,375
Our truck is downstairs, you pay the ticket?

55
00:03:21,542 --> 00:03:24,167
Even you're willing to pay
we've to go for another job

56
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,375
What?

57
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,708
Well, he's busy!

58
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,000
That's not what I mean

59
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:35,083
If you don't understand you can ask me

60
00:03:35,292 --> 00:03:36,417
But you're busy!

61
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:39,042
Well, you could ask me when I'm not so busy

62
00:03:40,167 --> 00:03:42,208
OK. I'll try once more

63
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,958
See how he speaks after becoming a boss!

64
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,500
We can't blame him it's my fault

65
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,250
Certainly it's not your fault. Oh, I get it!

66
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,042
The boss is getting married
and you're love-torn

67
00:03:56,042 --> 00:03:57,292
So you're so absent-minded!

68
00:03:57,292 --> 00:03:58,917
You go to hell!

69
00:04:06,167 --> 00:04:09,542
Don't play around just because you're leaving

70
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:11,917
OK! Done?

71
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:15,125
We won't be here if it's done!

72
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,708
I'll be on the plane tomorrow
and I'm still trying hard for you

73
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:23,292
Do frugal? Smoking second-hand cigarette?

74
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,333
I've quit it!

75
00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:27,250
Just for that woman?

76
00:04:28,417 --> 00:04:30,167
Don't stick to the gamble table

77
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:32,250
It's so misty how can I bet?

78
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,667
Close the door please

79
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,292
OK. Let's go on!

80
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,750
Who's turn now?

81
00:04:42,042 --> 00:04:43,292
Come on, hurry up!

82
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,917
Why are these houses so cheap?
A nice place to invest

83
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:54,125
In the Mainland's Wai Yang Town who'll buy?

84
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:58,667
Now the houses in USA, Canada, Thailand, Africa

85
00:04:58,667 --> 00:05:00,250
Are sold in Hong Kong

86
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,167
So what?

87
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:12,208
Hello Sam? Where are you now?

88
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:15,917
We've got to go to the class!
There's a test today

89
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,167
The office was crowded with people

90
00:05:19,167 --> 00:05:22,583
Just now I'm thirsty and taking the soft drink

91
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:26,542
They think that I'm one of the gang

92
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:28,250
So what's your number now?

93
00:05:29,417 --> 00:05:31,958
I don't remember whether it's 128 or 138

94
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,958
Hang up the line and search for it

95
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:38,542
That's right

96
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:40,792
It's time for the class, let's go

97
00:05:41,167 --> 00:05:42,417
Let me help you

98
00:05:42,417 --> 00:05:44,458
No, thanks. Mind your business

99
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:48,083
Vivian, I've missed two lectures this morning

100
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,667
Did Dr Chow say anything?

101
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:52,750
I've told you to queue for a private business

102
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:55,375
I've been in the queue all night for all of you

103
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,042
How can you do this to me?

104
00:05:57,042 --> 00:05:58,917
Don't you get a share if there's a profit?

105
00:05:58,917 --> 00:06:00,375
Let's go!

106
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,083
Where is Alex?

107
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,875
Still working hard over there!

108
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:23,333
Make some modification here

109
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,083
Are you crazy? It's your wedding!

110
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:29,000
Don't you guys have to get pay
when I'm going to the church?

111
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,083
Don't you get some clues after these days?

112
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:34,375
Boss the church's decoration, the flowers

113
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,875
Regent's cocktail Macau's tickets

114
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,375
And Hyatts honeymoon suite

115
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,667
All are sponsored and free of charge

116
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,708
Such a good deal.
Have it twice if you have time

117
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,583
Can't you two shut your mouth?

118
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:46,917
If my bride hear this, I'll be in trouble

119
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:48,667
You suffer from wife fear so early?

120
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:52,292
Boss don't think that
fearing wife can led to great fortune

121
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:55,458
I've told you not call me boss, call me Alex

122
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,167
We're brothers right?

123
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,917
That's why we've never had any salary increase?

124
00:06:59,917 --> 00:07:03,208
It's always hard to get start! Are we brothers?

125
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:04,250
What are you doing?

126
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,458
What are you working on?

127
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:17,708
Sorry!

128
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,333
I inform your mom!

129
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:21,375
Why are you so late?

130
00:07:21,792 --> 00:07:24,667
Today is Saturday. The road is crowded!

131
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:28,167
Why don't we go to the church nearby?

132
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:31,000
Alex said that church offers him a discount

133
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,917
Why are you still following me? It's time to go

134
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,250
Go where?

135
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,167
The flats in Sha Tau Kok start selling today

136
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:41,500
Go and queue for one!

137
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,917
Today is your mom's wedding!

138
00:07:43,917 --> 00:07:46,583
Why you're so care about my Mon's wedding!

139
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:56,542
Mom are you ready?

140
00:07:57,125 --> 00:08:00,167
Are you ready? Your daughter is urging

141
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:03,875
I knows it's time,
but I've got to look perfect

142
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:06,750
Alex would acknowledge receipt
even if you don't look beautiful

143
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,583
I'm human, not a good for sale. Mind you words!

144
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:12,500
You look terrific even without make-up

145
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,750
Let me see what's going on?

146
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,083
Mom, hurry up!

147
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,417
Why are you so anxious?

148
00:08:25,417 --> 00:08:27,167
It's my wedding!

149
00:08:27,292 --> 00:08:28,583
You're also too anxious!

150
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,167
It will be erased in a moment

151
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:31,792
All right! I'm ready

152
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:35,125
I think my eye shadow
is little bit too dark isn't it?

153
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:39,375
The car has come!

154
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,625
Over there

155
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:42,250
Driver, we've ready to go!

156
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,125
It's so late!

157
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,083
Get on, get on!

158
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,125
See you later!

159
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:51,833
Come earlier!

160
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,042
Bye!

161
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,542
Care you pressing for life!

162
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,708
Vivian, why are you rushing me?

163
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,750
The car hasn't arrived!

164
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,750
Where is the car? It's just here!

165
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:24,708
Where is Sam?

166
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,417
I told him to go to Sha Tau Kok

167
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:27,708
What?

168
00:09:28,292 --> 00:09:29,917
OK, I call him back now

169
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:34,250
Does the bride go to the wrong church?

170
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,708
She won't! The Father's got a light schedule

171
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,167
He's going to leave any minute

172
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:39,875
Can he do both jobs together?

173
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,333
But the next job is a mass for the dead!

174
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,208
It doesn't matter

175
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,625
What are you talking about?

176
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:48,333
Yeah right! Marriage is the grave of love

177
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:51,250
Call her up, see what's going on

178
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:55,625
Alex Lui, it's your marriage, what a surprise!

179
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:58,417
Shit head! Long time no see!

180
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,708
I'm Edmond Tang, call me ET

181
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:03,375
I'm in the bullion marked,
I'm Alex's former classmate

182
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,500
See if I can help you!

183
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,083
May 1?

184
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,667
Who is so powerful

185
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:10,625
to get our Valentino to marry her?

186
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,625
Just a mediocre

187
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,583
Go and call her up!

188
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:33,000
What kind of car is yours?

189
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,625
It's the kind that cannot be over-loaded

190
00:10:37,042 --> 00:10:38,667
Oh! Shit!

191
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,333
I'm even worse

192
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,500
What are we going to do now?
It's hard to get a taxi here

193
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:45,917
I've an idea!

194
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:51,958
In HK you can have everything with money

195
00:11:01,917 --> 00:11:04,083
Robber! Robber!

196
00:11:10,292 --> 00:11:11,750
Hey, Goose (she) is coming!

197
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:15,125
Goose is coming. She is coming

198
00:11:20,292 --> 00:11:24,208
What's happen? How come you

199
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,833
No more nonsense!

200
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:28,000
I've got enough from you and the geese

201
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,958
I'm going to be a goose too!

202
00:11:31,542 --> 00:11:33,833
It's so late! The Father has gone!

203
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,125
So what shall we do?

204
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,417
Oh, it's fine,
it's a great relief. No more marriage!

205
00:11:37,417 --> 00:11:39,625
Don't listen to them not a single truth

206
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:42,083
Who's he? Such a nasty mouth

207
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,292
Just a bastard! My former schoolmate

208
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:07,375
We're so glad to see the marriage

209
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,125
Between Mr. Lui and Miss Chu

210
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,083
OK! Cut!

211
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,958
Please take once more after a while

212
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,208
What's going on?

213
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,292
Shooting for the TV commercials!

214
00:12:18,292 --> 00:12:20,792
Otherwise who will
sponsor your wedding expense?

215
00:12:21,292 --> 00:12:23,583
So you're not getting married,
you're just shooting for the commercials?

216
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,458
Why didn't you discuss with me first?

217
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:30,667
Making commercial is one of our business

218
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,417
It's just an unimportant stuff,
I can make the decision

219
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:33,833
That's the usefulness of having brothers

220
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:34,750
It's brothers!

221
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,167
So... Are you two getting married?

222
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:38,958
The equipment is here

223
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,250
Please calm down

224
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,208
Do you two wish to get married?

225
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,583
Sure we do!

226
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:46,292
Is this Father an actor?

227
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:47,417
He's real

228
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:51,583
OK... Let's continue, don't obstruct others!

229
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,542
It seems that I've seen him in a movie

230
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,083
Me too

231
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:12,458
Begin

232
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:18,208
Unhappy things can happen
even when you're very happy

233
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,208
The World insurance can safe guard you!

234
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:23,542
You've gone too far!

235
00:13:23,542 --> 00:13:24,458
If you buy from the World insurance

236
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,167
You can insure against anything!

237
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,500
Don't touch

238
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,625
I think you're taking
the wedding gown commercial

239
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,875
Insurance can also have ads

240
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:37,375
How come it be so?

241
00:13:39,417 --> 00:13:41,875
Investing in the bullion market
is better than investing in property

242
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:45,000
-Pa pa
-Hi! Vivian!

243
00:13:47,917 --> 00:13:49,375
Congratulation!

244
00:13:52,542 --> 00:13:53,792
What's the matter?

245
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,333
Oh sorry, I've used to this

246
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,250
She likes it

247
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,083
But you've to hug the left-side

248
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:03,708
Who's he?

249
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:05,542
He's Vivian's father

250
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:07,417
So he's Alex is his runner-up'?

251
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,250
Haven't you told me to go honeymoon in Europe?

252
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,708
I think we go to Italy Spain

253
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:18,125
Macau is not much different from Portugal

254
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,333
There are also casinos there!

255
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:22,292
We've still speaking
in Chinese There's no difference

256
00:14:23,042 --> 00:14:24,375
(Welcome!)

257
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:25,792
(Thank you)

258
00:14:26,917 --> 00:14:28,875
Was! Speaking in Portuguese?

259
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,583
You are so crafty!

260
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,000
Hei! You've got much weight?

261
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:18,750
I don't care,
anyway I won't enter the room myself

262
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:24,917
Can you still remember the first time we touch?

263
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:43,542
Oh, it's fine we are alone now

264
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,375
No one will disturb us

265
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,125
Hello!

266
00:15:55,542 --> 00:15:57,250
Is it Alex? I'm Dennis

267
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,500
Have you received my champagne and flowers?

268
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,250
Yes!

269
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:04,750
You're having a good time
while I'm suffering in Canada

270
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:07,542
Have you start
the Fight of the Century with her?

271
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:10,792
I have if not for your call

272
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,042
I hope this is not collet-call

273
00:16:13,042 --> 00:16:14,750
Yes, it is! You pay the bill

274
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,167
Good-bye then

275
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,167
Who is it?

276
00:16:18,167 --> 00:16:19,500
It's Dennis

277
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,292
Hello!

278
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:30,583
Oh shit, BCC bank has just announced bankruptcy

279
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,250
You've got to hurry back

280
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:35,292
I don't believe you

281
00:16:36,292 --> 00:16:37,792
I'm coming... I'm coming

282
00:16:39,417 --> 00:16:41,500
Operator? Yes

283
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,917
We are not to accept
anymore call today, thank you

284
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:48,417
Oh, fine we can have our own time now

285
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,333
Let's take a rest?

286
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,125
Rest?

287
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,125
Isn't today our honey-moon?

288
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,875
Yes, it is, but we've old couples

289
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,625
There's nothing so special how

290
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,667
What do you mean?

291
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:02,000
It's our first time to do it in a bold!

292
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,625
Are you prepared?

293
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:06,875
Oh yes

294
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:10,583
See, double pack!

295
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,333
A whole box?

296
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,708
Isn't that too many?

297
00:17:21,417 --> 00:17:23,375
We've only here for two days

298
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,750
I think it is just enough!

299
00:17:39,417 --> 00:17:40,958
What shall we do now?

300
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:19,958
SUKI?

301
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,708
Why don't you accept calls?

302
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:22,667
What's the matter?

303
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:27,417
BCC is going bankrupt!
You've to get your money back before live

304
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:32,000
Alex, are you ready, Hurry up

305
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:36,042
I'm taking a shit!

306
00:18:36,042 --> 00:18:38,625
Come on, hurry up!

307
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,208
I've said! I can't go now

308
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:45,208
BCC is bankrupt! The bank is on run!

309
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,417
What?

310
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:49,792
What did you say?

311
00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:51,917
Let's pack up and go. Hurry up!

312
00:18:51,917 --> 00:18:55,250
We can get our money back
if we reach before five

313
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,042
Have we book the tickets?

314
00:18:57,042 --> 00:18:58,875
Otherwise we have to go by helicopter

315
00:18:58,875 --> 00:18:59,708
Are you joking?

316
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:02,375
I said before five o'clock yesterday

317
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:33,000
Don't worry! Our company is not in trouble

318
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,833
When will your boss come back?

319
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:38,375
Don't be so harsh, we've been long acquainted

320
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,458
The boss is back

321
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,417
Please settle these bills

322
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:46,167
Our money is in BCC bank

323
00:19:46,167 --> 00:19:48,500
It's BCC bank goes bankrupt, not ours

324
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:06,375
We're brothers we've get the creditors away

325
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:09,000
But we haven't make a living!

326
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,958
So do our wives and kids!

327
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,458
So do our pas and moms!

328
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,542
I keep all the money in BCC bank

329
00:20:17,042 --> 00:20:19,125
But you also have an account in Chartered Bank!

330
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:32,250
When I was going to the market,
I saw queues outside Chartered Bank

331
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,292
Will be also on run?

332
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:37,167
It's not a rum cur, the TV news also say so!

333
00:20:39,292 --> 00:20:41,417
Thank you boss

334
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:46,000
My wife said that Chartered Bank is also on run

335
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:47,542
What?

336
00:21:02,167 --> 00:21:04,542
Mom, what's wrong? Did you get rob?

337
00:21:04,542 --> 00:21:06,417
Fortunately it's not me

338
00:21:06,417 --> 00:21:08,792
But I'm not sure about those behind me

339
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:09,792
What do you mean?

340
00:21:09,792 --> 00:21:13,125
I've taken all my deposit out from the bank

341
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,125
It's crowded with people

342
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,833
It's lucky that it remain opened at night

343
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:19,542
Can't that prove that it's not in trouble?

344
00:21:19,542 --> 00:21:21,625
It's not worth to waste time in the queue!

345
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:24,917
The Government had said that BCC
wasn't in trouble before it went bankrupt

346
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:27,458
I could get back nothing
just because was late last time

347
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:30,208
This time I won't be so foolish
I took out all my money!

348
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:32,750
You've so much money
with you beware of the robbers!

349
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,542
I've only got eight thousand dollars,
no one will be interested

350
00:21:35,542 --> 00:21:39,458
There've many others
who get millions with them!

351
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:43,875
What? Eight thousand dollars is all you have?

352
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,542
So how much do you think your mom has?

353
00:21:46,542 --> 00:21:49,958
All the decoration,
furniture and miscellaneous items

354
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:52,208
In this house are paid by me

355
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,583
You know your dad has been working hard

356
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:57,167
on his new firm

357
00:21:57,167 --> 00:21:59,625
He hasn't give me money for our living

358
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:02,625
I've paid for the food, the clothing etc

359
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,917
You could have asked him to pay

360
00:22:04,917 --> 00:22:07,583
Come on, on family

361
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:08,792
He's been overloaded with work

362
00:22:08,792 --> 00:22:11,333
I don't want to add to his burden

363
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:13,875
Remember don't say a word about this to him!

364
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:16,625
I don't want him think that I'm complaining

365
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,292
Oh! You've come back?

366
00:22:21,792 --> 00:22:23,917
This bowl of noodle is mine!

367
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:28,167
I didn't expect you to come home for dinner

368
00:22:28,167 --> 00:22:31,625
You know, sometimes
you're so busy with your work

369
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:35,167
I just come back from the Chartered Bank

370
00:22:35,167 --> 00:22:37,417
I'm going to make
the dinner for you, it won't take long!

371
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:39,625
No, don't bother!

372
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:42,417
Oh! No! Instant noodle is no good for you

373
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:45,250
I couldn't help before we got married

374
00:22:47,292 --> 00:22:49,125
Tell your mom

375
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:53,458
I deposit 20 Thousands
to her account every month

376
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,667
But the account is in BCC

377
00:23:02,542 --> 00:23:06,083
I was in the queue all day,
I didn't have time to go in the market

378
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:08,750
Don't you mind a canned food meal?

379
00:23:09,542 --> 00:23:10,833
Where's Alex?

380
00:23:13,417 --> 00:23:15,083
Did talk too much!

381
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:17,417
Did he say anything about his company?

382
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:32,042
How is it now?

383
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:36,042
Is all the company's money in BCC bank?

384
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:42,208
Forget it it's no point worrying now

385
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:47,250
It's too good if this flat is mortgaged to BBC

386
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,333
Even if it closes down
we don't have to move for the time being

387
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:53,500
You're too idealistic!
The government has said that all BCC's debtors

388
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,667
should settle the money at once

389
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:58,833
Is it so unreasonable?

390
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:02,542
It demands others to settle
their debts while it doesn't settle its?

391
00:24:03,167 --> 00:24:05,833
Well, by the way, we owe others much money

392
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:07,875
The home installment the car

393
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,625
How much is the company is debt?

394
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:24,292
There's only about eight thousand cash

395
00:24:29,542 --> 00:24:34,458
Some gold accessories
and stocks of Hang Seng and Landmark

396
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:36,458
Where did I put them?

397
00:24:36,917 --> 00:24:41,792
Oh, yes I've sold them
top pay the decoration fee

398
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,875
How is the company actually?

399
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:48,042
Can I help you?

400
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:52,000
Yes, just one thing

401
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,167
What is it?

402
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,708
Shut up!

403
00:25:04,167 --> 00:25:06,000
Did your husband commit suicide?

404
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,750
What?

405
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,667
I just saw him jumping and
shouting outside the Government, Offices

406
00:25:08,667 --> 00:25:10,125
He got very upset!

407
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:11,625
I've video-taped the scene

408
00:25:24,125 --> 00:25:25,458
Who is my husband?

409
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:26,500
It's Alex

410
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,042
Everyone knows Alex is my husband

411
00:25:28,042 --> 00:25:30,208
Which one is Alex?

412
00:25:30,292 --> 00:25:31,542
Right here! Isn't he Alex?

413
00:25:32,292 --> 00:25:34,083
He's a Indian

414
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:37,958
Don't you think
your husband's beard looks like an Indians

415
00:25:37,958 --> 00:25:40,417
I sleep with him every night,
can I not recognize him?

416
00:25:40,417 --> 00:25:42,417
I can't recognize my wife

417
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:46,000
Women get two distinct
looks for daytime and at night

418
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,000
I'd better go back to see him

419
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Don't be silly! He's an adult

420
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,583
Can you watch over him 24 hours?

421
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:55,542
Yes, he is! He won't be
so stupid to do any harm to himself

422
00:25:55,542 --> 00:25:57,667
He would not have
married you if he's not stupid

423
00:25:57,667 --> 00:26:00,167
Shut your mouth! Check the stock in the store!

424
00:26:00,167 --> 00:26:01,917
Otherwise I'll fire you

425
00:26:03,917 --> 00:26:05,917
Didn't you say you want a job?

426
00:26:05,917 --> 00:26:07,667
Well you may work for me!

427
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:08,792
You really mean to fire him?

428
00:26:08,792 --> 00:26:10,833
No! was just scaring him

429
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:12,792
Are you going to keep the shop yourself?

430
00:26:12,792 --> 00:26:15,208
How much can you gain with it?

431
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:18,333
What else can I do?
I can't even pass the Secondary School Exam

432
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:20,250
I deliver the money, you the effort

433
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,542
Doing what?

434
00:26:21,542 --> 00:26:22,583
Prostitute

435
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:24,083
What?

436
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,958
Am I doing to pay to be a prostitute

437
00:26:25,958 --> 00:26:28,000
I want you to pretend to be a prostitute!

438
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,792
Pretending? Acting in porno?

439
00:26:31,917 --> 00:26:33,833
Scream like a fowl!

440
00:26:34,708 --> 00:26:37,417
Oh! This must be a new technology

441
00:26:37,417 --> 00:26:41,500
Human beings screams like a cock,
taped and broadcasted in the farm

442
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,667
To stimulate egg-laying!

443
00:26:43,833 --> 00:26:45,792
So I just read it, why?

444
00:26:46,458 --> 00:26:48,667
Do I sound like a cock?

445
00:26:49,042 --> 00:26:53,833
Ih, Yo Ya, Yi

446
00:26:54,417 --> 00:26:56,292
Do today's cocks scream this way?

447
00:26:56,292 --> 00:26:57,958
You are really silly

448
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:02,333
Listen to me!

449
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:10,750
Oh Ah Yi

450
00:27:11,083 --> 00:27:11,833
What are you doing?

451
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:19,667
Oh, I can't stand anymore...
I'm dying... It's too fantastic

452
00:27:21,417 --> 00:27:24,542
Oh, it's wonderful

453
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:28,917
Please don't push me

454
00:27:28,917 --> 00:27:30,583
Oh! Harder harder... Oh yes!

455
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:33,625
Damn you! I'm not doing it

456
00:27:34,042 --> 00:27:36,333
This is adult's phone-call service

457
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:38,542
It pays good, six bucks per minutes

458
00:27:38,542 --> 00:27:39,750
I've rented ten lines,

459
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,500
each can at least
make six to seven thousand per month

460
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,000
I won't do it

461
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,375
What if someone recognize my voice?

462
00:27:45,708 --> 00:27:47,583
I just ask you to scream

463
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:48,792
Do you think you're so popular?

464
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,542
Whose voice would be
recognized once you scream?

465
00:27:50,542 --> 00:27:52,833
My husband will recognize mine!

466
00:27:53,042 --> 00:27:55,625
Your husband often turns to such service?

467
00:27:55,917 --> 00:27:57,333
It's not for me!

468
00:27:57,458 --> 00:27:59,208
Don't you do it to your husband?

469
00:27:59,292 --> 00:28:00,875
That's different?

470
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:04,833
Forget it! Don't say I don't help you

471
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:08,417
It's you who wants to earn
some money for your family

472
00:28:08,417 --> 00:28:10,917
OK. I'll try

473
00:28:16,667 --> 00:28:19,708
Just imagine you've
with your little Beard, then you can do it

474
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:24,875
Right! Just keeping on!

475
00:28:25,042 --> 00:28:26,500
Who's this man?

476
00:28:26,583 --> 00:28:28,208
Little Beard

477
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:32,875
Duet is better than solo

478
00:28:34,042 --> 00:28:36,083
Let's get to work, babe!

479
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:44,125
Wo Yi harder

480
00:28:44,792 --> 00:28:46,167
Fuck you to die

481
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:04,958
Are we finished?

482
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:09,750
Man I have a contract with you

483
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:13,375
Yes but my boss only accepts cash

484
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:15,333
Can you do a favor?

485
00:29:16,542 --> 00:29:18,875
Are you kidding?

486
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:19,958
I've said that I'll pay after I complete it

487
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:22,250
and deliver it to the client

488
00:29:22,292 --> 00:29:24,083
Alex, you should know

489
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:26,167
I just do by order!

490
00:29:26,167 --> 00:29:26,917
What should I do?

491
00:29:26,917 --> 00:29:30,000
Teddy please help me

492
00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:34,500
Teddy... Teddy

493
00:29:38,583 --> 00:29:39,917
Let me do it

494
00:29:39,917 --> 00:29:41,125
Tell them to go back to their post

495
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:42,875
Be in one's position!

496
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:44,000
We do it ourselves!

497
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:46,917
We do it ourselves!

498
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:53,875
Can we?

499
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,917
Maybe lighting is not enough!

500
00:29:57,542 --> 00:29:58,917
How is it now?

501
00:29:58,917 --> 00:30:00,583
Yeah! Much better!

502
00:30:03,417 --> 00:30:06,667
Sorry, Margaret, we can't pay you tonight!

503
00:30:07,917 --> 00:30:11,458
Well, then you pay me double another night

504
00:30:12,167 --> 00:30:13,333
Are you guys ready?

505
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:14,750
We've ready

506
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,125
How about you guys?

507
00:30:17,417 --> 00:30:19,083
Ken, ask them in!

508
00:30:39,417 --> 00:30:40,583
Cut

509
00:30:41,667 --> 00:30:43,458
Move a little bit aside

510
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:47,667
Can you turn to your right side?

511
00:30:59,208 --> 00:31:02,000
This lady wants to see Mr. Tang

512
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,208
If you want to know
how prosperous HK is now, just

513
00:31:04,208 --> 00:31:06,958
Go to Cosmo,

514
00:31:06,958 --> 00:31:09,250
Today's World Night Club then you'll get it

515
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:12,958
You bastard My uncle is very patriotic

516
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:15,042
He should prefer China City!

517
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:18,083
Of course! We've all Chinese

518
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:20,917
China City sounds more intimate!

519
00:31:23,042 --> 00:31:25,750
Hello, Vivian! How nice to see you!

520
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:29,042
Uncle Tang be owing to the government's

521
00:31:29,042 --> 00:31:31,292
and the bank's policies

522
00:31:31,292 --> 00:31:32,500
Property market is
no longer a good place to get money

523
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,333
I want to learn bullion trading from you

524
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:35,417
What a smart girl!

525
00:31:35,417 --> 00:31:38,083
College kids are much social conscious now

526
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:41,583
Contributing to HK's
economic prosperity while still studying

527
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:44,208
Uncle, let me to teach her!

528
00:31:44,292 --> 00:31:45,542
Well but she's my niece

529
00:31:45,542 --> 00:31:46,917
There'll be no problem, uncle!

530
00:31:46,917 --> 00:31:50,167
Don't call me uncle, call me boss in the office

531
00:31:50,333 --> 00:31:52,125
Yes boss!

532
00:31:52,542 --> 00:31:55,250
Vivian, come with me now

533
00:31:56,167 --> 00:31:57,708
Boss, we're leaving

534
00:31:57,708 --> 00:31:59,167
OK

535
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,500
Little Tang she's so cute!

536
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,458
Keep out of her

537
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:08,417
How about just have a touch?

538
00:32:08,417 --> 00:32:10,458
She is my niece

539
00:32:10,708 --> 00:32:14,708
Little Tang,
can I just have a kiss to your niece

540
00:32:15,292 --> 00:32:19,083
You Hong Kong people are so conservative

541
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:20,458
A little bit of it

542
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,083
Mom, this is for you

543
00:32:33,208 --> 00:32:34,750
How come you have so much money?

544
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,875
Trading flats?

545
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:38,208
No, it's bullion! It's easier to make profit!

546
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:41,542
Bullion speculation? You're still a student

547
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:44,500
But many college students
also have part-time jobs!

548
00:32:44,958 --> 00:32:49,333
You should be cautious!
It's a very risky undertaking

549
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:51,417
But risk is unavoidable
if you want to earn big money

550
00:32:51,417 --> 00:32:53,208
Now I'm a part-time
investment executive in ET's company

551
00:32:53,208 --> 00:32:55,708
You know, ET is
Alex's former classmate,

552
00:32:55,708 --> 00:32:57,208
Edmond Tang

553
00:32:57,208 --> 00:33:00,833
Edmond Tang?! Alex has said that

554
00:33:00,833 --> 00:33:04,625
he uses fitter paper when going to the toilet

555
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:05,875
What does that mean?

556
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:07,250
No dregs remain!

557
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,958
He's a bad guy!

558
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:11,417
But it's a commonplace in the business world!

559
00:33:11,417 --> 00:33:13,542
Alex loses just because he's not cunning enough

560
00:33:13,542 --> 00:33:15,583
Anyway I'll be careful

561
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:18,667
Mom, didn't you say that you want to get a job?

562
00:33:18,667 --> 00:33:20,667
How about working with me

563
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:25,917
I just know cookery
I know nothing about bullion!

564
00:33:25,917 --> 00:33:27,958
It's easy I can show you the way

565
00:33:27,958 --> 00:33:30,125
Frist of all, you must change your attitude

566
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:31,958
We're not speculating!

567
00:33:31,958 --> 00:33:34,875
We just earn commission
by teaching others to invest

568
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:36,792
We can even earn profit
from the price difference

569
00:33:36,792 --> 00:33:39,542
In a word, we do in and out
for the clients and earn money

570
00:33:39,542 --> 00:33:41,792
How to do in and out for the clients?

571
00:33:41,792 --> 00:33:44,833
Out is selling, in is buying

572
00:33:44,833 --> 00:33:47,000
Going in and out means buying and selling

573
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,292
All in all it's easy, Just follow me

574
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,708
Really?

575
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:54,500
Good morning, Mr. Cock!

576
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,125
Good morning, Mrs. Mao

577
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:58,000
My new husband's last name is Lui

578
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,458
Oh sorry, I don't know you get married again

579
00:34:00,458 --> 00:34:02,542
There's not much difference whether

580
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:03,792
You're Mrs. Mao of Mrs. Lui

581
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,792
I've got something nice for you today

582
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:08,792
Tsou-Cze hen, twenty-five bucks for one

583
00:34:08,792 --> 00:34:10,583
Good for you, Mrs. Mao

584
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:12,542
Oh! What's his last name?

585
00:34:12,542 --> 00:34:13,958
Lui!

586
00:34:13,958 --> 00:34:16,333
Yeah! Good for your daughter too!

587
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:17,583
So terrific!

588
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:22,375
Mom, sales should be active

589
00:34:23,542 --> 00:34:25,208
Shall we have one more?

590
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:29,417
Mom, we've here to sell gold, not to buy hens

591
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:32,667
Buying hen? I offer you a special price!

592
00:34:32,667 --> 00:34:35,000
Mr. Cock, you often give me a discount

593
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,500
How about I give you one this time

594
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,417
I'm a sales rep in a bullion agency now

595
00:34:39,417 --> 00:34:40,875
What rep?

596
00:34:40,917 --> 00:34:44,083
That's speculating in bullion,
foreign currency etc

597
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:46,833
Mom, Not speculating its investment!

598
00:34:46,833 --> 00:34:47,708
Isn't there any difference?

599
00:34:47,708 --> 00:34:48,833
Of course there is

600
00:34:48,833 --> 00:34:50,792
Speculation calls for luck, whereas investment
calls for strategy and tactics

601
00:34:50,792 --> 00:34:53,625
She is professional,
I'm still learning from her

602
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:57,875
It's true! We have many
investment items for you to choose from

603
00:34:57,875 --> 00:35:00,125
Such as gold, foreign currencies

604
00:35:00,125 --> 00:35:03,083
I don't know what you're talking about

605
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:05,125
It's simply say for an example

606
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,292
Bullion trading if the price stays still,

607
00:35:07,292 --> 00:35:10,708
it's called Cow market

608
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:12,875
If it is fluctuates greatly,

609
00:35:12,875 --> 00:35:15,167
it's called Bear Market

610
00:35:15,167 --> 00:35:17,000
If you want to make a fortune

611
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,250
You can buy and sell in the 'Bear Market'

612
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,833
I don't know anything
about 'Cow and Bear Market'.

613
00:35:20,833 --> 00:35:23,000
In a word if you lose you'll
get a 'whole foot of cow shit'

614
00:35:23,125 --> 00:35:24,708
It's not so easy to lose money?
We have many professionals

615
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:28,500
Computers, and graphs to help you

616
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,500
The prosperity of HK
depends on various speculation

617
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,667
Look

618
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:34,667
Mom, I've said it's not speculation

619
00:35:34,667 --> 00:35:36,208
Right! You won't lose
if you're not speculating!

620
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:37,833
Look at these graphs!

621
00:35:37,833 --> 00:35:40,750
There've many experts
PhDs working for our company

622
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:43,958
We're selling hen. We have no money to invest

623
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:46,458
You can invest with a small sum of money

624
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:49,458
As we were just engaging in margin'
We profit from the price difference

625
00:35:49,458 --> 00:35:50,542
How much must I invest?

626
00:35:50,542 --> 00:35:52,500
Ten thousand for 'ONE DAY'
Fifty thousand for "OVERNIGHT"

627
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,292
Overnight with you?

628
00:35:53,292 --> 00:35:54,958
Or with this little girl?

629
00:35:55,167 --> 00:35:58,625
Don't think astray
"ONE DAY" means settling daily

630
00:35:58,625 --> 00:36:01,208
Whereas ' OVERNIGHT' means
setting once every 2 or 3 days

631
00:36:01,208 --> 00:36:04,000
How much do you want
to invest? Come on, sign this

632
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,375
Vivian, explain it to him

633
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,875
This coequal is given to me by the clients

634
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:11,958
Please divide the amount among you guys

635
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:14,667
BCC's again?

636
00:36:15,417 --> 00:36:17,375
Now, even the salary is deprived!

637
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:18,917
What do you mean?

638
00:36:18,917 --> 00:36:20,458
Close the company!

639
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:28,667
What's the matter?

640
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:31,458
There're two ducks in the bath tub

641
00:36:31,792 --> 00:36:33,750
Haven't you seen ducks before?

642
00:36:33,833 --> 00:36:36,333
I've never seen people
doing business like you do

643
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:38,875
There should be a two way trading in business

644
00:36:38,875 --> 00:36:41,125
Can these ducks can be eaten, and

645
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:43,500
Can also be reared to lay eggs

646
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,958
They can be kept if you eat them all at once

647
00:36:45,958 --> 00:36:48,958
You ought to be more frugal like I am!

648
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:51,417
So if you meet a coffin trader,
you ask him to buy gold

649
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:52,292
And you get

650
00:36:52,292 --> 00:36:53,917
Don't say such a thing! Open the door first!

651
00:36:58,583 --> 00:36:59,625
Who are you looking for?

652
00:36:59,625 --> 00:37:01,667
Is it Flat D, 4/F, Lui's home?

653
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,667
Hey police!

654
00:37:12,917 --> 00:37:15,542
Parking is allowed here.
Why did you tow away my car?

655
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:17,750
We didn't!

656
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,292
So that's theft

657
00:37:19,375 --> 00:37:21,625
Hey you!

658
00:37:22,917 --> 00:37:26,292
Why do you stand here? My car is stolen,
don't you go and catch the thie!

659
00:37:26,292 --> 00:37:28,083
What kind of cop you're?

660
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:34,833
Is this your car, Little Beard?

661
00:37:35,167 --> 00:37:37,500
Mind you, there's jurisdiction in Hong Kong

662
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,500
Hong Kong Law is one should pay his creditors

663
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,375
You haven't paid five installments
so we towed away your car

664
00:37:43,292 --> 00:37:44,708
Mr. Lui Mr. Lui

665
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:46,458
You've got to go back at once,

666
00:37:46,458 --> 00:37:48,083
big heads from Tai Fung are in our office

667
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:49,375
They said if you don't settle the money today,

668
00:37:49,375 --> 00:37:51,042
they'll call the police!

669
00:37:51,042 --> 00:37:54,208
I'm cop! Who does you want to get?

670
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:03,250
You're home? Sit down for the dinner

671
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,000
Vivian dinner's ready

672
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,417
-My car has been towed away!
-Really?

673
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:15,417
It's fine less to feed!

674
00:38:15,417 --> 00:38:16,958
Let me do it

675
00:38:20,958 --> 00:38:23,708
It's ready, come on!

676
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:27,792
What is it? Are we celebrating?

677
00:38:28,417 --> 00:38:31,000
Come on, this one's for you

678
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,875
Have another piece?

679
00:38:33,875 --> 00:38:35,667
What's going on?

680
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:39,542
Last Supper!

681
00:38:42,708 --> 00:38:44,333
Who are you two

682
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:46,375
Bailiff, come to seal the house

683
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:47,792
Don't worry about them

684
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:48,833
Come on, let's eat

685
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:51,500
Is there a mistake? What's wrong with you?

686
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,542
Talk to the court,

687
00:38:52,542 --> 00:38:54,417
we're just doing our duty

688
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:56,625
But why are you taking pictures?

689
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:59,167
We have to take pictures
for whatever it is in this flat

690
00:38:59,542 --> 00:39:01,792
Alex, take it easy! We've moving anyway

691
00:39:01,792 --> 00:39:03,750
Why don't we enjoy and finish our meal?

692
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:06,083
Come on... Let's go in with our meal!

693
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:10,292
Hey!

694
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,125
Don't be so!

695
00:39:12,125 --> 00:39:13,083
OK!

696
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:14,458
What's the matter?

697
00:39:15,875 --> 00:39:19,750
Do we have to move out after this meal?

698
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:20,833
Right

699
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:28,208
Would you mind taking a picture

700
00:39:28,417 --> 00:39:30,167
For us?

701
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:31,375
Sure!

702
00:40:06,458 --> 00:40:08,125
Do you really mean to treat me this way?

703
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:11,833
It's so big here.
Can't I stay here for a night?

704
00:40:22,375 --> 00:40:25,292
How can you prefer to be
with a dog than being with me?

705
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,333
This is a male dog!

706
00:40:29,167 --> 00:40:30,875
That's even worse

707
00:40:33,167 --> 00:40:36,458
Did you send this dog to deep track of me?

708
00:40:36,875 --> 00:40:38,458
Do I need to do that?

709
00:40:38,458 --> 00:40:41,750
You'll always come back here whenever you go

710
00:40:42,625 --> 00:40:44,833
So you know where to find me

711
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:52,917
Oh, look! It's jealous!

712
00:40:54,667 --> 00:40:55,833
Are you cold?

713
00:40:59,042 --> 00:41:01,042
Hey! I'm jealous too

714
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:03,083
Didn't you say you'll sleep in a friend's home?

715
00:41:03,083 --> 00:41:04,875
I miss you low so I called up aunt

716
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:06,583
And she said you've left

717
00:41:06,583 --> 00:41:08,500
How do you know we're here?

718
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,875
You love to come here

719
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:11,625
Where else can you go?

720
00:41:11,625 --> 00:41:12,500
You're so Clever!

721
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,458
I feel very cold!

722
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:14,917
I know!

723
00:41:21,375 --> 00:41:22,500
Hi! Sir!

724
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:25,417
You're so bad!

725
00:41:25,417 --> 00:41:26,458
Why do you look so beautiful today?

726
00:41:26,458 --> 00:41:29,292
Your daughter is waiting for you in your room!

727
00:41:29,583 --> 00:41:30,792
Thanks

728
00:41:36,375 --> 00:41:38,750
Why do you read this stuff?

729
00:41:39,167 --> 00:41:40,708
It's yours

730
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:44,333
Why do you come here?

731
00:41:44,333 --> 00:41:46,625
Papa, I've got something to discuss with you

732
00:41:46,625 --> 00:41:49,083
Be frankly, my daughter, how much do you want?

733
00:41:49,083 --> 00:41:51,250
I'm not asking for money!

734
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:53,625
I just want to
live in your flat for a short time

735
00:41:54,042 --> 00:41:55,417
Living in my flat?

736
00:41:55,417 --> 00:41:57,208
It's because a quarrel with Mom?

737
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:00,750
Or because your
step-father did anything on you?

738
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:03,208
That Little Beard,
I've known he's guy at first sight!

739
00:42:03,208 --> 00:42:04,083
Any eye-Witness?

740
00:42:04,083 --> 00:42:05,375
If there's enough evidence, I'll get him

741
00:42:05,375 --> 00:42:07,167
Beat him to death! OK!

742
00:42:07,167 --> 00:42:09,917
BCC s liquidated. Alex's flat is taken away

743
00:42:09,917 --> 00:42:12,000
We've homeless now

744
00:42:12,625 --> 00:42:13,708
So fine?

745
00:42:13,958 --> 00:42:15,708
My old Pa!

746
00:42:15,708 --> 00:42:17,083
You and your mom can move in

747
00:42:17,083 --> 00:42:19,333
But that Little Beard cannot! OK!

748
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:20,917
Why?

749
00:42:20,917 --> 00:42:23,667
You're grown up now;
can't you just use your brain to think it out?

750
00:42:23,667 --> 00:42:25,042
How a man can be so generous

751
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,083
as to give his daughter, his wife

752
00:42:26,083 --> 00:42:28,583
-and his house to another man?
-Don't you care about me?

753
00:42:28,583 --> 00:42:31,458
My daughter!
If I give you the flat, where shall I live?

754
00:42:33,125 --> 00:42:34,625
Before you got the divorce,

755
00:42:34,625 --> 00:42:36,125
you always said that you're busy busy

756
00:42:36,125 --> 00:42:38,375
So you didn't come home for the night!

757
00:42:38,375 --> 00:42:40,708
Only mom and I was in the flat

758
00:42:41,417 --> 00:42:43,958
So you won't know
if there's another one in the flat!

759
00:42:44,708 --> 00:42:46,583
So it's okay if
you can take it as the past, and

760
00:42:46,583 --> 00:42:48,917
not to come back to sleep

761
00:42:49,708 --> 00:42:50,917
No way! Go away, I've much work to do

762
00:42:50,917 --> 00:42:53,583
No! Unless you promise me!

763
00:42:53,583 --> 00:42:54,250
If you don't promise me,

764
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:56,583
I'll sit here and sleep here

765
00:42:56,583 --> 00:42:59,208
Do you really mean to do this? As you like!

766
00:43:00,042 --> 00:43:01,167
Hello!

767
00:43:01,875 --> 00:43:02,750
Nancy!

768
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,583
Hi, it's been a long time to hear your voice!

769
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:06,583
Where do you usually have tea recently?

770
00:43:07,542 --> 00:43:09,000
Don't be so naughty!

771
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,708
I'm talking in the phone!

772
00:43:12,833 --> 00:43:17,333
Hei, is it Nancy?
Nothing it's just disconnected

773
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,750
Tell me, where you want to have tea

774
00:43:21,917 --> 00:43:23,042
Hello

775
00:43:24,208 --> 00:43:25,208
You're so bad now!

776
00:43:25,208 --> 00:43:27,333
Does the Little Beard teach you so?

777
00:43:27,333 --> 00:43:28,875
Don't you think I'll beat you?

778
00:43:29,208 --> 00:43:30,667
OK! Come on, beat me dead!

779
00:43:30,667 --> 00:43:32,250
Beat me dead so
I don't have to wander in the street

780
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:34,667
So I don't have to be
forced to go astray, to be a prostitute

781
00:43:36,417 --> 00:43:38,917
Hello! Yes... yes

782
00:43:39,292 --> 00:43:41,000
It doesn't matter

783
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,750
I'm exercise...

784
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,750
Don't come again

785
00:43:49,167 --> 00:43:50,750
What are you two doing?

786
00:43:53,042 --> 00:43:54,000
Hi! Sir!

787
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,167
Excuse me

788
00:43:55,167 --> 00:43:56,292
My daughter!

789
00:43:56,292 --> 00:43:59,125
She's your daughter of your girl?

790
00:43:59,417 --> 00:44:01,208
He's really my old Pa

791
00:44:01,917 --> 00:44:06,208
It's so nice that we meet again.
So we're a little bit too excited!

792
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,458
You Hen (whore)
killing superintendent is so smart!

793
00:44:08,458 --> 00:44:11,083
Kill even you own daughter!

794
00:44:18,625 --> 00:44:20,167
Mom, this way

795
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:23,167
I always tell you not to
engage in property speculation

796
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,583
And it is of use this time

797
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:25,917
This flat's owner has just gone for a trip

798
00:44:25,917 --> 00:44:28,083
And won't be back for two to three months

799
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:29,708
I've kept it without letting it out

800
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:31,375
Let's live here for the time being

801
00:44:31,583 --> 00:44:32,792
In Hong Kong,

802
00:44:32,792 --> 00:44:35,542
there've flats without occupiers,
and people without flats to live in

803
00:44:47,792 --> 00:44:52,458
Wo! I'm sure the owner is a playboy

804
00:44:52,458 --> 00:44:54,333
He must be a bad guy!

805
00:45:01,875 --> 00:45:03,417
This guy is abnormal!

806
00:45:03,417 --> 00:45:05,167
How did you know him?

807
00:45:05,167 --> 00:45:07,125
Don't let him get anything from you!

808
00:45:07,125 --> 00:45:09,292
I have never!

809
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,500
But I think you have!

810
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:22,167
How is Alex?

811
00:45:24,083 --> 00:45:25,375
Fine!

812
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:29,167
Why do I feel the things so familiar with here

813
00:45:32,208 --> 00:45:34,083
It tastes like

814
00:45:35,083 --> 00:45:36,667
VIVIAN!

815
00:45:40,333 --> 00:45:42,000
You must tell me,

816
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,167
whose flat this is?

817
00:45:44,292 --> 00:45:45,792
You've know the answer!

818
00:45:45,792 --> 00:45:49,875
You're old Pa!
There'll be trouble if Alex knows it!

819
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:52,708
What's problem
for Dad to live in Old Pa's flat?

820
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,125
We can't afford to hotel room,

821
00:45:54,125 --> 00:45:56,667
where else shall we live?

822
00:45:56,667 --> 00:45:59,458
But it's not good to live under other roof

823
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:00,833
Mom, don't worry,

824
00:46:00,833 --> 00:46:02,875
I'll put all Old Pa's things away

825
00:46:07,625 --> 00:46:09,708
Why do this flat have

826
00:46:09,708 --> 00:46:11,750
A taste that I hate!

827
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:13,958
Yes! I also smell it!

828
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:25,125
What are you doing?

829
00:46:25,125 --> 00:46:26,333
Little Tang!

830
00:46:26,333 --> 00:46:28,833
It's been a whole year!
And you haven't arranged the money for me

831
00:46:28,833 --> 00:46:32,042
I tell you, I'll be
transferred back to Beijing soon

832
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:33,833
I know, Uncle

833
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:38,708
When USSR was broken up recently,
the gold price fluctuates greatly

834
00:46:39,083 --> 00:46:41,667
We've made a good fortune,
we don't wanna close down

835
00:46:41,667 --> 00:46:42,458
Close down!?

836
00:46:42,458 --> 00:46:43,083
I tell you,

837
00:46:43,083 --> 00:46:45,125
if you close this down you can open another

838
00:46:45,125 --> 00:46:49,167
Damn you! I wouldn't have
invested in this company if I'd known this

839
00:46:49,167 --> 00:46:51,125
Do you think I don't love money?

840
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:54,083
I have 3/10 share out of the ten millions?

841
00:46:54,083 --> 00:46:55,208
Don't worry

842
00:46:55,208 --> 00:46:57,292
I'll close it down once. I find a scapegoat

843
00:46:57,292 --> 00:47:00,417
OK. Please do it as soon as possible!

844
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,667
What're you doing madam?

845
00:47:02,667 --> 00:47:03,583
Keeping everything

846
00:47:03,583 --> 00:47:05,917
And hold up all lines, how can we buy in?

847
00:47:05,917 --> 00:47:08,083
It's all yours, we have nothing can do!

848
00:47:09,583 --> 00:47:12,500
62, keep it 61 keep it,

849
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,167
60 also keep it?

850
00:47:14,167 --> 00:47:15,542
59 also keep it?

851
00:47:15,542 --> 00:47:16,625
Mom, the market is sliding

852
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,000
Why do you buy so much?

853
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,042
You can't say this way!

854
00:47:19,042 --> 00:47:20,958
When I bought this wedding ring

855
00:47:20,958 --> 00:47:24,375
The gold price is $3,800 a tael,
the current price is $3,259

856
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:26,250
It's cheap, I've got to buy some!

857
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:28,333
Madam, you know what it is?

858
00:47:28,333 --> 00:47:29,833
It's very dangerous

859
00:47:29,833 --> 00:47:30,958
to get so much!

860
00:47:30,958 --> 00:47:33,750
Don't listen to him he's a bastard!

861
00:47:34,917 --> 00:47:36,583
What shall we do now?

862
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:39,375
Sell it buy it again later if the price is good

863
00:47:39,375 --> 00:47:41,875
Shit! The pork stall owner
has lost a great deal!

864
00:47:41,875 --> 00:47:43,375
We've said, if he loses

865
00:47:43,375 --> 00:47:44,958
He'll kill me!

866
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,458
But it's common to have price
fluctuations in the gold market

867
00:47:48,625 --> 00:47:49,625
What's the matter?

868
00:47:49,625 --> 00:47:50,708
Mr. Tang

869
00:47:50,708 --> 00:47:53,250
Boss!

870
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:54,500
This Madam knows nothing

871
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,667
trade in a much manner

872
00:47:55,667 --> 00:47:57,750
What shit are you saying? She's my friend

873
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:58,708
Mr. Tang

874
00:47:58,708 --> 00:48:03,083
I find that I'm not
so suitable for this business

875
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:05,250
I'm afraid I've to resign

876
00:48:05,708 --> 00:48:07,375
Don't you really need to do?

877
00:48:07,375 --> 00:48:09,625
Let's have a chat, come on

878
00:48:12,125 --> 00:48:14,000
Mr. tang, its URGENT

879
00:48:15,167 --> 00:48:17,333
Ngao, give me a coffee

880
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:26,250
Uncle, what's the matter? Something missing?

881
00:48:27,958 --> 00:48:32,208
OK! I'll ask Ming
to get you something better tonight

882
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:33,958
See you

883
00:48:36,542 --> 00:48:38,042
Mr. Tang, it's coffee

884
00:48:38,042 --> 00:48:39,042
What?

885
00:48:39,042 --> 00:48:40,833
You asked me to give you a coffee!

886
00:48:40,833 --> 00:48:42,000
Me?

887
00:48:44,333 --> 00:48:45,750
You're called Ngao!

888
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:47,167
That maid is also called Ngao

889
00:48:47,167 --> 00:48:48,958
Such a coincidence!

890
00:48:48,958 --> 00:48:50,625
Can I call you

891
00:48:50,625 --> 00:48:52,667
Call me Mrs. Lui or Miss Chu

892
00:48:52,667 --> 00:48:53,667
Any English name?

893
00:48:53,667 --> 00:48:55,958
Yes! Judy!

894
00:48:56,625 --> 00:49:00,333
Judy! It sounds silly, it fits you!

895
00:49:00,333 --> 00:49:03,000
Just a joke... Sit down first

896
00:49:04,208 --> 00:49:06,833
Judy, even if you find
this job isn't suitable for you

897
00:49:06,833 --> 00:49:08,333
You don't have to resign

898
00:49:08,333 --> 00:49:11,042
You're honest and reliable

899
00:49:11,042 --> 00:49:13,667
I just need such a person to help me

900
00:49:13,667 --> 00:49:16,917
OK. I promote you to be Assistant to Director

901
00:49:26,167 --> 00:49:27,583
Two pictures

300 bucks the you'll have the interview at once

903
00:49:34,292 --> 00:49:36,833
30 bucks one week to want for the reply

904
00:49:36,833 --> 00:49:38,208
Should I pay you?

905
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:39,875
It's up to you

906
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:50,500
Next one

907
00:49:56,583 --> 00:49:57,750
Thank you

908
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:04,125
Come in

909
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,958
Hi! Alex, it's really you!

910
00:50:08,958 --> 00:50:11,542
Let me introduced to you my partner, Frankie

911
00:50:11,833 --> 00:50:13,292
Glad to meet you!

912
00:50:13,292 --> 00:50:15,625
Alex, he's got a creative mind!

913
00:50:15,625 --> 00:50:16,833
Don't be misted by his artless look

914
00:50:16,833 --> 00:50:18,458
I was his subordinate

915
00:50:18,458 --> 00:50:20,625
His brain can compensate
for the brains of thirty persons

916
00:50:20,625 --> 00:50:23,083
We were no match to him! Sit ... Sit down

917
00:50:23,083 --> 00:50:25,542
We're just discussing on the grape's ads

918
00:50:25,542 --> 00:50:27,333
Give us a good idea

919
00:50:27,333 --> 00:50:29,417
It needs a test anyway

920
00:50:29,417 --> 00:50:31,417
Ten minutes! Ten minutes. OK?

921
00:50:31,417 --> 00:50:33,583
We go out for a while! Remember ten minutes!

922
00:50:36,375 --> 00:50:39,083
Don't eat all the grapes! They're just props

923
00:51:03,042 --> 00:51:05,042
How is it? OK?

924
00:51:05,167 --> 00:51:06,292
OK!

925
00:51:08,167 --> 00:51:09,958
Let me look at it

926
00:51:14,625 --> 00:51:18,583
Are you joking? This is an idea?

927
00:51:19,417 --> 00:51:22,042
You've been so excellent
in the past, how come now?

928
00:51:22,042 --> 00:51:23,667
Your performance is so bad,

929
00:51:23,667 --> 00:51:25,542
How can't employ you?

930
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:31,417
Frankie, you see, it's okay. It's not bad

931
00:51:31,417 --> 00:51:34,125
It's okay? Alright, you try it, come on, try it

932
00:51:34,375 --> 00:51:37,125
How? There should be some dancers

933
00:51:37,125 --> 00:51:39,875
Then our dance how can I
know the effect if you don't

934
00:51:41,625 --> 00:51:43,375
I've drawn it out

935
00:51:43,375 --> 00:51:47,000
Am I also to draw to show to my client?
You've got to show it in action

936
00:51:47,125 --> 00:51:48,958
If the brain is grown in your asshole

937
00:51:50,292 --> 00:51:51,500
Just don't use it

938
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,083
That note-book is mine!

939
00:51:54,875 --> 00:51:56,417
Sorry, I've to go now

940
00:51:59,833 --> 00:52:01,583
Hey... How about my 300 bucks?

941
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,833
300 bucks It's gone! Have a grape, come on

942
00:52:15,792 --> 00:52:17,542
That guy is really great!

943
00:52:17,542 --> 00:52:18,750
Of course!

944
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:20,750
I've said he's a genius!

945
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:21,958
Produce the ads on it!

946
00:52:32,625 --> 00:52:35,958
I've good news! I've got a promotion

947
00:52:35,958 --> 00:52:37,833
Assistant to Director

948
00:52:38,833 --> 00:52:40,500
Don't you feel happy for me?

949
00:52:43,875 --> 00:52:45,458
Take a grape!

950
00:52:49,292 --> 00:52:50,958
So sour!

951
00:52:51,667 --> 00:52:53,333
I mean the grape, not you

952
00:52:53,333 --> 00:52:56,667
Alex doesn't know fruits. He must be cheated!

953
00:52:56,667 --> 00:52:59,917
The fruit hawker nearby often cheats people!

954
00:52:59,917 --> 00:53:04,542
The most honest is the shop No 9
near our previous apartment

955
00:53:05,125 --> 00:53:07,292
Such a sour grape, how much for a pound?

956
00:53:08,125 --> 00:53:09,250
Three hundred bucks!

957
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:10,500
What?

958
00:53:11,208 --> 00:53:14,500
If you love grapes, I'll get you some everyday

959
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:15,542
Mom, I'm hungry,

960
00:53:15,542 --> 00:53:16,958
Are we going out to dine?

961
00:53:16,958 --> 00:53:20,250
I'm not cooking this evening
I'd like to have a celebration

962
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:23,250
So we are going out to have a pretty nice meal

963
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:25,333
I'm not going

964
00:53:25,333 --> 00:53:26,625
You don't like it?

965
00:53:28,875 --> 00:53:30,792
He's angry with me!

966
00:53:30,917 --> 00:53:34,667
Oh yes! I forgot
to ask him how the interview is

967
00:53:34,667 --> 00:53:36,333
It surely goes into failure!

968
00:53:38,208 --> 00:53:42,292
Well, I just prepare
the dinner and wait for you back

969
00:53:42,292 --> 00:53:43,583
It's ready; I don't want to waste it!

970
00:53:43,583 --> 00:53:44,625
You two can go out

971
00:53:44,625 --> 00:53:47,458
No! Sit down, let's have the dinner together

972
00:53:47,458 --> 00:53:49,542
It's warmer to eat at home!

973
00:53:49,542 --> 00:53:51,375
I didn't know that Alex knows how to cook!

974
00:53:51,375 --> 00:53:53,375
Just like a house-husband!

975
00:53:55,292 --> 00:53:56,458
OK

976
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,167
How is it? Still can't get a job

977
00:54:40,167 --> 00:54:42,667
I won't depend on you

978
00:54:58,542 --> 00:54:59,833
Come in

979
00:55:01,167 --> 00:55:02,500
Please close the door for me

980
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,667
And also hang down the blinds

981
00:55:08,125 --> 00:55:09,333
Please sit

982
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,875
What's the matter?

983
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:14,792
Nothing, how do you feel about me?

984
00:55:14,792 --> 00:55:17,750
Quite food, willing to help others

985
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,625
You have to do something for yourself

986
00:55:20,625 --> 00:55:22,625
How can you be so conservative?

987
00:55:22,625 --> 00:55:25,458
I have my own principles to follow

988
00:55:25,458 --> 00:55:27,750
I don't rely on any sideways

989
00:55:28,042 --> 00:55:30,292
If you haven't got the capability,
you wouldn't have been in that position

990
00:55:30,292 --> 00:55:35,125
However, you'll be
left behind if you're too conservative

991
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:36,917
Take off the clothes

992
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,417
Take off the clothes?

993
00:55:38,417 --> 00:55:40,083
Take off the clothes so that
I can see it more clearly

994
00:55:40,083 --> 00:55:43,417
ET you've mistaken! I'm not that type of woman

995
00:55:43,417 --> 00:55:44,542
What?

996
00:55:44,542 --> 00:55:46,125
How can you dress this way?

997
00:55:46,125 --> 00:55:49,333
You don't look like a senior executive?

998
00:55:49,333 --> 00:55:52,208
My opinion is that you should
buy some more beautiful clothes

999
00:55:52,875 --> 00:55:54,292
Your opinion, buy some beautiful clothes?

1000
00:55:54,292 --> 00:55:55,375
Yes!

1001
00:55:55,417 --> 00:55:56,542
Please!

1002
00:55:56,875 --> 00:55:57,625
Sorry

1003
00:55:57,625 --> 00:56:00,250
Having an hour's freight,
it's time to change the clothes

1004
00:56:00,708 --> 00:56:02,250
Yes, the company is going to sponsor you

1005
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:04,250
ten thousands as
clothing allowance, is it enough

1006
00:56:04,708 --> 00:56:06,667
Yes! It's enough!

1007
00:56:06,667 --> 00:56:09,500
Go the hair salon,
and buy some pretty clothes

1008
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:10,500
Don't make me lose face!

1009
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:11,667
Right

1010
00:56:25,917 --> 00:56:27,083
Is it beautiful?

1011
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:28,208
Yes!

1012
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:30,708
But you haven't look at me!

1013
00:56:32,917 --> 00:56:34,708
I've been looking at you all night

1014
00:56:34,708 --> 00:56:35,917
You stay a whole night with me,

1015
00:56:35,917 --> 00:56:38,250
But you've never look at me!

1016
00:56:38,917 --> 00:56:42,000
I've bought a dress
to show you it's very beautiful

1017
00:56:45,667 --> 00:56:47,042
Does it look good?

1018
00:56:47,208 --> 00:56:51,958
ET said that I'll have ten thousand
as clothing allowance every month

1019
00:56:51,958 --> 00:56:53,542
He also said

1020
00:56:53,542 --> 00:56:57,125
That pig head is a bad guy.

1021
00:56:57,375 --> 00:56:59,125
You're jealous

1022
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:00,958
You've mad!

1023
00:57:01,625 --> 00:57:04,375
You don't want me t work?

1024
00:57:04,792 --> 00:57:07,083
No, certainly not

1025
00:57:07,875 --> 00:57:11,125
At least you have money
to buy the slippers for me!

1026
00:57:11,375 --> 00:57:13,875
I've been working

1027
00:57:14,125 --> 00:57:17,625
You don't know much,
but you get a promotion in such a short time

1028
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,917
Be more cautious

1029
00:57:19,917 --> 00:57:21,708
I can learn to do it

1030
00:57:21,708 --> 00:57:25,167
Also ET said that I'm honest and reliable

1031
00:57:25,167 --> 00:57:27,000
I can help him to watch over the company

1032
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,792
I've taken a course in Economics

1033
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:44,500
Mr. Tang, you've come in?

1034
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,667
Call me ET, we've known each other!

1035
00:57:46,667 --> 00:57:48,500
ET I'd like to ask

1036
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:52,083
Why did you promote me to be Managing Director?

1037
00:57:52,083 --> 00:57:54,292
I often have business trips here and there

1038
00:57:54,292 --> 00:57:57,125
I need a trustworthy person
to manage the business

1039
00:57:57,125 --> 00:57:58,500
That's the only reason

1040
00:57:58,500 --> 00:57:59,417
But!

1041
00:57:59,417 --> 00:58:01,708
I know your pressure is getting greater

1042
00:58:01,708 --> 00:58:05,333
But I'm confident of myself never judge wrongly

1043
00:58:05,542 --> 00:58:07,750
Mr. Tang, excuse me, it's urgent

1044
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:10,042
Just take it as if I'm not in the office

1045
00:58:10,375 --> 00:58:11,458
Sorry

1046
00:58:11,458 --> 00:58:13,333
Managing Director, excuse me

1047
00:58:13,333 --> 00:58:14,542
You put it down first

1048
00:58:14,542 --> 00:58:15,750
But it's urgent!

1049
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:16,750
You should know that

1050
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:18,875
everyone gets different styles

1051
00:58:18,875 --> 00:58:21,417
And I used to sign without reading anything

1052
00:58:21,417 --> 00:58:23,167
Miss Chu is different,

1053
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:24,417
so if it's really urgent

1054
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:25,667
Explain it clearly to her

1055
00:58:25,667 --> 00:58:28,542
Yes, I'm sorry Miss Chu, this letter is

1056
00:58:28,542 --> 00:58:31,250
OK, OK. I sign first!

1057
00:58:32,167 --> 00:58:33,458
Thank you

1058
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:37,792
Signing is just a routine

1059
00:58:37,792 --> 00:58:40,500
All our staff are top guys

1060
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,125
You don't have to be so anxious

1061
00:58:42,125 --> 00:58:44,042
I know what to do?

1062
00:58:44,042 --> 00:58:45,792
I go first!

1063
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,708
Boss!

1064
00:58:53,125 --> 00:58:55,500
Managing Director,
let me explain this document to you

1065
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:56,792
It's okay, OK

1066
00:59:00,167 --> 00:59:02,458
There's one more at the back, please

1067
00:59:02,667 --> 00:59:04,292
Here, please

1068
00:59:04,292 --> 00:59:06,542
-OK?
-OK! Thanks, sorry for troubling you!

1069
00:59:17,458 --> 00:59:19,708
Hello, you want to
speak to Ah Man? Just a moment

1070
00:59:19,708 --> 00:59:21,167
Ah Man your call

1071
00:59:21,917 --> 00:59:23,167
Thanks

1072
00:59:24,042 --> 00:59:24,750
Hello!

1073
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:27,542
What? You damn drunkard

1074
00:59:27,542 --> 00:59:29,375
Going around in the bar at daytime?

1075
00:59:29,375 --> 00:59:32,833
I'm working as a collie in the bar I'm dying

1076
00:59:32,833 --> 00:59:35,333
You're lucky to have a brilliant wife!

1077
00:59:35,333 --> 00:59:36,458
If I don't work

1078
00:59:36,458 --> 00:59:38,750
My wife would have to be
a whore bring up the little spirits

1079
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:40,208
Whore, drunkard and little spirits

1080
00:59:40,208 --> 00:59:42,042
Do you think it's the red light zone?

1081
01:00:33,625 --> 01:00:34,958
Hi Alex

1082
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:38,875
Hi! Come in

1083
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:47,000
What do you want?

1084
01:00:50,792 --> 01:00:51,958
Sit down

1085
01:00:55,292 --> 01:00:57,625
What's the matter?

1086
01:00:57,625 --> 01:01:00,208
I'd like to help me with an ads

1087
01:01:01,458 --> 01:01:02,458
OK

1088
01:01:03,083 --> 01:01:05,583
But you've to go to Macau for a few days

1089
01:01:08,708 --> 01:01:09,833
No problem!

1090
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:10,958
What are you looking at?

1091
01:01:11,875 --> 01:01:13,542
Are my legs beautiful?

1092
01:01:15,333 --> 01:01:17,208
Can you

1093
01:01:18,083 --> 01:01:20,167
Take off your shows and let me polish them?

1094
01:01:33,917 --> 01:01:36,792
This one has to be steamed for a while!

1095
01:01:50,042 --> 01:01:54,000
Hello! Is it Ah Man? I'm Suki.

1096
01:01:54,375 --> 01:01:55,958
What's happened to Alex?

1097
01:01:55,958 --> 01:01:57,208
He's been so strange!

1098
01:01:57,208 --> 01:02:00,958
What? He only took off
your shoes but not your clothes?

1099
01:02:01,125 --> 01:02:03,042
That's really strange?

1100
01:02:04,375 --> 01:02:06,125
Maybe it's because
his wife is brighter than him

1101
01:02:06,125 --> 01:02:09,250
He's self-abused and he channels
his irritation through shoe polishing

1102
01:02:09,417 --> 01:02:10,875
What is he doing now?

1103
01:02:10,875 --> 01:02:13,208
He's steaming my shoe?

1104
01:02:17,792 --> 01:02:19,625
Don't irritate him anymore!

1105
01:02:19,625 --> 01:02:22,708
Otherwise you may be the next one to steam!

1106
01:02:25,167 --> 01:02:26,500
It's been steamed clean!

1107
01:02:37,458 --> 01:02:39,375
Judy! Judy

1108
01:02:43,792 --> 01:02:45,083
Mr. Tang

1109
01:02:45,625 --> 01:02:46,833
Why is the driver absent today?

1110
01:02:46,833 --> 01:02:48,625
Why don't you ride on your car?

1111
01:02:48,625 --> 01:02:51,917
I have classes tonight till nine

1112
01:02:51,917 --> 01:02:53,000
You don't have to ask him to wait for me!

1113
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,917
Ah Shing is the company's driver

1114
01:02:54,917 --> 01:02:57,625
He can serve you anytime,
don't save money for the company

1115
01:02:57,625 --> 01:03:00,250
Oh, no, I just have an Economics lesson

1116
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:01,875
The teacher said that

1117
01:03:01,875 --> 01:03:04,125
It's useless to take Economics and Management

1118
01:03:04,125 --> 01:03:05,125
If your teacher is really so great,

1119
01:03:05,125 --> 01:03:07,458
why isn't he a General Manager?

1120
01:03:07,458 --> 01:03:09,542
The most important thing
is to be loyal to the company!

1121
01:03:09,542 --> 01:03:11,167
I'm Vv E R Y lo Y a I

1122
01:03:11,167 --> 01:03:13,417
Are you free now?
Maybe you can go back to office

1123
01:03:13,417 --> 01:03:15,625
And watch over the night shift staff for me

1124
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:18,542
But, I'm just learning more for the company

1125
01:03:18,542 --> 01:03:20,208
I just don't want you to learn too much

1126
01:03:20,208 --> 01:03:22,042
I mean I don't want you to waste too much time

1127
01:03:22,042 --> 01:03:25,542
Those commercial short courses are useless

1128
01:03:25,542 --> 01:03:27,833
You're the Managing Director

1129
01:03:27,833 --> 01:03:29,125
How can you give the time to study?

1130
01:03:29,125 --> 01:03:31,750
I've nothing to do in the office!

1131
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:33,667
I'm not so clear about many things

1132
01:03:33,667 --> 01:03:35,750
That's why I take a course to lean more

1133
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:38,333
Aren't you free now? Come on, get on the car

1134
01:03:47,708 --> 01:03:48,792
Come on please

1135
01:03:48,792 --> 01:03:52,625
Thank you Washroom
is the first one at left hand side

1136
01:03:54,375 --> 01:03:56,000
Who is coming?

1137
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:59,375
-What is it?
-Mrs. Lui

1138
01:03:59,667 --> 01:04:01,250
You've come!

1139
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:04,750
Alex, I feel envy of you!

1140
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:08,250
You have such a capable wife

1141
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:10,000
And I feel even more envy of you!

1142
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,125
You've married a husband who is

1143
01:04:11,125 --> 01:04:14,208
even more hard-working than my Philippine maid

1144
01:04:14,917 --> 01:04:16,750
Polish my shoes if you have time

1145
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:19,167
I won't shoe-shine for the one
who shoe shines for others!

1146
01:04:19,667 --> 01:04:21,375
Washroom is there

1147
01:04:24,917 --> 01:04:26,500
I'm going to change my clothes

1148
01:04:54,042 --> 01:04:56,792
You've to go out with ET, am I right?

1149
01:04:57,083 --> 01:04:58,833
Which shoes do you want to put on?

1150
01:04:58,833 --> 01:05:01,292
No, thanks, I can have this pair on

1151
01:05:01,292 --> 01:05:05,417
Oh no! This is too dirty, take it off
and I'll polish it up for you

1152
01:05:05,667 --> 01:05:08,792
Does Suki come to see you?

1153
01:05:09,708 --> 01:05:11,750
She has a job for me

1154
01:05:12,792 --> 01:05:14,333
Isn't it too good?

1155
01:05:14,625 --> 01:05:17,167
I've to go to Macau with her tomorrow

1156
01:05:17,167 --> 01:05:18,708
For how long?

1157
01:05:19,042 --> 01:05:20,542
Two to three days

1158
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:24,375
Do I have to pack things for you?

1159
01:05:28,417 --> 01:05:29,750
Let me polish it!

1160
01:06:00,875 --> 01:06:02,250
Excuse me, are you Miss Suki Wong?

1161
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:03,000
Yes, I'm

1162
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,583
Your call, over there

1163
01:06:04,583 --> 01:06:05,583
Thanks

1164
01:06:10,542 --> 01:06:11,708
Thanks

1165
01:06:13,417 --> 01:06:14,500
Hello!

1166
01:06:15,667 --> 01:06:18,083
What? How would it be that?

1167
01:06:20,792 --> 01:06:22,292
I'm sorry,

1168
01:06:22,292 --> 01:06:25,000
last night my client went to Zhu Hi

1169
01:06:26,458 --> 01:06:27,833
He called a whore?

1170
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:30,708
Yes! The police have taken him away!

1171
01:06:30,708 --> 01:06:32,958
So he'll be back a few days later!

1172
01:06:33,792 --> 01:06:35,083
He's so unlucky

1173
01:06:35,083 --> 01:06:36,500
It's me

1174
01:06:42,292 --> 01:06:43,250
I'm sorry

1175
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:46,167
for you've lost five hundred bucks

1176
01:06:46,167 --> 01:06:47,500
I feel bad, I'm so sorry,

1177
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:50,208
I hope you won't be angry at me

1178
01:06:50,208 --> 01:06:52,208
OK, let's make it this way, bye!

1179
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:53,000
Maybe next time

1180
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,708
How dare you! You even change my lock

1181
01:06:56,208 --> 01:06:57,625
What've you doing?

1182
01:06:58,833 --> 01:07:01,083
Nothing, just playing around

1183
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:03,750
Why do you come in such a heavy rain?

1184
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:05,250
I'm coming to get my passport

1185
01:07:06,083 --> 01:07:09,708
Old Pa! Fortunately
Alex has gone to Macau last night

1186
01:07:09,708 --> 01:07:12,667
Next time call us
before you come back, can't you?

1187
01:07:13,292 --> 01:07:15,583
I just come back my home;
do I have to give a cal first?

1188
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:17,500
Isn't it reasonable? This is my flat

1189
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:20,500
Do I have to apply for the court's permit?

1190
01:07:20,708 --> 01:07:22,250
What's your last name daughter?

1191
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:24,125
Are you on my side?

1192
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:28,000
Where're you going Old Pa?

1193
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,750
Where? I'm wet through,
I'm going to have a shower

1194
01:07:34,125 --> 01:07:36,458
Your passport has been kept up by mom

1195
01:07:36,458 --> 01:07:37,333
Don't touch the things

1196
01:07:37,333 --> 01:07:39,125
Alex hates people moving his things

1197
01:07:39,125 --> 01:07:40,875
Alex Its always Alex

1198
01:07:40,875 --> 01:07:43,542
If you say anything for the Little Beard again

1199
01:07:43,542 --> 01:07:45,083
I'll beat you!

1200
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:50,208
Hello! OK. I'll be right there

1201
01:07:50,958 --> 01:07:53,000
Old Pa, don't use Alex's towel!

1202
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,208
He doesn't like others using his things!

1203
01:07:56,375 --> 01:07:57,542
Mom, will be back soon,

1204
01:07:57,542 --> 01:07:59,083
tell her I've prepared the dinner

1205
01:07:59,083 --> 01:08:00,042
But I won't be back for it.

1206
01:08:00,042 --> 01:08:01,792
I'll be coming back late tonight

1207
01:08:26,083 --> 01:08:27,458
You're back?

1208
01:08:29,083 --> 01:08:30,458
It's raining heavily

1209
01:08:32,833 --> 01:08:35,958
Vivian has prepared the meal.

1210
01:08:39,708 --> 01:08:41,417
She was just mumbling

1211
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:43,125
She must be annoyed by someone

1212
01:08:43,917 --> 01:08:46,625
There's a fish in the refrigerator.
Steam it for you, OK?

1213
01:10:06,042 --> 01:10:07,458
What are you looking at?

1214
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:09,500
Never seen a man naked?

1215
01:10:09,625 --> 01:10:11,958
You're rude! You should knock the door first!

1216
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:17,250
What are you doing here?

1217
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:19,042
Why is he here?

1218
01:10:23,917 --> 01:10:25,833
Can't you hear I am asking him?

1219
01:10:25,833 --> 01:10:28,958
I thought you asked me why I am here!

1220
01:10:30,208 --> 01:10:32,000
The towel is mine!

1221
01:10:36,292 --> 01:10:38,000
So chicken-minded!

1222
01:10:40,917 --> 01:10:42,917
Haven't you seen that?!

1223
01:10:45,958 --> 01:10:48,917
Alex, I really don't know he has come

1224
01:10:48,917 --> 01:10:50,375
How do I know whether you know or not!

1225
01:10:50,375 --> 01:10:52,250
I only know that he has climbed up

1226
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:53,667
Climbing what? What are you talking about?

1227
01:10:53,667 --> 01:10:55,042
We have done nothing!

1228
01:10:55,042 --> 01:10:56,125
Nothing!

1229
01:10:56,125 --> 01:10:59,208
You're only in
your night wear, and he seems so tired

1230
01:10:59,208 --> 01:11:02,417
He has just had a bath.
And you look so pleasant

1231
01:11:02,417 --> 01:11:04,667
I've seen you two

1232
01:11:04,667 --> 01:11:06,625
You're with a naked man

1233
01:11:06,625 --> 01:11:07,958
How do I know what you were doing with him!

1234
01:11:07,958 --> 01:11:09,458
You and he also look so pleasant!

1235
01:11:09,458 --> 01:11:10,500
You also said so

1236
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:12,792
I've never let any man see my naked body

1237
01:11:12,792 --> 01:11:13,708
You are the first one!

1238
01:11:13,708 --> 01:11:14,917
Your boyfriend is so great!

1239
01:11:14,917 --> 01:11:16,042
He's not my boyfriend,

1240
01:11:16,042 --> 01:11:17,375
he's my husband!

1241
01:11:17,375 --> 01:11:18,417
Anyway,

1242
01:11:18,417 --> 01:11:22,333
He and I are cleaner
than the bleaching substance

1243
01:11:22,583 --> 01:11:26,000
To be frank, 
I've had an affair with her!

1244
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,500
But it's in the past!

1245
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:29,000
Since you two had an affair,

1246
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,083
it seems that our relation ship

1247
01:11:30,083 --> 01:11:32,375
Has really been beached!

1248
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:34,917
You shut up!

1249
01:11:35,125 --> 01:11:36,000
I just explain it for you

1250
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:36,917
Help what?

1251
01:11:36,917 --> 01:11:39,042
We actually haven't done anything!

1252
01:11:39,667 --> 01:11:42,292
You, get lost!

1253
01:11:43,125 --> 01:11:45,333
You're so good!

1254
01:11:45,333 --> 01:11:46,917
Hay Man. Don't you know that
you're living in my place?

1255
01:11:46,917 --> 01:11:49,000
You have an affair with my woman

1256
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:49,958
I haven't angry with you yet

1257
01:11:49,958 --> 01:11:51,792
And you asked me to get out!

1258
01:11:52,625 --> 01:11:54,917
What is he talking about?

1259
01:11:56,375 --> 01:11:58,583
This place this place is his?

1260
01:11:58,583 --> 01:12:00,583
Why are you so angry?

1261
01:12:01,042 --> 01:12:02,417
Why didn't you tell me?

1262
01:12:02,417 --> 01:12:04,208
What do you want?

1263
01:12:04,208 --> 01:12:05,375
You never give me credit
for the tings I have done

1264
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:06,875
You don't like me working

1265
01:12:06,875 --> 01:12:08,542
You get jealous when I got a promotion

1266
01:12:08,542 --> 01:12:09,667
and salary increase

1267
01:12:09,667 --> 01:12:10,917
You suspected I want you to depend on me

1268
01:12:10,917 --> 01:12:13,292
when I ask for your help

1269
01:12:13,292 --> 01:12:14,625
We have nothing left

1270
01:12:14,625 --> 01:12:16,375
I've got to figure it out!

1271
01:12:16,375 --> 01:12:19,333
There has to be a place to sleep in at night!
OK! You tell me!

1272
01:12:19,333 --> 01:12:20,917
What Should I do?

1273
01:12:21,458 --> 01:12:23,750
I'd rather sleep on the street!

1274
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,833
Alex!

1275
01:12:28,125 --> 01:12:32,583
You're narrow mined, stubborn, and self-centred

1276
01:12:33,208 --> 01:12:34,417
But why did you marry him?

1277
01:12:34,417 --> 01:12:37,083
He's much better than you!
You just like to fool around with woman

1278
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:40,000
He doesn't like to fool around,
and he doesn't have the bad habits that I have

1279
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:40,917
So what's the result?

1280
01:12:40,917 --> 01:12:42,750
He's going at last!

1281
01:12:44,125 --> 01:12:45,417
I'm going to screw someone

1282
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:54,292
Remember, all man is like that!

1283
01:13:00,583 --> 01:13:02,833
Can you give me the passport?

1284
01:13:07,833 --> 01:13:09,542
Passport!

1285
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:28,333
Still want one more?

1286
01:16:28,333 --> 01:16:30,125
You've had 17 glasses, boss!

1287
01:16:30,125 --> 01:16:33,000
I've not been a boss for a long time

1288
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,750
Don't excite him! He's already been so sad

1289
01:16:36,042 --> 01:16:37,917
Can he be worse than me?

1290
01:16:37,917 --> 01:16:39,625
I've to be a collie here!

1291
01:16:40,333 --> 01:16:42,167
It seems that we're in the same boat

1292
01:16:42,167 --> 01:16:44,417
How about a brothers' partnership?

1293
01:16:44,958 --> 01:16:47,042
Aren't we sisters?

1294
01:17:03,667 --> 01:17:05,125
Miss Chu, the gold price
has slided down beyond the bottom line,

1295
01:17:05,125 --> 01:17:06,292
shall we sell it

1296
01:17:06,292 --> 01:17:07,250
You ask me?

1297
01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:08,208
Mr. Tang has gone to Thailand

1298
01:17:08,208 --> 01:17:11,042
He said you'll be responsible for everything

1299
01:17:11,542 --> 01:17:12,958
Just a moment

1300
01:17:13,375 --> 01:17:18,167
Grace...wait

1301
01:17:21,667 --> 01:17:25,208
Grace. Who would know whether we shall sell it?

1302
01:17:25,208 --> 01:17:26,208
Mr. Tang

1303
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:28,583
I don't know!
But Mr. Tang has gone to Thailand!

1304
01:17:28,583 --> 01:17:31,750
Miss Chu, Mr. Tang said
whenever he has business trips

1305
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:34,500
I know, signing name! Come in

1306
01:17:34,875 --> 01:17:36,208
Anything else?

1307
01:17:36,208 --> 01:17:37,708
A regular meeting with
the brokers in the afternoon

1308
01:17:37,708 --> 01:17:39,708
and an appointment
with the IC of the Bank Bureau

1309
01:17:39,708 --> 01:17:42,292
You've to be present on behalf of Mr. Tang

1310
01:17:42,292 --> 01:17:45,750
Also, Mr. Tang has reminded you
to watch over the market

1311
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:47,292
Miss Chu, shall we sell it?

1312
01:17:47,292 --> 01:17:48,250
Just a moment

1313
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:49,583
Do you mean not selling?

1314
01:17:49,583 --> 01:17:53,167
No! Let me analyze the situation first

1315
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:05,583
Now, the market is trying to
break through the psychological gate point

1316
01:18:05,583 --> 01:18:08,125
I'll make the decision in a short while

1317
01:18:08,125 --> 01:18:11,292
So when will you break through
you own psychological gate point?

1318
01:18:11,292 --> 01:18:13,208
Sit down and talk about it

1319
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:17,583
Miss Chu, you've to sign this
financial report and the annual report at once

1320
01:18:17,583 --> 01:18:19,958
I know I know. You go out first

1321
01:18:19,958 --> 01:18:22,000
You also have to sign
the cheques from the Accounting Dept

1322
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,292
You go out first, thank you

1323
01:18:27,458 --> 01:18:30,208
In fact, the problem between
you and Alex is just an psychological one

1324
01:18:30,208 --> 01:18:32,083
Are you so free?
Don't you have to go back to the office?

1325
01:18:32,083 --> 01:18:34,292
Don't you have to record all the calls?

1326
01:18:34,292 --> 01:18:36,042
Business can be done at any moment

1327
01:18:36,042 --> 01:18:37,917
But it's more important
to care about an old friend

1328
01:18:37,917 --> 01:18:39,125
You don't have to convince me

1329
01:18:39,125 --> 01:18:40,583
You see there's so much work to do

1330
01:18:40,583 --> 01:18:42,125
So you'd better go

1331
01:18:42,125 --> 01:18:43,000
But...

1332
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:46,375
No one can alter what 
've decided

1333
01:18:47,167 --> 01:18:49,417
Like a capable woman!

1334
01:18:49,417 --> 01:18:50,250
What's the matter?

1335
01:18:50,250 --> 01:18:51,500
The cheque is urgent, have you signed it?

1336
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:54,417
You tell him to wait for a while. Thank you

1337
01:18:54,417 --> 01:18:55,792
Why don't you go?

1338
01:18:56,167 --> 01:18:57,875
I'm afraid no one can call the ambulance

1339
01:18:57,875 --> 01:19:00,417
if you suddenly has heart attack

1340
01:19:00,542 --> 01:19:02,542
I say it clearly once more

1341
01:19:02,542 --> 01:19:03,708
Just a moment

1342
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:05,042
What are you doing?

1343
01:19:05,042 --> 01:19:07,917
I'm afraid
I can't hear clearly, so I take it down

1344
01:19:09,167 --> 01:19:11,458
I have no affair with Phillip

1345
01:19:11,458 --> 01:19:14,542
He is mistaking

1346
01:19:14,542 --> 01:19:17,292
Do you know why I'm working hard?

1347
01:19:17,292 --> 01:19:18,833
I don't!

1348
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:21,625
Just for our family!

1349
01:19:21,625 --> 01:19:23,125
It doesn't matter even if I work like a dog

1350
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:26,125
But even a dog needs master's care and love

1351
01:19:26,125 --> 01:19:29,792
But now he said
he's my fault. I've to comfort him

1352
01:19:29,792 --> 01:19:32,083
I won't downgrade myself

1353
01:19:32,083 --> 01:19:34,375
Where's your character gone?

1354
01:19:34,375 --> 01:19:37,250
You wanted to get married so crazily

1355
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:38,625
Being a lady please

1356
01:19:38,625 --> 01:19:39,958
This is the first time you downgraded yourself

1357
01:19:39,958 --> 01:19:42,375
You word like a dog and no one praises you

1358
01:19:42,375 --> 01:19:43,458
This is the second time you downgraded yourself

1359
01:19:43,458 --> 01:19:45,500
I downgrade myself most to know you

1360
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:47,167
How can you talk shit to me at this moment!

1361
01:19:47,167 --> 01:19:48,458
So it's the third time I downgrade myself

1362
01:19:48,458 --> 01:19:50,333
So, you may continue downgrading yourself

1363
01:19:50,333 --> 01:19:52,125
Go and comfort him

1364
01:19:52,125 --> 01:19:53,625
Impossible!

1365
01:19:53,833 --> 01:19:55,958
You should think it over seriously

1366
01:19:56,375 --> 01:19:58,792
Psychological hurdles to overcome,
No succeeding force...

1367
01:19:58,833 --> 01:20:01,875
No succeeding force? OK. Sell it!

1368
01:20:01,875 --> 01:20:03,167
Thanks

1369
01:20:03,167 --> 01:20:07,125
There must be understanding between couples

1370
01:20:07,125 --> 01:20:09,125
Like bullion speculation

1371
01:20:09,125 --> 01:20:11,750
You have to know
where is the psychological gate point

1372
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:13,667
You haven't married you know nothing about it

1373
01:20:13,667 --> 01:20:15,208
Just knowing how to say it
without knowing how to do it

1374
01:20:15,667 --> 01:20:18,333
It's still better than your ignorance of both!

1375
01:20:18,333 --> 01:20:19,792
What do you think?

1376
01:20:33,375 --> 01:20:36,083
Vivian, you want to see Alex?

1377
01:20:36,208 --> 01:20:38,667
Uncle, didn't you migrate to Canada?

1378
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:41,458
I get bored!
So I come back to visit the old friends

1379
01:20:41,458 --> 01:20:43,208
Is Dad's office upstairs?

1380
01:20:43,208 --> 01:20:44,917
I come for the first time

1381
01:20:47,458 --> 01:20:51,375
-No 99 I think it is
-5th Floor...

1382
01:20:55,542 --> 01:20:58,292
There are so many firms here is it here?

1383
01:20:58,750 --> 01:21:01,000
Boss, come in is it hard to find?

1384
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,542
No! Just the staircase a bit awkward!

1385
01:21:03,542 --> 01:21:04,708
You have a very strange smell

1386
01:21:04,708 --> 01:21:06,583
That it can be easily followed

1387
01:21:06,583 --> 01:21:10,583
To be honest, though your mouth smells bad

1388
01:21:10,583 --> 01:21:12,125
I have been used to it

1389
01:21:12,125 --> 01:21:15,667
It's boring to be without it in Canada

1390
01:21:16,250 --> 01:21:17,375
You want to see Old Pa?

1391
01:21:17,375 --> 01:21:18,458
Daddy!

1392
01:21:18,458 --> 01:21:21,500
Her Old Pa and her dad is not the same! Shit!

1393
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:22,750
Where's Alex?

1394
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:24,500
He is meditating in the root garden

1395
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:27,750
Though the space is small, we live happily

1396
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,250
The meal is ready

1397
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:30,167
I'm coming

1398
01:21:30,167 --> 01:21:32,375
It's so warm to eat at home

1399
01:21:32,375 --> 01:21:33,750
We have a Philippine maid

1400
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:36,000
who does everything for us

1401
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,458
You little Ben!

1402
01:21:37,458 --> 01:21:39,542
Don't call him Ben, his last name is Chow

1403
01:21:39,542 --> 01:21:41,458
Don't trick me!

1404
01:21:41,458 --> 01:21:43,250
We can't trick you only Alex can!

1405
01:21:43,250 --> 01:21:45,208
Damn you! Go to hell!

1406
01:21:45,208 --> 01:21:47,083
I don't go to hell! I go into your body

1407
01:21:48,458 --> 01:21:50,333
I am going to find Alex

1408
01:21:51,042 --> 01:21:52,333
Have the meal first

1409
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:54,333
Thanks

1410
01:22:16,958 --> 01:22:21,375
"The heart is down and raining,"

1411
01:22:21,375 --> 01:22:25,792
"who can make love stay?"

1412
01:22:26,875 --> 01:22:28,833
Do I sing lovely?

1413
01:22:28,875 --> 01:22:31,542
Like an elephant which gets a cold

1414
01:22:33,042 --> 01:22:35,833
How can I sing if you don't teach me?

1415
01:22:35,958 --> 01:22:37,917
You are devoted to bullion speculation now

1416
01:22:37,917 --> 01:22:39,958
Do you still have time for singing?

1417
01:22:40,667 --> 01:22:42,792
You don't like me to be so money-minded?

1418
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:44,250
Me too!

1419
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:46,875
Whatever I think and do are for earning money

1420
01:22:46,875 --> 01:22:49,208
Don't disturb me, I want to complete this song

1421
01:23:16,167 --> 01:23:17,375
How is it?

1422
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:22,292
Alex Lui's piece must be good work!

1423
01:23:22,875 --> 01:23:25,917
Shoe-shining! But I like it

1424
01:23:27,417 --> 01:23:30,000
Do you still remember how you teach me singing?

1425
01:23:35,875 --> 01:23:38,625
What? You want t go to the toilet?

1426
01:23:38,625 --> 01:23:40,875
It's what you taught me

1427
01:23:40,958 --> 01:23:42,667
Did 1?

1428
01:23:42,667 --> 01:23:45,042
You said one must sing from deep inside

1429
01:23:45,042 --> 01:23:47,542
And the mouth must be kept round

1430
01:23:48,375 --> 01:23:51,458
Mom used to think that
you tried to make a pass on me

1431
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:54,583
Though Mom sometimes is too wordy,

1432
01:23:54,583 --> 01:23:56,333
she's quite good!

1433
01:23:56,458 --> 01:23:59,167
If she's not good I would not have married her

1434
01:23:59,333 --> 01:24:02,000
Furthermore, I quit smoking for her

1435
01:24:09,625 --> 01:24:10,542
So you feel great relief

1436
01:24:10,542 --> 01:24:12,750
as you can smoke now?

1437
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:16,458
You don't care her anymore?

1438
01:24:17,458 --> 01:24:19,458
In fact it's not her fault

1439
01:24:19,458 --> 01:24:21,292
I borrow this flat from my Old Pa

1440
01:24:21,292 --> 01:24:23,042
It was raining

1441
01:24:23,583 --> 01:24:27,417
Anyway now I feel good when smoking

1442
01:24:31,875 --> 01:24:33,708
If Mom knows that

1443
01:24:33,708 --> 01:24:38,000
Suki is looking after you

1444
01:24:38,333 --> 01:24:40,500
She'll also be unhappy!

1445
01:24:40,833 --> 01:24:42,667
I don't have any affair with Suki!

1446
01:24:42,667 --> 01:24:44,250
Mom and Old Pa have also done nothing!

1447
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:46,875
They quarrel whenever they see each other!

1448
01:24:50,875 --> 01:24:54,458
OK, I will quit smoking after I finish this one

1449
01:24:54,667 --> 01:24:57,500
Do you know that cigarette is very expensive!

1450
01:24:58,083 --> 01:25:00,125
You aren't angry with mom?

1451
01:25:00,125 --> 01:25:02,667
Will aren't angry at her having a job?

1452
01:25:02,667 --> 01:25:04,542
But she knows little about what she is doing

1453
01:25:04,542 --> 01:25:05,958
You can teach her

1454
01:25:05,958 --> 01:25:08,417
Just as you taught me singing is the past

1455
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:11,708
I don't know bullion speculation

1456
01:25:12,417 --> 01:25:15,583
But ET, who had been
my schoolmate for such a long time

1457
01:25:15,583 --> 01:25:17,708
I have never seen him do a good thing

1458
01:25:18,083 --> 01:25:19,958
I also feel that he's little bit strange

1459
01:25:25,167 --> 01:25:26,625
Tomorrow I'm going to warm him

1460
01:25:26,625 --> 01:25:29,917
not to make use of my wife

1461
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:31,792
He has gone to Thailand

1462
01:25:40,250 --> 01:25:41,417
Thanks

1463
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,542
Mom

1464
01:25:54,833 --> 01:25:56,667
You ask him to come

1465
01:25:56,667 --> 01:25:58,417
Don't come if you're not willing to do so

1466
01:25:58,417 --> 01:25:59,958
I have been used to have a living

1467
01:25:59,958 --> 01:26:02,083
only with my daughter these years

1468
01:26:02,375 --> 01:26:04,375
But I'm not used to it

1469
01:26:04,375 --> 01:26:05,667
What

1470
01:26:06,208 --> 01:26:08,542
I'll get married sooner or later?

1471
01:26:08,542 --> 01:26:10,083
Then you'll be alone

1472
01:26:10,083 --> 01:26:12,125
It's even better! Feeling light happy!

1473
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:17,292
Mom, we three can also
live happily together. You shouldn't

1474
01:26:17,292 --> 01:26:19,292
You sounds like 
I've asked him to leave

1475
01:26:19,292 --> 01:26:21,500
He himself decided to leave!

1476
01:26:21,708 --> 01:26:24,083
Didn't he just come back?

1477
01:26:24,083 --> 01:26:26,042
Why didn't he come in if he had been back

1478
01:26:26,042 --> 01:26:27,583
This is Old Pa's flat

1479
01:26:27,583 --> 01:26:29,792
How can you expect him to come in

1480
01:26:30,708 --> 01:26:33,542
He feels jealous just because he loves you

1481
01:26:33,792 --> 01:26:35,542
Where is he now?

1482
01:26:35,542 --> 01:26:37,417
He is waiting for you at the old place

1483
01:26:37,417 --> 01:26:38,875
The old place?

1484
01:27:04,917 --> 01:27:06,458
So coincident

1485
01:27:07,333 --> 01:27:09,250
I come to see you

1486
01:27:09,250 --> 01:27:10,583
Really?

1487
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:13,583
Just smoke if you want to do so I won't mind

1488
01:27:13,583 --> 01:27:16,500
We should be

1489
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:18,458
adjusted for each other

1490
01:27:20,917 --> 01:27:22,125
Then I adjust for you

1491
01:27:22,125 --> 01:27:25,625
No! I can adjust for you! Smoke it

1492
01:27:30,333 --> 01:27:33,042
Well, but don't have to burn my beard

1493
01:27:34,417 --> 01:27:35,750
Where is Vivian?

1494
01:27:40,375 --> 01:27:41,708
Smoke it

1495
01:27:44,333 --> 01:27:45,917
Hasn't she told you?

1496
01:27:45,917 --> 01:27:47,083
Tell me what?

1497
01:27:47,083 --> 01:27:49,792
There's a serious problem in your company

1498
01:27:50,375 --> 01:27:51,667
Really?

1499
01:27:54,458 --> 01:27:58,500
Damn it! No one works at night-shift

1500
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:00,250
Has it already been closed down?

1501
01:28:00,250 --> 01:28:01,667
Are you in the field?

1502
01:28:01,667 --> 01:28:03,833
Today is public holiday!

1503
01:28:08,667 --> 01:28:11,083
What are these keys for?

1504
01:28:14,708 --> 01:28:16,583
How do you get them?

1505
01:28:16,917 --> 01:28:18,208
These keys!

1506
01:28:18,958 --> 01:28:23,083
I'm the Managing Director, so I have the keys

1507
01:28:35,083 --> 01:28:36,542
Where are the switches?

1508
01:28:36,542 --> 01:28:38,042
Don't switch on the light!

1509
01:28:38,250 --> 01:28:40,042
I'm the Managing Director,

1510
01:28:40,042 --> 01:28:41,042
why can't I switch it on?

1511
01:28:41,042 --> 01:28:42,333
No need to hide!

1512
01:28:42,333 --> 01:28:44,667
But we are coming to break into ET's office

1513
01:28:44,667 --> 01:28:46,750
How can we be open and honest?

1514
01:28:47,875 --> 01:28:50,292
Oh damn it! ET is coming back

1515
01:28:50,875 --> 01:28:52,667
Don't worry, boss! I'll call you

1516
01:28:52,667 --> 01:28:54,792
If any changes take place here

1517
01:28:55,792 --> 01:28:58,583
The uncle's money
has not been deposited in our account

1518
01:28:59,917 --> 01:29:01,750
I know. After I get the money

1519
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:02,625
I'll release information

1520
01:29:02,625 --> 01:29:04,917
so that our clients would force us

1521
01:29:06,375 --> 01:29:09,042
That woman is silly. She knows nothing!

1522
01:29:09,375 --> 01:29:11,208
ET's nephew!

1523
01:29:11,208 --> 01:29:12,000
So what shall we do now?

1524
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:12,958
Let me take care of him!

1525
01:29:12,958 --> 01:29:13,750
How?

1526
01:29:13,750 --> 01:29:14,833
Comfort him!

1527
01:29:17,458 --> 01:29:18,625
Hi

1528
01:29:19,042 --> 01:29:20,833
Why do you come back so late at night?

1529
01:29:21,083 --> 01:29:22,458
I'm thinking of you!

1530
01:29:22,458 --> 01:29:23,750
Really?

1531
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,333
Sure!

1532
01:29:37,833 --> 01:29:40,542
A bullion company suddenly closed down,

1533
01:29:40,542 --> 01:29:42,792
the clients and the staff are suffered

1534
01:29:42,792 --> 01:29:47,208
It's a trap

1535
01:29:47,292 --> 01:29:48,250
Alex,

1536
01:29:48,250 --> 01:29:50,542
this case is similar to our situation

1537
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:54,708
But you're still signing names for your company

1538
01:29:54,917 --> 01:29:56,708
This company no longer belongs to ET

1539
01:29:56,708 --> 01:30:00,167
He transferred all the shares to you!

1540
01:30:00,167 --> 01:30:02,000
So what shall I do?

1541
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,500
If the clients close their account,

1542
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:05,292
you'll be put to jail

1543
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:08,500
Ngao, they are here. Go out first

1544
01:30:12,833 --> 01:30:14,583
We want to see Miss Chan

1545
01:30:15,875 --> 01:30:17,208
What can I do for you?

1546
01:30:17,208 --> 01:30:18,833
We come to close our accounts

1547
01:30:19,250 --> 01:30:20,292
There's no problem

1548
01:30:20,292 --> 01:30:21,792
But our boss is having an appointment

1549
01:30:21,792 --> 01:30:23,375
Maybe you can wait for while here

1550
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:25,083
Fine, the boss is coming

1551
01:30:25,083 --> 01:30:27,208
I really want to take over your company

1552
01:30:27,208 --> 01:30:28,292
I know you're soundly-based,

1553
01:30:28,292 --> 01:30:29,917
I don't want to be taken over now

1554
01:30:29,917 --> 01:30:30,458
I'm so sorry!

1555
01:30:30,458 --> 01:30:32,750
Miss Chu, this is cash

1556
01:30:32,750 --> 01:30:34,458
Why can't I open an account

1557
01:30:34,458 --> 01:30:36,167
We only trust cash in Taiwan

1558
01:30:36,167 --> 01:30:37,625
We don't trust cheques

1559
01:30:37,625 --> 01:30:40,042
Right We have pretty sum of cash in Middle East

1560
01:30:40,042 --> 01:30:41,583
Although some of the books cannot be publicized

1561
01:30:41,583 --> 01:30:43,083
I can give you any commission you want

1562
01:30:43,083 --> 01:30:44,042
Miss Chu,

1563
01:30:44,042 --> 01:30:45,958
you can't close my account without any reason

1564
01:30:45,958 --> 01:30:46,833
I've deposited millions in your company

1565
01:30:46,833 --> 01:30:48,375
and never asked for interests

1566
01:30:49,042 --> 01:30:52,250
It's useless to deposit money in our company

1567
01:30:52,250 --> 01:30:53,417
Even you don't ask for the interest

1568
01:30:53,417 --> 01:30:55,250
we'd responsible for you

1569
01:30:55,250 --> 01:30:57,500
You haven't had
any transactions for three months

1570
01:30:57,500 --> 01:30:59,750
I'm sorry, but we must close your account

1571
01:30:59,750 --> 01:31:01,000
Miss Chu, don't bother with her anymore

1572
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,125
Open an account for me first

1573
01:31:04,917 --> 01:31:06,500
It's millions!

1574
01:31:07,625 --> 01:31:09,458
Please

1575
01:31:10,375 --> 01:31:11,958
What can I do for you two?

1576
01:31:11,958 --> 01:31:14,250
They want to close their accounts

1577
01:31:14,250 --> 01:31:15,458
No

1578
01:31:15,458 --> 01:31:17,750
We are confident of your company, aren't we?

1579
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:19,542
We have been confident of your company

1580
01:31:19,542 --> 01:31:20,708
Thank you!

1581
01:31:22,125 --> 01:31:23,958
Hurry! These are props money

1582
01:31:23,958 --> 01:31:25,542
Be careful of being discovered

1583
01:31:29,042 --> 01:31:30,625
What's up?

1584
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:33,708
I find a client very questionable

1585
01:31:33,708 --> 01:31:35,500
He's called KP Yuen

1586
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:37,083
and his investments is 17 millions

1587
01:31:37,083 --> 01:31:38,417
But all are only figures on the book

1588
01:31:38,417 --> 01:31:40,875
Right... He's the one
who comes from the Mainland China

1589
01:31:40,875 --> 01:31:43,917
If he closes his account,
you'll be in big trouble

1590
01:31:44,208 --> 01:31:45,792
Maybe I can have a talk with him

1591
01:31:45,958 --> 01:31:48,875
If he is designated to trap you,
he won't listen to you

1592
01:31:51,792 --> 01:31:52,875
Go to arrest him!

1593
01:31:59,208 --> 01:32:00,333
Be careful

1594
01:32:00,542 --> 01:32:01,917
Don't worry!

1595
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:05,500
Chairman Mao has said
overcome all the difficulties fearlessly

1596
01:32:08,125 --> 01:32:10,708
Mao vs. Mao, its sounds good

1597
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,750
Don't let him gain anything from you

1598
01:32:12,750 --> 01:32:16,875
He likes to go to night club,
beware of his hands

1599
01:32:19,167 --> 01:32:21,833
Uncle... Oh Comrade Yuen

1600
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,500
Who is your comrade?

1601
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:26,208
We're partners to earn money

1602
01:32:26,208 --> 01:32:28,250
Aren't comrades?

1603
01:32:28,250 --> 01:32:30,625
It's better to call each other comrades

1604
01:32:30,625 --> 01:32:32,083
Chairman Mao has said...

1605
01:32:32,250 --> 01:32:34,083
It not convenient to talk here

1606
01:32:34,083 --> 01:32:35,458
Maybe we go inside, OK?

1607
01:32:35,458 --> 01:32:36,625
No!

1608
01:32:36,667 --> 01:32:37,417
OK

1609
01:32:37,417 --> 01:32:39,958
We'd better go to find comrade Cheung

1610
01:32:41,333 --> 01:32:42,875
Who is he?

1611
01:32:43,042 --> 01:32:44,375
We go inside first

1612
01:32:44,375 --> 01:32:46,333
I'm afraid someone would follow me

1613
01:32:48,042 --> 01:32:48,875
Come inside, hurry up!

1614
01:32:48,875 --> 01:32:50,458
-Thank you.
-Close the door

1615
01:32:50,458 --> 01:32:51,875
There are only you in the room?

1616
01:32:51,875 --> 01:32:54,042
Yes! What do you want to say?

1617
01:32:54,208 --> 01:32:56,208
Someone of China official
is investigating on you

1618
01:32:56,208 --> 01:32:58,625
Yesterday, a man called
Mr. Chueng come to our company to find you

1619
01:32:58,625 --> 01:32:59,792
Is he CS Cheung?

1620
01:32:59,792 --> 01:33:02,875
No! That one is called Cheung?

1621
01:33:03,125 --> 01:33:04,833
He gave me a name card

1622
01:33:05,208 --> 01:33:06,500
Forget his name first

1623
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:10,792
You're suspected to steal a big money

1624
01:33:10,792 --> 01:33:13,250
from the Chinese Government

1625
01:33:13,250 --> 01:33:14,500
Any evidence?

1626
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:15,708
Oh yes

1627
01:33:15,708 --> 01:33:18,333
You're crazy! You create it in the air!

1628
01:33:19,583 --> 01:33:20,625
What do you want?

1629
01:33:20,625 --> 01:33:21,667
Oh, he does not faint!

1630
01:33:21,667 --> 01:33:23,167
Has the electricity switched on?

1631
01:33:24,333 --> 01:33:26,000
You want to shock me?

1632
01:33:26,208 --> 01:33:30,875
I tell you, I've experienced
many adverse situations

1633
01:33:30,875 --> 01:33:33,375
I've knelled down on
pieces of glass and stabbed the lingers

1634
01:33:33,375 --> 01:33:35,875
You damn woman wants to trick me?

1635
01:33:36,083 --> 01:33:37,417
KP Yuen!

1636
01:33:39,083 --> 01:33:41,333
Mummy, smother him with Colophon

1637
01:33:56,250 --> 01:33:57,458
Mom!

1638
01:34:11,542 --> 01:34:16,083
Girl!

1639
01:34:21,667 --> 01:34:23,000
Are you okay?

1640
01:34:23,208 --> 01:34:24,542
For you

1641
01:34:25,583 --> 01:34:27,708
I lost my arm during the cultural revolution

1642
01:34:27,708 --> 01:34:30,000
Why can't I have something in return?

1643
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,083
This is compensation trading

1644
01:34:35,667 --> 01:34:37,583
Mom, wake up!

1645
01:34:42,708 --> 01:34:43,958

01:34:55,167 --> 01:34:57,375
We heard the sound of fire What's happened?

01:34:58,208 --> 01:35:00,208

Sir, I'm not involved!

1659
01:35:16,250 --> 01:35:17,500
Someone fired in this room

1660
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:19,167
and a girl may be killed

1661
01:35:19,167 --> 01:35:20,083
For such a serious case

1662
01:35:20,083 --> 01:35:21,833
All people must assist in the investigation

1663
01:35:21,833 --> 01:35:23,500
Let's go!

1664
01:35:23,708 --> 01:35:25,958
Get on!

1665
01:35:28,625 --> 01:35:29,583
Is it real?

1666
01:35:29,583 --> 01:35:30,500
Yes

1667
01:35:31,250 --> 01:35:32,500
Why do you lock me up

1668
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:33,417
You like gold so much,

1669
01:35:33,417 --> 01:35:35,417
so I use a golden orange to block your mouth

1670
01:35:43,667 --> 01:35:45,500
Are you alright

1671
01:35:46,583 --> 01:35:48,292
It's merely honey its sweet!

1672
01:35:48,292 --> 01:35:50,667
My nose has just bled its real!

1673
01:35:50,667 --> 01:35:52,167
Give you some forged one!

1674
01:35:52,917 --> 01:35:55,250
"Prop Car"

1675
01:36:19,375 --> 01:36:21,167

1680
01:36:57,250 --> 01:36:59,708

Let him in

1682
01:37:08,167 --> 01:37:09,667
Are you little Tang?

1683
01:37:09,667 --> 01:37:11,417
Damn it you're so stupid!

1684
01:37:11,625 --> 01:37:12,583
Who are you?

1685
01:37:12,583 --> 01:37:14,000
Call me' grandfather'

1686
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,167
KP Yuen has been transferred back to Beijing

1687
01:37:16,167 --> 01:37:17,542
Damn it bastard

1688
01:37:17,542 --> 01:37:19,833
Wasting my time and effort

1689
01:37:19,833 --> 01:37:21,208
You...

1690
01:37:21,208 --> 01:37:23,375
Grandfather, also
comes from the Mainland China?

1691
01:37:23,375 --> 01:37:24,583
I can't do down now

1692
01:37:24,583 --> 01:37:26,417
You block my way

1693
01:37:26,417 --> 01:37:27,750
I'm sorry

1694
01:37:29,333 --> 01:37:32,250
Grandfather, how's comrade Yuen now?

1695
01:37:32,250 --> 01:37:34,333
He is being re-educated

1696
01:37:34,333 --> 01:37:37,542
He only lost ten millions during one year in HK

1697
01:37:37,542 --> 01:37:39,542
Don't you think he needs re-education?

1698
01:37:39,542 --> 01:37:40,542
And you

1699
01:37:40,542 --> 01:37:41,750
I promise

1700
01:37:41,750 --> 01:37:44,875
to lose 100 millions in a year!

1701
01:37:45,875 --> 01:37:47,167
A hundred millions!

1702
01:37:47,375 --> 01:37:49,542
Little Tang, you're so useless

1703
01:37:49,542 --> 01:37:52,833
I've never seen all who is as useless as you

1704
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,625
Yes, I'm of no use!

1705
01:37:55,625 --> 01:37:57,375
But if I can be re-educated by you, Grandfather

1706
01:37:57,375 --> 01:37:59,667
I guarantee, I can lose
100 millions in six months

1707
01:37:59,667 --> 01:38:01,333
It's none of your business!

1708
01:38:01,542 --> 01:38:03,750
Your company is no longer yours

1709
01:38:03,750 --> 01:38:06,500
The owner is called something like Ngao

1710
01:38:06,792 --> 01:38:09,500
We can form another company!

1711
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:11,667
It's not that easy

1712
01:38:11,667 --> 01:38:15,792
Your company has been registered
with the Chinese government

1713
01:38:15,792 --> 01:38:18,042
Otherwise I would not have invested in it and

1714
01:38:18,042 --> 01:38:21,125
Place ads for their

1715
01:38:21,375 --> 01:38:24,375
Oh I see... Yes 'Grandfather'

1716
01:38:24,583 --> 01:38:26,333
You give me three days time

1717
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,583
Miss Chu? I'm talking about you

1718
01:38:32,958 --> 01:38:34,292
Yes, I remember

1719
01:38:34,292 --> 01:38:36,708
tomorrow 3pm I'll sign contract with you

1720
01:38:37,708 --> 01:38:39,125
Don't worry

1721
01:38:39,125 --> 01:38:42,750
Your commission I understand

1722
01:38:45,917 --> 01:38:48,000
I know all your deals with the 'Grandfather

1723
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,208
I only want to have my company back

1724
01:38:50,375 --> 01:38:52,375
It's only necessary for you to sign here

1725
01:38:52,375 --> 01:38:54,625
then company would be mine again

1726
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:57,750
Don't you think

1727
01:38:57,750 --> 01:38:59,792
you're too idealistic?

1728
01:39:00,917 --> 01:39:02,292
You're artists

1729
01:39:02,292 --> 01:39:04,875
You won't complete with me, will you?

1730
01:39:04,875 --> 01:39:06,792
I do some shits

1731
01:39:06,792 --> 01:39:09,792
so that you will look virtuous

1732
01:39:10,125 --> 01:39:13,542
And by the way you know
nothing about bullion and currencies

1733
01:39:13,542 --> 01:39:15,375
How about if I'm money-minded?

1734
01:39:16,333 --> 01:39:17,708
One million

1735
01:39:17,708 --> 01:39:20,250
Not really so money-minded!

1736
01:39:20,875 --> 01:39:22,333
Two millions

1737
01:39:22,583 --> 01:39:25,292
There've three people
in my family, so at least 3 millions!

1738
01:39:25,292 --> 01:39:26,583
3 millions

1739
01:39:26,583 --> 01:39:28,583
Yes, And it must be paid in cash cheque!

1740
01:39:28,583 --> 01:39:31,792
Grandfather would come
at 3 pm to sign the contract

1741
01:39:41,625 --> 01:39:43,125
OK. Sign it

1742
01:39:43,125 --> 01:39:44,500
No, I can't

1743
01:39:44,500 --> 01:39:46,333
I've to see whether it can be cashed

1744
01:39:50,667 --> 01:39:52,958
You still don't trust me!

1745
01:39:53,208 --> 01:39:54,833
We maybe in a mess if we trust you again

1746
01:39:54,833 --> 01:39:56,792
Don't worry if the cheque is cashed,

1747
01:39:56,792 --> 01:39:58,167
I will sign the contract

1748
01:39:58,167 --> 01:39:59,750
I'm not so cunning as you're

1749
01:40:01,958 --> 01:40:04,333
Have you seen my nephew?

1750
01:40:04,625 --> 01:40:09,000
He often goes around the girls.
He's seldom in the office

1751
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:10,833
I... how do I know?

1752
01:40:11,625 --> 01:40:13,250
That bastard!

1753
01:40:22,917 --> 01:40:25,417
Sign it, it's nice to be able to stand out

1754
01:40:25,417 --> 01:40:28,292
Right! Being free from the trouble
is more important than 3 millions

1755
01:40:30,625 --> 01:40:31,917
Pig head!

1756
01:40:32,708 --> 01:40:35,708
Hay Man, I'm the boss of this company

1757
01:40:35,708 --> 01:40:36,958
So please don't call me pig head!

1758
01:40:36,958 --> 01:40:38,083
No more nonsense!

1759
01:40:38,083 --> 01:40:40,125
Alex said since you've his schoolmate

1760
01:40:40,125 --> 01:40:43,083
He told me to give you back the company

1761
01:40:43,083 --> 01:40:44,417
Oh really?

1762
01:40:53,875 --> 01:40:55,417
Give me the pen

1763
01:40:57,750 --> 01:40:59,708
Call you to tea if you've time

1764
01:40:59,708 --> 01:41:01,875
Don't call me I don't know you

1765
01:41:06,708 --> 01:41:07,542
Haven't you gone to Beijing?

1766
01:41:07,542 --> 01:41:09,958
Please save me

1767
01:41:11,917 --> 01:41:15,625
Call the police. They've swindles

1768
01:41:16,708 --> 01:41:19,042
We've also swindlers!

1769
01:41:20,375 --> 01:41:21,833
My 3 millions

1770
01:41:21,875 --> 01:41:25,917
Unfasten me first!

1771
01:41:28,458 --> 01:41:31,792
It's lucky this time!

1772
01:41:32,417 --> 01:41:34,500
Mom, the cheque has been banked in

1773
01:41:37,333 --> 01:41:38,875
It's my Phone-call

1774
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:44,167
What?

1775
01:41:45,458 --> 01:41:47,292
What about now?

1776
01:41:49,750 --> 01:41:50,875
OK

1777
01:41:53,417 --> 01:41:54,750
Mom, it's too bad

1778
01:41:54,750 --> 01:41:57,500
The Bank said ET wants to cancel our cheque

1779
01:41:58,417 --> 01:42:00,750
Forget it. By the way, it's dirty money

1780
01:42:00,750 --> 01:42:02,917
But the bank manager said the money
has been transferred into our account

1781
01:42:02,917 --> 01:42:04,583
So it can't be canceled!
