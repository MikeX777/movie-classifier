1
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,134
MILLENNIUM GENERATION

2
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:46,376
Alright...

3
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,875
Then, fair, I want to do differently.

4
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:53,709
You will get out of the fair out, shoot the first two frames.

5
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:58,418
For the second shot, we want to do something

6
00:01:58,542 --> 00:02:00,667
it is risky for the child.

7
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:04,209
Well then record it

8
00:02:04,376 --> 00:02:07,834
running down the road with her big belly,

9
00:02:08,001 --> 00:02:10,834
in the seventh month, and she run, run, run.

10
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:12,875
You will save in slow move around.

11
00:02:13,042 --> 00:02:15,834
and then probably go without sound. Something.

12
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:21,418
Send ... When ready, send it to me and I read it.

13
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,292
OK, see you! Bye.

14
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:26,750
Bye.

15
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:42,917
Just imagine this is your mother, and this is the little baby in it.

16
00:02:43,084 --> 00:02:46,709
This is her stomach, and this is your smaller sibling.

17
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,667
AND...

18
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:52,500
And Mom was a little sad the last few days.

19
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:55,499
And I want to know why.

20
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,834
And you also want to know

21
00:02:58,001 --> 00:03:00,376
why she's sad all the time.

22
00:03:01,126 --> 00:03:04,376
The way we play you the ...

23
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:07,709
wonder if something is wrong.

24
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:10,001
And we'll see how it will be.

25
00:03:11,418 --> 00:03:12,667
- Alright? - Yes.

26
00:03:21,418 --> 00:03:24,292
Try to find out what's wrong with Mom.

27
00:03:26,292 --> 00:03:28,376
What hurts?

28
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,583
Inside there's a baby, right?

29
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,042
And baby ...

30
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,499
Something is wrong with him.

31
00:03:40,084 --> 00:03:41,875
Did you kill her?

32
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:47,209
Honey, I'm sorry.

33
00:03:48,792 --> 00:03:50,792
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,959
Listen, Emily.

35
00:03:55,126 --> 00:03:57,959
Much needs to be angered.

36
00:03:58,126 --> 00:04:00,959
You know? Because you love the baby.

37
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,459
Stoma're ready ...

38
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:06,542
You have to run.

39
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:09,459
- you understand me? - No, not morality.

40
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,334
He wants to get out to see the world.

41
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:14,667
Look, I am the mother

42
00:04:14,834 --> 00:04:19,126
and I have to bear a baby and keep it.

43
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:28,459
- Hello. - Hello.

44
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:30,251
What brings you here?

45
00:04:30,667 --> 00:04:33,334
Will you stay with Anne, right?

46
00:04:33,499 --> 00:04:35,583
Come here and give me a hug again?

47
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:37,709
Srcence?

48
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:44,209
Mom goes to work, but will be back very soon, okay?

49
00:04:45,917 --> 00:04:47,917
- Okay. - Yes, ah ...

50
00:04:48,084 --> 00:04:50,376
Thank you, thank you.

51
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,167
Bye, Tony.

52
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,376
Bye!

53
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,126
- Purple! - Purple.

54
00:05:33,126 --> 00:05:34,959
That ...

55
00:05:47,126 --> 00:05:49,500
And here, what season is it?

56
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:53,418
- What is this?? - Is it autumn or spring?

57
00:05:53,542 --> 00:05:54,792
Spring.

58
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,499
And this?

59
00:05:58,459 --> 00:05:59,750
Essen.

60
00:06:01,001 --> 00:06:03,542
See the leaves on the ground.

61
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:07,709
Here the stem.

62
00:06:08,376 --> 00:06:10,583
The leaves fall in autumn.

63
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:17,126
What is that?

64
00:06:17,292 --> 00:06:18,792
Castle.

65
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:22,001
In the castle lived a witch.

66
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:24,084
- Witch? - Witch

67
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:26,126
- Witch? - Yes.

68
00:06:27,001 --> 00:06:28,959
It witchcraft.

69
00:06:30,084 --> 00:06:32,001
Whether you're a witch?

70
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:41,167
Witch are you?

71
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:44,251
Maybe, sometimes.

72
00:06:44,418 --> 00:06:46,542
And this and this?

73
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:52,875
No I did not recognize. I've never been there.

74
00:06:53,042 --> 00:06:55,084
Nor I have been to.

75
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:04,792
Arise!

76
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:32,709
Good?

77
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,251
What's up?

78
00:08:27,126 --> 00:08:29,001
Do you want children?

79
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:32,126
Yes.

80
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,084
Certainly.

81
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,251
But not yet.

82
00:09:01,334 --> 00:09:02,334
Cheers!

83
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:04,084
What are you doing?

84
00:09:04,334 --> 00:09:05,500
Au, baby!

85
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:07,499
You pushed his nose?

86
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,418
So kid, joints?

87
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,667
Excuse!

88
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:14,542
No, but only briefly,

89
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:17,500
A friend of mine makes it very often.

90
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:19,499
Go to the supermarket

91
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:23,084
if saw strong fish, simply run it.

92
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:25,334
I think I fucked up.

93
00:09:26,042 --> 00:09:27,959
It does the trick.

94
00:09:29,499 --> 00:09:32,334
You know? While people like us think the psychological work ...

95
00:09:32,499 --> 00:09:34,167
he just does.

96
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:37,583
No, I can not imagine.

97
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,625
Not something handsome, he just ...

98
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:42,376
Easy does it. That ...

99
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,750
So I do not know anything as extreme as your friend does.

100
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:48,834
- However, Leo wants to love with. - Does not work.

101
00:09:49,001 --> 00:09:51,500
- Wow, what is this, dude? - Lump.

102
00:09:55,834 --> 00:09:59,418
- We have grass? - Hey Leo, your birthday, dude.

103
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:03,376
Do not you old to 30 years.

104
00:10:04,376 --> 00:10:07,459
You have to stop to think about it.

105
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:10,042
But somehow it is easier for us.

106
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:12,251
We're potent.

107
00:10:12,418 --> 00:10:14,084
So?

108
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,834
I say we are potent, but women ...

109
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:19,709
- Women ... - does the same.

110
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:24,001
No, but older men how, beautiful flowers

111
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:26,292
and women zbrchkani.

112
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:29,167
- That's it. - Depends.

113
00:10:29,334 --> 00:10:31,500
Saying that Ann is wrinkled?

114
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,459
I have 34 years.

115
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:36,542
Well, things will start happening soon ...

116
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,499
Lele, pistons.

117
00:10:42,251 --> 00:10:44,251
Wow, I'm all for it.

118
00:10:44,499 --> 00:10:47,376
- I want to be alone tonight. - What number?

119
00:12:40,499 --> 00:12:42,667
... like a roller coaster with us.

120
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:47,500
And what is your solution?

121
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:57,667
Since you have many expectations of me that I have to fulfill.

122
00:12:59,334 --> 00:13:01,625
And instead we ...

123
00:13:03,001 --> 00:13:05,376
We accept the situation as such.

124
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,459
And besides, now I ...

125
00:13:09,042 --> 00:13:12,167
you provide.

126
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:15,126
In fact I can not even for me to acquire now.

127
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:17,792
No time for anything.

128
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:24,167
And you could do well much attention.

129
00:13:35,542 --> 00:13:36,542
AHA.

130
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:40,709
I think it works with us in stages.

131
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:45,834
Yes, but that would be the ideal situation?

132
00:13:46,001 --> 00:13:48,042
Not an ideal situation!

133
00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:49,500
Yes, but only because ...

134
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:52,167
And strive more for it!

135
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:58,042
We accept things as they are, but not:

136
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:01,418
to get married. It simply is not true.

137
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:04,625
Finally I do not think so ..

138
00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:07,167
It's a huge pressure.

139
00:14:07,418 --> 00:14:10,667
Because I think I can give ... what you expect.

140
00:14:10,834 --> 00:14:13,875
Whatever you say, I can not udovolam ...

141
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,418
Leo, I want to sleep.

142
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,126
I can not sleep.

143
00:15:48,251 --> 00:15:49,834
Then go to the kitchen.

144
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:31,625
... This is a bit different from what we do.

145
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:36,209
We focus on people,

146
00:16:36,376 --> 00:16:40,499
And I ... really do not see where is the link.

147
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,542
What I now to give you

148
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:46,875
edition is

149
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:52,292
that we have an amateur photographer.

150
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:58,001
I researched and I know the material.

151
00:16:58,167 --> 00:16:59,834
The thing is, ah ...

152
00:17:00,001 --> 00:17:04,875
that this moral section, which can be downloaded,

153
00:17:05,042 --> 00:17:08,667
we can use spontaneous material that we sent.

154
00:17:08,834 --> 00:17:11,667
And if you send us something like this

155
00:17:11,917 --> 00:17:15,126
We will look. Maybe you use.

156
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:49,625
It is almost empty.

157
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,459
I'm not used to these little houses in general.

158
00:17:59,376 --> 00:18:02,542
No? I grew up in such.

159
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:08,418
When you have problems, you can not break out.

160
00:18:08,542 --> 00:18:11,376
Yes, but I could not in the city center.

161
00:18:12,709 --> 00:18:16,418
But you will still know people who make exhibitions?

162
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:18,875
Yes, I know a few.

163
00:18:19,042 --> 00:18:20,500
But...

164
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:24,167
I think...

165
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:28,542
a little publicity in a magazine or so

166
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:32,376
perhaps before doing The exhibition or whatever.

167
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,667
If you just show up with your portfolio, you have no chance.

168
00:18:35,834 --> 00:18:37,750
- No? - No, I do not think so.

169
00:18:40,917 --> 00:18:42,875
But I can not import.

170
00:18:43,042 --> 00:18:45,583
The most important thing is that you meet people.

171
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,875
If you are interested in you, and you love your job.

172
00:18:59,792 --> 00:19:01,709
This is Anne.

173
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,750
You still see?

174
00:19:07,084 --> 00:19:09,251
Yes ... now and then.

175
00:19:10,126 --> 00:19:13,583
- But now somehow difficult. - Why?

176
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:17,126
Unable to bear it to be close

177
00:19:19,084 --> 00:19:21,209
and says I'm too intrusive

178
00:19:22,042 --> 00:19:24,583
and on the other hand, it always ...

179
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:30,251
We must discuss and constantly looking for me,

180
00:19:30,418 --> 00:19:33,084
no speak only for myself and ...

181
00:19:33,251 --> 00:19:36,042
And I think some questions and thoughts that I have

182
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:38,834
I can cope with it, and instead ...

183
00:19:40,251 --> 00:19:42,709
I talk to you or my mother, or ...

184
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:44,959
Yes.

185
00:19:46,334 --> 00:19:48,500
And all this ...

186
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:53,251
stress begins to annoy me.

187
00:19:54,499 --> 00:19:56,209
How do you email?

188
00:19:57,542 --> 00:19:59,292
I think in relationships?

189
00:20:00,001 --> 00:20:01,583
I've never been in a relationship.

190
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,376
Seriously ??

191
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,583
Well, never a fit.

192
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,499
Whatever that means. "Guess."

193
00:20:12,126 --> 00:20:14,917
But as with men in terms of relationship?

194
00:20:15,084 --> 00:20:17,001
I get the picture ...

195
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:19,376
I imagine that it is simpler.

196
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,251
No, actually the same shit.

197
00:21:19,001 --> 00:21:20,792
Sit down.

198
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:24,792
One foot throttle, the other on the brake.

199
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:33,292
Well, Miss Marshus, well you see the screen?

200
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:36,084
- Oh, is Ladny. - Yes.

201
00:21:37,459 --> 00:21:40,500
What you see here is your bladder

202
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:42,667
and there goes the colon.

203
00:21:43,418 --> 00:21:46,001
Here's your uterus. I'll show you in more detail.

204
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:48,500
Will pause the image. Here is the uterus.

205
00:21:48,667 --> 00:21:50,792
Here is set

206
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:53,542
between the two notebooks that did.

207
00:21:53,709 --> 00:21:57,334
Just like it would expect in the middle of the cycle.

208
00:21:57,499 --> 00:21:59,959
I save the image.

209
00:22:00,126 --> 00:22:05,500
Now let's look at the ovaries from the right.

210
00:22:09,042 --> 00:22:11,334
I'll show you how I closer.

211
00:22:11,499 --> 00:22:15,251
And then you look and lev side.

212
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,959
It's here.

213
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,959
Watch here. This ovarian follicles.

214
00:22:24,126 --> 00:22:26,001
And here there are many smaller follicles.

215
00:22:26,167 --> 00:22:29,376
It is proof that your fertility is excellent.

216
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,334
On the other hand.

217
00:22:31,499 --> 00:22:35,625
So it all follicles that are ready for fertilization.

218
00:22:35,792 --> 00:22:39,500
This means that the initial trials

219
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:43,499
until this point your fertility is intact.

220
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:46,459
Just to make sure that I have missed something

221
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:48,542
It may make our problem.

222
00:22:48,709 --> 00:22:51,292
But there is nothing that would cause a problem.

223
00:22:51,834 --> 00:22:55,084
How many years were you the first period?

224
00:22:55,251 --> 00:22:57,001
14 years.

225
00:22:57,167 --> 00:23:00,001
And now, it is too painful to do is to download something?

226
00:23:00,167 --> 00:23:02,418
- Yes. - Are you taking pills? What are you doing?

227
00:23:02,542 --> 00:23:04,583
Sometimes I drink pills, if you bet wrong,

228
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,292
and usually put hot water bottle on the abdomen.

229
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,126
Have you ever been pregnant?

230
00:23:09,292 --> 00:23:12,001
You pometnale, abortion bad pregnancy?

231
00:23:13,834 --> 00:23:15,625
I once aborted, yes.

232
00:23:15,792 --> 00:23:17,459
When either of the occasion?

233
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:19,459
I was 21.

234
00:23:23,334 --> 00:23:26,126
You taking any medications? Any?

235
00:23:28,084 --> 00:23:29,500
No, nothing.

236
00:23:31,292 --> 00:23:34,583
What is your schedule of work and daily routine?

237
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:38,292
- More regular or irregular? - Very, very irregular.

238
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:41,167
It's certainly a lot of stress.

239
00:23:41,334 --> 00:23:43,334
Usually I'm very stressful

240
00:23:43,499 --> 00:23:47,917
and often stay up late and get up early.

241
00:23:49,167 --> 00:23:52,376
OK it's background. Just for a moment ..

242
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,625
I want to explain the diagnosis as to your not understanding.

243
00:23:56,875 --> 00:24:00,750
It's important for me to know how much percentage'm still fertile.

244
00:24:00,917 --> 00:24:02,875
- Yes. - Can you tell me?

245
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:05,001
I'll tell you a percentage.

246
00:24:05,167 --> 00:24:07,209
The question is how to help.

247
00:24:07,376 --> 00:24:09,499
Will it help me ... why I'm here.

248
00:24:09,709 --> 00:24:11,209
There is no percentage in conception.

249
00:24:11,376 --> 00:24:14,418
Either you conceive or not.

250
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:17,334
If you want good advice,

251
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:19,917
The earlier you get pregnant the better.

252
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:22,500
Waiting reduces fertility.

253
00:24:50,376 --> 00:24:52,667
It can actually be darker.

254
00:24:53,251 --> 00:24:57,917
I'm missing a little pigment here and mask.

255
00:24:58,084 --> 00:24:59,667
You have something darker?

256
00:25:08,418 --> 00:25:11,251
Simply anyone no longer telling him about my love life.

257
00:25:11,418 --> 00:25:14,251
Simply anyone no longer telling him about my love life.

258
00:25:14,418 --> 00:25:16,251
This is not a love story.

259
00:25:16,418 --> 00:25:18,167
This is not a love story.

260
00:25:31,334 --> 00:25:34,376
So I tell you, I saw the material,

261
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,209
the end of the week will call parents

262
00:25:38,376 --> 00:25:42,209
to tell them clearly that we love Emilia and Avid,

263
00:25:42,376 --> 00:25:44,583
and we want to see them again.

264
00:27:11,042 --> 00:27:12,625
Yes, this might.

265
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:16,625
It's cool.

266
00:27:25,709 --> 00:27:27,334
I think they're cool.

267
00:27:31,042 --> 00:27:32,500
one

268
00:27:33,292 --> 00:27:34,750
two,

269
00:27:36,418 --> 00:27:37,875
three,

270
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:40,084
four five.

271
00:27:41,251 --> 00:27:43,209
This is not like you at all?

272
00:27:43,376 --> 00:27:44,834
Not.

273
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:50,917
But there is something about it.

274
00:27:56,792 --> 00:28:00,251
It is different from others.

275
00:28:01,376 --> 00:28:03,209
It's kind of childish.

276
00:28:03,376 --> 00:28:05,042
- You like it? - Yes.

277
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:08,042
And me.

278
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:14,959
It's kind of an unusual way of exposing things.

279
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:19,084
But here often I watched photographic work.

280
00:28:25,167 --> 00:28:29,126
But here in the corridor, for example, several pieces in a large format.

281
00:28:29,292 --> 00:28:30,542
You think?

282
00:28:32,126 --> 00:28:35,499
For example, there may be a series with the dog.

283
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:38,001
- Yes, why not? - I like it.

284
00:28:38,167 --> 00:28:40,709
What are my chances?

285
00:28:40,875 --> 00:28:43,542
We will meet with him and see.

286
00:28:43,709 --> 00:28:46,834
I'm sure I will like your work.

287
00:28:47,084 --> 00:28:48,625
This is very out.

288
00:28:49,625 --> 00:28:51,126
Watch!

289
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:55,959
Radically.

290
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:14,875
That is good.

291
00:29:39,292 --> 00:29:40,500
Alright.

292
00:29:44,459 --> 00:29:45,917
Seriously.

293
00:29:47,792 --> 00:29:49,917
And you put the plastic cover.

294
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:55,042
Head up a little, eyes ...

295
00:30:09,667 --> 00:30:11,792
See here left behind.

296
00:30:23,251 --> 00:30:24,709
Cheers.

297
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,292
This will be funny.

298
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:29,625
- Hey! - What's up? Where are you?

299
00:32:29,792 --> 00:32:32,500
Sorry. I will be able to.

300
00:33:39,875 --> 00:33:41,042
Show me!

301
00:33:58,001 --> 00:33:59,499
You like?

302
00:34:00,001 --> 00:34:01,583
That is good.

303
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,334
What?

304
00:34:04,499 --> 00:34:06,126
No, it's fine.

305
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:09,709
As long as I you like me ...

306
00:34:52,834 --> 00:34:55,500
Let the day float past.

307
00:34:56,084 --> 00:34:58,792
Be here now, in this moment.

308
00:34:59,209 --> 00:35:01,209
Weightlessness,

309
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,750
security.

310
00:35:04,959 --> 00:35:06,959
Go back

311
00:35:08,459 --> 00:35:10,459
in your mother's womb,

312
00:35:12,792 --> 00:35:14,583
where it is warm

313
00:35:15,251 --> 00:35:17,251
and beautiful.

314
00:35:18,917 --> 00:35:22,625
Feel Your Presence here and now.

315
00:35:24,251 --> 00:35:26,209
Do not do anything.

316
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:29,084
Just to get here

317
00:35:29,251 --> 00:35:30,667
and to be enjoyed.

318
00:35:34,126 --> 00:35:36,542
And feel safety

319
00:35:36,709 --> 00:35:40,001
here at this point in your shell.

320
00:35:57,875 --> 00:35:59,001
- Hello! - Hello.

321
00:35:59,167 --> 00:36:01,959
- Come on in! Everything is okay? - Yeah, thanks.

322
00:36:04,209 --> 00:36:08,917
This is important if you want to increase the lips,

323
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:12,500
it is really very nice and shaped shading.

324
00:36:12,667 --> 00:36:14,709
You can watch me.

325
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:19,251
to see it increase, embellishment from here to there.

326
00:36:19,499 --> 00:36:21,917
And zasenchuvanjeto really nice and shaped.

That means you can look completely natural.

329
00:36:29,376 --> 00:36:31,709
- That's right. - I do not want to stand out a lot.

330
00:36:31,875 --> 00:36:33,042
Completely natural.

331
00:36:39,126 --> 00:36:42,084
Well, soon we are ready.

332
00:36:42,251 --> 00:36:46,667
Well kept. It does not hurt. Bravely.

00:36:47,209 --> 00:36:49,750
Once again little by the parties.

334
00:36:50,001 --> 00:36:53,042
Then you add some makeup, you raise.

335
00:36:53,209 --> 00:36:55,167
And tonight you can go out.

336
00:36:55,334 --> 00:36:58,209

00:37:01,251 --> 00:37:03,959
- To put a little powder. - True.

339
00:37:16,126 --> 00:37:18,334
Ready? Yes.

340
00:37:19,209 --> 00:37:20,667

00:37:22,167 --> 00:37:25,625
- Oh my God. - Yes, more lip.

00:37:25,792 --> 00:37:28,209
- Now is the flow can be understood. - Oh no.

343
00:37:28,376 --> 00:37:31,499
- you will need only 10 minutes. And then ... - 10 minutes?

344
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:34,251
- Oh, it's really swollen. - It is normal.

345
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:37,209
Just shaped course. Like that?

346
00:37:37,376 --> 00:37:39,959
Like that. It is best not to touch more.

347
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:44,834
- Only 10 minutes far! I have important Nastan tomorrow.

348
00:37:45,001 --> 00:37:48,625
10 minutes. Then everything will be settled.

349
00:37:48,792 --> 00:37:50,792
And wait 3 to 5 days.

350
00:37:51,042 --> 00:37:53,542
You need a little patience and confidence.

351
00:37:53,709 --> 00:37:56,542
It will be much milder than with us. Like that?

352
00:37:56,709 --> 00:37:58,834
- Does the swelling is gone tomorrow? - Yes.

353
00:37:59,001 --> 00:38:02,459
- Up to 11 in the morning? - Will it run for 10 minutes.

354
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:03,625
Oh God.

Swollen, but this is normal. Just be patient, have a little faith.

00:38:17,084 --> 00:38:20,792
Hour swelling is gone, and tomorrow will look great.

360
00:38:20,959 --> 00:38:22,709
Just in time for the event. Do not worry.

361
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:24,875
- we promise. - Alright.

362
00:38:38,792 --> 00:38:41,126
Then you have an appointment next treatment.

363
00:38:41,292 --> 00:38:45,167
When suits you most? Morning or poslepladne?

364
00:38:46,875 --> 00:38:49,418
- At noon, the better. After noon, okay.

365
00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:52,542
As late as possible. - Alright.

You know? - No, no.

368
00:39:55,042 --> 00:39:56,792
But why did not you understand?

369
00:39:56,959 --> 00:40:00,167
It wants to get out and see the world.

370
00:40:07,542 --> 00:40:09,959
Light. Can we get some light?

371
00:41:34,001 --> 00:41:35,499
Guys ...

372
00:41:40,084 --> 00:41:42,084
Cheers! The ex?

373
00:41:57,251 --> 00:41:59,126
Not bad, but ??

374
00:43:00,042 --> 00:43:03,750
... just tits ... not just tits.

375
00:43:04,001 --> 00:43:06,209
Please, it's my face.

376
00:43:16,499 --> 00:43:17,959
Hello! Leo's.

377
00:43:19,917 --> 00:43:22,084
Hey. You OK??

378
00:43:25,001 --> 00:43:26,418
You may kacham above ??

379
00:43:27,667 --> 00:43:30,667
Hmm ... I do not know.

380
00:43:33,376 --> 00:43:36,499
Maybe tomorrow to see?

381
00:43:36,625 --> 00:43:38,126
Alright.

382
00:43:38,292 --> 00:43:39,834
I will call you.

383
00:44:14,875 --> 00:44:20,583
Otherwise, I am very close to art photography,

384
00:44:21,126 --> 00:44:26,542
and Jan Sibenhan us presents a series of photographs

385
00:44:26,709 --> 00:44:30,500
depicting naked male body.

386
00:44:30,667 --> 00:44:36,042
These are scenes that reveal a certain intimacy.

387
00:44:36,209 --> 00:44:39,418
Very subtle scenes are presented here.

388
00:44:39,542 --> 00:44:44,292
Some scenes even have philosophical effect

389
00:44:44,459 --> 00:44:46,875
as this picture from behind, for example.

390
00:44:47,042 --> 00:44:50,959
And here we see the imaginary Leonard

391
00:44:51,126 --> 00:44:56,251
sit in front of a mirror with a lot of desperation in itself.

392
00:44:56,418 --> 00:45:01,209
In order to implement this Jan Sibenhar.

393
00:45:01,376 --> 00:45:03,418
Yes, first of all to thank Richard

394
00:45:03,542 --> 00:45:08,418
I allow organisms to my first photo exhibition here.

395
00:45:09,625 --> 00:45:11,625
It's uncharted territory for me,

396
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:14,709
and I think there is not much to say.

397
00:45:14,875 --> 00:45:18,167
If there is a question, of course, is free to ask me.

398
00:45:18,334 --> 00:45:20,418
It is great that you have gathered here in such numbers,

399
00:45:20,542 --> 00:45:22,917
and I hope you enjoy "I'm excited."

400
00:45:26,084 --> 00:45:28,167
Thank you very much, thank you.

401
00:45:32,917 --> 00:45:35,001
I was terribly nervous!

402
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,583
Everything out at the last minute.

403
00:45:46,459 --> 00:45:48,042
Just email me soap.

404
00:46:00,251 --> 00:46:03,126
Hello! I'm glad you came!

405
00:46:04,875 --> 00:46:06,792
Why did not you tell me?

406
00:46:07,042 --> 00:46:08,750
I tell you?

407
00:46:10,251 --> 00:46:11,792
Do you like it?

408
00:46:12,792 --> 00:46:14,500
It is uncommon.

409
00:46:16,583 --> 00:46:18,376
You will come back?

410
00:46:40,917 --> 00:46:43,084
This woman collects photos?

411
00:46:44,499 --> 00:46:47,418
Well, we'll see. I will not decide.

412
00:46:47,542 --> 00:46:49,750
Sure, but it might be a good chance.

413
00:46:51,583 --> 00:46:53,792
Today we celebrate.

414
00:47:31,084 --> 00:47:32,792
- Hello. Hello, ÅžEKERCÄ°.

415
00:47:32,959 --> 00:47:35,709
- Want some fun? - Yes.

416
00:48:09,667 --> 00:48:11,376
Stop, stop, stop!

417
00:48:23,084 --> 00:48:24,542
Thank you.

418
00:48:25,292 --> 00:48:26,750
I took another pat.

419
00:48:28,418 --> 00:48:31,459
- You want a cigarette? - Yes of course.

420
00:48:44,667 --> 00:48:46,750
How long you been here?

421
00:48:46,917 --> 00:48:49,209
... about two months.

422
00:48:49,376 --> 00:48:52,001
- Two months? - Yes, I'm new here.

423
00:48:59,834 --> 00:49:01,499
And you?

424
00:49:01,625 --> 00:49:04,875
Not long. Several months.

425
00:49:07,959 --> 00:49:10,084
Here it is cold.

426
00:49:11,667 --> 00:49:12,959
Yes...

427
00:49:16,583 --> 00:49:21,334
I came here because my girlfriend ...

428
00:49:21,499 --> 00:49:24,959
and I wanted to start a career here, but ...

429
00:49:25,126 --> 00:49:28,834
nothing happened.

430
00:49:32,167 --> 00:49:34,042
I have to go now.

431
00:49:34,209 --> 00:49:36,959
Alright. Need a lift?

432
00:49:37,126 --> 00:49:40,834
No, just ... I'm going there.

433
00:49:41,001 --> 00:49:42,834
Someone will pick me up.

434
00:49:43,001 --> 00:49:44,334
Alright.

435
00:49:46,875 --> 00:49:48,499
Well, we see!

436
00:50:21,875 --> 00:50:23,209
Healthy?

437
00:50:23,376 --> 00:50:25,167
Yes, hello, too.

438
00:50:25,334 --> 00:50:28,084
And I wanted to tell me?

439
00:50:31,376 --> 00:50:33,376
Hmm, I do not know.

440
00:50:34,583 --> 00:50:37,209
Sam there?

441
00:50:37,376 --> 00:50:39,084
Where are you?

442
00:50:40,251 --> 00:50:42,292
No, I'm in the car.

443
00:50:42,459 --> 00:50:45,001
Ah! Where are you going?

444
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:47,251
I do not know myself.

445
00:50:48,251 --> 00:50:51,418
Whats wrong? Nervous are you?

446
00:50:52,209 --> 00:50:53,792
So why?

447
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:56,625
What happens there?

448
00:50:57,376 --> 00:50:59,667
I'll call you later, okay?

449
00:51:00,499 --> 00:51:03,167
Yes ... calm down first.

450
00:51:03,334 --> 00:51:06,500
Somehow, all that work seemed strange,

451
00:51:06,667 --> 00:51:08,959
muss ich dir ehrlich sagen. Moram da kazham you.

452
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:11,709
You must have control over their lives

453
00:51:11,875 --> 00:51:13,418
and find a solution.

454
00:51:13,542 --> 00:51:15,209
It can not continue like this.

455
00:51:15,376 --> 00:51:17,834
That's right. We will be in touch, right?

456
00:51:18,001 --> 00:51:19,959
- Yes. - Bye.

457
00:51:39,001 --> 00:51:42,084
Come here. See. Sit back here.

458
00:51:42,251 --> 00:51:45,625
You can again briefly. Sit here.

459
00:51:46,334 --> 00:51:48,667
- We'll try again? - Yes!

460
00:51:49,709 --> 00:51:51,834
- Hello. - Hello.

461
00:51:52,084 --> 00:51:53,750
- Alright? - Ok?

462
00:51:54,709 --> 00:51:56,917
- How are you? - I'm good.

463
00:51:58,376 --> 00:52:01,126
- Finished allowed. - Hi, Tony.

464
00:52:01,959 --> 00:52:04,500
- Hello. - Guided my hands.

465
00:52:05,667 --> 00:52:07,499
I have to go, but ...

466
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,959
We can see the coffee and talk a little?

467
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:11,376
Yes, great.

468
00:52:11,583 --> 00:52:13,167
Great!

469
00:52:14,042 --> 00:52:15,500
Well, go then, you Tony?

470
00:52:15,667 --> 00:52:17,126
You go home? Yes?

471
00:52:19,459 --> 00:52:21,542
Hey? Honey?

472
00:52:22,418 --> 00:52:25,376
We'll go to see Julia.

473
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:28,418
And Annie. With all ... Come.

474
00:52:28,542 --> 00:52:31,917
- And Dad! - Yes, you see Dad. Come!

475
00:52:32,084 --> 00:52:34,418
All right. Clothing, blanket.

476
00:52:34,542 --> 00:52:36,418
We have everything? - Yes?

477
00:52:36,542 --> 00:52:38,583
- Say bye! - Bye!

478
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:40,459
- Bye! - We'll see each other!

479
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:45,167
- Take my jacket ... - jacket.

480
00:52:45,334 --> 00:52:47,625
All this we will do. I see.

481
00:55:24,251 --> 00:55:26,583
We will discuss the actors re briefly

482
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:30,001
but today I have a great feeling. Yesterday I was ...

483
00:55:30,167 --> 00:55:32,667
Ah ... Bev very tired.

484
00:55:38,042 --> 00:55:39,500
Not. Not!

485
00:57:09,792 --> 00:57:11,542
There's another.

486
00:57:14,792 --> 00:57:17,334
Then extract it.

487
00:57:17,499 --> 00:57:18,667
- Yes? - Yes.

488
00:57:18,834 --> 00:57:20,376
Others were much better.

489
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:22,499
What do you say you?

490
00:57:22,625 --> 00:57:25,084
- Wow, it's too ugly. - No.

491
00:57:25,251 --> 00:57:26,750
Perfectly.

492
00:57:30,126 --> 00:57:32,126
Yes, but it is very cool, too.

493
00:57:32,292 --> 00:57:35,084
This photo you can look at it from all sides.

494
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:39,750
Cheers, dude.

495
00:57:39,917 --> 00:57:42,209
She looks as deer!

496
00:57:45,418 --> 00:57:48,792
Yes, a little scared. Because the hunter is close.

497
00:57:50,583 --> 00:57:52,959
- That the hunter. - Comes hunter.

498
00:57:57,418 --> 00:58:00,459
And then there are the gates of hell.

499
00:58:02,126 --> 00:58:04,499
All come, all just looking, looking and seeking.

500
00:58:04,625 --> 00:58:07,499
All always seek. Everyone wants to take a stand.

501
00:58:07,709 --> 00:58:10,500
You also need to take a stand, Leo.

502
00:58:11,459 --> 00:58:13,209
Let me say it, dude.

503
00:58:13,583 --> 00:58:16,459
From another perspective.

504
00:58:17,376 --> 00:58:18,667
Why?

505
00:58:36,875 --> 00:58:40,292
If we take embryos will not take just one,

506
00:58:40,459 --> 00:58:42,418
We will take more if we can.

507
00:58:42,542 --> 00:58:46,001
We will do it with provocation of your own hormone.

508
00:58:46,834 --> 00:58:49,084
- Yes. - It is not complicated.

509
00:58:49,251 --> 00:58:52,376
All right. Should I take this every day ....

510
00:59:56,583 --> 00:59:58,750
And what if it is wrong?

511
01:00:08,167 --> 01:00:10,750
What if you want to start over?

512
01:00:11,709 --> 01:00:13,917
I do not think will make a difference.

513
01:00:16,459 --> 01:00:18,001
No, not really ...

514
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:24,583
I never wanted to be someone else.

515
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:30,834
But maybe ...

516
01:00:35,251 --> 01:00:39,292
Well, you always want more, right? As ... never satisfied.

517
01:00:40,001 --> 01:00:42,625
I think if we start over again ...

518
01:00:42,875 --> 01:00:45,917
I will start more comfortable with more feeling.

519
01:00:46,084 --> 01:00:48,167
I did everything with more feeling.

520
01:00:48,334 --> 01:00:51,500
Yes, but it may not have been so successful.

521
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:55,834
Maybe it was not so bad.

522
01:00:59,126 --> 01:01:00,583
I have to Mock.

523
01:01:34,084 --> 01:01:36,251
Well, now you can come here

524
01:01:36,418 --> 01:01:38,625
and sit on the chair.

525
01:01:40,376 --> 01:01:41,834
Carefully.

526
01:01:43,709 --> 01:01:46,167
Come forward with your hips,

527
01:01:46,334 --> 01:01:49,875
put your feet here. That's lev and right.

528
01:01:50,042 --> 01:01:53,334
Another forward. A little bit more!

529
01:01:53,499 --> 01:01:55,042
All right. Great!

530
01:02:07,709 --> 01:02:09,625
Good other side.

531
01:02:20,709 --> 01:02:22,709
Yes, that's better.

532
01:02:34,418 --> 01:02:37,459
Okay, all are placed. Great.

533
01:02:52,459 --> 01:02:54,459
What is the meaning of life?

534
01:02:56,542 --> 01:03:01,625
Life: what distinguishes animals and plants from inorganic matter,

535
01:03:01,792 --> 01:03:06,334
including the possibility of growth, reproduction, activity,

536
01:03:06,499 --> 01:03:09,334
changes and eventually death.

537
01:03:11,167 --> 01:03:13,126
I do not want to die.

538
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:18,001
I do not understand, "I do not want to die."

539
01:03:18,167 --> 01:03:21,499
If you will check the internet.
