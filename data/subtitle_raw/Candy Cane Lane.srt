Holy cow. Wow.

19
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:56,499
You sure got a thing for candy canes,
don't you, Chris?

20
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,874
Yeah.

21
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:00,874
And you sure got a thing
for big blow-up dolls, don't you, Bruce?

22
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:02,915
Yeah, I love those blow-up dolls.

23
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:05,665
Okay. No.

24
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:07,082
I see what you did there.

25
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:08,957
Did you blow all those up?

26
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:11,624
We're, we're a family that blows.

27
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:15,290
And I see you're, still carving
your wood... little hobby.

28
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:17,374
Yeah. All hand-carved.

29
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:18,749
Yeah, it's cute.

30
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,999
It's not first-place cute, but it's cute.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,749
I don't know how a blow-up doll
could, you know,

32
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,332
compare with this handcraftsmanship.

33
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,499
Not interested.

34
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,707
- Well, we'll see. We'll see, Bruce.
- We w... We will see.

35
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:31,749
We will see. We will see.

36
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,957
We will see.

37
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:38,332
Do I want an invisibility cloak
or flying shoes?

38
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,624
If an elf can make it,
you can wish for it, okay?

39
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,540
Santa's elves can make anything.

40
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:44,540
They can make anything.
Now finish that letter.

41
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:46,665
Come on. We got to send it
all the way to the North Pole.

42
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,040
How much more inflatable crap
is Bruce gonna put on that roof?

43
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:52,165
Bruce.
Babe, thank you for reminding me.

44
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,499
Please don't forget to buy a nice bottle
of red for us to go over there tonight.

45
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,374
I'm not getting a good bottle
for the competition.

46
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,415
They're not the competition.
They're our neighbors.

47
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:01,874
Dad, where are my cleats?

48
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,040
Your cleats are right here.

49
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,040
You know, Joy, I was wondering:
Since you're having such a hard time

50
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,582
keeping track of things
while you're at home,

51
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:09,791
what's gonna happen
when you go off to college...

52
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,749
Notre Dame?

53
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,500
How'd this get in the house?

54
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:21,290
Dad, I... I know that you guys met at USC,
but I don't want to go there.

55
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,874
What?!

56
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,457
Excuse me.

57
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,124
USC is in your blood.

58
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:32,249
- Fight on.
- Fight on!

59
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,457
Listen, sweetheart, I-I would be happy
to call my old softball coach.

60
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:37,707
No, Mom, I...

61
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,999
I'm-I'm shattered
that you don't want to go to USC.

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,957
Wow. Joy.

63
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,165
USC. Fight on.

64
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,250
- Fight on, honey.
- Fight on.

65
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,332
Only a half hour away.

66
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,290
You could spend so much time with Dad.

67
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:53,582
That's right.

68
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,040
It's only 20 minutes with no traffic.

69
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,290
You could eat dinner with your family
every night.

70
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,332
Yeah.

71
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:01,207
Nick, um, how did that math test go?

72
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,415
You had a math test? What'd you get?

73
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,665
I don't let grades define me, Dad.

74
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:08,124
All right, that does not sound good.

75
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,707
Yeah, that don't sound good at all.

76
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:13,165
Look, Nick, if you want to win in life,
you have to learn to focus

77
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,040
on what's important.

78
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:17,082
Well, my music is important.

79
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,040
Math is required. Music is elective.

80
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,332
Okay, but, sweetie,
the-the music makes him happy.

81
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,415
Yeah, but he ain't gonna make no money
making music.

82
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:26,707
Well, I mean, there's a lot of
music people that make money, Chris.

83
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:27,790
Not playing the tuba.

84
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:31,040
Name one tuba player
that's living his life like it's golden.

85
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,749
Just one.

86
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,707
Have you ever heard
somebody in the band say,

87
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,249
"And on tuba is," and they introduce him?

88
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,249
Hey, hon, I think
you should focus on the math.

89
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,665
You should focus on the math.

90
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,457

Our outplacement officers

Lee, nobody can talk
to the vendors like I can.

107
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:42,665
Nobody has my relationships,
my history and my Rolodex.

108
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,749
Rolodex?

109
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,165
Classic O.G.

110
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:47,500
I love it.

111
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:52,040
You're really gonna do this
right before Christmas?

112
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,625
It's just business.

113
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,290
Listen, we know it's the holidays.

114
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,832
We want to give you something

115
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,916
to say thank you for your service.

116
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,458
Hey, don't nobody want your fleece.

117
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,124
Hey, you know what?
I'm-a take this fleece.

118
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,624
You know what I'm gonna do?

119
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:16,874
I'm gonna regift it, show you how much
contempt I have for your holiday fleece.

120
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:19,165
There for you.

121
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,291
Yeah.

122
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,833
Merry Christmas, brother.

123
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,375
Merry Christmas.

124
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,832
Who's next?

125
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:35,540
So I stopped the bleeding
on the night sort by 14%.

126
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,624
Great job as always, Carol. Right?

127
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,749
The regionals are gonna be
impressed by all this.

128
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:43,082
So, do you think
that they will consider me

129
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,457
for the director of operations position?

130
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:48,749
I feel like when the regionals come,
they'll see how we are the...

131
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,790
that we're the best distribution center
in the west.

132
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:55,124
Because of me and-and because of you.
Because of you.

133
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:59,165
And be... well, because of...
Mostly because of me, so...

134
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,749
can I count on your support?

135
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,374
If everything goes perfectly.

136
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,249
- Yes! Thank you.
- You got it.

137
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,457
- Good work.
- Thank you so much.

138
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,582
Thanks. Yes!

139
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,415
Hello, Mrs. Carver.

140
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:16,165
You are never gonna believe
what just happened.

141
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,082
Yeah, you know, I was gonna say
the same thing to you.

142
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,749
I did it. I-I got, I got Donald's support.

143
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,040
That's great, babe.

144
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,874
They'd be crazy not to promote you.

145
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:28,499
Chris, this is gonna be, like, an increase
in pay and-and more vacation time.

146
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,165
Hey, listen, um...

147
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,915
- something funny happened here today, too.
- Hang on. Hang on a...

148
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,457
There's a backup in the sort.

149
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:36,665
- I'm gonna call you back.
- Hey, Carol, listen...

150
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,540
I'll call you later. Okay, bye.

151
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,207
Yoo-hoo. Hi.

- Yes, you're being outplaced.

00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,374
Yes, I-I know.

157
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:53,624
I knew I was being outplaced,

158
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:58,915
but I didn't know that there was
an actual, officer that assisted you.

159
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,582
Yes, I'm here to help.
How are you feeling today?

160
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:06,207
Well, you know, I got that...
got that, outplaced feeling.

161
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,040
So is this what you do?

162
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,874
You help the fired people
leave their jobs?

00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,415
- RFPs.
- R...

164
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:14,415
- "Recently fired persons."
- Wow. Thank you, Kimmer.

165
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:17,125

I'm sorry. I'm sorry, honey.

177
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,999
- You look pretty, Mom.
- Aw, thank you, sweetie.

178
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,832
Hey, can you tell Joy and Nick
that we're across the street? -Yeah.

179
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,665
- And the pizza's on its way, okay?
- Okay.

180
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,124
- You ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

181
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,624
Okay, I think we should try pickleball.

182
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,499
Seriously, everybody's doing it.
Scott and Shelly are doing it.

183
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:40,249
And I think that we should get
those matching headbands and, um, shorts.

184
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,874
You look so good in those shorts.

185
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,624
And that way, we could do stuff together.

186
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,915
It'll be like we used to do.
You know how we used to do that?

187
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:48,415
We would dress up and we would go out
and do, like, an activity.

188
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,624
- Hey, Carol. Hey.
- Yes, my darling?

189
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:51,833
Yes?

190
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,374
I got laid off.

191
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,457
Wait, what?

192
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:59,749
I got laid off.

193
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,415
Lee sold the company,
and they cut the sales division in half,

194
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:03,749
and I was in the wrong half.

195
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,374
My God. Wait, when did this happen?

196
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:07,624
This morning.

197
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,332
I didn't want to say anything about it
'cause you were so excited

198
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:13,374
talking about Donald and the promotion.

199
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,207
I just didn't want to ruin it, so...

200
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,582
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

201
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:19,749
I'm screwed.

202
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,665
No, you're not screwed.
You're not screwed.

203
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,957
We'll... we'll figure this out.

204
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,749
We will. -Listen, the kids
can't find out about this, okay?

205
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,999
What are you talking about? They love you.

206
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,249
They do, and they should know
what's going on.

207
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,708
No, I just don't want to ruin
the last Christmas.

208
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,957
"Last Christmas"?
What are you talking about?

209
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,957
Joy is moving out.

210
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,499
Nick is not that far behind, and...

211
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,124
My God, my little baby girl is almost
old enough to realize what's going on.

212
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,445
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

213
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:50,040
You got thrown a curveball, all right,
but this is not our last Christmas.

214
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,207
Okay?

215
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,624
It's okay. We're gonna figure it out.

216
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,916
- Are we?
- Yes, we are. We're gonna figure it out.

217
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,790
- All right.
- Ahoy, neighbors!

218
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,749
Permission to come aboard!

219
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,957
I got the good stuff!

220
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,290
Yeah, join us for a box of grog!

221
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,082
He means wine!

222
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,957
We'll be right over!

223
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,665
Give us two secs!

224
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,040
There's a box of wine, though.

225
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,749
Yeah.

226
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,957
Do you want to skip this?

227
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,457
- We can skip it.
- No, you heard him.

228
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,040
- He got the good stuff. Let's go.
- All right.

229
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,624
Could do with a glass of the good stuff.

230
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,540
I'll drink the box myself.

231
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:25,707
Maybe I'll feel better.

232
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,332
I'll give you some good stuff later.

233
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:30,332
- Okay, I'm-a hold you to that.
- Okay.

234
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,332
Aidan's school called.

235
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,540
Apparently, compared to
the other kids in his class,

236
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:43,207
he is testing off the charts in math.

237
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:45,332
You know, I saw an article online recently

238
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:48,916
that said a lot of sociopaths
were math prodigies.

239
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51,666
But not Aidan.

240
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,874
Well, I don't know about you guys, but
I'm so excited Candy Cane Lane is here.

241
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:59,249
- Yeah.
- The lights, the decorations,

242
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,540
the goodwill between neighbors.

243
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:03,082
I hear the competition
is different this year.

244
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:05,332
Hurry up, guys. It's about to start.

245
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,165
This is Prism 1.

246
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:09,500
Seeing the world through your eyes.

247
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,540
Hi. I'm Emerson Turner.

248
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,290
And I'm Kit Kleiman.

249
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,249
That's-that's new.

250
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,499
And we're hosting
the Candy Cane Lane Spectacular

251
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,665
live from beautiful El Segundo.

252
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,749
Only on Prism Cable.

253
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,790
Not only will there be
music, merrymaking...

254
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:28,999
And lights!

255
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,207
But there will be high stakes as well,

256
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,749
as the neighbors compete
for best decorated house,

257
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,332
and because of our sponsors...

258
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,707
Wait, sponsor?
We've never had a sponsor. What?

259
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:40,582
$100,000.

260
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,165
I'm sorry, what?

261
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,415
Shut up! -My...

262
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,124
$100,000?

263
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,499
Join us all week
as we cover the festivities,

264
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,165
starting with
our Santa's house lighting parade.

265
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:55,915
And ending with our spectacular finale
on Christmas Eve.

266
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,499
Christmas Eve!

267
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,540
Christmas Eve is only three days away,

268
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:02,415
so let the competition begin.

269
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,290
Ho ho ho.

270
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,040
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- Yeah.

271
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:12,499
This was so fun.

272
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,707
- I'm tired.
- Thank you so much.

273
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,624
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

274
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,290
It was so nice. It was so nice.

275
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,040
It was so ni... thank... okay, we're...

276
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,165
- Thank you so much.
- Yes, have a good night.

277
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,415
- We got to get Aidan...
- The wine was amazing.

278
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:24,374
Of course, we got to get Aidan to sleep.
Good night, everybody!

279
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,415
I need your brackets to mount a reindeer.

280
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:38,874
What?

281
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,249
Dad!

282
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,582
Dad, are you, are you serious?

283
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,500
Thank you, son.

284
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:58,624
I've got a supplier.

285
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,624
I can hook you up with more
if you need it.

286
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,249
That's my girl.

287
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,582
What is all this?

288
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,207
- What is this?
- What do you mean, what is all that?

289
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,957
You said to get a plan, so I got a plan.

290
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,290
Okay.

291
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:12,582
Hey, look, I know it looks like a lot,
but I got to do something spectacular,

292
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:13,749
something they've never seen before.

293
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,249
- Okay, well...
- This'll be...

294
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,999
I was talking about
a plan for after Christmas.

295
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,915
Yes, like

296
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,207
maybe update your LinkedIn,

297
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:26,707
telling your vendors, letting people know
you're back on the market.

298
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,332
You know, we good, we good.

299
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,624
- You know why?
- Why?

300
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,540
'Cause I'm gonna win Candy Cane Lane.

301
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:34,332
My love, I know that this is something
that's so important to you,

302
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:39,540
but I think that you need to consider
the idea that you might not win.

303
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:43,332
Well, I also might not not win.

304
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:46,374
Okay, you know what?
Let's go, guys. Come on. Let's go.

305
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,290
- Let's go to school.
- Yes. Get the show on the road.

306
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,249
Hey, can you bring Holly to school today?

307
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,665
I don't know if I can do that
because I got a lot of stuff to do today.

308
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:55,415
I'm really busy.
I got to get a thousand icicles.

309
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:58,374
- God, okay, well, I got to go to work.
- Okay, touché.

310
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,457
- Touché.
- Okay, you're going to work.

311
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,540
- You got it?
- Okay. I will handle it.

312
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:02,790
- Thank you.
- Thank you, my love.

313
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:04,249
- All right, I love you.
- Love you, too.

314
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,957
Bye-bye!

315
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:09,082
Yeah, I'm not going to school, am I?

316
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,415
Don't be ridiculous. Of course you're not.

317
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,291
Already?

318
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,541
You got to be freaking kidding me.

319
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,707
But our decorations are handmade.

320
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,165
They'll see how hard you worked.

321
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,790
That's better than buying stuff.

322
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:48,875
Hard work? Nobody cares anymore.

323
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:51,791
And crap beats quality every time.

324
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,540
Hard work.

325
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,665
I'm sorry, you're old enough
to know the truth.

326
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:59,874
Whenever somebody says to you,
"It's just business,"

327
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,665
then you're the one getting f...

328
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,832
Fleeced. Fleeced.

329
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,707
"Fleeced"?

330
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:06,915
Fleeced, yes.

331
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,999
Yeah, fleeced.
You're the one getting fleeced.

332
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,916
I got fleeced yesterday.

333
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,916
And I did not like it.

334
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:20,207
Who cares about craftsmanship
or relationships?

335
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,249
You spent your whole career developing.

336
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,583
- Toss you out like cheap plastic...
- Dad. Stop!

337
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:56,124
Holly, look at this.

338
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,707
Wow.

339
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:45,915
This is unbelievable.

340
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,249
- Wow.
- This is amazing.

341
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,749
Look at this detail here.

342
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,124
- I know.
- Look at this thing. It looks like...

343
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,624
- Merry Christmas!
- Sh... Hey.

344
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,165
I'm so sorry.

345
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,249
I didn't mean to scare you.

346
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,582
Who am I kidding? Of course I did.

347
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,499
What's Christmas without a little terror?

348
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,165
I'm Pepper.

349
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,124
Hey, Pepper.

350
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,082
Hey, h-how long
has this place been here?

351
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:10,124
Well, we're what the kids call
a pop-up.

352
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,499
You know, here today, gone tomorrow. Pop.

353
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,915
Very Instagrammable. Go on, take an elfie.

354
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:17,832
Sorry, sugarplum.

355
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,915
Please, please be careful with that.

356
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:22,082
That's very precious to me.

357
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,457
They look so real.

358
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:25,665
Don't they?

359
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,540
Each one has their own story.

360
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:28,832
So what's yours?

361
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,624
Indoor, outdoor? Flashy, classy?

362
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:31,790
Mistletoe, mistle-no?

363
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:34,207
We are looking to kick some ass.

364
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,415
That's not what she meant to say, Holly.

365
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,832
Children always say what they mean.

366
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,874
It's adults you can't trust.

367
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,749
See, I like her.

368
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,957
Yeah.

369
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,624
Listen.

370
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,915
Every year, our block
goes all out for Christmas.

371
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,290
You have my attention.

372
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:50,790
And this year,
the stakes are higher than ever.

373
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,082
Keeping up with the Joneses.

374
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,165
It's actually gonna be televised
this year.

375
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,790
Cable? Streaming? The Internet?

376
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,540
Probably all of that.

377
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,790
This year, the competition's got
a lot of money on the line,

378
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,207
and I mean a lot of money.

379
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,832
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold your reindeers.

380
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,290
Christmas is not about money.

381
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,707
I agree. Christmas is...

382
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,249
It has never been about money.

383
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,915
Christmas is not about money.

384
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,165
- It's not.
- Except that it is.

385
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:15,290
I'm just kidding. Of course it is.

386
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,707
'Tis the reason for the season.

387
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,790

I need to know that you understand
the true meaning of Christmas.

404
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,749
Are you kidding me? I'm Mr. Christmas.

405
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,290
Christmas is about giving.

406
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,999
And Christmas is about
the power of a child's imagination.

407
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,415
And it's about giving the least popular
reindeer with the red nose

408
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,457
a chance to be great.

409
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:32,499
Unless you want to go the religious angle.

410
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,582
Jesus Christ, no.

411
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:35,790
I'll ring you up.

412
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:38,166

It's beginning to look a lot like
Christmas here in El Segundo.

445
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,207
I'm Kit Kleiman.

446
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:59,124
We're still doing that.

447
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:03,582
And I'm Emerson Turner, and welcome
to opening night here on Candy Cane Lane

448
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:05,624
- where the temperature is cooling off...
- Ooh.

449
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:07,249
But the competition, my friends,

450
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,915
the competition is heating up.

451
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:12,665
And let me just say how thrilled I am
to be here with you.

452
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:15,207
And I am also here with you.

453
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:19,915
Well, the 1300 block of Acacia Avenue
is about to get lit.

454
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,290
And with good reason, 'cause this year,

455
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:30,124
the residents of Candy Cane Lane
are competing for a $100,000 prize.

456
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:31,665
Well, this is exciting.

457
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:33,832
I've been looking forward to this
all year.

458
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:36,165
And you know what,
I've been looking forward to this, boy,

459
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:38,040
ever since I graduated top of my class

460
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:39,832
from the Columbia Graduate School
of Journalism.

461
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:40,915
Really?

462
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:43,165
No. So let's kick it off by sending it

463
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:46,999
to our Prism Cable News meteorologist
Sunny Roberts.

464
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,332
<i>Can I give y'all some advice?</i>

465
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:53,999
When y'all brought the spaceship out
and mixed it in with Santa Claus,

466
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,082
it screamed, "I don't want to win."

467
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:57,874
I'm sorry, who is that?

468
00:24:57,875 --> 00:25:00,624
That's my nephew Josh!

469
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:02,332

572

Hey, teenagers, how do you block

I'll tell you if you tell me

00:31:18,958 --> 00:31:21,082
Hey, what are you listening to?

It's... I wrote it.

You want to hear it from the beginning?

No.

583
00:31:25,625 --> 00:31:27,374

- No!
- Chris!

590
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:58,728
Hey, Carol, we've been vandalized.
Somebody trashed the whole...

591
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:02,249
I know we are not doing live swans.

592
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,624
No.

593
00:32:04,625 --> 00:32:06,624
What the hell's all of this?

594
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:07,749
I don't know.

595
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:11,082
But you mean to tell me
that you will not let the kids get a dog,

596
00:32:11,083 --> 00:32:13,040
but you're gonna get swans?

597
00:32:13,041 --> 00:32:14,124
These guys need to go.

598
00:32:14,125 --> 00:32:16,416
I didn't do this.
I didn't bring these back here.

599
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:21,415
But now that you mention it, live animals
would make a hell of a statement.

600
00:32:21,416 --> 00:32:22,624
No, no.

601
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:25,290
I am squashing the swans, okay?

602
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:26,957
And I do not want to be late
for regionals.

603
00:32:26,958 --> 00:32:28,832
Get these out of here. -O-Okay,
I'll get rid, I'll get rid of 'em.

604
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:30,582
- It's in the pool. That's disgusting.
- Okay, I'm gonna...

605
00:32:30,583 --> 00:32:32,457
- I'll get rid of 'em.
- Please, please.

606
00:32:32,458 --> 00:32:35,332
Hey, hey, little swan.

607
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:36,499
Hi.

608
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,582
All right, listen, you swans,
y'all have to get up out of here.

609
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:39,874
Let's go. Let's go.

610
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:41,249
Come on.

611
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,000
Hey! Hey!

612
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:54,915
Don't worry about this, honey.
I can fix this.

613
00:32:54,916 --> 00:32:57,957
- Hey, Bruce. Hey, Tricky Bruce.
- What?

614
00:32:57,958 --> 00:32:59,624
Yeah, I know you know
what happened to my ornaments.

615
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:00,707
Don't act like you don't know.

616
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:01,790
Hundred percent don't know
what you're talking about.

617
00:33:01,791 --> 00:33:02,874
Don't act like you don't know
what happened.

618
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:04,124
You know exactly what happened
to them ornaments.

619
00:33:04,125 --> 00:33:05,457
I have no idea
what you're talking about, Chris.

620
00:33:05,458 --> 00:33:06,707
And you know what just dawned on me?

621
00:33:06,708 --> 00:33:09,999
That whoever did it wasn't working alone,
Scott and Shelly.

622
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,999
- Why would we do it?
- Look, the only thing I know is

623
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,082
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You know exactly what I'm talking about.

624
00:33:14,083 --> 00:33:15,999
And if you don't know
what I'm talking about,

625
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,207
maybe you should ask Scott and Shelly
what I'm talking about,

626
00:33:18,208 --> 00:33:20,082
'cause I think they might know.

627
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:22,207
Chris, we didn't do anything.

628
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,249
We didn't do anything.
Did you guys do anything?

629
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,415
- No.
- I did nothing.

630
00:33:25,416 --> 00:33:27,999
- Okay.
- Stop looking at me like that, man.

631
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,665
- My God.
- Creeping me out, man.

632
00:33:30,666 --> 00:33:34,999
Yeah, you see, it's all good holiday cheer
till there's $100,000 on the line.

633
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,290
Then you see what happens
to the thin veneer of neighborly love?

634
00:33:37,291 --> 00:33:38,374
What are you gonna do, Dad?

635
00:33:38,375 --> 00:33:39,582
I'm gonna go back to that weird woman

636
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:41,332
and see if she can hook me up
with some replacement parts.

637
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:43,290
- Can I come?
- Don't you have school?

638
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:45,249
It's the last day.

639
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:49,040
We're watching <i>Frozen</i>
in like three different classes.

640
00:33:49,041 --> 00:33:51,721
You know, you're very, very cute,
and you're also very manipulative.

641
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:56,249
Hey, I don't know about this bird.

642
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,082
Well, Pepper did say it was good luck.

643
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:00,166
Not so far.

644
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:15,915
What was that?

645
00:34:15,916 --> 00:34:18,000
My God.

646
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:52,250
Hello?

647
00:34:55,708 --> 00:34:57,250
You in here?

648
00:35:00,791 --> 00:35:02,458
Hello?!

649
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:11,457
- What are you doing?
- Hey! Ooh.

650
00:35:11,458 --> 00:35:12,749
You have to stop scaring me like that!

651
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:15,582
Looks like someone's been
rubbing the partridge.

652
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:17,790
What? No.

653
00:35:17,791 --> 00:35:20,707
I know a rubbed partridge
when I see one, sir.

654
00:35:20,708 --> 00:35:24,290
I rubbed it like
the instructions said to rub it.

655
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:27,040
- Weird instructions, by the way.
- What was your wish? Fame?

656
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,290
No, fortune.

657
00:35:29,291 --> 00:35:31,290
No, no, no, that is right.

658
00:35:31,291 --> 00:35:32,999
You want to win a contest,

659
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,165
because Christmas is all about winning,
isn't it, Chris?

660
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:37,790
- Look, lady...
- Pepper.

661
00:35:37,791 --> 00:35:41,624
Look, Pepper, somebody stole my
ornaments, and I need some replacements.

662
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:43,457
I'm sorry. It's like I told you.

663
00:35:43,458 --> 00:35:45,874
Each one of those trees is unique.

664
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:50,457
If you lost your ornaments,
I'm afraid you have to find them yourself.

665
00:35:50,458 --> 00:35:52,915
I didn't lose my ornaments.
Somebody stole 'em.

666

667

697
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:26,165
Are you real?

698
00:37:26,166 --> 00:37:29,582
As real as you. Least I was.

699
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:32,832
We all were until we fell into
that elf's sick, twisted trap.

700
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,999
Yeah, don't get screwed like us, man.
It ain't good.

701
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,790
No, Christmas is wonderful once a year.

702
00:37:37,791 --> 00:37:39,624
But every day? It's a nightmare.

703
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:43,290
I've been eating nothing
but chestnuts for ten years.

704
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:44,582
I'm right clogged up.

705
00:37:44,583 --> 00:37:47,374
The relentless good cheer,
these ridiculous outfits.

706
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:48,499
And it never ends.

707
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,749
I light the lamp. I blow it out.

708
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:51,874
Light it, blow it out again.

709
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:54,790
- Light, blow, light, blow, light, blow...
- Stop it!

710
00:37:54,791 --> 00:37:56,707
I would love to, Cordelia.

711
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:58,874
So Pepper's a real elf?

712
00:37:58,875 --> 00:38:00,749
Pepper was Santa's favorite,

713
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,457
but any mistake and she'd put you
on the naughty list.

714
00:38:03,458 --> 00:38:05,290
Her standards were impossible.

715
00:38:05,291 --> 00:38:06,999
One strike and you're out.

716
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,165
So Santa demoted her all the way down
to the reindeer stable.

717
00:38:10,166 --> 00:38:11,499
Ew.

718
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,749
And then she just quit.

719
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,457
Who quits Santa?

720
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:18,415
Now she's made it her mission to punish
anyone who makes it onto her naughty list.

721
00:38:18,416 --> 00:38:19,957
And I got news for you, fellas.

722
00:38:19,958 --> 00:38:21,790
We're all on the naughty list.

723
00:38:21,791 --> 00:38:23,707
But the benefit is
I do have a two-inch waist.

724
00:38:23,708 --> 00:38:25,874
Guys, enough of the backstory.
Not enough time.

725
00:38:25,875 --> 00:38:27,915
There's not enough time.
She'll be back soon.

726
00:38:27,916 --> 00:38:30,540
Quick, guv, what'd she sell you?

727
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:33,082
She sold me some decorations,
the 12 days of Christmas.

728
00:38:33,083 --> 00:38:34,457
♪ 12 drummers drumming ♪

729
00:38:34,458 --> 00:38:36,915
♪ 11 pipers piping,
ten lords a-leaping... ♪

730
00:38:36,916 --> 00:38:39,499
- Stop it!
- -Please!

731
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,790
Did she tell you what to do,
a task of some kind?

732
00:38:41,791 --> 00:38:44,207
There's usually a very bad rhyme involved.

733
00:38:44,208 --> 00:38:46,457
- Yeah, she...
- Yeah, it was,

734
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:50,332
"Before the old clock tower dings,

735
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:52,415
- you must collect the golden rings."
- "The golden rings."

736
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:55,665
♪ Five gold rings. ♪

737
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:59,457
Find the five gold rings
before the clock tower dings.

738
00:38:59,458 --> 00:39:03,165
That bell only chimes
on Christmas Eve at 8:00.

739
00:39:03,166 --> 00:39:04,749
That's in three days.

740
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,207
Hurry, man, get those rings.

741
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:07,707
It's the only way to save yourself.

742
00:39:07,708 --> 00:39:11,208
If you fail...

743
00:39:13,875 --> 00:39:15,165
- Yes?
- What are you doing?

744
00:39:15,166 --> 00:39:16,415
Sh... Hey.

745
00:39:16,416 --> 00:39:18,250
You got to stop doing that!

746
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,125
What's going on?

747
00:39:22,291 --> 00:39:25,582
Um, we were just,
admiring this craftsmanship.

748
00:39:25,583 --> 00:39:27,707
It's very lifelike.

749
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:30,832
Interesting choice of words.

750
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:32,499
Yeah.

751
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,207
- We got to find those rings, Dad.
- No.

752
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:38,832
I bet you that was just
some hidden camera practical joke thing

753
00:39:38,833 --> 00:39:41,165
that some idiots want
to put on the Internet.

754
00:39:41,166 --> 00:39:42,415
We're not chasing any rings.

755
00:39:43,916 --> 00:39:45,583
Shoot.

756
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:52,165
Well, what are you waiting for?

757
00:39:52,166 --> 00:39:53,540
Get the ring.

758
00:39:53,541 --> 00:39:55,124
Holly, this is crazy.

759
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:56,290
What if it's not?

760
00:39:56,291 --> 00:39:58,332
What's the worst that could happen?

761
00:39:58,333 --> 00:40:00,665
If it's not real, you've got the ring.

762
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:02,708
But if it is, you've got the ring!

763
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:18,124
All right, easy there, chickens.

764
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:19,708
Easy.

765
00:40:21,291 --> 00:40:23,540
All right, little chickens.

766
00:40:23,541 --> 00:40:25,041
Chick-chick-chick...

767
00:40:26,041 --> 00:40:27,041
Yes!

768
00:40:48,041 --> 00:40:49,457
Look at this. Look at this.

769
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:54,374
Hey. I had the weirdest morning.

770
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:55,957
Yeah, I bet not as weird as mine.

771
00:40:55,958 --> 00:40:59,082
No, I'm about to meet the regionals,
and there's egg on my face.

772
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:01,249
And I mean it. Like, on my suit, too.

773
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,332
Well, baby, you'll crush that.
But, hey, listen.

774
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:06,207
This is gonna sound kind of crazy,
but about those ornaments?

775
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:07,832
I don't think Bruce took them.

776
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:09,540
It's some kind of test.

777
00:41:09,541 --> 00:41:11,124
I got to get all the rings
by Christmas Eve.

778
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:12,374
It's the only way to win the contest.

779
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:14,665
Chris, I was attacked by birds
this morning.

780
00:41:14,666 --> 00:41:16,582
What? What kind of birds?

781
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:20,832
Listen, they were laying eggs
out of the sky.

782
00:41:20,833 --> 00:41:22,540
What kind of bird does that?

783
00:41:22,541 --> 00:41:24,540
That is no way to perpetuate a species,

784
00:41:24,541 --> 00:41:26,165
and it was, like, all over my suit,
my brand-new...

785
00:41:26,166 --> 00:41:27,624
Six geese a-laying!

786
00:41:27,625 --> 00:41:28,957
Were there rings?

787
00:41:28,958 --> 00:41:32,082
Gold rings?
If you see a gold ring, grab it!

788
00:41:32,083 --> 00:41:34,457
- I got to go. I love you.
- Hey, Carol...

789
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:35,832
I got to go. Okay.

790
00:41:35,833 --> 00:41:37,250
Wait.

791
00:41:38,875 --> 00:41:41,040
Something's going down at Mom's work.

792
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:43,874
Well, think there's a ring?

793
00:41:43,875 --> 00:41:45,624
Only one way to find out.

794
00:41:54,916 --> 00:41:57,457
All right, my little French hens,

795
00:41:57,458 --> 00:42:00,124
time to wreak some havoc, cause some chaos

796
00:42:00,125 --> 00:42:03,207
and make them suffer
as only the French can.

797
00:42:03,208 --> 00:42:04,582
<i>Vive la résistance!</i>

798
00:42:08,958 --> 00:42:11,582
Well, what are you waiting for? <i>Allez!</i>

799
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,833
Go, Pierre. Go, Jacques.

800
00:42:16,541 --> 00:42:18,999
By alternating packaging flow,

801
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,540
we avoid backups
that could lead to costly ware...

802
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:30,165
warehouse shutdowns.

803
00:42:30,166 --> 00:42:31,582
Right this way!

804
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:33,249
You see how...

805
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,249
Let's go that way.

806
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:36,790
The sorting is unbelievable.

807
00:42:36,791 --> 00:42:38,457
Sort, sort, sort, sort.

808
00:42:38,458 --> 00:42:40,458
We'll go that way. Go ahead, go ahead.

809
00:42:44,875 --> 00:42:46,499
Business all the way through.

810
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,374
Wait till you see what she has to say.
It's pretty incredible.

811
00:42:48,375 --> 00:42:50,332
Go ahead, Carol.

812
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:52,707
So, packing peanuts.

813
00:42:52,708 --> 00:42:55,290
Ours are completely biodegradable.

814
00:43:00,208 --> 00:43:02,499
They are plant-based and s...

815
00:43:03,791 --> 00:43:05,457
sourced and...

816
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:08,375
Chicken.

817
00:43:09,625 --> 00:43:11,749
Our packing peanuts are made of chicken?

818
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:13,082
No.

819
00:43:13,083 --> 00:43:14,874
No, no. That would be crazy.

820
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:30,790
I got this.

821
00:43:34,291 --> 00:43:35,374
I got it!

822
00:43:35,375 --> 00:43:37,749
I got it!

823
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:39,665
My God. Okay.

824
00:43:49,291 --> 00:43:51,165
- Carol?
- Yes?

825
00:43:51,166 --> 00:43:52,332
What is the problem?

826
00:43:52,333 --> 00:43:54,457
Ex... Y-Yes!

827
00:43:54,458 --> 00:43:55,790
This is a problem.

828
00:43:55,791 --> 00:43:59,165
I wanted to demonstrate what can happen.

829
00:43:59,166 --> 00:44:00,832
Bottlenecks.

830
00:44:00,833 --> 00:44:02,082
Unpredictability.

831
00:44:02,083 --> 00:44:04,165
- Chickens.
- Chickens.

832
00:44:04,166 --> 00:44:07,415
You would avoid all of that
if you came to our warehouse

833
00:44:07,416 --> 00:44:09,707
and do my protocols.

834
00:44:14,166 --> 00:44:16,166
Yes!

835
00:44:17,166 --> 00:44:19,083
Yeah?

836
00:44:21,791 --> 00:44:23,333
Yeah.

837
00:44:25,583 --> 00:44:26,874
Come on. Thank you.

838
00:44:26,875 --> 00:44:28,499
Thank you so much.

839
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,832
Thank you, seriously.

840
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:32,832
- Get it out. Yeah. Thank you.
- Yeah.

841
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:44,957
Where are we going, Dad?

842
00:44:44,958 --> 00:44:48,207
We're going around back
'cause I need some answers.

843
00:44:48,208 --> 00:44:49,624
The sign says she's not there.

844
00:44:49,625 --> 00:44:51,958
I'm not talking about her.

845
00:44:54,875 --> 00:44:57,082
I don't like this.

846
00:44:57,083 --> 00:44:58,707
And are we breaking in?

847
00:44:58,708 --> 00:45:00,040
No, no, not at all.

848
00:45:00,041 --> 00:45:02,916
We are paying customers, all right?

849
00:45:12,875 --> 00:45:14,708
See, the door was wide open.

850
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:25,749
Go keep a look out front.

851
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:28,207
That's the kind of thing you say
when you're breaking in.

852
00:45:28,208 --> 00:45:29,708
Just do what I said.

853
00:45:34,416 --> 00:45:35,957
Hey.

854
00:45:35,958 --> 00:45:38,040
Wake up. Wake up.

855
00:45:38,041 --> 00:45:39,332
Wake up, everybody.

856
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:41,291
Wake up, wake up.

857
00:45:53,666 --> 00:45:55,582
Everybody.

858
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:58,332
I usually don't get up before 10:00.

859
00:45:58,333 --> 00:45:59,582
- Okay.
- What's up, man?

860
00:46:03,916 --> 00:46:05,582
Wake up.

861
00:46:05,583 --> 00:46:07,499
- Man.
- Okay, okay.

862
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,874
- We're here.
- Okay. Okay.

863
00:46:09,875 --> 00:46:12,499
All right, Tiny Tim,
now Pepper's messing with my family.

864
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,999
Blimey, that's what she does, guv.

865
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,915
Goes after the people you love most,
turns your whole life upside down.

866
00:46:18,916 --> 00:46:20,790
Well, it's not gonna work
because I'm calling this off.

867
00:46:20,791 --> 00:46:21,999
This has to stop.

868
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,415
Stop?

869
00:46:23,416 --> 00:46:25,290
You can't make it stop.

870
00:46:25,291 --> 00:46:26,832
You made your wish. You're in it now.

871
00:46:26,833 --> 00:46:28,332
Yeah.
That's how she gets you, man.

872
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:30,374
Tells you you can get a wish.

873
00:46:30,375 --> 00:46:33,082
Only you have to complete
some crazy, stupid, impossible challenge.

874
00:46:33,083 --> 00:46:35,540
- Well, why me?
- Why any of us?

875
00:46:35,541 --> 00:46:36,957
Because we took the bait.

876
00:46:36,958 --> 00:46:38,790
Anyone can make one mistake,

877
00:46:38,791 --> 00:46:41,499
and then you're cursed
and no one can help you.

878
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:46,207
She's evil but needy like a cat you bought
and raised but hates your guts.

879
00:46:46,208 --> 00:46:48,832
Well, she sent me looking for gold,
frankincense and myrrh.

880
00:46:48,833 --> 00:46:50,332
I mean, gold was easy, obviously.

881
00:46:50,333 --> 00:46:51,874
I have a ton of that at my house.

882
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:53,665
But what even is that other stuff?

883
00:46:53,666 --> 00:46:56,040
I went to every Sephora I could find.

884
00:46:56,041 --> 00:46:58,707
I found plenty of Fenty but no myrrh.
No myrrh!

885
00:46:58,708 --> 00:47:01,165
And she made me dress up
as a New York City cop

886
00:47:01,166 --> 00:47:04,207
to rescue my estranged wife
from a Japanese-owned high-rise

887
00:47:04,208 --> 00:47:05,832
being attacked by terrorists.

888
00:47:05,833 --> 00:47:07,165
What? <i>Die Hard?</i>

889
00:47:07,166 --> 00:47:08,374
That's not even a Christmas movie.

890
00:47:08,375 --> 00:47:10,874
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
It is the Christmas movie.

891
00:47:10,875 --> 00:47:12,790
- I literally cannot with you.
- Well, I can with you.

892
00:47:12,791 --> 00:47:14,624
- You won't.
- All right, then.

893
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:16,374
Guv, we all failed.

894
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,332
Now we're trapped in Christmas Village.

895
00:47:18,333 --> 00:47:21,874
Just like you'll be
if you don't find those rings.

896
00:47:21,875 --> 00:47:23,082
Like I'll be?

897
00:47:23,083 --> 00:47:25,207
I'm not gonna get trapped
in no Christmas Village.

898
00:47:25,208 --> 00:47:26,290
I didn't sign on for this.

899
00:47:26,291 --> 00:47:27,874
But you did.

900
00:47:27,875 --> 00:47:30,290
You literally signed on for this.

901
00:47:30,291 --> 00:47:32,374
Your receipt? There's, like,
a bunch of fine print at the bottom.

902
00:47:32,375 --> 00:47:33,457
You didn't read it?

903
00:47:33,458 --> 00:47:34,790
Nobody reads the fine print.

904
00:47:34,791 --> 00:47:36,124
Come on, brother.

905
00:47:36,125 --> 00:47:38,957
You got to read the fine print, man.
The terms of service are brutal.

906
00:47:38,958 --> 00:47:40,040
I know one thing:

907
00:47:40,041 --> 00:47:43,040
No elf is gonna shrink me down
into some freaky Christmas person.

908
00:47:43,041 --> 00:47:44,332
Hey!

909
00:47:44,333 --> 00:47:45,665
- Well, I am freaky.
- That's personal.

910
00:47:45,666 --> 00:47:47,582
Sorry. Sorry.

911
00:47:47,583 --> 00:47:49,124
'Cause I'm going after those rings.

912
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:51,374
- Whoa. Whoa!
- Holy Sonic the Hedgehog.

913
00:47:51,375 --> 00:47:52,499
I'm already on my way.

914
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:53,749
My God, he's doing it.

915
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:54,957
He's really doing it!

916
00:47:54,958 --> 00:47:56,332
That's a good sign, guv.

917
00:47:56,333 --> 00:47:57,999
You only need three more.

918
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,249

No!

No, no, no, no, no!

958
00:49:41,208 --> 00:49:42,749

00:50:05,083 --> 00:50:07,249
So that's how you want to play?

966
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:08,540
Game on.

967
00:50:08,541 --> 00:50:10,457
I'm the king of the...

Whoa-whoa-whoa! Hey! That was fun.

970
00:50:20,541 --> 00:50:22,040
All right, just don't take
any more turns like that.

00:50:39,791 --> 00:50:41,790
Two normal-size people
driving down the street.

973

Hello, neighbors. Hello, neighborhood.

974
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:52,082
Is this a broker version
of where we came from?

975
00:50:52,083 --> 00:50:53,874
I have motion sickness.

976
00:50:53,875 --> 00:50:55,124
Girl, don't throw up on me.

977
00:51:03,458 --> 00:51:08,458
At last, free from the torment
of eternal Christma...

978
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:19,624
Ew.

979
00:51:19,625 --> 00:51:22,083
I'm-a burn up everything in here.

980
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:26,707
- Run! -Paper tidal wave!
- Incoming!

981
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:27,999
Hop it! Hop it!

982
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,665
- My bustle!
- My everything.

983
00:51:32,208 --> 00:51:34,833
You're quite the home decorator, Holly.

984
00:51:41,625 --> 00:51:44,207
What is this,
some sort of butcher's chart?

985
00:51:44,208 --> 00:51:46,874
My God, it's Operation!

986
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:48,582
Yo, I love Operation, dawg.

987
00:51:48,583 --> 00:51:50,665
I am flawless. I never get shocked.

988
00:51:50,666 --> 00:51:51,832
Watch this, y'all.

989
00:51:51,833 --> 00:51:53,541
Gary!

990
00:51:54,625 --> 00:51:55,707
- No.
- S-Sweeney Todd!

991
00:51:55,708 --> 00:51:58,165
- My God, Gary, are you okay?
- Do I look okay?

992
00:51:58,166 --> 00:52:01,249
Ay. Ay. Ay. Ay.

993
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:03,666
I actually think it's an improvement.

994
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:11,332
Hey, hold up.

995
00:52:11,333 --> 00:52:12,832
This is important.

Dad, come on, seriously?

997
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,290
Do you have any idea
how bad that could've been?

998
00:52:18,291 --> 00:52:21,040
- I can explain.
- And why were there chickens?

999
00:52:21,041 --> 00:52:22,290
Did you bring the chickens?

1000
00:52:22,291 --> 00:52:23,790
No.

1001
00:52:23,791 --> 00:52:25,208
Well, kinda, yeah.

1002
00:52:26,291 --> 00:52:29,250
My God.

1003
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:31,540

spending this time looking for a job.

00:52:39,583 --> 00:52:41,582
Why Dad looking for another job?

1008
00:52:41,583 --> 00:52:43,457
Did you quit?

1009
00:52:43,458 --> 00:52:44,624
You got fired?

1010
00:52:44,625 --> 00:52:46,665
No, I got laid off.

1011
00:52:46,666 --> 00:52:48,915

because I didn't want to ruin Christmas.

Seriously, fine.

00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,290
Check out the new whip, everybody.

1048
00:54:06,291 --> 00:54:09,249
Someone order a cab?

1049
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:10,415
Pip!

1050
00:54:10,416 --> 00:54:12,374
Hi-ho, cheerio, Holly.

1051
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:14,540
Okay, Chris...

1052
00:54:14,541 --> 00:54:15,915
what are these?

1053
00:54:15,916 --> 00:54:18,832
Hey, everybody, this is my wife Carol.

1054
00:54:18,833 --> 00:54:20,749
- Hello.
- ♪ Here we come a-caroling ♪

1055
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:22,832
- ♪ Among the leaves so green. ♪
- No.

1056
00:54:22,833 --> 00:54:24,915
Nope. That is weird.

1057
00:54:24,916 --> 00:54:26,790
And-and this is my son Nick.

1058
00:54:26,791 --> 00:54:28,582
♪ Jolly old Saint Nicholas ♪

1059
00:54:28,583 --> 00:54:30,582
♪ Lean your ear this way. ♪

1060
00:54:30,583 --> 00:54:32,207
And you guys remember Holly.

1061
00:54:32,208 --> 00:54:35,165
♪ The holly and the ivy. ♪

1062
00:54:35,166 --> 00:54:36,915
And this is my oldest daughter Joy.

1063
00:54:36,916 --> 00:54:39,708
- ♪ Joy to the world. ♪
- Wow.

1064
00:54:40,791 --> 00:54:41,915
Wait.

1065
00:54:41,916 --> 00:54:43,249
Whoa.

1066
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:45,249
We're all named after Christmas stuff?

1067
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:47,665
- My God.
- Seriously?

1068
00:54:47,666 --> 00:54:49,540
Just now figuring this out?

1069
00:54:49,541 --> 00:54:51,207
I have to admit that was my idea.

1070
00:54:51,208 --> 00:54:53,499
- Yeah, it was all him.
- I kind of talked Mom into that.

1071
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,207
He did.
Chris, can I talk to you for a second?

1072
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:56,374
She's talking through gritted teeth.

1073
00:54:56,375 --> 00:54:57,499
- You know what that means.
- We can talk right now.

1074
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,332
Think we should do it a little privately.

1075
00:54:59,333 --> 00:55:01,040
Just kind of step away for a second.

1076
00:55:01,041 --> 00:55:02,290
Someone's in trouble.

1077
00:55:02,291 --> 00:55:05,415
No, no one's in trouble.

1078
00:55:05,416 --> 00:55:08,249
What are those and why are they talking?

1079
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:10,415
They're little Christmas people.

1080
00:55:10,416 --> 00:55:11,957
Yes, I can tell, but that's insane.

1081
00:55:11,958 --> 00:55:13,790
I mean, do you wind them up?
Is there a battery?

1082
00:55:13,791 --> 00:55:14,874
I don't got no battery, but you can check.

1083
00:55:14,875 --> 00:55:15,999
No, there's no battery.

1084
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,707
They're-they're little Christmas people
that have come to life.

1085
00:55:18,708 --> 00:55:21,082
- It seems scary to me.
- What's scary about it?

1086
00:55:21,083 --> 00:55:23,374
They're talking and they're little, and
that little one keeps flirting with me.

1087
00:55:23,375 --> 00:55:25,749
Hey, I'm scary at first, baby, but...

1088
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:27,749
I'm telling you right now,
you say one more thing,

1089
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:30,290
- I'm gonna flick you into next Christmas.
- Ooh, girl.

1090
00:55:30,291 --> 00:55:31,707
You smell good.

1091
00:55:31,708 --> 00:55:32,915
You don't think this is amazing?

1092
00:55:32,916 --> 00:55:34,624
No, it doesn't feel magical.
It feels terrifying.

1093
00:55:34,625 --> 00:55:36,624
Please don't touch that! Don't touch it.

1094
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:38,040
It's okay. They're...

1095
00:55:38,041 --> 00:55:39,165
It's safe.

1096
00:55:39,166 --> 00:55:40,582
You know what this is?

1097
00:55:40,583 --> 00:55:42,374
This is Christmas magic.

1098
00:55:42,375 --> 00:55:44,749
Well, I'm magic.
I don't know what Gary is. -

1099
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:47,125
Mostly, like, gross.

1100
00:55:48,125 --> 00:55:49,915
That's why I got to find three more rings

1101
00:55:49,916 --> 00:55:53,749
before this clock chimes eight times
on Christmas Eve.

1102
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:55,874
- Okay, so Popper...
- Pepper.

1103
00:55:55,875 --> 00:55:57,915
- Pepper. Pepper.
- It's Pepper. -It's Pepper.

1104
00:55:57,916 --> 00:56:00,874
Pepper will make your wish come true?

1105
00:56:00,875 --> 00:56:02,957
Right, then I win. I win the contest,

1106
00:56:02,958 --> 00:56:05,082
- and I get $100,000.
- Right.

1107
00:56:05,083 --> 00:56:08,332
Then this family has the best Christmas
of all the Christmases ever.

1108
00:56:08,333 --> 00:56:11,124
Except for the first one,
which was obviously a biggie.

1109
00:56:11,125 --> 00:56:12,540
That was special.

1110
00:56:12,541 --> 00:56:14,374
Wait, so that was your wish?

1111
00:56:14,375 --> 00:56:16,582
To win Candy Cane Lane?

1112
00:56:16,583 --> 00:56:17,915
Not, like... I don't know... world peace?

1113
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,874
- End hunger?
- End homelessness?

1114
00:56:19,875 --> 00:56:21,832
- Stop climate change?
- Save the polar bears?

1115
00:56:21,833 --> 00:56:23,874
- New Drake album?
- I love Drake.

1116
00:56:23,875 --> 00:56:25,082
Me, too.

1117
00:56:25,083 --> 00:56:27,290
Okay, point taken,
but I wasn't thinking like that.

1118
00:56:27,291 --> 00:56:28,665
I was thinking about my family.

1119
00:56:28,666 --> 00:56:30,707
That's why I love him.

1120
00:56:30,708 --> 00:56:32,582
But remember, if you fail...

1121
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,582
If you fail? What?

1122
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:37,082
If I fail, then I don't win.

1123
00:56:37,083 --> 00:56:38,957
But we don't have to worry about that.

1124
00:56:38,958 --> 00:56:41,165
'Cause I'm gonna find those rings.

1125
00:56:41,166 --> 00:56:42,332
- That's right.
- Yeah.

1126
00:56:42,333 --> 00:56:44,124
Hopefully.

1127
00:56:44,125 --> 00:56:46,416
What you mean, "hopefully"?
Stop being negative.

1128
00:56:48,125 --> 00:56:49,375
All right.

1129
00:56:56,125 --> 00:56:57,791
Stapler.

1130
00:57:01,166 --> 00:57:02,249
Stapler!

1131
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:04,332
Somebody better find that stapler.

1132
00:57:04,333 --> 00:57:05,958
Come on, guys, who used it last?

1133
00:57:13,625 --> 00:57:15,041
Over here, you little piper.

1134
00:57:16,791 --> 00:57:18,540
There you go.

1135
00:57:18,541 --> 00:57:20,083
You little suckers.

1136
00:57:21,083 --> 00:57:22,083
Gotcha.

1137
00:57:22,084 --> 00:57:23,624
Right there, lady.

1138
00:57:23,625 --> 00:57:25,374
There you go.

1139
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:27,207
All right.

1140
00:57:27,208 --> 00:57:29,040
So, we got two rings.

1141
00:57:29,041 --> 00:57:30,790
The first one is from...

1142
00:57:30,791 --> 00:57:32,374
♪ Two turtledoves ♪

1143
00:57:32,375 --> 00:57:35,624
Yep. And the second one
is from the three...

1144
00:57:35,625 --> 00:57:38,124
- ♪ Three French hens ♪
- I was gonna say it.

1145
00:57:38,125 --> 00:57:42,499
Okay. And we also met...

1146
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,082
- ♪ Seven swans a-swimming ♪
- And the six geese a...

1147
00:57:44,083 --> 00:57:45,374
♪ Six geese a-laying ♪

1148
00:57:45,375 --> 00:57:47,707
That looks just like her.
I'm-a burn her ass up.

1149
00:57:47,708 --> 00:57:49,790
Firepit that ass.

1150
00:57:49,791 --> 00:57:51,665
- Hey, Gary. No, no, no, no.
- Yes.

1151
00:57:51,666 --> 00:57:53,582
She going to hell.

1152
00:57:53,583 --> 00:57:55,499
Gary, put the fire down.

1153
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,165
Aw.

1154
00:57:57,166 --> 00:57:58,583
Question.

1155
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:02,082
So, Dad, Dad, who is this Pepper person?

1156
00:58:02,083 --> 00:58:04,374
She some old girlfriend or something?

1157
00:58:04,375 --> 00:58:06,790
'Cause I met one of those before,
and she was still mad.

1158
00:58:06,791 --> 00:58:07,999
She's not wrong.

1159
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,457
No, no, she's not an old girlfriend.

1160
00:58:10,458 --> 00:58:11,582
She's an elf.

1161
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:14,290
And she fights dirty,
so we got a new house rule:

1162
00:58:14,291 --> 00:58:16,499
Nobody can leave this house
till Christmas Eve.

1163
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,957
- What? -What? -Wait, what?
- Fine with me.

1164
00:58:17,958 --> 00:58:19,790
- Dad, I got band.
- You're gonna have to skip band.

1165
00:58:19,791 --> 00:58:23,124
Okay, more importantly, I have a
track meet, and a scout's gonna be there.

1166
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:24,832
Really? A scout?

1167
00:58:24,833 --> 00:58:26,375
From USC?

1168
00:58:28,333 --> 00:58:29,541
Yeah.

1169
00:58:30,541 --> 00:58:31,957
Okay, we can't skip that.

1170
00:58:31,958 --> 00:58:33,999
We're gonna all go to that together.
I'll just have to keep you safe.

1171
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,624
Yeah, and we're gonna do this as a family.

1172
00:58:35,625 --> 00:58:38,124
- We should split up.
- What do you mean, we should split up?

1173
00:58:38,125 --> 00:58:40,374
Have you ever watched a horror film?

1174
00:58:40,375 --> 00:58:42,957
When you split up, somebody dies.

1175
00:58:42,958 --> 00:58:44,124
That's true.

1176
00:58:44,125 --> 00:58:46,833
Yeah, a Black person always die first,
and all y'all Black.

1177
00:58:48,041 --> 00:58:51,124
I've searched online,
and no one has heard of this Pepper.

1178
00:58:51,125 --> 00:58:53,290
I think we should wake up tomorrow morning
and call the police.

1179
00:58:53,291 --> 00:58:54,874
And tell them what?

1180
00:58:54,875 --> 00:58:57,249
And tell them the truth,
that some sadistic little elf

1181
00:58:57,250 --> 00:58:59,665
is targeting our family.

1182
00:58:59,666 --> 00:59:01,915
Yeah, I just said it out loud.
It's not gonna work.

1183
00:59:01,916 --> 00:59:04,207
I just got to find those damn rings.

1184
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:06,915
Can you please forget the rings, Chris?

1185
00:59:06,916 --> 00:59:10,874
Seriously, just give the-the village back
and all those little tiny figurines

1186
00:59:10,875 --> 00:59:13,374
and say you're sorry
for whatever you did to piss her off,

1187
00:59:13,375 --> 00:59:14,540
and then be done with it.

1188
00:59:14,541 --> 00:59:17,082
It's just not that simple, Carol.

1189
00:59:17,083 --> 00:59:19,624
What are you not telling me?

1190
00:59:19,625 --> 00:59:21,957
There's something you're not telling me.
What are you not telling me?

1191
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:25,416
Carol, I just can't walk away.

1192
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:28,166
I have to.

1193
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:30,874
Okay.

1194
00:59:30,875 --> 00:59:31,999
Okay, I hear you.

1195
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,249
- Okay?
- Okay, yes.

1196
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:35,457
- All right.
- We made a promise to each other.

1197
00:59:35,458 --> 00:59:37,499
I'm glad you're saying this.
I was about to remind you.

1198
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:39,332
- You were gonna remind me?
- Before you said it.

1199
00:59:39,333 --> 00:59:40,874
- Okay.
- Okay.

1200
00:59:40,875 --> 00:59:42,790
- Okay?
- So... Yes, I'm gonna show up for you

1201
00:59:42,791 --> 00:59:44,457
because we are on the same team

1202
00:59:44,458 --> 00:59:46,207
- with each other.
- Yes, because of this, we show up.

1203
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:48,665
- We show up for each other.
- Right, we show up for each other.

1204
00:59:48,666 --> 00:59:52,957
No matter how strange, no matter
how crazy, we show up for each other.

1205
00:59:52,958 --> 00:59:54,499
I don't think those were in the vows.

1206
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:55,707
I'm putting that in now.

1207
00:59:55,708 --> 00:59:58,458
No matter how strange or how crazy,
we support each other. -Okay.

1208
00:59:59,541 --> 01:00:00,999
So I got your back.

1209
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,665
We're gonna get this done.

1210
01:00:02,666 --> 01:00:05,290
- And that's why I love you so much.
- I love you, too.

1211
01:00:05,291 --> 01:00:06,374
Mwah.

1212
01:00:06,375 --> 01:00:07,790
Give me another one.

1213
01:00:07,791 --> 01:00:10,832
Ooh, I love both of y'all right now.
How strange it 'bout to get?

1214
01:00:10,833 --> 01:00:12,957
- No! No!
- Hey.

1215
01:00:12,958 --> 01:00:15,124
- No! Chris.
- I'm-I'm-a handle him.

1216
01:00:15,125 --> 01:00:17,832
Don't cup me, brother,
not on the holiday.

1217
01:00:17,833 --> 01:00:21,290
I'm gonna d-deal with our little friend,
and I'll be back in a second.

1218
01:00:25,666 --> 01:00:26,915
All right, you got the letter?

1219
01:00:26,916 --> 01:00:28,916
- Yes.
- Disarmed.

1220
01:00:31,291 --> 01:00:32,541
Here we go.

1221
01:00:34,541 --> 01:00:36,665
You're very brave, Holly.

1222
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:38,540
Thank you, Pip.

1223
01:00:38,541 --> 01:00:40,082
I'm quite scared myself.

1224
01:00:40,083 --> 01:00:44,290
You see, Pepper will never stop
until she finds us.

1225
01:00:44,291 --> 01:00:46,124
It's okay.

1226
01:00:46,125 --> 01:00:47,749
We can protect each other.

1227
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:49,457
That's very kind of you, love.

1228
01:00:49,458 --> 01:00:51,249
I'm just so tiny, you see.

1229
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:53,124
I am, too.

1230
01:00:53,125 --> 01:00:55,583
Is that the mailbox?

1231
01:00:57,083 --> 01:00:58,791
It is.

1232
01:01:00,541 --> 01:01:02,291
We got this, love.

1233
01:01:03,375 --> 01:01:04,916
Thank you, Pip.

1234
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:12,874
Well, and Bob's your uncle.

1235
01:01:12,875 --> 01:01:14,790
I don't have an uncle.

1236
01:01:14,791 --> 01:01:17,207
- It's an idiom, love.
- What's that?

1237
01:01:17,208 --> 01:01:18,457
A figure of speech.

1238
01:01:18,458 --> 01:01:20,832
You ever hear of a writer
called Charlie Dickens?

1239
01:01:20,833 --> 01:01:22,249
No.

1240
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:24,041
My mother knew his mother.

1241
01:01:29,041 --> 01:01:30,625
Yoo-hoo.

1242
01:01:32,458 --> 01:01:35,750
Where are you,
my naughty little stocking stuffers?

1243
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:37,750
Pip?

1244
01:01:37,751 --> 01:01:40,332
Don't move. Don't even breathe.

1245
01:01:40,333 --> 01:01:41,415
Cordelia?

1246
01:01:41,416 --> 01:01:43,458
Lamp boy?

1247
01:01:46,625 --> 01:01:49,499
My Santa. It's a slum.

1248
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,166
What a downgrade.

1249
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:57,207
Come out, my little villagers.

1250
01:01:57,208 --> 01:01:58,457
It's me.

1251
01:01:58,458 --> 01:02:00,165
Where are you?

1252
01:02:00,166 --> 01:02:01,875
Hello?

1253
01:02:02,875 --> 01:02:04,165
Please, no.

1254
01:02:04,166 --> 01:02:05,833
I want to tell you a bedtime story.

1255
01:02:07,916 --> 01:02:09,957
But you need to come out.

1256
01:02:09,958 --> 01:02:11,708
Where are you?

1257
01:02:17,208 --> 01:02:19,957
I'm starting to get angry.

1258
01:02:19,958 --> 01:02:22,374
Feels like you're hiding on purpose.

1259
01:02:24,166 --> 01:02:25,666
Well, look at this.

1260
01:02:30,166 --> 01:02:31,832
Is that me?

1261
01:02:31,833 --> 01:02:33,791
I'm stunning.

1262
01:02:36,833 --> 01:02:38,375
All right, I'm leaving.

1263
01:02:39,458 --> 01:02:40,541
Or am I?

1264
01:02:43,375 --> 01:02:45,957
♪ Dashing through the snow ♪

1265
01:02:45,958 --> 01:02:47,790
♪ In a one-horse open sleigh ♪

1266
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:52,457
How's that song go again?

1267
01:02:52,458 --> 01:02:54,874
Does anyone know the lyrics?

1268
01:02:54,875 --> 01:02:56,457
♪ O'er the fields we go ♪

1269
01:02:57,541 --> 01:02:59,457
♪ Laughing all the way ♪

1270
01:02:59,458 --> 01:03:00,957
♪ Ha ha ha! ♪

1271
01:03:00,958 --> 01:03:03,416
Aha!

1272
01:03:05,791 --> 01:03:07,832
You know, he can't protect you forever.

1273
01:03:07,833 --> 01:03:10,874
He'll never find the last ring.

1274
01:03:10,875 --> 01:03:16,915
For the king of Christmas to save himself,
he needs the one upon the shelf.

1275
01:03:18,375 --> 01:03:21,791
I'll be back when the clock strikes 8:00.

1276
01:03:23,125 --> 01:03:26,333
And then you'll learn your tragic...

1277
01:03:27,791 --> 01:03:29,499
Destiny?

1278
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:30,749
Inevitable outcome?

1279
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:32,624
No, that's not it either.

1280
01:03:38,916 --> 01:03:41,874
Okay, girls, this is just a normal relay.

1281
01:03:41,875 --> 01:03:46,249
Yeah, totally normal for
a Notre Dame scout to be watching us.

1282
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:48,624
Joy, does your dad know?

1283
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:53,290
Hey, Joy!

1284
01:03:53,291 --> 01:03:54,499
We see you!

1285
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:56,415
Look, just don't worry about him.

1286
01:03:59,166 --> 01:04:02,124
I think those are those scouts
from USC up there.

1287
01:04:02,125 --> 01:04:03,915
- Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Take a look. See, right where...

1288
01:04:03,916 --> 01:04:05,500
That's them, right?

1289
01:04:07,583 --> 01:04:09,082
Is that them?

1290
01:04:09,083 --> 01:04:11,124
- Yes?
- Yeah.

1291
01:04:11,125 --> 01:04:12,915
- Yes. It is? It is?
- The middle one, the middle one.

1292
01:04:12,916 --> 01:04:14,125
Hey!

1293
01:04:16,083 --> 01:04:17,124
Yo!

1294
01:04:17,125 --> 01:04:18,665
- Fight on!
- Okay. My God.

1295
01:04:18,666 --> 01:04:19,833
Whoo!

1296
01:04:24,416 --> 01:04:25,790
Stop. Yeah.

1297
01:04:28,208 --> 01:04:30,333
I'm getting sick of this.

1298
01:04:31,416 --> 01:04:32,457
- Hello.
- Squawk.

1299
01:04:32,458 --> 01:04:34,499
Clock's ticking, naughty chicken.

1300
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:37,124
Polly doesn't just want a cracker.
She's after all of you.

1301
01:04:37,125 --> 01:04:39,707
No Carver is safe. No Carver is safe.

1302
01:04:39,708 --> 01:04:42,124
What is that?

1303
01:04:42,125 --> 01:04:44,832
Some prank call, like I don't have
enough problems. -

1304
01:04:44,833 --> 01:04:46,916
Sounds like a parrot.

1305
01:04:48,375 --> 01:04:49,666
That's it.

1306
01:04:50,833 --> 01:04:52,957
- The birds. -What?
- Birds?

1307
01:04:52,958 --> 01:04:54,166
The calling birds.

1308
01:04:56,375 --> 01:04:59,124
- She's messing with us.
- Okay.

1309
01:04:59,125 --> 01:05:01,082
- What do we do?
- Look, hey.

1310
01:05:01,083 --> 01:05:02,999
Take these binoculars,
look around the crowd.

1311
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,124
- You spot anything, say something.
- On it.

1312
01:05:05,125 --> 01:05:07,565
- You think she's here?
- She could be. She could be anywhere.

1313
01:05:09,208 --> 01:05:10,499
Hey.

1314
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,415
Hey, look at that.
Nick, that's your math teacher.

1315
01:05:12,416 --> 01:05:15,415
- No, it's not.
- Mr. Benedetto. Hey. Hi.

1316
01:05:15,416 --> 01:05:17,790
My God, sweetheart. Hey.

1317
01:05:17,791 --> 01:05:19,415
He's probably excited 'cause
you're doing so well in math, sweetheart.

1318
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:20,999
- Yeah, I'm doing, I'm doing good in music.
- Yeah?

1319
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,707
He's coming to say congratulations.

1320
01:05:22,708 --> 01:05:24,290
Hey! Hi there.

1321
01:05:24,291 --> 01:05:26,749
- I see you. Hi.
- Okay. Okay.

1322
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:28,749
- I'll be right there.
- Hey.

1323
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:30,500
Where's Nick?

1324
01:06:39,041 --> 01:06:41,457
- There she goes. There she goes.
- Come on, Joy!

1325
01:06:41,458 --> 01:06:43,208
- Come on. Come on, babe.
- Come on, Joy!

1326
01:07:13,666 --> 01:07:14,749
- Got a minute.
- Come on, Joy!

1327
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:16,707
- I need to talk to you about Nick.
- Smoke 'em, Joy!

1328
01:07:16,708 --> 01:07:18,207
Yeah, you want to praise my boy.

1329
01:07:18,208 --> 01:07:19,457
- Run, girl, run!
- Come on, come on.

1330
01:07:19,458 --> 01:07:21,832
- Whoo!
- Praise your boy for failing my class?

1331
01:07:21,833 --> 01:07:23,207
- Failing. He's not failing.
- Come on, now!

1332
01:07:23,208 --> 01:07:25,489
If he was failing,
I would know he was failing. -Fight on!

1333
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,457
- Is he failing?
- Whoo!

1334
01:07:29,458 --> 01:07:32,332
- Yeah. Exponentially.
- Who's failing? What?

1335
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:42,624
I don't know where Nick is.

1336
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:45,249
There you go. Need I say more?

1337
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:46,415
No, you should not.

1338
01:07:46,416 --> 01:07:48,040
Sports.

1339
01:07:48,041 --> 01:07:50,249
A topic I know nothing about.

1340
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:51,790
But I did my research last night,

1341
01:07:51,791 --> 01:07:55,665
and I looked up some of
the greatest sports icons of all time.

1342
01:07:55,666 --> 01:07:58,040
The likes of...

1343
01:07:58,041 --> 01:07:59,916
Wade Gretzky...

1344
01:08:01,166 --> 01:08:03,458
and Tiger Wools.

1345
01:08:04,541 --> 01:08:07,582
And of course the classic trio of

1346
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:10,540
Le, Bron and James.

1347
01:08:10,541 --> 01:08:12,625
And the greatest of all time...

1348
01:08:13,875 --> 01:08:15,957
Michael B. Jordan.

1349
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:18,999
And do you know what they would say
if they were here right now?

1350
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,040
They would say this is not a game.

1351
01:08:21,041 --> 01:08:23,707
We're not running in circles out here.

1352
01:08:23,708 --> 01:08:25,124
We're not passing the baton.

1353
01:08:25,125 --> 01:08:30,207
Life is about taking the baton
and shoving it right up

1354
01:08:30,208 --> 01:08:32,666
the competition's chimney!

1355
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:37,040
That was your cue. Go, go, go!

1356
01:08:37,041 --> 01:08:38,540
Run!

1357
01:09:02,416 --> 01:09:03,790
Ring.

1358
01:09:03,791 --> 01:09:05,665
Milkmaid?

1359
01:09:05,666 --> 01:09:07,125
Hi.

1360
01:09:10,625 --> 01:09:12,165
Got milk?

1361
01:09:23,958 --> 01:09:25,874
Hey!!

1362
01:09:25,875 --> 01:09:27,540
Go.

1363
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:32,541
What the hell are you doing?

1364
01:09:38,916 --> 01:09:41,291
You've got no drip.

1365
01:09:45,541 --> 01:09:47,540
You have got to be kidding me.

1366
01:09:47,541 --> 01:09:49,041
I'm coming, Joy! I got you!

1367
01:09:51,791 --> 01:09:53,665
Hey, this doesn't count!

1368
01:09:53,666 --> 01:09:54,750
Hey, man, what...

1369
01:10:11,041 --> 01:10:12,707
All right, now, I ain't no punk.

1370
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:15,124
What?

1371
01:10:15,125 --> 01:10:17,457
Hey! Why y'all messing with me?

1372
01:10:17,458 --> 01:10:19,333
Y'all should be working
for Cirque du Soleil.

1373
01:10:20,791 --> 01:10:22,290
- Run, Joy!
- I don't know if

1374
01:10:22,291 --> 01:10:23,874
- you understand how important math is.
- Run!

1375
01:10:23,875 --> 01:10:24,957
Nine, ten.

1376
01:10:24,958 --> 01:10:26,291
Mom, ten lords a-leaping.

1377
01:10:31,208 --> 01:10:33,750
Joy. What are you doing?

1378
01:10:41,041 --> 01:10:42,749
Why y'all dressed like Prince?

1379
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:45,374
Hey, Chris, the ring!

1380
01:10:45,375 --> 01:10:46,540
You got to stop him!

1381
01:10:46,541 --> 01:10:48,582
Math is at the heart
of everything. It's vitally important.

1382
01:10:48,583 --> 01:10:49,874
- Nick...
- Listen to me, Friar Tuck.

1383
01:10:49,875 --> 01:10:52,124
I need you to shut it!

1384
01:10:52,125 --> 01:10:54,165
Stand by.

1385
01:11:11,666 --> 01:11:14,541
Ha! Yes! Yes!

1386
01:11:16,333 --> 01:11:18,375
What were you saying?

1387
01:11:19,458 --> 01:11:21,207
I... I...

1388
01:12:13,083 --> 01:12:14,665
That's right!

1389
01:12:14,666 --> 01:12:17,665
I was about to start whipping
everybody's ass up in here!

1390
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:19,458
Y'all got off easy this time!

1391
01:12:20,791 --> 01:12:23,374
- Joy, that was amazing. That was amazing.
- Thanks, Dad.

1392
01:12:23,375 --> 01:12:25,082
You got it. You got the ring.

1393
01:12:25,083 --> 01:12:26,415
- Are sure you're okay?
- Yeah, I'm good, Mom.

1394
01:12:26,416 --> 01:12:27,540
- You're okay. All right.
- Thank you.

1395
01:12:27,541 --> 01:12:29,249
Hey, there's that scout.

1396
01:12:29,250 --> 01:12:31,040
Where? Wait, Dad, don't.

1397
01:12:31,041 --> 01:12:33,374
Hey, how about that? Did you see that?

1398
01:12:33,375 --> 01:12:35,790
Did you see what she did out there?
Wasn't she amazing?

1399
01:12:35,791 --> 01:12:37,040
Look, listen.

1400
01:12:37,041 --> 01:12:39,665
It's not my policy
to talk to parents, okay?

1401
01:12:39,666 --> 01:12:41,582
Or an athlete at these events.

1402
01:12:41,583 --> 01:12:43,707
I'm just here to observe. That's it.

1403
01:12:43,708 --> 01:12:45,582
Well, consider yourself lucky.
You got a chance to observe her.

1404
01:12:45,583 --> 01:12:46,957
But did you see what she did?

1405
01:12:46,958 --> 01:12:48,374
I did. I did.

1406
01:12:48,375 --> 01:12:51,790
I counted,
20 violations and infractions.

1407
01:12:51,791 --> 01:12:53,665
Well, I-I promise,

1408
01:12:53,666 --> 01:12:54,999
- I don't usually run like this.
- Yeah.

1409
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:59,582
Look, if she could run that fast with all
those obstacles and hurdles coming at her,

1410
01:12:59,583 --> 01:13:02,082
imagine how good she'll do
in a USC uniform.

1411
01:13:02,083 --> 01:13:03,665
I hope so. I do.

1412
01:13:03,666 --> 01:13:05,624
'Cause she's not running for us.

1413
01:13:05,625 --> 01:13:06,749
Notre Dame?

1414
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:08,874
Nobody want to go to Notre Dame.

1415
01:13:10,375 --> 01:13:12,000
Well, she's definitely not.

1416
01:13:16,875 --> 01:13:18,374
What's going on?

1417
01:13:18,375 --> 01:13:21,040
Holy cow! Holy...

1418
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:26,416
I don't want to talk about it.

1419
01:13:27,708 --> 01:13:30,957
So you lied about
how you're doing in math?

1420
01:13:30,958 --> 01:13:33,124
It wasn't a lie. It was a spin.

1421
01:13:33,125 --> 01:13:35,624
Yeah, now, how far you expect
to get in life with an attitude like that?

1422
01:13:35,625 --> 01:13:36,915
I don't know.

1423
01:13:36,916 --> 01:13:39,416
I'm thinking president.

1424
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:42,832
Something big. Big things.

1425
01:13:42,833 --> 01:13:45,207
- This boy. I can't.
- Look.

1426
01:13:45,208 --> 01:13:47,249
Only reason I didn't tell you
I was a loser in math

1427
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:48,958
is 'cause I know
how you feel about losers.

1428
01:13:54,833 --> 01:13:58,790
And, Dad, just as a reminder,
I can speak for myself.

1429
01:13:58,791 --> 01:14:01,624
Excuse me.
Don't you even try to make this about me.

1430
01:14:01,625 --> 01:14:03,290
Okay? USC scout.

1431
01:14:03,291 --> 01:14:05,374
That guy was from Notre Dame,
and you knew it.

1432
01:14:05,375 --> 01:14:06,707
Yes.

1433
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:08,165
Okay? I don't want to go to USC, okay?

1434
01:14:08,166 --> 01:14:10,540
I-I don't want to come home
for dinner every night.

1435
01:14:10,541 --> 01:14:12,499
I want my own life, away from you.

1436
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:13,665
Hey.

1437
01:14:13,666 --> 01:14:18,082
There is nothing wrong with that, but
you need to be honest with your parents.

1438
01:14:18,083 --> 01:14:21,332
Do you two even know how hard that I work

1439
01:14:21,333 --> 01:14:23,707
so that you can have
the best of everything, the best in life,

1440
01:14:23,708 --> 01:14:25,999
the best Christmas?

1441
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,540
Everything that I do, I do for you.

1442
01:14:27,541 --> 01:14:29,874
No, no, no. You do this for yourself.

1443
01:14:29,875 --> 01:14:32,500
All this Christmas stuff,
this isn't for us.

1444
01:14:34,291 --> 01:14:35,832
Not anymore.

1445
01:14:35,833 --> 01:14:37,499
It's all for you.

1446
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:39,165
You... yeah, y-you say
that you want our help,

1447
01:14:39,166 --> 01:14:41,707
but you really just want to do it yourself
and then have us stand here and go,

1448
01:14:41,708 --> 01:14:45,291
"Wow, isn't Dad so amazing?
He's number one!"

1449
01:14:46,625 --> 01:14:47,915
Hey.

1450
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:51,290
Okay, that's not helping anything.

1451
01:14:51,291 --> 01:14:52,416
Hey.

1452
01:14:54,541 --> 01:14:56,165
We. We do the work.

1453
01:14:56,166 --> 01:14:57,707
- I know we do the work.
- Okay, okay.

1454
01:14:57,708 --> 01:15:00,208
Okay, but, you know, not right now.

1455
01:15:07,083 --> 01:15:11,415
Look, everything you said
out there was true. All right?

1456
01:15:11,416 --> 01:15:15,374
I want to apologize for a lot of things.

1457
01:15:15,375 --> 01:15:19,207
And I haven't told you the whole truth.

1458
01:15:19,208 --> 01:15:20,707
If I find all the rings, I win.

1459
01:15:20,708 --> 01:15:21,915
Yeah?

1460
01:15:21,916 --> 01:15:23,583
But if I don't...

1461
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:29,957
then I get turned into one of them.

1462
01:15:29,958 --> 01:15:32,165
- What?
- Dad, what?

1463
01:15:32,166 --> 01:15:34,124
My God, Christopher.

1464
01:15:34,125 --> 01:15:35,332
Gary, you already knew that.

1465
01:15:35,333 --> 01:15:37,582
I know. It's still a big reveal.
Girl, I'm in the moment.

1466
01:15:37,583 --> 01:15:39,290
- No.
- Dad!

1467
01:15:43,791 --> 01:15:45,124
Hey. What do you mean?

1468
01:15:45,125 --> 01:15:46,999
You're gonna be one of those little guys?
Forever?

1469
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,624
- Forever.
- Why didn't you tell me?

1470
01:15:48,625 --> 01:15:51,165
'Cause I thought that I could,
you know, fix this by myself.

1471
01:15:51,166 --> 01:15:53,457
By yourself?

1472
01:15:53,458 --> 01:15:54,582
My God, Chris.

1473
01:15:54,583 --> 01:15:56,499
Now they gonna turn me into a little...

1474
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:58,415
- Don't cry.
- I'm gonna be all tiny.

1475
01:15:58,416 --> 01:16:00,499
I would break you.

1476
01:16:06,666 --> 01:16:09,665
You're not gonna let her take my dad,
are you, Pip?

1477
01:16:09,666 --> 01:16:12,499
Not if I can help it, love.

1478
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:14,665
Little bonbon.

1479
01:16:14,666 --> 01:16:17,040
I'm not crying. My eyes just sweat
when I see something adorable.

1480
01:16:17,041 --> 01:16:18,124
You know what I mean?

1481
01:16:18,125 --> 01:16:19,957
No, sweetheart.

1482
01:16:19,958 --> 01:16:21,957
No. Get up. Get up.

1483
01:16:21,958 --> 01:16:23,665
We are not gonna let her turn your dad

1484
01:16:23,666 --> 01:16:26,957
into one of those weird,
old-timey Happy Meal toys.

1485
01:16:26,958 --> 01:16:28,665
Not like... No offense. I'm sorry.

1486
01:16:28,666 --> 01:16:30,915
- None taken.
- A little taken.

1487
01:16:30,916 --> 01:16:32,915
Mom is right.

1488
01:16:32,916 --> 01:16:34,540
We're in this together.

1489
01:16:34,541 --> 01:16:35,707
We're the Carvers.

1490
01:16:35,708 --> 01:16:36,999
Yeah.

1491
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,082
You know what? We are a family.

1492
01:16:39,083 --> 01:16:43,415
We will do this together
because we are the Carvers.

1493
01:16:43,416 --> 01:16:45,165
- We're the Carvers!
- Yeah!

1494
01:16:45,166 --> 01:16:47,790
Technically, you guys are not Carvers.

1495
01:16:47,791 --> 01:16:49,582
Honorary members.

1496
01:16:49,583 --> 01:16:50,999
On a temporary basis.

1497
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,707
Temporary honorary Carvers!

1498
01:16:53,708 --> 01:16:54,790
Seriously?

1499
01:16:54,791 --> 01:16:58,374
Hey, these tree creatures
have to have the ring.

1500
01:16:58,375 --> 01:17:00,874
Don't be so sure, guv.

1501
01:17:00,875 --> 01:17:03,082
Pepper's not to be trusted.

1502
01:17:03,083 --> 01:17:06,707
In fact, she was here last night
looking for us.

1503
01:17:06,708 --> 01:17:07,874
Wait, she was in my house?

1504
01:17:07,875 --> 01:17:10,707
And she said
you'd never find the last ring.

1505
01:17:10,708 --> 01:17:13,707
- There's always some trick.
- That's how she gets you.

1506
01:17:13,708 --> 01:17:16,665
Right when the clock strikes 8:00
and you think you're about to win...

1507
01:17:16,666 --> 01:17:17,749
You lose.

1508
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:19,874
But she also said something about,

1509
01:17:19,875 --> 01:17:22,457
"Don't forget the nice gift maker."

1510
01:17:22,458 --> 01:17:23,749
Yeah, and,

1511
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:26,249
"For the king of Christmas
to save himself,

1512
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:28,458
he needs the one up on the shelf."

1513
01:17:29,541 --> 01:17:30,707
"Up on the shelf"?

1514
01:17:30,708 --> 01:17:32,290
What does, what does that mean?
What does that mean?

1515
01:17:32,291 --> 01:17:35,124
What? Seriously, you guys?

1516
01:17:35,125 --> 01:17:36,249
Elf on the Shelf.

1517
01:17:36,250 --> 01:17:37,665
- Duh..
- Elf. Yes.

1518
01:17:37,666 --> 01:17:38,749
That's it.

1519
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:41,124
Elves make gifts. Pepper's the elf.

1520
01:17:41,125 --> 01:17:43,916
- Pepper has the last ring.
- Pepper has the last ring.

1521
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:48,999
Do you see this?

1522
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,082
How nice is it to have some help
from your family?

1523
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:53,665
Yeah, it's good to have
some help from your family.

1524
01:17:53,666 --> 01:17:57,082
Right? And what you need is
an operational manager, and that's all me.

1525
01:17:58,208 --> 01:18:00,790
Follow your mother.
I have ideas. Let's go.

1526
01:18:00,791 --> 01:18:02,791
- Come on, you heard your mother. Let's go!
- Yeah!

1527
01:18:04,083 --> 01:18:05,415
What is she doing?

1528
01:18:05,416 --> 01:18:06,666
She's in the zone.

1529
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:11,749
Okay. Okay.

1530
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:13,457
Okay!

1531
01:18:13,458 --> 01:18:15,915
Listen up!
Here's how it's gonna go down tonight.

1532
01:18:15,916 --> 01:18:19,540
Village people, I want you right here,
front and center.

1533
01:18:19,541 --> 01:18:21,374
To do what?

1534
01:18:21,375 --> 01:18:23,374
You're the bait.

1535
01:18:23,375 --> 01:18:24,999
I liked when Chris was in charge.

1536
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,499
I mean, he wasn't effective,
but I felt safer.

1537
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:28,624
No one asked you.

1538
01:18:28,625 --> 01:18:31,124
Yeah, for once, I agree with Gary.

1539
01:18:31,125 --> 01:18:33,874
Do you guys want to catch an elf or not?

1540
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:36,625
Don't answer it!

1541
01:18:38,875 --> 01:18:40,457
Hey, listen here, you stupid birds.

1542
01:18:40,458 --> 01:18:41,832
Let me tell you something right now.

1543
01:18:41,833 --> 01:18:44,082
We are all coming for you 'cause
you messed with the wrong family.

1544
01:18:44,083 --> 01:18:46,165
- That's right.
- So you better not ever...

1545
01:18:46,166 --> 01:18:47,915
Nick, this is Mr. Benedetto.

1546
01:18:47,916 --> 01:18:49,540
What the heck is going...

1547
01:18:49,541 --> 01:18:50,915
That's the wrong number.

1548
01:18:52,166 --> 01:18:53,624
Okay, listen up, guys.

1549
01:18:53,625 --> 01:18:57,540
We are gonna need a pulley, plywood

1550
01:18:57,541 --> 01:18:59,499
and string lights,
lots and lots of string lights.

1551
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:01,625
Now you're speaking my love language.

1552
01:19:02,708 --> 01:19:06,583
Hey, babe, do you think you can make
a lasso out of string lights?

1553
01:19:10,041 --> 01:19:11,457
That's my man.

Candy Cane Lane Spectacular.

1560
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:42,666
Extravaganza Bonanza.

1561
01:19:44,083 --> 01:19:47,332
Now, all week long,
our sponsors have been judging the houses,

1562
01:19:47,333 --> 01:19:51,499
and one of these lucky families will be
declared the winner of Candy Cane Lane.

1563
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:54,832
And receive a check for $100,000.

1564
01:19:54,833 --> 01:19:57,374
Right?

1565
01:19:57,375 --> 01:19:58,957
Whoo!

1566
01:19:58,958 --> 01:20:01,582
Um... it's not a check.

1567
01:20:01,583 --> 01:20:04,332
It's, prizes that equal $100,000.

1568
01:20:04,333 --> 01:20:05,749
Was that not clear?

1569
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:08,332
No, that was absolutely not clear.

1570
01:20:08,333 --> 01:20:09,957
What kind of prizes?

1571
01:20:09,958 --> 01:20:11,374
You know, just see for yourself.

1572
01:20:11,375 --> 01:20:13,624
Can you run the prizes, please?

1573
01:20:13,625 --> 01:20:18,624
And of course,
gift certificates to Tony's Tacos.

1574
01:20:18,625 --> 01:20:21,832
Live every day like it's Taco Tuesday.

1575
01:20:21,833 --> 01:20:22,915
Tacos?

1576
01:20:22,916 --> 01:20:25,707
$100,000 in Tony Tacos?

1577
01:20:25,708 --> 01:20:27,415
It's not cash? It's tacos?

1578
01:20:27,416 --> 01:20:29,457
Dad, Dad, just stay focused.

1579
01:20:29,458 --> 01:20:32,374
They are gonna turn you into
a tiny action figure.

1580
01:20:32,375 --> 01:20:33,750
Stay focused on the plan.

1581
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,332
Tacos are stupid.

1582
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:40,415
A hundred grand in tacos?
God, that's unbelievable.

1583
01:20:40,416 --> 01:20:42,207
You know what else
is unbelievable, Emerson?

1584
01:20:42,208 --> 01:20:43,749
I don't know,
that I haven't fired my agent?

1585
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:47,999
The magic and music the good folks
of El Segundo have in store for us.

1586
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,999
Take it away!

There she is.

01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,666
Okay, go, go, go. Go, go.

1602
01:21:45,416 --> 01:21:46,958
A peppermint.

1603
01:21:49,250 --> 01:21:51,082
There she is.

1604
01:21:51,083 --> 01:21:52,499
Joy killer.

1605
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:53,665
Pip.

1606
01:21:55,916 --> 01:21:57,582
Hello, old friend.

1607
01:21:57,583 --> 01:22:00,416
Hello, Santa's little devil.

1608
01:22:02,875 --> 01:22:04,415
Going for a spin?

1609
01:22:07,041 --> 01:22:08,207
See if you can catch me.

1610
01:22:16,041 --> 01:22:18,583
Oy! Now!

1611
01:22:24,291 --> 01:22:25,582
Gotcha!

1612
01:22:25,583 --> 01:22:27,707
Messed with the wrong family!

1613
01:22:27,708 --> 01:22:29,707
Seriously?

1614
01:22:29,708 --> 01:22:31,915
This is the Oompa Loompa that has been
causing all the trouble? What...

1615
01:22:31,916 --> 01:22:33,082
No.

1616
01:22:33,083 --> 01:22:35,665
I walked right into your trap.

1617
01:22:35,666 --> 01:22:37,040
Or did you walk right into mine?

1618
01:22:37,041 --> 01:22:38,582
What are you talking about?

1619
01:22:38,583 --> 01:22:41,207
Santa's been giving too many nice passes
to all the naughties.

1620
01:22:41,208 --> 01:22:43,832
I'm here to put a little coal
in your stocking.

1621
01:22:45,625 --> 01:22:48,416
- You got some real anger issues.
- Just a little.

1622
01:22:50,625 --> 01:22:51,874
Well, I got the last ring.

1623
01:22:51,875 --> 01:22:53,040
- Winner!
- Yeah!

1624
01:22:53,041 --> 01:22:55,624
I win!

1625
01:22:55,625 --> 01:22:58,665
I win, win, win!

1626
01:22:58,666 --> 01:23:00,207
Did you?

1627
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:02,790
All right, I get it.
I got a lot to learn about Christmas.

1628
01:23:02,791 --> 01:23:05,415
It's not about what you have
on the outside of your house.

1629
01:23:05,416 --> 01:23:07,457
It's about who you have inside with you.

1630
01:23:07,458 --> 01:23:08,540
Yeah.

1631
01:23:08,541 --> 01:23:10,332
And nothing compares to that.

1632
01:23:10,333 --> 01:23:15,165
My God, if you do not stop
humansplaining Christmas to me.

1633
01:23:18,458 --> 01:23:20,207
What is that?

1634
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:37,710
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.
It's coming in hot.

1635
01:23:42,333 --> 01:23:43,916
Dad, what is that?

1636
01:23:48,125 --> 01:23:49,207
Peppermint!

1637
01:23:49,208 --> 01:23:50,624
Crap.

1638
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:52,165
Is that who I think it is?

1639
01:23:53,541 --> 01:23:55,540
Uncle Santa! What's up?!

1640
01:23:56,750 --> 01:23:59,040
I knew Santa was Black, man!

1641
01:23:59,041 --> 01:24:01,790
My gosh, Black Santa!

1642
01:24:01,791 --> 01:24:03,749
I only see Santa.

1643
01:24:03,750 --> 01:24:04,999
What color is that nutcracker?

1644
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
It's white.

1645
01:24:11,958 --> 01:24:13,415
Santa, we love you!

1646
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:16,500
- That's Santa Claus.
- It's Santa! Hi, Santa!

1647
01:24:21,208 --> 01:24:22,500
I knew it!

1648
01:24:23,875 --> 01:24:25,166
Peppermint!

1649
01:24:26,583 --> 01:24:28,375
Peppermint?

1650
01:24:29,708 --> 01:24:32,915
Peppermint, you working my last nerve.

1651
01:24:34,208 --> 01:24:36,290
Hey, you.

1652
01:24:36,291 --> 01:24:37,457
Fudge me.

1653
01:24:37,458 --> 01:24:39,790
You look great.

1654
01:24:39,791 --> 01:24:42,207
What's your secret? Less cookies?

1655
01:24:42,208 --> 01:24:44,290
Peppermint, what have you done?

1656
01:24:44,291 --> 01:24:46,665
Well, I know how busy you get
this time of year,

1657
01:24:46,666 --> 01:24:50,415
so I thought I'd just teach a few people
the true meaning of Christmas.

1658
01:24:50,416 --> 01:24:52,374
The person that needs
to learn a thing or two

1659
01:24:52,375 --> 01:24:54,874
- is you!
- What?

1660
01:24:54,875 --> 01:24:57,790
Wow. Santa.

1661
01:24:57,791 --> 01:25:00,082
- It's Santa, right?
- Hello, Christopher.

1662
01:25:00,083 --> 01:25:01,165
Yes, it's me.

1663
01:25:01,166 --> 01:25:02,874
He knows your name.

1664
01:25:02,875 --> 01:25:04,957
I'm... I'm really sorry about all this.

1665
01:25:04,958 --> 01:25:06,499
No problem.

1666
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:08,040
Wow, you're actually really here.

1667
01:25:08,041 --> 01:25:10,915
Hey, listen, Santa, um, I'm good, right?

1668
01:25:10,916 --> 01:25:13,415
'Cause I got all the five gold rings.

1669
01:25:14,958 --> 01:25:17,249
- I never said five.
- Yes, you did.

1670
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:22,374
"Before the old clock tower goes ding,
you must collect the golden rings."

1671
01:25:22,375 --> 01:25:24,707
There are five golden rings.

1672
01:25:24,708 --> 01:25:26,541
Are there?

1673
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:38,665
Twelve.

1674
01:25:38,666 --> 01:25:40,332
Dad, there's 12 partridges.

1675
01:25:40,333 --> 01:25:43,457
Why? Why are there 12?

1676
01:25:43,458 --> 01:25:45,249
No.

1677
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:48,249
- What?
- That song "The Twelve Days of Christmas,"

1678
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:49,457
it repeats.

1679
01:25:49,458 --> 01:25:51,999
She always changes the rules.
That's her trick.

1680
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,082
That's why no one ever wins.

1681
01:25:54,083 --> 01:25:56,707
Is this a... some sort of pet entrance?

1682
01:25:56,708 --> 01:26:00,582
You sing it over and over again, and
every time you do, you add another one.

1683
01:26:04,041 --> 01:26:05,499
12 partridges!

1684
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:07,583
Why... why are we doing math right now?

1685
01:26:14,166 --> 01:26:15,457
And two turtledoves.

1686
01:26:15,458 --> 01:26:17,249
And then it repeats that verse.

1687
01:26:17,250 --> 01:26:18,583
11 times.

1688
01:26:20,125 --> 01:26:21,874
So... so that means there's...

1689
01:26:21,875 --> 01:26:24,124
22 turtledoves!

1690
01:26:24,125 --> 01:26:25,749
So it's not really five golden rings.

1691
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:27,540
It's 40.

1692
01:26:27,541 --> 01:26:29,165
Forty.

1693
01:26:29,166 --> 01:26:30,832
My God.

1694
01:26:30,833 --> 01:26:32,249
He's right. How is Nick right?

1695
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:35,499
I don't know. It's... it's music.

1696
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:36,625
But it's math.

1697
01:26:37,833 --> 01:26:39,415
I'm doing math.

1698
01:26:39,416 --> 01:26:40,999
Is this what y'all call calculus?

1699
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,332
What? It's multiplication, you idiot.

1700
01:26:43,333 --> 01:26:45,499
But you're right, for once.

1701
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:46,999
Wait a minute.

1702
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,082
40 rings?

1703
01:26:50,583 --> 01:26:53,207
I got you so good. All of you were like,
"Five? Let's find the five."

1704
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:55,374
It was 40.

1705
01:26:55,375 --> 01:26:56,499
Peppermint.

1706
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:57,957
Enough is enough.

1707
01:26:57,958 --> 01:27:00,165
No. No, no, no, no, no. No, no.

1708
01:27:00,166 --> 01:27:02,290
He made a deal.
He signed it and everything. Look.

1709
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:08,790
See?

1710
01:27:08,791 --> 01:27:09,874
Signed it right there.

1711
01:27:09,875 --> 01:27:13,040
And there's nothing you can say or do
because it's a deal.

1712
01:27:13,041 --> 01:27:14,124
A deal is a deal!

1713
01:27:14,125 --> 01:27:16,415
Well, there's a lot of fine print here.

1714
01:27:16,416 --> 01:27:19,249
You can't expect someone
to read all of this.

1715
01:27:19,250 --> 01:27:21,790
Dear.

1716
01:27:21,791 --> 01:27:23,166
I'm afraid she's got you.

1717
01:27:24,333 --> 01:27:26,165
My God.

1718
01:27:26,166 --> 01:27:28,124
Hey, wait a second, now.
Wait a second, now. -

1719
01:27:28,125 --> 01:27:30,749
You're Santa Claus, so you should be able

1720
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:32,332
- to veto this or something.
- Yeah.

1721
01:27:32,333 --> 01:27:34,332
Christopher, you signed the receipt.

1722
01:27:34,333 --> 01:27:35,707
That's your name.

1723
01:27:35,708 --> 01:27:38,207
Only you can break the curse.

1724
01:27:39,291 --> 01:27:42,082
♪ Do you hear what I hear? ♪

1725
01:27:53,875 --> 01:27:56,207
Wh-Wh-Where y'all come from?

1726
01:27:58,208 --> 01:28:00,333
- Whoa.
- Everybody, back up.

1727
01:28:02,041 --> 01:28:04,207
Ticktock, ticktock.

1728
01:28:04,208 --> 01:28:05,333
Almost eight o'clock.

1729
01:28:06,416 --> 01:28:08,707
Seriously, you want us
to try to get 40 rings now?

1730
01:28:08,708 --> 01:28:10,957
No, no, no. I expect you to fail.

1731
01:28:10,958 --> 01:28:13,582
Peppermint, I'm warning you, if...

1732
01:28:13,583 --> 01:28:15,749
No, I'm warning you, old man.

1733
01:28:15,750 --> 01:28:16,874
You've gone soft.

1734
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:18,832
Well, all that's about to change

1735
01:28:18,833 --> 01:28:21,750
because Peppermint is coming to town!

1736
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,457
Son of a Blitzen!

1737
01:28:24,458 --> 01:28:27,499
Fly, my pretties! Fly!

1738
01:28:38,625 --> 01:28:40,082
She just kick Santa Claus?

1739
01:28:40,083 --> 01:28:41,332
That's what I saw.

1740
01:28:41,333 --> 01:28:42,540
- Whoa!
- My God!

1741
01:28:51,958 --> 01:28:53,874
Ooh, that hurt.

1742
01:28:53,875 --> 01:28:56,499
- Hey, we need more rings.
- Quick, how many do we have?

1743
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:57,957
- Five.
- Five?

1744
01:28:57,958 --> 01:28:59,749
- Okay, we got five rings.
- That leaves 35.

1745
01:28:59,750 --> 01:29:01,082
Yeah.

1746
01:29:01,083 --> 01:29:03,124
I'm like a math genius, y'all.

1747
01:29:03,125 --> 01:29:04,207
No, sweetie.

1748
01:29:04,208 --> 01:29:05,749
Okay, everybody has to get
as many rings as they can.

1749
01:29:05,750 --> 01:29:08,040
- Yes, okay, split up.
- You said not to split up.

1750
01:29:08,041 --> 01:29:09,749
That only happens in horror movies.

1751
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:10,957
What do you think this is? Come on.

1752
01:29:10,958 --> 01:29:12,249
Hey, Santa Claus, you all right?

1753
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:14,207
Are all your elves like this?

1754
01:29:14,208 --> 01:29:17,207
I'm telling you, this generation.

1755
01:29:17,208 --> 01:29:18,790
Brother.

1756
01:29:20,583 --> 01:29:22,207
Where these birds come from?

1757
01:29:31,875 --> 01:29:34,624
He got you.

1758
01:29:35,791 --> 01:29:38,540
He got you.

1759
01:29:42,083 --> 01:29:45,791
Hey, Santa, are you sure
there isn't anything else you can do?

1760
01:30:06,166 --> 01:30:08,082
- Yes!
- Hell no!

1761
01:30:08,083 --> 01:30:09,999
Santa Claus!

1762
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,082
Well, maybe you come by the shop sometime.

1763
01:30:12,083 --> 01:30:13,374
Introduce you to the elves.

1764
01:30:13,375 --> 01:30:16,207
We got Cupcake, Twinkle, Dinky...

1765
01:30:16,208 --> 01:30:18,082
Okay, okay, let's hurry this up.

1766
01:30:18,083 --> 01:30:20,957
We got Winky, Dinky, Binky...

1767
01:30:20,958 --> 01:30:22,124
and Stinky.

1768
01:30:22,125 --> 01:30:23,957
He not allowed inside.

1769
01:30:23,958 --> 01:30:26,124
If you looking for scrambled eggs,
I'm telling you,

1770
01:30:26,125 --> 01:30:28,749
it's going down on Candy Cane Lane.

1771
01:30:28,750 --> 01:30:30,310
I could've stayed in the hood for this.

1772
01:30:44,375 --> 01:30:46,499
- Thanks, neighbor.
- All right. Hey.

1773
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:48,624
All right. All right, Bruce.

1774
01:30:48,625 --> 01:30:50,165
Thank you.

1775
01:30:50,166 --> 01:30:53,540
My window is rolling up so slow.

1776
01:30:53,541 --> 01:30:55,040
I can't do this.

1777
01:31:02,458 --> 01:31:04,541
Hey! Hey!

1778
01:31:07,208 --> 01:31:09,041
Wow.

1779
01:31:10,333 --> 01:31:11,582
You're fast.

1780
01:31:11,583 --> 01:31:13,707
Yeah, it's kind of my thing.

1781
01:31:13,708 --> 01:31:15,583
Mine, too. We should talk.

1782
01:31:52,666 --> 01:31:53,749
My God.

1783
01:31:53,750 --> 01:31:55,749
Oy, that's dirty pool.

1784
01:31:55,750 --> 01:31:57,874
Pepper know what time it is,
but Chris won't.

1785
01:31:57,875 --> 01:31:59,707
- Okay.
- What we gonna do, just sit here?

1786
01:31:59,708 --> 01:32:02,915
Actually, guys,
I think it's time for me to drive.

1787
01:32:09,875 --> 01:32:11,124
No.

1788
01:32:11,125 --> 01:32:13,874
What? It's not time yet.
We still have five minutes.

1789
01:32:18,666 --> 01:32:19,791
Carol!

1790
01:32:20,791 --> 01:32:22,874
Where's that ring? Excuse me.

1791
01:32:22,875 --> 01:32:24,457
I'm-I'm sorry.

1792
01:32:25,916 --> 01:32:27,041
There it is.

1793
01:32:30,416 --> 01:32:32,416
What are y'all doing?

1794
01:32:39,125 --> 01:32:40,749
Yo, who are these guys?

1795
01:32:40,750 --> 01:32:42,249
Yo, we got to get those rings.

1796
01:32:42,250 --> 01:32:44,707
- Rings? What rings?
- There's a ring on that drum.

1797
01:32:44,708 --> 01:32:46,749
This the battle of the bands?
Dude, let's go.

1798
01:32:47,875 --> 01:32:50,290
Yo, everybody, bring them in closer.

1799
01:32:50,291 --> 01:32:51,916
Then I can grab the rings.

1800
01:32:53,458 --> 01:32:54,915
Carol!

1801
01:33:09,083 --> 01:33:11,125
Go ahead, Nick.

1802
01:33:20,583 --> 01:33:21,790
What in the world?

1803
01:33:21,791 --> 01:33:23,665
No!

1804
01:33:23,666 --> 01:33:24,790
Breaking news!

1805
01:33:24,791 --> 01:33:29,040
Brother man who house couldn't light up
the first try, he just shrunk.

1806
01:33:29,041 --> 01:33:31,166
She got me.

1807
01:33:34,833 --> 01:33:37,041
Hey, I still have time.

1808
01:33:41,208 --> 01:33:43,625
Coming through! Watch your step, y'all!

1809
01:33:48,166 --> 01:33:50,790
I don't know what just happened.
I ain't never seen no...

1810
01:33:50,791 --> 01:33:52,040
Where did he go?

1811
01:33:52,041 --> 01:33:53,708
Let 'em get closer. Let 'em get closer.

1812
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,832
Drum line, single file.

1813
01:34:01,333 --> 01:34:04,290
Hey, this is all we can do, Nick.
Got to do it now!

1814
01:34:04,291 --> 01:34:05,375
There they go.

1815
01:34:14,583 --> 01:34:15,583
Gotcha.

1816
01:34:22,041 --> 01:34:23,125
What?

1817
01:34:24,708 --> 01:34:26,165
Yeah.

1818
01:34:26,166 --> 01:34:27,541
I got 'em.

1819
01:34:29,625 --> 01:34:31,541
- Carol, down here!
- Chris?

1820
01:34:33,208 --> 01:34:35,165
Carol!

1821
01:34:35,166 --> 01:34:36,415
Whoa!

1822
01:34:38,875 --> 01:34:40,750
Hey!

1823
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Whoa, this chicken is trippin'!

1824
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:47,582
Beautiful and fast, coming through!

1825
01:34:47,583 --> 01:34:50,207
I'm the cabbie!
I should be the one driving!

1826
01:34:51,291 --> 01:34:53,249
Now I know what Barbie feels like!

1827
01:34:53,250 --> 01:34:54,790
Let's punch it!

1828
01:34:54,791 --> 01:34:57,082
You're not even using the turn signal!

1829
01:34:57,083 --> 01:34:58,999
Look, it's Chris!

1830
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,624
Hey! Cordelia!

1831
01:35:00,625 --> 01:35:02,207
Gee, we're too late.

1832
01:35:02,208 --> 01:35:04,124
- Get in! Get in!
- Chris, jump in!

1833
01:35:04,125 --> 01:35:05,415
Hey!

1834
01:35:05,416 --> 01:35:07,249
My God, I'm never
going to Popeyes again!

1835
01:35:07,250 --> 01:35:08,665
Get in, guv!

1836
01:35:10,250 --> 01:35:11,999
You got to be yolkin' kidding me!

1837
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,749
- Punch it!
- Let's go!

1838
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:15,665
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1839
01:35:15,666 --> 01:35:18,374
What happened to me? It's not 8:00 yet.

1840
01:35:18,375 --> 01:35:19,832
Pepper moved the hands on the clock.

1841
01:35:19,833 --> 01:35:23,374
I told you, she always cheats to win!

1842
01:35:23,375 --> 01:35:26,207
But I still have time.
We got to get the rest of those rings.

1843
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:28,749
Ay, we all just gonna sit here
and act like his ass ain't already glass?

1844
01:35:28,750 --> 01:35:29,874
We just gonna do that?

1845
01:35:36,708 --> 01:35:38,040
There's one.

1846
01:35:38,041 --> 01:35:40,874
Hard to port! Put your weight on it!

1847
01:35:40,875 --> 01:35:42,874
- Catch it, bro!
- Oy! Huzzah!

1848
01:35:42,875 --> 01:35:44,999
That's what I'm talking about.
Nice one, Pip!

1849
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,832
That ain't nothing. Watch this.

1850
01:35:46,833 --> 01:35:48,874
Call this a Tootsie Roll.

1851
01:35:48,875 --> 01:35:51,332
A-one, a-two, a-three.

1852
01:35:51,333 --> 01:35:53,499
I got all the rings
from Cordelia's three marriages.

1853
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:55,458
Those were annulled and you know it!

1854
01:35:57,125 --> 01:35:59,374
Bombs away! Look out!

1855
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,541
Got it! I got it! I got it!

1856
01:36:08,125 --> 01:36:09,457
We can't get traction, y'all!

1857
01:36:09,458 --> 01:36:11,040
We got to go!

1858
01:36:17,958 --> 01:36:19,374
Come on, come on,

1859
01:36:19,375 --> 01:36:21,082
come on!

1860
01:36:21,083 --> 01:36:22,874
That's not our only problem.

1861
01:36:22,875 --> 01:36:23,999
Give me that thing.

1862
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,680
Hey, don't just touch another man's stick.

1863
01:36:27,208 --> 01:36:29,207
- I got this.
- I think I got it.

1864
01:36:29,208 --> 01:36:31,165
Here we go!

1865
01:36:31,166 --> 01:36:32,374
Whoa!

1866
01:36:32,375 --> 01:36:34,165
Stick that chicken!

1867
01:36:34,166 --> 01:36:35,540
Okay.

1868
01:36:35,541 --> 01:36:37,915
This better work!

1869
01:36:37,916 --> 01:36:39,291
Come on, Chris!

1870
01:36:40,250 --> 01:36:42,082
Okay, impressive.

1871
01:36:42,083 --> 01:36:43,415
Yes!

1872
01:36:43,416 --> 01:36:45,624
Got the ring! Let's go!

1873
01:36:45,625 --> 01:36:48,791
Yes! Everything is going great!

1874
01:36:50,916 --> 01:36:52,749
End of the road, sugarplums.

1875
01:36:52,750 --> 01:36:55,457
God! Why are you always finding us?

1876
01:36:55,458 --> 01:36:57,915
Look at the oppressor
with the foot on our necks.

1877
01:36:57,916 --> 01:36:59,540
You signed a contract.

1878
01:36:59,541 --> 01:37:00,915
That's not fair.

1879
01:37:00,916 --> 01:37:02,374
It's just business.

1880
01:37:02,375 --> 01:37:03,707
Dad, no!

1881
01:37:03,708 --> 01:37:04,832
You're a villain.

1882
01:37:04,833 --> 01:37:06,249
Hey.

1883
01:37:06,250 --> 01:37:08,374
My God.

1884
01:37:08,375 --> 01:37:09,749
Easy now, guv.

1885
01:37:09,750 --> 01:37:12,041
Hold on. One minute.

1886
01:37:13,041 --> 01:37:15,249
Chris? My God.

1887
01:37:15,250 --> 01:37:16,957
Blimey.

1888
01:37:16,958 --> 01:37:19,249
I had no idea
that this would actually happen.

1889
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:22,415
I know, honey.
It's like we're in the Twilight Zone.

1890
01:37:22,416 --> 01:37:23,874
Dad, no.

1891
01:37:23,875 --> 01:37:24,999
How do we fix this?

1892
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:26,499
Daddy!

1893
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:28,124
I'm-a keep it real.

1894
01:37:28,125 --> 01:37:29,833
Worst Christmas ever.

1895
01:37:30,916 --> 01:37:33,665
Look, bad things happen to good people,

1896
01:37:33,666 --> 01:37:37,082
but if you have family and love,

1897
01:37:37,083 --> 01:37:38,999
you'll get through anything.

1898
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:43,999
And it's always better to get through it
together than on your own.

1899
01:37:45,875 --> 01:37:49,332
Joy, you go to any college you want to.

1900
01:37:49,333 --> 01:37:51,749
'Cause you are unstoppable,

1901
01:37:51,750 --> 01:37:54,040
and it should be your choice.

1902
01:37:54,041 --> 01:37:57,707
And, Nick, your music is good.

1903
01:37:57,708 --> 01:37:59,040
Really good.

1904
01:37:59,041 --> 01:38:00,665
I saw that tonight.

1905
01:38:00,666 --> 01:38:04,915
Son, you're an entertainer
and you're a leader,

1906
01:38:04,916 --> 01:38:07,082
and you need to share your gift.

1907
01:38:07,083 --> 01:38:09,957
And, Holly, baby girl,

1908
01:38:09,958 --> 01:38:12,665
you keep the spirit of Christmas alive,
every day.

1909
01:38:12,666 --> 01:38:15,290
That's always been your gift to the world.

1910
01:38:15,291 --> 01:38:18,540
That's always been your gift to me.

1911
01:38:18,541 --> 01:38:21,915
And, Carol, mama,
you gonna have to go on without me.

1912
01:38:21,916 --> 01:38:24,665
No, Chris.
Chris, we're not the Carvers without you.

1913
01:38:24,666 --> 01:38:25,832
We're just not.

1914
01:38:25,833 --> 01:38:28,540
Too bad, so sad.

1915
01:38:28,541 --> 01:38:30,624
Say goodbye to your dad.

1916
01:38:30,625 --> 01:38:32,500
Wait, wait. Wait!

1917
01:38:34,666 --> 01:38:36,832
Santa! Please.

1918
01:38:36,833 --> 01:38:38,250
Please, you've got to help.

1919
01:38:39,333 --> 01:38:41,207
No, no, no. Don't get any ideas, old man.

1920
01:38:41,208 --> 01:38:42,540
I won fair and square.

1921
01:38:42,541 --> 01:38:45,040
They needed 40 gold rings in their hands.

1922
01:38:45,041 --> 01:38:47,041
And how many rings do they have?

1923
01:38:48,583 --> 01:38:51,165
- 38. I counted.
- 38.

1924
01:38:51,166 --> 01:38:52,749
We have 38 gold rings.

1925
01:38:52,750 --> 01:38:54,457
You sure about that?

1926
01:38:54,458 --> 01:38:56,665
Y-Yeah. I-I...

1927
01:38:58,333 --> 01:39:00,999
Wait. 39.39!

1928
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,124
Plus mine makes 40!

1929
01:39:10,708 --> 01:39:12,707
- Dad, you're back!
- What just happened?

1930
01:39:14,833 --> 01:39:16,082
God, you're heavy.

1931
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:19,624
Hi.

1932
01:39:19,625 --> 01:39:21,832
My God! I love you!

1933
01:39:21,833 --> 01:39:23,332
I love y'all so much.

1934
01:39:23,333 --> 01:39:24,773
- We love you, too.
- God.

1935
01:39:25,833 --> 01:39:27,374
- My goodness.
- Holly.

1936
01:39:27,375 --> 01:39:28,749
Daddy, I love you.

1937
01:39:30,875 --> 01:39:32,457
Those don't count. Those don't count!

1938
01:39:32,458 --> 01:39:34,207
40 rings, Pepper.

1939
01:39:34,208 --> 01:39:36,124
- No! No.
- Just like you said.

1940
01:39:36,125 --> 01:39:38,249
In their hands.

1941
01:39:38,250 --> 01:39:39,832
No, no, no, no!

1942
01:39:39,833 --> 01:39:41,832
No!

1943
01:39:41,833 --> 01:39:43,499
No, no!

1944
01:39:44,708 --> 01:39:47,041
No. No.

1945
01:39:48,666 --> 01:39:50,124
No!

1946
01:39:50,125 --> 01:39:52,707
Hey, can y'all not forget about
the little people, like, literally?

1947
01:39:52,708 --> 01:39:55,165
Hey, Santa,

1948
01:39:55,166 --> 01:39:57,207
is there anything you can do to help them?

1949
01:39:57,208 --> 01:39:59,332
No. No, they are mine.

1950
01:40:00,708 --> 01:40:02,332
They made a deal, too, and they lost!

1951
01:40:02,333 --> 01:40:04,707
- They lost!
- You're right. They did.

1952
01:40:04,708 --> 01:40:05,874
There's nothing I can do.

1953
01:40:05,875 --> 01:40:07,249
Shaken ornament syndrome.

1954
01:40:07,250 --> 01:40:09,624
But I know something that can.

1955
01:40:09,625 --> 01:40:10,749
What's that?

1956
01:40:10,750 --> 01:40:12,665
A child's Christmas wish.

1957
01:40:12,666 --> 01:40:14,208
Aw.

1958
01:40:16,333 --> 01:40:18,374
Oprah said if I believe,
I can do anything!

1959
01:40:19,916 --> 01:40:21,874
Let's park and dive!

1960
01:40:21,875 --> 01:40:23,832
Jumping in!

1961
01:40:34,750 --> 01:40:36,041
We're back! We're back!

1962
01:40:37,041 --> 01:40:39,332
What in the absolute f...

1963
01:40:39,333 --> 01:40:42,040
♪ Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la. ♪

1964
01:40:42,041 --> 01:40:43,499
Holly, my angel.

1965
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:45,499
- Are you Gary?
- Yeah. And you my future, ain't you?

1966
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:46,874
- No, no, no, I didn't mean it like that.
- Are you my future?

1967
01:40:46,875 --> 01:40:48,124
Come on, baby, you don't like all that?

1968
01:40:48,125 --> 01:40:49,999
- I don't.
- Okay.

1969
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,375
All right, all right.

1970
01:40:54,916 --> 01:40:56,374
What are we doing?!

1971
01:40:56,375 --> 01:40:58,665
What are we doing?!

1972
01:40:58,666 --> 01:41:01,582
Hey! Way to go, Santa Claus!

1973
01:41:01,583 --> 01:41:03,000
Why is this happening to me?

1974
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:06,749
It's what I asked Santa for.

1975
01:41:06,750 --> 01:41:07,999
For Christmas.

1976
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,124
Are you elfin' kidding me?

1977
01:41:10,125 --> 01:41:12,290
Thugs need hugs.

1978
01:41:12,291 --> 01:41:14,040
No, no, no. -No, don't, don't, don't!

1979
01:41:14,041 --> 01:41:16,125
Don't!

1980
01:41:17,375 --> 01:41:19,332
Why is it so warm?

1981
01:41:19,333 --> 01:41:21,290
That's the spirit.

1982
01:41:21,291 --> 01:41:23,624
Now, if you promise to be good,

1983
01:41:23,625 --> 01:41:26,499
I'll let you return to the North Pole.

1984
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:27,707
Deal!

1985
01:41:27,708 --> 01:41:29,124
Wait, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1986
01:41:29,125 --> 01:41:31,749
You gonna let her return to the North Pole
after all the stuff she did to us?

1987
01:41:31,750 --> 01:41:34,040
I'm Santa Claus, Christopher.

1988
01:41:34,041 --> 01:41:35,832
Everybody gets a second chance.

1989
01:41:35,833 --> 01:41:37,290
No, Santa Claus.

1990
01:41:37,291 --> 01:41:38,999
I mean, she did a lot of stuff here.

1991
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,707
At-at the very least,
she should be flogged or something.

1992
01:41:43,041 --> 01:41:45,040
It's been a long time
since my last flogging.

1993
01:41:45,041 --> 01:41:47,749
Well, you overdue.

1994
01:41:47,750 --> 01:41:49,665
All right, come on, everyone.

1995
01:41:49,666 --> 01:41:52,249
Let's get you home in time for Christmas.

1996
01:41:52,250 --> 01:41:53,707
- Bye!
- Bye!

1997
01:41:53,708 --> 01:41:55,457
- Shotgun!
- Not if I get there first!

1998
01:41:55,458 --> 01:41:57,624
That's not how shotgun works, Gary!

1999
01:41:57,625 --> 01:42:00,540
My heels! Oops.

2000
01:42:00,541 --> 01:42:02,791
Where's your magic up in here?

2001
01:42:05,708 --> 01:42:07,082
I'm gonna miss you, guv.

2002
01:42:07,083 --> 01:42:10,291
Pip, I wish you could stay, but you
probably got family waiting on you, right?

2003
01:42:12,291 --> 01:42:13,999
Right.

2004
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,915
Family.

2005
01:42:15,916 --> 01:42:17,874
That's the real gift, innit?

2006
01:42:17,875 --> 01:42:19,915
Yeah, it is.

2007
01:42:19,916 --> 01:42:21,332
Merry Christmas, Pip.

2008
01:42:21,333 --> 01:42:23,249
Merry Christmas.

2009
01:42:23,250 --> 01:42:24,708
All right.

2010
01:42:26,208 --> 01:42:27,957
Babe, look. They're gonna take off.

2011
01:42:27,958 --> 01:42:30,207
Merry Christmas, everyone!

2012
01:42:30,208 --> 01:42:31,915
Merry Christmas!

2013
01:42:31,916 --> 01:42:33,457
- Bye, Cordelia! -
- Bye!

2014
01:42:33,458 --> 01:42:35,040
Hyah!

2015

Bye, Santa!

2020
01:42:49,875 --> 01:42:52,707
Ho ho ho!

2021
01:42:59,958 --> 01:43:01,540
My gosh.

2022
01:43:01,541 --> 01:43:03,165
- Wow. -Hey!
- My God.

2023
01:43:03,166 --> 01:43:05,749
That was great. And snow?

2024
01:43:05,750 --> 01:43:07,082
- Hey!
- Hey!

2025
01:43:07,083 --> 01:43:09,540
Whoa! Look at that!

2026
01:43:09,541 --> 01:43:11,790
- It's amazing. It's amazing.
- No way. -Hey!

2027
01:43:12,916 --> 01:43:14,207
What happened?

2028
01:43:14,208 --> 01:43:15,458
That's not snow.

2029
01:43:16,958 --> 01:43:18,957
- Hell no.
- You're kidding me.

2030
01:43:18,958 --> 01:43:20,374
- From Bruce's yard!
- It's Bruce!

2031
01:43:20,375 --> 01:43:22,915
I thought it was
one of those moments.

2032
01:43:22,916 --> 01:43:24,332
Wow!

2033
01:43:24,333 --> 01:43:25,790
Wow! Wow!

2034
01:43:25,791 --> 01:43:27,583
I mean, it all looked so real.

2035
01:43:28,666 --> 01:43:30,665
I mean, I think it... I think it was real.

2036
01:43:30,666 --> 01:43:33,374
Real good.

2037
01:43:33,375 --> 01:43:36,290
Like Tony's Tacos.

2038
01:43:36,291 --> 01:43:38,583
Live every day like it's...

2039
01:43:40,458 --> 01:43:42,083
Like it's Christmas.

2040
01:43:45,625 --> 01:43:47,082
I don't know how we gonna top this
next year.

2041
01:43:47,083 --> 01:43:49,540
- No, Chris, we don't want to do that.
- What? Next year? -Seriously? -What?

2042
01:43:49,541 --> 01:43:52,124
- I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
- Okay, but the-the good news!

2043
01:43:52,125 --> 01:43:54,124
It's ten months to Halloween.

2044
01:43:54,125 --> 01:43:55,874
- Yeah! -
- HOLLY: Yeah!

2045
01:43:55,875 --> 01:43:58,374
My gosh, seriously, Mom?

2046
01:44:08,916 --> 01:44:10,582
Not bad.

2047
01:44:10,583 --> 01:44:12,957
- Merry Christmas, Bruce.
- Hey.

2048
01:44:12,958 --> 01:44:14,832
- Chris. Thank you.
- Yeah, man.

2049
01:44:14,833 --> 01:44:17,457
I didn't get anything for you, but I will.

2050
01:44:17,458 --> 01:44:18,540
And hey!

2051
01:44:18,541 --> 01:44:20,332
What is this?

2052
01:44:20,333 --> 01:44:22,082
- It's fleece. It's fleece.
- Is this... Is it real fleece?

2053
01:44:22,083 --> 01:44:23,957
- That's real fleece. Yeah.
- That is so generous of you.

2054
01:44:23,958 --> 01:44:26,665
I love fleece.

2055
01:44:26,666 --> 01:44:28,082
How about that?

2056
01:44:28,083 --> 01:44:30,457
I saw it, and I thought, "Bruce."

2057
01:44:30,458 --> 01:44:33,249
It's very breathable.

2058
01:44:33,250 --> 01:44:35,499
Very breathable fabric.

2059
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:38,250
- That's not the calling birds, is it?
- I really hope not.

2060
01:44:39,333 --> 01:44:40,500
Hello?

2061
01:44:43,166 --> 01:44:44,249
It's for you.

2062
01:44:44,250 --> 01:44:45,957
All right.

2063
01:44:45,958 --> 01:44:47,375
Okay.

2064
01:44:48,791 --> 01:44:50,915
So, yeah, man,
I think you're gonna enjoy that.

2065
01:44:50,916 --> 01:44:52,832
Yeah. What size is it?

2066
01:44:52,833 --> 01:44:54,832
- Hello?
- Your size.

2067
01:44:57,208 --> 01:44:59,665
Um, okay, yeah.

2068
01:44:59,666 --> 01:45:01,665
Merry Christmas to you, too.

2069
01:45:01,666 --> 01:45:03,832
All right. Buh-bye.

2070
01:45:12,583 --> 01:45:14,290
I got the job.

2071
01:45:14,291 --> 01:45:15,499
I got the job!

2072
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:18,082
- You got the job.
- What? Are you serious?

2073
01:45:18,083 --> 01:45:20,749
You got the job!

2074
01:45:22,625 --> 01:45:24,457
- All right.
- Incredible!

2075
01:45:24,458 --> 01:45:26,332
Get the door.

2076
01:45:26,333 --> 01:45:28,040
- I got the job. My God.
- Mommy!

2077
01:45:28,041 --> 01:45:29,207
I got the job.

2078
01:45:29,208 --> 01:45:30,874
- I can't believe it!
- I got it.

2079
01:45:30,875 --> 01:45:32,458
- No, I'm okay. Okay.
- Okay.

2080
01:45:34,333 --> 01:45:35,458
Hey!

2081
01:45:37,041 --> 01:45:38,290
Pip, you're back.

2082
01:45:38,291 --> 01:45:39,415
Morning, guv.

2083
01:45:39,416 --> 01:45:41,332
- Hey, is everything okay?
- Yeah.

2084
01:45:41,333 --> 01:45:43,207
Just found myself in the borough,

2088
01:45:47,750 --> 01:45:49,749
It's to not spend the holidays on me own.

2089
01:45:49,750 --> 01:45:51,540
- Aw. -If you'll have me.
- Man.

2090

A fresh-killed lady mallard.

2097
01:46:05,250 --> 01:46:06,374
