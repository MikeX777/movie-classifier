<font color=#FFFFFF><b>SUPREME COURT BUILDING
Washington, D.C.</b></font>

3
00:01:14,663 --> 00:01:16,457
The Honorable Court is now adjourned

4
00:01:16,755 --> 00:01:20,517
until Thursday the 10th day
of December at 12 o'clock

5
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:23,150
Good afternoon.

6
00:01:25,884 --> 00:01:27,932
The fruit to under
spare all right but

7
00:01:28,243 --> 00:01:30,364
the left real one is
causing me great anxiety.

8
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,559
Switched minor well getting of the year
out there I should be very disappointed.

9
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:36,306
You know, that grandson of
mine is most unusual infant.

10
00:01:36,636 --> 00:01:38,661
At 5 weeks he holds up
his head without support.

11
00:01:39,085 --> 00:01:40,518
Yeah, I'll show you snapshot.

12
00:01:43,655 --> 00:01:45,360
Goodbye Grant, have a good vacation.

13
00:01:45,817 --> 00:01:48,457
Happy holiday Josephus.
-  Thank you gentlemen. Thank you.

14
00:01:53,923 --> 00:01:55,544
Mr. justice.
- Well?

15
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:57,786
If we have a word with you
justice Grant, just a few questions?

16
00:01:58,411 --> 00:01:59,858
I stopped answering questions,

17
00:02:00,147 --> 00:02:02,372
when court recessed
about three minutes ago.

18
00:02:04,342 --> 00:02:06,853
What do you know man...
- Comin, comin. -  Here at all.

19
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:13,462
Well gentlemen?
-  Justice Grant

20
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:16,446
We understand you declined to
preside at the Danville investigation.

21
00:02:16,895 --> 00:02:18,288
There's some speculation
as to your reasons.

22
00:02:19,112 --> 00:02:23,237
Well, believe me I had long hard
year I'm tired, I'm going hunting.

23
00:02:24,182 --> 00:02:26,278
Miss Gilbert, would you
put this in my bag, please.

24
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,343
bBecause that referred
to you last week

25
00:02:28,344 --> 00:02:30,065
is a terrible
temper justice Grant.

26
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:32,391
How do you feel
about that? - I'm flattered.

27
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:36,870
And this tomb miss Gibert.
-  Where are you going for your hanting?

28
00:02:37,494 --> 00:02:39,983
Well there are plenty
of docs, and nowhere reporters.

29
00:02:40,893 --> 00:02:44,997
When you are leaving?
-  A moment after you do.

30
00:02:45,609 --> 00:02:46,727
Good day, sir.

31
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:59,421
Miss Gilbert, what is this nonsense
What does this resignation mean?

32
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:02,677
I think it's obvious, sir.
-  if it were obvious I wouldn't

33
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:04,379
ask the question, would I?

34
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,731
Justis Grant, I've been
with you for two years.

35
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:12,475
And no time you aspect
satisfaction with my work.

36
00:03:13,187 --> 00:03:15,506
Miss Gilbert, you can learn
more law here in a week

37
00:03:15,507 --> 00:03:18,831
than you can anywhere else in a year,
and that's all that should interest you.

38
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,703
I don't feel that
I have to constantly

39
00:03:21,779 --> 00:03:24,221
remind you that you're
a brilliant young woman

40
00:03:24,256 --> 00:03:26,231
and that you have a fine future.

41
00:03:29,089 --> 00:03:33,044
Now if there isn't
anything else, can I go?

42
00:03:33,383 --> 00:03:36,750
Oh, you wanted to look over
the Hill and Try an opinion, sir,

43
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,125
they won't be back for
the premature till next week.

44
00:03:38,249 --> 00:03:40,152
Oh, yes they'll need some revision.

45
00:03:41,339 --> 00:03:43,439
But I don't want
to hang around here.

46
00:03:44,574 --> 00:03:46,744
Perhaps I can bring a
ot to you it can process, sir? (?)

47
00:03:46,779 --> 00:03:50,939
That'd be fine. No, no, no,
you need a vacation too.

48
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:54,431
From me.
- I don't mind it at all.

49
00:03:55,748 --> 00:03:58,813
Miss Gilbert are you
heaping coals of fire on my head?

50
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,781
I wouldn't dream of it, sir.

51
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:06,225
Oh I'll wire you
before I come. - Thank you.

52
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:10,854
Miss Gilbert. - Yes, sir? - No one
must know I'm going. No one.

53
00:04:12,188 --> 00:04:18,523
I want to get away
from courtrooms... investigations,

54
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:21,847
lawyers... black robes everything.

55
00:04:24,409 --> 00:04:27,523
Everything bath ducks.

56
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:33,087
Hundreds and hundreds
of beautiful ducks.

57
00:04:34,086 --> 00:04:38,802
Gvik, gvik, gvik, gvik
gvik. gvik, gvik, gvik, gvik.

58
00:04:38,803 --> 00:04:42,896
Gvik, gvik, gvik, gvik
gvik. gvik, gvik, gvik, gvik.

59
00:04:43,925 --> 00:04:46,598
Hey, you!
Wait a minute.

60
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:56,109
I'm Orrin Todds. Game
inspector. Let's see your license.

61
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,051
yeah just like I thought

62
00:05:00,179 --> 00:05:03,380
Stranger in town, ain't you?
Ths license ain't legal.

63
00:05:03,415 --> 00:05:05,640
Well, I just bought it
yesterday at the state capital.

64
00:05:06,158 --> 00:05:08,208
Yeah I know mister.
But this is Crown port.

65
00:05:08,507 --> 00:05:10,059
You got to have
acomport stamp on there.

66
00:05:10,356 --> 00:05:11,971
Well I didn't know that.
I'll get one tomorrow.

67
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:14,397
Are they ain't going
to do you any good today?

68
00:05:15,309 --> 00:05:18,305
No I could haul you into court and
let the judge slide we'll fine on you.

69
00:05:18,582 --> 00:05:20,562
But say wear and
tear on my tires for

70
00:05:20,866 --> 00:05:23,152
the cell you one right
here it only cost you five bucks.

71
00:05:31,672 --> 00:05:33,494
You know the five bucks
is just for the stamp.

72
00:05:33,797 --> 00:05:35,893
I usually get a little
something to my trouble, too..

73
00:05:37,964 --> 00:05:40,360
Well, you don't understand
I'm giving you a break, brother.

74
00:05:40,395 --> 00:05:42,029
Yeah, I never pay off
twice brother. Come on.

75
00:05:42,179 --> 00:05:45,264
Look, let me explain it to you.

76
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,605
Your Honor it's not as though
my client we're trying to evade

77
00:06:13,988 --> 00:06:15,284
his financial oblation.

78
00:06:15,956 --> 00:06:18,581
Tom Cooney is a member of
this community for many years.

79
00:06:19,221 --> 00:06:22,637
And all that time his honesty and his
responsibility has never been questioned.

80
00:06:23,253 --> 00:06:25,660
now he intends to make good
the payments on these flowers,

81
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,341
but he's been sick
unable to work.

82
00:06:28,376 --> 00:06:31,870
Now if the court could
just grant him an extension.

83
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,448
The law doesn't
recognize good intentions.

84
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,980
I shouldn't have to remind
you of that, mr. Adams,

85
00:06:35,991 --> 00:06:37,379
you're supposed
to be a lawyer.

86
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:40,899
But your honor am I not... am I
not justified in asking the court's

87
00:06:41,049 --> 00:06:42,076
indulgence in this case?

88
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:44,862
If you take Tom Cooney
spawn tools away from him,

89
00:06:45,134 --> 00:06:47,237
you take away his only
means of earning a living.

90
00:06:47,272 --> 00:06:51,230
Mr. Adams this is a court of
law, not an employment agency.

91
00:06:51,951 --> 00:06:53,658
Tom Cooney signed
an agreement with

92
00:06:53,943 --> 00:06:56,592
Vincent Blaxton of the Crown
port auto and supplies company

93
00:06:57,255 --> 00:06:59,772
This agreement stated if he
missed a payment on those plows,

94
00:07:00,117 --> 00:07:01,731
Mr. Blaxton could
take them back.

95
00:07:02,282 --> 00:07:06,178
Is that right mr. Cooney?
- Well, yes Your honor but...

96
00:07:06,488 --> 00:07:09,890
All right, judgment
concelor against Thomas Cooney.

97
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,833
But it... it was just one payment.
If you give me a chance to...

98
00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:17,489
I don't care whether
you say is fair or not.

99
00:07:17,763 --> 00:07:19,279
It ain't!
- Get him out of here.

100
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:22,558
Come on Tom, this isn't gonna help.
- I know it's not gonna help.

101
00:07:22,593 --> 00:07:26,037
Nothing's going to help in town
like this. - Officer. - Come on.

102
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,540
Let go on me.
- Come on. Looks like you

103
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,168
just lost yourself
another vote cellar.

104
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:33,160
I know ain't right.
- Come on. I know ain't right.

105
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:36,945
Crown Court versus Joe
Grant. Step up Joe Grant.

106
00:07:45,022 --> 00:07:48,172
Name?
- Joe Grant.

107
00:07:48,988 --> 00:07:51,348
Shooting ducks
without a Crown port permit.

108
00:07:51,753 --> 00:07:54,217
I didn't get a chance to shoot.
- You were going to.

109
00:07:54,504 --> 00:07:57,607
Of course I'm going to, you fool.
I so I bought a state license.

110
00:07:57,927 --> 00:08:00,589
We also require a Crown
port license mr. Grant

111
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:03,357
An ignorance of the law is no excuse.

112
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,725
100 $ or 30 days.

113
00:08:10,043 --> 00:08:14,215
Which one of you
gentleman do I pay? - The clerk.

114
00:08:15,093 --> 00:08:18,278
Should have bought it for me in the
first place, save yourself a lot of the bill.

115
00:08:19,136 --> 00:08:21,719
I assume that this
100 $ will permit me

116
00:08:21,754 --> 00:08:24,648
to resume my hunting
without further interference?

117
00:08:24,683 --> 00:08:28,140
Your assumption is wrong.
You still need a Crown port stamp.

118
00:08:28,677 --> 00:08:31,878
And an officer enforcing the
law is not interference, mr. Grant.

119
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,817
As a judge I advise you
to be careful of your words.

120
00:08:35,467 --> 00:08:36,529
Next case.

121
00:08:38,473 --> 00:08:41,979
Crown port vs. Burton
Line. Step up Burton Line.

122
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:48,539
Hi, Tom.

123
00:08:53,222 --> 00:08:54,636
I'm sorry it turned
out that way.

124
00:08:56,425 --> 00:08:58,719
Yes, that's the only
way twitter turned out.

125
00:08:58,754 --> 00:09:00,813
No I thought we had a chance
but I guess you should it know.

126
00:09:02,771 --> 00:09:06,288
What you gonna do no?
- Arms no good to me

127
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:08,191
without the tools to work. 

128
00:09:09,361 --> 00:09:13,800
Quess I lose it. Bank will start
yelling for its money pretty soon.

129
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:18,965
No Bill. Sometimes it just
morning man can stand.

130
00:09:21,277 --> 00:09:25,186
I got things something to do.  If I
can only... Yah, I know Tom. I know.

131
00:09:25,221 --> 00:09:26,948
But, why don't you come

132
00:09:27,098 --> 00:09:29,421
by the office later on
we'll talk about it, huh?

133
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:41,847
Hello, boys.

134
00:09:49,134 --> 00:09:50,138
Shave, Boomer.

135
00:09:53,611 --> 00:09:55,512
Right here poor
Tom Cooney lost his case.

136
00:09:55,977 --> 00:09:58,680
Yeah, he'll probably
lose his farm now, too.

137
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,232
It's a shame, c, c, c, c.

138
00:10:02,231 --> 00:10:04,642
You know Homer that's wha I like
about the fellas around your shop?

139
00:10:04,677 --> 00:10:06,196
They enjoy the good things of life.

140
00:10:06,737 --> 00:10:08,051
a guy who can't meet his mortgage,

141
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,619
or poor farmer geting dawn hs plaws.

142
00:10:10,948 --> 00:10:12,564
Say had a Cooney real shot, Roy.

143
00:10:13,217 --> 00:10:15,765
Maybe banker to extend
an honest man land credit,

144
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:17,244
or a judge' to give him a break

145
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,044
Talk like that isn't going to
get you any votes, Adams.

146
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:22,779
I can afford 50 cents
a guard to get yours.

147
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:35,315
Just the shave.
-  Sure, mr. Strange in tawn?

148
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:39,733
Aim just stay long?
- Long enough to get a shave.

149
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,203
Great little town, isn't it old timer?

150
00:10:44,189 --> 00:10:47,462
Yeah, judge Harkley really
gave you a welcome didn't he?

151
00:10:48,055 --> 00:10:51,581
And our constable Orrin
Todds that's... that's Homers cousin.

152
00:10:51,616 --> 00:10:55,438
He's all law and order regular
minute man isn't he, Homer?

153
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:59,550
Uh, how many minutes did it take
before he tried to shake you dawn?

154
00:10:59,664 --> 00:11:02,489
That's a shame. Ever notice how a
fella who can't make a living in a town

155
00:11:02,797 --> 00:11:04,175
always tries to run it down

156
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:10,638
you know mr... Grand isn't?
- Yeah. -  Mr. Grant,

157
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,709
might be fun to bust up one
of the constables little rackets.

158
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:16,716
How about being a guinea pig
et me turn this into a test case.

159
00:11:17,348 --> 00:11:19,411
Mr. Lane case save list
Jason wouldn't take it.

160
00:11:19,892 --> 00:11:21,308
Was two bucks to
vote in it for him.

161
00:11:24,046 --> 00:11:24,192
How you are boys?
- Hou you mr. mayor?

162
00:11:25,216 --> 00:11:27,512
Out there is very much of
weight home were? - It will, mr. mayor.

163
00:11:27,547 --> 00:11:29,415
Hello there my worthy opponent.

164
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:33,513
I'm sorry about Tom Cooney I
hope he doesn't go to pieces over this.

165
00:11:33,548 --> 00:11:35,600
he's really got something
good this is always.

166
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:38,143
You know, it's a funny thing about
some fellas are unaware your firm

167
00:11:38,178 --> 00:11:41,568
everything goes wrong for.
-  Hiya Tom, you looking for me?

168
00:11:41,603 --> 00:11:44,525
I'll be ready in a minute.
- Yeah, mr. mayor...

169
00:11:47,569 --> 00:11:48,879
if there's anything I can
a little ready cash or something...

170
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,914
I don't want charity...
-  I can't change the law, Tom.

171
00:11:51,949 --> 00:11:53,958
You the mayor.
-  but I'm not a nursemaid to

172
00:11:54,108 --> 00:11:56,459
every man in town
who can't take care of himself.

173
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,094
Alright Tomy that's
enough. Now beat it.

174
00:12:00,129 --> 00:12:02,159
Keep your hands of him.
-  Let him alone, Blaxton.

175
00:12:02,194 --> 00:12:06,882
Oh.  - No, no,
this is all my fault.

176
00:12:27,442 --> 00:12:32,053
I wish you hadn't had to do that funny
- he said coming to him for a long time.

177
00:12:32,088 --> 00:12:34,899
Our boy is turning
into an awful radical.

178
00:12:35,049 --> 00:12:38,286
You could sell that for the speech
he made accept the nomination.

179
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:41,415
let's kind of talk is never
going to make a miracle, boy.

180
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,899
It's too bad. Nothing I like better

181
00:12:44,049 --> 00:12:48,181
than to see some bright young fella
came along who would take my place.

182
00:12:49,241 --> 00:12:54,112
But Bill Adams? -  Take a man
to feel your she was mr. mayor.

183
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:05,796
Darrell dropped in this morning.
He said to give us regards.

184
00:13:12,267 --> 00:13:14,913
What's my Bill?
- Just a shame? - Yeah.

185
00:13:15,111 --> 00:13:16,385
50 cents

186
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:21,297
Hey mr. , bill is 50
cents, not a quarter.

187
00:13:21,332 --> 00:13:23,299
Guess she made
a mistake, friend.

188
00:13:26,711 --> 00:13:29,776
No, you made the mistake... friend.

189
00:13:33,402 --> 00:13:35,446
you pick the wrong
customer that time limit.

190
00:13:36,864 --> 00:13:39,617
This fella ten years every
sip the better on me

191
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:44,632
<font color=#00FFFF><b>WAY NOT TRY

193
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:10,289
Come on in old timer.
- thank you.

194
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:21,267
Well going stood
in boats? -  yeah.

195
00:14:22,781 --> 00:14:25,473
That's a rather interesting
model. Sees the Columbia.

196
00:14:25,593 --> 00:14:27,506
A square rigged for master.

197
00:14:28,674 --> 00:14:31,715
Nice work. -  Oh,
and here's a nice one.

198
00:14:32,428 --> 00:14:34,184
This is a parking team.

199
00:14:34,219 --> 00:14:37,685
Form a square rigged the other
mass for an average, rather unusual.

200
00:14:38,523 --> 00:14:40,861
For sail?
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

201
00:14:41,356 --> 00:14:43,839
No, they're not that good
it's only a hobby, just just for fun.

202
00:14:44,036 --> 00:14:50,224
I see you're running for mayor. - Yeah.
- Sort of a hobby too just for fun?

203
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,560
No, not quite.

204
00:14:54,145 --> 00:14:57,111
mayor Connison, you
saw him in the barber shop...

205
00:14:57,305 --> 00:15:00,258
he and his boys been running
this town for a long time.

206
00:15:00,489 --> 00:15:04,257
Make it pretty tough for anybody comes
up against them. - Yes I get it as much.

207
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,758
A lot of people been getting
tired of it. I have much time myself...

208
00:15:08,191 --> 00:15:10,491
the Army's going to grab
me in a couple of months,

209
00:15:11,049 --> 00:15:13,437
but I thought I might at
least get the ball rolling

210
00:15:13,691 --> 00:15:16,692
and for once give them a fight.
-  but not too much of a fight.

211
00:15:19,677 --> 00:15:21,375
Something you want
to see me about mr. Grant?

212
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,859
In the barber shop mr. Adams

213
00:15:23,894 --> 00:15:27,372
you mentioned the fact that you
might like to make a test case of my fine .

214
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:31,666
Yes, yes I think
you've got a case. - You do.

215
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,417
How would you go about it ?

216
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:37,976
Well, we... - lost the law requires
a stamp. I didn't have one.

217
00:15:38,349 --> 00:15:40,568
no no but I think I
could work out an appeal.

218
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:44,236
An appeal? On what
grounds? Was the fine illegal?

219
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,445
Oh, no, no. They had
a right to fine you.

220
00:15:47,175 --> 00:15:48,969
the fact that I was
unfamiliar with the law.

221
00:15:49,444 --> 00:15:52,051
Well, that's no
excuse obviously. - Obviously.

222
00:15:52,764 --> 00:15:55,493
Then what would you base
your appeal on mr. Adams?

223
00:15:56,368 --> 00:15:58,952
The fact that it's Tuesday
and the sun is shining?

224
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,612
Look, I haven't had much
time to give it thought.

225
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:05,573
But I can figure out an angle there
must be one lying around somewhat.

226
00:16:05,608 --> 00:16:06,932
Oh, yes I'm sure there is.

227
00:16:07,494 --> 00:16:10,405
In the meanwhile you can
always make a living as a carpenter.

228
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,568
Hiya, Bill. Oh, you're
busy? - No Charlie, come on in.

229
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:19,511
Mr. Grant, Charlie Craig
my campaign manager.

230
00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:20,853
How you do, sir?
- Hi.

231
00:16:21,277 --> 00:16:23,582
Any new votes Charlie?
- Enough to fill a dog's ear.

232
00:16:24,064 --> 00:16:26,568
Say I just heard about Tom
Cooney. - Yeah, he's taking it pretty hard.

233
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,899
I'm the same kind of
note he did so it don't look,

234
00:16:30,049 --> 00:16:30,153
so good for that
tractor mine either.

235
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,927
you couldn't get me a couple
of weeks performance could you?

236
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:34,822
I'll try charlie
but there's no use,

237
00:16:34,823 --> 00:16:37,459
of peeling the black stone over
the way he's got his business set up

238
00:16:37,476 --> 00:16:40,399
his hopping on my tail wouldn't
burn me if I hadn't had so much

239
00:16:40,434 --> 00:16:41,696
trouble with that tractor.

240
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,707
every time I needed a spare
part I had to send for myself

241
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,818
Blaxton never carried him in stop.
- Did Blaxton promise you such service,

242
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:53,181
No, there's nothing in the
contract about providing service.

243
00:16:53,591 --> 00:16:57,045
Has Blaxton lived up to all his
legal obligations a seller of the tractor?

244
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,516
No, sir. You sound like a
lawyer yourself mr. Grant.

245
00:17:02,197 --> 00:17:04,780
Yes, well, I was
about 20 years ago.

246
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:08,074
well maybe you could
give Bill here ponder it to.

247
00:17:08,075 --> 00:17:09,544
Anyway I'm glad to met you.

248
00:17:09,977 --> 00:17:11,918
Be seeing you mr. mayor.
I'm going out and see if I can

249
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,621
educate a few votes for you.

250
00:17:15,938 --> 00:17:18,014
Well, mr. Grant since you'll
have some knowledge of the law,

251
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:20,398
you probably decided there's
nothing much I can do for you.

252
00:17:21,045 --> 00:17:23,990
Well, what about Craig, what
are you going to do about him?

253
00:17:24,025 --> 00:17:27,039
What can I do for him?
With Hartley on the bench?

254
00:17:27,738 --> 00:17:28,935
You saw what
happened to Tom Cooney.

255
00:17:29,175 --> 00:17:31,309
You can't blame
that on judge Hartley.

256
00:17:31,459 --> 00:17:33,913
You went into that courtroom without
a defense, that's why you got whipped.

257
00:17:34,729 --> 00:17:36,244
Well, and I guess to get
whipped again. - I guess you will.

258
00:17:37,411 --> 00:17:39,159
You're not much of a
fighter, are you mr. Adams?

259
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:42,366
Except in the barber
shop brawls. - Oh, stop it.

260
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,606
You can't fight brass
knuckles with spitballs.

261
00:17:45,184 --> 00:17:47,359
The trick in this town is either
to play the game their way,

262
00:17:47,509 --> 00:17:49,071
and I haven't the
stomach for that,

263
00:17:49,072 --> 00:17:52,666
or to be as smart as they are.
- The trick mr. Adams is to be smarter.

264
00:17:56,322 --> 00:17:58,250
What does that wind up your
business? Are you going to stay

265
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,246
and give me the first private lessons
how to win friends, and influence judges?

266
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:03,796
No mr. Adams, I'm not.

267
00:18:04,154 --> 00:18:06,785
Those lessons have been
written and very well written in

268
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,282
books like this,
and all the others.

269
00:18:09,775 --> 00:18:12,187
And somewhere in one of
them, there's a lesson mentioning

270
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,860
that in any transaction
between a seller and a buyer

271
00:18:14,884 --> 00:18:18,246
there are laws governing
the behavior of both parties.

272
00:18:18,982 --> 00:18:21,399
But I doubt if you can keep
afloat long enough to find it.

273
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:25,936
You know mr. Adams I've seen
you in action now as a lawyer

274
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:29,386
as a candidate for
mayor and as a shipbuilder.

275
00:18:30,203 --> 00:18:32,533
And if you'll take my advice
you will stick to shipbuilding.

276
00:18:33,068 --> 00:18:35,389
There's a great
future in it for lawyers.

277
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:58,146
Excuse me, sir, for breaking
in like this, but I think I found it.

278
00:19:02,405 --> 00:19:03,989
Yes, yes that covers it.

279
00:19:05,261 --> 00:19:06,321
You've said you haven't
practiced law for 20 years

280
00:19:06,322 --> 00:19:08,830
imagine remembering
a thing like that.

281
00:19:10,563 --> 00:19:13,668
Have you had dinner mr.
Adams? - No thanks, not hungry.

282
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:17,493
I... I think this will
cover it. It should work but...

283
00:19:18,038 --> 00:19:19,675
I've been batted down
by those guys so often,

284
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:21,372
I quess I haven't
to much cofidence.

285
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:27,402
How long have you lived
in Crown port mr. Adams?

286
00:19:29,246 --> 00:19:31,452
For 28 years with time out
for colleagues in law school.

287
00:19:33,094 --> 00:19:35,233
Never established
residents in any other state?

288
00:19:35,564 --> 00:19:37,225
No.
- Are you sure in that?

289
00:19:38,775 --> 00:19:40,257
Well, of course.

290
00:19:44,043 --> 00:19:46,892
Oh,  we... we went to Mexico for a
few months when I was seven, but...

291
00:19:47,502 --> 00:19:51,156
Did you file an income tax
returns on 1939 and 40?

292
00:19:51,538 --> 00:19:52,572
Well, sure.

293
00:19:53,245 --> 00:19:56,701
I didn't pay anything in 1940. I
didn't earn enough, but I filed a return.

294
00:19:56,843 --> 00:20:01,558
And your figures were honest,
correct and would their investigation.

295
00:20:01,777 --> 00:20:05,747
What? Well of well course they were.
- Oh, you getting nervous mr. Adams.

296
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,707
I'm not nervous, I'm really... - Ah,
yes, yes, you are you flustered

297
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:09,947
you're raising your voice

298
00:20:09,982 --> 00:20:10,964
Why shouldn't I raise my voice

299
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,386
you must God has accused
me of falsifying my income taxes.

300
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:14,948
I've accused you
of nothing mr. Adams.

301
00:20:14,983 --> 00:20:16,377
Now look I don't know
what you have on there, 

302
00:20:16,658 --> 00:20:18,525
but I want to tell you...
- Take a look.

303
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:29,287
It's... it's an old trick that
Justice Brandeis used to play.

304
00:20:30,788 --> 00:20:32,784
I read about it
in Colliers once.

305
00:20:33,195 --> 00:20:35,401
You see, it's an
unfortunate fact mr. Adams

306
00:20:35,743 --> 00:20:39,192
that every man, even
you and I, has done something,

307
00:20:39,227 --> 00:20:41,074
that he doesn't want
anybody to know about.

308
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,982
Now you can make him think
that you're holding in your hand

309
00:20:45,629 --> 00:20:47,375
the skeleton in his
closet.. - You've got it.

310
00:20:49,463 --> 00:20:54,288
Well let's say at least you've got him
squirming... nervous... worried as you were,

311
00:20:55,155 --> 00:20:59,070
but if that man happens to
have a really guilty conscience.

312
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:11,955
your full name is
Vincent Lee Braxton? - Yes.

313
00:21:12,884 --> 00:21:15,855
Tell me mr. Braxton,
what does the Z stand for?

314
00:21:17,912 --> 00:21:20,170
Do I have to answer
that, Your honor?

315
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,640
What can be your objection,
surely you have nothing to hide.

316
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:30,878
Well, the Z...  well,
Z stands for Zeffir.

317
00:21:30,913 --> 00:21:32,480
It's a family name.

318
00:21:33,185 --> 00:21:36,669
Zeffir? Means a
little wind I believe.

319
00:21:42,464 --> 00:21:43,354
Quiet.

320
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:49,089
Mr. Braxton, you're the owner and manager
of the Crown for Taran company? - Yes.

321
00:21:49,451 --> 00:21:53,942
The sole owner?
- Well, sure of course.

322
00:21:55,111 --> 00:22:01,991
No silent partners?
- No. Well of course... (?)

323
00:22:02,084 --> 00:22:03,414
Then, you're
not the sole owner.

324
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:05,886
I didn't say
that I just say...

325
00:22:05,921 --> 00:22:07,268
You sound very
strange to me mr. Blaxton.

326
00:22:07,551 --> 00:22:10,181
You don't know whether you
own your own business. - I object.

327
00:22:10,534 --> 00:22:14,456
That question is irrelevant, immaterial,
and calculated to confuse the witness.

328
00:22:14,921 --> 00:22:16,126
Objection sustained.

329
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:19,648
Counselor will restrict himself
to the facts very on this case.

330
00:22:21,782 --> 00:22:26,346
Mr. Braxton... the company sells most of
the used cars and tractors in this town.

331
00:22:27,532 --> 00:22:30,967
Almost a monopoly, isn't it?
-  I do the most business

332
00:22:31,271 --> 00:22:34,088
because I sell my
stuck at lowest prises.

333
00:22:34,577 --> 00:22:37,675
that's not monopoly. That's...

334
00:22:38,532 --> 00:22:40,244
that's the American
Way of life.

335
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,340
Tell me mr. Braxton...

336
00:22:43,902 --> 00:22:46,846
carry spare parts for
your customers? - Sure.

337
00:22:50,312 --> 00:22:55,312
You have in stock at
this moment piston rings for

338
00:22:56,286 --> 00:22:59,953
Well mr. Braxton?
- Well, no. I don't.

339
00:22:59,988 --> 00:23:02,810
Oh then you don't carry all the spare
parts your customers might need.

340
00:23:03,324 --> 00:23:04,770
Well, I can always get
them if they need them.

341
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:08,372
Yes, but sometimes your customers
have to wait. - Sure, it takes two weeks.

342
00:23:09,709 --> 00:23:12,948
If I ain't got them,
how can they have them?

343
00:23:13,758 --> 00:23:16,468
The intelligent engine mr.
Braxton, and an honest one.

344
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:20,949
one which will require the court to
enter judgment against you in this case.

345
00:23:22,613 --> 00:23:25,517
Will counselor explain that
statement. - Certainly,  Your honor.

346
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:33,165
Motor vehicle laws nineteen
nineteen chapter 174 section 52.

347
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,645
The sale of any automobile
or any other automotive vehicle

348
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:41,109
is void unless the dealer
carries in stock at all times,

349
00:23:41,259 --> 00:23:45,126
and on demand parts that may be
needed to repair particulary vehicle.

350
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,113
Will you let me
see that reference?

351
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:57,090
Counselor would
seem to be correct.

352
00:24:03,739 --> 00:24:07,989
You put it over, Bill. Say
will take your Tom cloony too. (?)

353
00:24:08,286 --> 00:24:09,567
You're telling me.

354
00:24:23,685 --> 00:24:24,701
Oh, mr. Grant.

355
00:24:27,421 --> 00:24:29,478
Sorry, I thought
you were going hunting.

356
00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:33,813
All the ducks are inside today. I
see you winged a couple yourself.

357
00:24:34,126 --> 00:24:36,266
Oh it's nothing really big.

358
00:24:36,889 --> 00:24:40,027
Who am I kidding. I'm so tickled
I feel like a combination of Superman

359
00:24:40,466 --> 00:24:42,478
and a member of
the Supreme court.

360
00:24:45,723 --> 00:24:45,723
and really I... I don't know
how to thank you, mister Grant.

361
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:49,421
Oh, no need to my boy. First time
I've enjoyed a courtroom in here.

362
00:24:49,815 --> 00:24:52,104
Hey. Thank you

363
00:24:55,023 --> 00:24:57,522
You know what this stuff is?
- No mr. Grant, he wouldn't.

364
00:24:57,948 --> 00:25:00,921
William this is American money.
Good old fold of money.

365
00:25:01,227 --> 00:25:03,523
You know what you can do with this
stuff? You can buy things that you need.

366
00:25:04,084 --> 00:25:06,496
You get it? - And what
I don't get is, where you got it?

367
00:25:06,775 --> 00:25:10,296
For Z and bikes and get tram warm some
arts and unloosen a couple of purse strings.

368
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,403
The boys have kicked
in for your campaign fund.

369
00:25:12,827 --> 00:25:14,677
You know what we're going
to do with this beautiful stuff?

370
00:25:14,712 --> 00:25:16,200
we're going to get some
posters printed great, big ones.

371
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:19,745
They kind of look you're right
straight in the eye and call you around

372
00:25:25,914 --> 00:25:28,643
Why get frightened so Adams
does win one rotten little case.

373
00:25:29,157 --> 00:25:32,134
Do you know what that case
cost me? - You can afford it.

374
00:25:34,994 --> 00:25:38,035
you'd scream like a
stuck pig. - Stop it, stop it.

375
00:25:39,427 --> 00:25:43,804
Seriously Jim, you don't see
Adams it's really competition.

376
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,207
Whoa, staying a Stan now no,

377
00:25:46,704 --> 00:25:50,729
but if a lot of people start thinking of
Bill Adams as the people's champion.

378
00:25:50,764 --> 00:25:54,938
Well... - Jim there was
nothing else I could do.

379
00:25:55,569 --> 00:25:58,866
I can give you boys the edge
when it's a question of interpretation.

380
00:25:59,459 --> 00:26:01,813
but not when the laws like
they're in black and white.

381
00:26:02,155 --> 00:26:05,250
Oh, I'm not blaming you, judges.

382
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,972
Just something to start
thinking about, that's all.

383
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,720
You think we'll have trouble?

384
00:26:10,217 --> 00:26:11,313
Well, now look boys.

385
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:16,461
On second thought, we may be
getting all steamed up for nothing.

386
00:26:16,496 --> 00:26:22,288
Yeah, but suppose he opens a
lot of old cases like Tom Cooney's.

387
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:24,750
I think you've got
something there Zeffir.

388
00:26:28,832 --> 00:26:30,617
We'll just have to show
the boy that is wrong.

Yes I know. - Let me
take that. The cars over here.

398
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,636
Is it... you think we should
try to scoop some of that up?

399

No, I guess not.
Huh, well...

Oh, no. No, yes right here.

403
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:33,648
Sorry to get off to such a bad
start. I'm not always so clumsy

Oh! My hat!

Don't worry we'll... we'l get it.

How long have you
worked for mr. Grant?

407
00:29:46,688 --> 00:29:50,289
Two years. - A credit
character, isn't it?

408
00:29:51,115 --> 00:29:54,759
Quite. -  You know, I
was very surprised,

409
00:29:54,909 --> 00:29:56,266
when he told me his
secretary was coming dow.

410
00:29:56,556 --> 00:29:58,014
I had an idea the
old boy was retired.

411
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:01,096
The old boy is ... retired.

412
00:30:01,656 --> 00:30:03,333
Where is he now, mr. Adams?

413
00:30:03,694 --> 00:30:06,019
He went over to well bridge
this morning do some hunting.

414
00:30:06,292 --> 00:30:07,589
He oughta be back soon.

415

What's going to drive
you around the town but...

416
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:16,445
I guess you want
to get cleaned up now.

417
00:30:16,935 --> 00:30:19,891
Yes, I think I will. -  I'll
take you straight to the hotel.

00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:36,765
Surprised? - That's putting
it very mildly, mr. Adams.

422
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,289
Won't make the most of it lady

423
00:30:38,324 --> 00:30:41,107

- Take your hands off her.

00:31:16,585 --> 00:31:17,868
Oh, yeah?

434
00:31:17,869 --> 00:31:30,551
Nice work, pal.

435
00:31:41,195 --> 00:31:42,275
I tell you you can't do this.

436
00:31:42,613 --> 00:31:44,076

Sergeant, I want
to use that phone.

00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,502
Will you please keep
quiet, Your honor.

441
00:31:57,156 --> 00:31:58,596
Just trying to get us
out of here, you know?

442
00:31:58,688 --> 00:32:01,225
Why don't you think
of that before you got a... (?)

443
00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:04,594
Look I'm very sorry this
happened, but it isn't my fault.

444
00:32:06,108 --> 00:32:07,657
I suppose I started the fight.

445
00:32:07,658 --> 00:32:10,327
You sure did all
right once it got going.

446
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:14,842
Ho, ho, ho, what a
gal, and what a wallop.

447
00:32:16,261 --> 00:32:18,734
Yeah miss G. you're
really some scrapper.

448
00:32:22,952 --> 00:32:24,603
Say Roscoe Swade asked
me to call you a judge,

449
00:32:24,857 --> 00:32:27,105
we've got Bill Adams in here
with a dame salt and battery.

450
00:32:27,754 --> 00:32:28,972
How long do you
want us to hold him here?

451
00:32:29,517 --> 00:32:32,519
Oh, just let them
stew for a while, sergeant.

452
00:32:33,887 --> 00:32:36,392
Adams will probably
want to get in touch with me.

453
00:32:37,224 --> 00:32:40,294
And... oh, he does, huh?

454
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:43,624
Well, I'm out of town.
You can't reach me anywhere.

455
00:32:45,819 --> 00:32:46,914
That's right.
Overnight.

456
00:32:55,339 --> 00:32:59,388
Will you have a chef prepare a couple
of these for tomorrow night's dinner.

457
00:32:59,579 --> 00:33:01,981
And I'll have my key, please.

458
00:33:01,982 --> 00:33:05,235
What... what room
did you put miss Gilbert?

459
00:33:06,139 --> 00:33:09,760
Gilbert. Gilbert. There's
no miss Gilbert registered.

460
00:33:10,624 --> 00:33:15,068
Well, that's... - Anything
wrong mr. Grant?

461
00:33:15,103 --> 00:33:16,265
Why yes, I was expecting
my secretary today.

462
00:33:16,532 --> 00:33:18,021
Mr. Adams went to met her.

463
00:33:19,101 --> 00:33:22,579
Your secretary?
-  Yeah, miss... miss Gilbert,

464
00:33:22,868 --> 00:33:24,234
miss Lucy Gilbert have
you heard from? - No.

465
00:33:24,797 --> 00:33:29,519
No. Not exactly, well that is she
was here, but... - Where is she?

466
00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:32,697
Well mr. Grant, you see,
we had a little trouble.

467
00:33:32,945 --> 00:33:37,024
Where is she? - She's
with Adams in the county jail.

468
00:33:37,593 --> 00:33:40,930
Well you get them out
of there and fast. - Yes, sir.

469
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:45,390
Yes, sir, right away. Buddy
get me judge Hockley, quick.

470
00:33:45,956 --> 00:33:46,894
Yes, sir.

471
00:33:59,055 --> 00:34:02,992
Good evening mr. Grant.
- Well, good evening miss Gilbert.

472
00:34:03,944 --> 00:34:06,140
I'm sorry I couldn't
meet you at the station.

473
00:34:08,849 --> 00:34:10,492
So I'm I, sir.

474
00:34:10,527 --> 00:34:14,247
However, mr. Adam seems
to have made your introduction

475
00:34:14,527 --> 00:34:16,744
to Crown board quite spectacular.

476
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:20,282
Well it amuses you both.
-  Of course it was quite forvoa.

477
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:23,455
Ha, ha, ha, I'm sorry.
Sit down, miss Gilbert.

478
00:34:24,213 --> 00:34:26,549
You, uh... seemed tired.

479
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:30,460
What... what happened?
- Well when I said the boys were...

480
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:33,101
we're playing with brass
knuckles I wasn't kidding.

481
00:34:33,743 --> 00:34:35,179
Look, I win a case from Blackston,

482
00:34:35,798 --> 00:34:37,211
that makes a good
impression around town,

483
00:34:37,522 --> 00:34:39,849
so I walk into Swade's hotel,

484
00:34:39,999 --> 00:34:41,240
Rosco says something provokes a fight,

485
00:34:41,511 --> 00:34:44,158
and I land in jail that's the
way Crown courts run mr. Grant.

486
00:34:44,193 --> 00:34:47,614
I hope the fact that as Gilbert
was involved won't upset you.

487
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:51,399
The fact that miss Gilbert was
involved upsets me a great deal.

488
00:34:52,463 --> 00:34:54,668
It strikes me that Swade
Carlson and company are...

489
00:34:55,188 --> 00:34:58,996
just been a little too high-handed
- Well, you can't fight the city halter.

490
00:34:59,031 --> 00:35:02,196
As candidate for mayor
that's what you're doing, isn't it?

491
00:35:02,231 --> 00:35:05,415
Well I suppose I am, but employees
are starting to play rough.

492
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,179
Well of course if they play too rough

493
00:35:07,329 --> 00:35:09,735
you can always go back
to your ship building.

494
00:35:10,646 --> 00:35:11,600
Yes, I guess I could.

495
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:14,026
But right now I'm
going to go home,

496
00:35:14,439 --> 00:35:16,500
get some sleep miss Gilbert and
I have a date in court tomorrow.

497
00:35:16,535 --> 00:35:18,261
Good night miss Gilbert.

498
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,171
Don't hold me against
comport. Good night, sir.

499
00:35:30,915 --> 00:35:33,795
You know perhaps
you'd like to go over them.

500
00:35:34,769 --> 00:35:38,871
I gather somehow that you're
not very much drawn mr. Adams

501
00:35:40,526 --> 00:35:43,030
My personal reactions to
him aren't important, sir.

502
00:35:43,065 --> 00:35:45,327
Well I wouldn't be too hasty.

503
00:35:46,584 --> 00:35:47,881
He attacked too much trouble.

504
00:35:48,249 --> 00:35:51,104
He certainly does. His
whole approach is wrong.

505
00:35:51,139 --> 00:35:54,173
He shuts his eyes
and waves in and slugs.

506
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:58,690
But he has good stuff.

507
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,483
Do you think it wise to get
involved with his problem?

508
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:02,920
After all, you are
on your vacation.

509
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:06,478
Oh, I'm not involved I'm
just trying to give the boy a push.

510
00:36:06,513 --> 00:36:07,630
Come in.

511
00:36:10,687 --> 00:36:13,063
May Iturn your bed down, sir.
- Oh, yes, yes, certainly.

512
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:17,069
Good night mr. Grant.
- Good night.

513
00:36:18,319 --> 00:36:21,360
Oh.
- Pardom mua.

514
00:36:21,852 --> 00:36:25,413
Good night, miss Gibert.

515
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:38,927
Kind of skimpy, isn't it? - They
just ain't long enough, none of them.

516
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,802
I keep it telling mr. Swade.

517
00:36:42,302 --> 00:36:44,243
Well, thy have to do it.

518
00:36:44,941 --> 00:36:47,459
Good night, sir. Hope
you rest well. - Thank you.

519
00:36:55,573 --> 00:36:57,381
<font color=#00FFFF><b>THE MAN WHO WON'T SELL

521
00:37:25,729 --> 00:37:29,810
Wrong number. - Mr. Adams
wake up. This is mr. Grant.

522
00:37:31,596 --> 00:37:34,708
What? Wait a minute.

523
00:37:36,124 --> 00:37:36,892
Yeah?

524
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,420
Want me to write?
- I said get any of your clothes

525
00:37:42,455 --> 00:37:45,333
get two yard
sticks. Yard sticks.

526
00:37:45,432 --> 00:37:48,037
Come right over here and
register for the night of the hotel.

527
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,055
I'll tell you all about it when
you get here. But get here.

528
00:37:51,471 --> 00:37:52,486
Rright.

529
00:37:52,765 --> 00:38:02,271
Halllo, Roscoe.

530
00:38:03,584 --> 00:38:07,008
Give me a single room next mr.
Grant. - How lot? - I'll pay in advance.

531
00:38:14,362 --> 00:38:17,852
What's the matter, Roscoe?
you don't seem happy to see me?

532
00:38:17,887 --> 00:38:22,391
I... a have my baggage too.

533
00:38:26,432 --> 00:38:28,116
Why should he sleep
here with yard sticks?

534
00:38:28,485 --> 00:38:29,851
He's got a place of his own.

535
00:38:36,668 --> 00:38:37,816
Hello? Get me miss
Gilbert's room, please.

536
00:38:38,087 --> 00:38:39,201
What do we
started? - Shhh.

537
00:38:39,236 --> 00:38:41,624
Why should he want to talk to
her in the middle of the night?

538
00:38:45,601 --> 00:38:46,947
I don't know.

539
00:38:49,562 --> 00:38:50,272
It's Grant.

540
00:38:50,307 --> 00:38:55,427
Yes mr. Grant.
Yes, sir. Right away.

541
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:58,626
He wants a bellboy right away.

542
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:00,580
He wants to send
something to mr. Gilbert's room.

543
00:39:00,615 --> 00:39:03,190
They're up to something,
I know they are.

544
00:39:06,209 --> 00:39:07,535
Henry.

545
00:39:13,349 --> 00:39:15,543
Take this yardstick
to miss Gilbert.

546
00:39:15,807 --> 00:39:18,545
Yes, sir. Oh, mr. Swade
send with his compliments.

547
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:21,633
My compliments to
mr. Swade. I don't eat fruit.

I got a bowl of fruit for you.
Mr. Swade send with his compliments.

551
00:40:03,904 --> 00:40:06,772
My compliments to
mr. Swade, but I lost my apetit.

552
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:22,144
I couldn't see nothing.
They blacked out the room.

553
00:40:26,247 --> 00:40:27,186
Number, please. (?)

554
00:40:27,295 --> 00:40:29,385
She calling Grant.

555
00:40:34,033 --> 00:40:34,895
Yes, miss Gilbert?

556
00:40:35,456 --> 00:40:36,465
7 and a half.

557
00:40:36,754 --> 00:40:38,105
Same here. And the others?

558
00:40:39,057 --> 00:40:40,759
Two and a half.
- That daz it.

559
00:40:43,783 --> 00:40:45,032
Maybe it's a cod.

560
00:40:48,482 --> 00:40:50,220
Oh, don't worry
Roscoe. I'll be back.

561
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:27,290
Suites hotel?
Give me mr. Grants room.

562
00:41:28,796 --> 00:41:31,176
Mr. Grant, you were
absolutely right. It's nine and two.

563
00:41:32,346 --> 00:41:33,411
Yeah, I'll be back in a minut.

564
00:41:34,412 --> 00:41:37,816
Oh I think mr. Swade it's going
to be a little sorry tomorrow

565
00:41:38,114 --> 00:41:39,737
that he's bringing
those charges against us.

566
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:02,679
Good afternoon miss Gilbert, mr. Grant.
You're looking very beautiful miss Gilbert.

567
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:04,664
Really? I didn't sleep at all.

568
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:07,054
Probably nervous exhaustion,

569
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,415
due to the unfortunate
experience you underwent yesterday.

570
00:42:10,841 --> 00:42:14,201
Ever spent any
time in jail mr. Swade?

571
00:42:14,842 --> 00:42:17,424
Ever been sued for false
arrest mr. Swade? - Miss Gilbert,

572
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:20,335
I made up my mind to
drop the complaint against you.

573
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:24,657
Well, what about the complaint against
mr. Adams? He spent a few hours in jail too.

574
00:42:24,692 --> 00:42:28,291
You've got nobody but yourself to
thank you started it kidding Henry.

575
00:42:28,488 --> 00:42:31,656
I'll forget you hit me.
- He didn't hit you. I did.

576
00:42:31,673 --> 00:42:36,745
Well I'll forget that too, but...
- But six hours in jail is something

577
00:42:37,051 --> 00:42:42,619
I wont forgetting
mr. Swade. I think 5.000 $

578
00:42:43,095 --> 00:42:46,195
Well I had thought of 10, but
- No, I think five is enough.

579
00:42:47,216 --> 00:42:50,160
Oh don't worry mr. Swade.
I'll see that the money goes

580
00:42:49,309 --> 00:42:51,621
to a good cause
I'll invest in war bond.

581
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:01,879
Court is now in session.
Judge Hartley presiding.

582
00:43:03,871 --> 00:43:05,817
The case of Swade
versus Gilbert and Adams.

583
00:43:11,415 --> 00:43:14,167
Judge I move you
through my complaint out.

584
00:43:16,335 --> 00:43:19,089
The complaint against
miss Gilbert? - Yes. Adams too.

585
00:43:19,741 --> 00:43:21,473
We settled advise himself.

586
00:43:21,749 --> 00:43:23,882
How's alone?
- Yeah.

587
00:43:24,813 --> 00:43:31,212
Well, case of Suede versus
Gibert and Adams dismist.

588
00:43:33,403 --> 00:43:36,796
You can thank miss Gibert for getting
you off so easy. - Thank you, Lucy.

589
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:44,772
Oh Roscoe, just a minute,
Roscoe. We're not quite true yet.

590
00:43:44,982 --> 00:43:47,173
As Joe said the papers
are mr. Swade.

591
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:51,319
Rosco Slade.
- what are you toking about?

592
00:43:51,639 --> 00:43:54,945
I took it if I drop my suit against
you you've got yours against me.

593
00:43:55,361 --> 00:43:56,824
Relax Rosco, this is another suit.

594
00:43:57,537 --> 00:43:59,891
Your Honor, I find that in
the management of his hotel,

595
00:44:00,186 --> 00:44:02,523
mr. Swade is in violation
of several important laws,

596
00:44:02,536 --> 00:44:06,454
What are the charges? - I brought
the evidence with me, Your honor.

597
00:44:13,133 --> 00:44:16,262
The hotel laws of this
state 1909 section 52.

598
00:44:17,064 --> 00:44:21,200
All sheets provided in all hotels
hostelry skins or lodging houses

599
00:44:21,446 --> 00:44:23,370
shall be a minimum of
nine feet in length.

600
00:44:27,835 --> 00:44:29,091
7 and a half feature, Your honor.

601
00:44:30,132 --> 00:44:32,180
All pillowcases shall be
a minimum of three feet.

602
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:35,252
Two and a half feet, Your honor.

603
00:44:36,438 --> 00:44:39,549
There should be a minimum distance
between all twin beds of two feet.

604
00:44:39,789 --> 00:44:42,265
Now, the beds in my room
with the swayed hotel

605
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,107
were scarcely half a
foot apart, Your honor

606
00:44:44,516 --> 00:44:46,578
I couldn't bring them in
evidence but I have witnesses

607
00:44:47,019 --> 00:44:48,509
who can testify
as to my veracity.

608
00:44:49,694 --> 00:44:51,454
Let me see this
reference. - Certainly.

609
00:45:00,377 --> 00:45:01,802
You'll be sorry for this.
You wait and see.

610
00:45:02,187 --> 00:45:03,419
Will the court law
in the defendant

611
00:45:03,583 --> 00:45:05,467
the threats and intimidation
are punishable by law?

612
00:45:05,811 --> 00:45:09,691
Quiet mister Swade, and you
don't tell me how to run my court .

613
00:45:11,061 --> 00:45:15,010
The law provides a fine
500 $. - Up for each offense.

614
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:21,036
Are you prepared to face these
charges at the present time? - Yes.

615
00:45:21,565 --> 00:45:22,633
You plead guilty?

616
00:45:23,845 --> 00:45:27,500
Yes.
- And pay the clerk.

617
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:33,094
Nice work, counsellor.

618
00:45:51,019 --> 00:45:54,646
Half hour recess.

619
00:46:09,511 --> 00:46:12,415
Well this couldn't by any
chance be a little gift for mr. Swade.

620
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:16,126
I thought we might end
our celebration in style.

621
00:46:17,279 --> 00:46:20,656
What what vintage is
that miss? - California 1938.

622
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:23,678
Here, I'll do it miss.

623
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:27,959
Tell I'm an amateur
the bottle resents me.

624
00:46:30,697 --> 00:46:32,468
Well, it stopped anyway.

625
00:46:34,844 --> 00:46:39,162
Gil. -  To the next
pair of Crown pause.

626
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:43,146
Yes, who's learned to
use his head and law books.

627
00:46:44,948 --> 00:46:46,805
Oh, to my rooting section.

628
00:46:49,305 --> 00:46:51,120
I think you're on
the right track counselor.

629
00:46:51,401 --> 00:46:53,626
You keep the connaissance
busy on the little things,

630
00:46:53,939 --> 00:46:55,397
and they won't have
time for the bigger one.

631
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:56,778
Nieder would I.

632
00:46:57,121 --> 00:47:01,154
Mm-hmm. Well I think I'd like to
do a little hunting in the morning

633
00:47:01,189 --> 00:47:04,379
if you can keep your life
Kaylee quiet for one day.

634
00:47:04,634 --> 00:47:08,294
Well I'll try. Lucy might keep
an eye on me, that woul'd help.

635
00:47:09,074 --> 00:47:11,078
I'll be responsible for him, sir.

636
00:47:11,171 --> 00:47:12,681
Starting with breakfast.

637
00:47:14,721 --> 00:47:18,402
Well... - I... I think Lucy would
probably like some more coffee.

638
00:47:19,689 --> 00:47:20,833
Yes, I would.

639
00:47:22,475 --> 00:47:25,431
It'll just keep you awake.
- Well... - Good night.

640
00:47:25,466 --> 00:47:26,802
Good night.
-  Good night, sir.

641
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:34,008
More coffee?

642
00:47:39,067 --> 00:47:40,845
I suppose you're
a wonderful dancer.

643
00:47:41,606 --> 00:47:44,038
Yeah.
- I'm awful. - Good.

644
00:47:44,139 --> 00:47:47,562
Well magnesium cerium.
May I have a sampl? - Sure.

645
00:47:52,964 --> 00:47:55,328
Hey, I'm not so
bad, am I? - You fine.

646
00:47:56,927 --> 00:48:00,705
I guess the trouble is I just never
liked to dance before. - Neither did I.

647
00:48:04,522 --> 00:48:07,458
You know Lucy, Crown ports
not such a bad little town,

648
00:48:08,068 --> 00:48:11,500
it's got a lot of nice people.
You've just seen the worst side of it.

649
00:48:11,501 --> 00:48:13,503
Like you?
- Mmhh.

650
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,167
Know what, I mean
Lucy is, well...

651
00:48:17,202 --> 00:48:21,639
can you see yourself
living in a town like Crown port?

652
00:48:22,569 --> 00:48:24,218
No pretty delegates.

653
00:48:24,348 --> 00:48:27,954
Very. Practically nothing's
happened to me since I met you.

654
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:31,590
Yeah. You know no but
seriously sometimes I have home

655
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:32,886
days of peace and quiet.

656
00:48:33,346 --> 00:48:35,092
Well, we've been
together for several hours,

657
00:48:36,107 --> 00:48:37,766
nothing very
spectacular has happened.

658
00:48:40,551 --> 00:48:42,020
Not near enough has happened.

659
00:48:55,603 --> 00:48:56,764
Let's get out of here.

660
00:49:00,281 --> 00:49:01,289
Sorry.

661
00:49:03,044 --> 00:49:07,140
Sometimes we have old days of
peace and quiet? Good night mr. Adams.

Oh, no. Oh no. Mr. Grant said

666
00:49:29,718 --> 00:49:32,140
What he says goes

667
00:49:32,603 --> 00:49:34,395

Come on boys, don't

00:49:58,422 --> 00:50:01,388
Because of the lumber I keep
around the places attracted termites.

675
00:50:01,659 --> 00:50:03,664
How do you like that?
- It's fantastic.

00:50:05,489 --> 00:50:07,911
Look Look, can't you

681
00:50:19,765 --> 00:50:20,731
until I can get
another office.

682

Yeah. Just drop my

692
00:51:08,975 --> 00:51:09,792
Now, follow me.

693
00:51:13,447 --> 00:51:16,458
Who's responsible for this?
- Seems that Roscoe Swade

694
00:51:16,494 --> 00:51:18,030
has a pal name Hart Ridges

695
00:51:18,258 --> 00:51:21,269

happens to be one Connison's boys.

696
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:24,925
Oh, so Roscoe gives heart
a call and here I am.

697
00:51:25,788 --> 00:51:27,294
Don't worry though
I'll get another office.

698
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:30,087
Hello? Hello this

699
00:51:30,368 --> 00:51:33,086

Well I don't know.
- Wait! Be careful with that.

702
00:51:47,655 --> 00:51:50,019
No vacancies,
at all. I see.

703
00:51:51,516 --> 00:51:53,461
Not an office in
town, not even a loft.

704
00:51:54,223 --> 00:51:55,982
Oh, those boys
think of everything.

705
00:51:56,565 --> 00:52:00,627

710
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:20,470
What's a minor mr. mayor?
Can't you pay your bills?

711
00:52:22,282 --> 00:52:24,416
You shut your mouth.
- I'll shut yours before.

712
00:52:24,706 --> 00:52:26,641
No, no, Tom no, that's
what they want us to do.

713
00:52:26,955 --> 00:52:31,104
So let's not do it. - Why not use my
citting as temporary headquarters?

714
00:52:32,465 --> 00:52:34,996
Oh, well, that's not
awfully nice of you,

715
00:52:34,997 --> 00:52:36,688
mr. Grant, but I could't
accept. - Why not, Bill?

716
00:52:37,305 --> 00:52:39,432
You not gonna let them to

717
00:52:43,967 --> 00:52:47,148
Where's Bill Adams? - Oh mr.

718
00:52:47,356 --> 00:52:48,190

Will you send my compliments right
back to the mayor, and telling him...

723
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:02,506
You tell me a countess and I'm staying

724
00:53:02,541 --> 00:53:04,498

725
00:53:04,875 --> 00:53:07,119
Ah,I bet you get so far.
- You bet I'll get us so far.

If goddess wants know what I

727
00:53:09,879 --> 00:53:11,416
and I'll try explaining
it to him personally.

728
00:53:11,735 --> 00:53:16,369
Ha, ha, ha. - Ladies and
gentlman, please, please.

729
00:53:16,816 --> 00:53:19,247
Just give me a few minutes
until I get my new office set up.

730
00:53:19,282 --> 00:53:22,270
What, you... you mean clog

731
00:53:22,305 --> 00:53:23,723
Will end my shingle
on that lamppost.

732
00:53:26,295 --> 00:53:28,192
They'll be here two
hours. - I know that, sir.

733
00:53:28,227 --> 00:53:29,773
But this time
Connison gone too far.

734
00:53:29,774 --> 00:53:32,211
He's giving me more
publicity than I ever dreamed of.

735
00:53:32,246 --> 00:53:34,829
I may be here only an
hour but it'll be a good one.

736
00:53:34,443 --> 00:53:38,451
I'll get you in office. Now keep out
of trouble. I'll be back in a few minutes.

737
00:53:39,708 --> 00:53:42,627
Oh, that's about
right for the desk?

738
00:53:42,662 --> 00:53:45,028
Oh, no I think it's the
Caddy corner. - Okay lady.

739
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:49,301
Oh, let me take those.
- Watch this.

740
00:53:49,302 --> 00:53:50,834
Oh, yeah.
- Excuse me!

741
00:54:26,245 --> 00:54:27,866
Who did that?
- Tom Cooney.

742
00:54:28,509 --> 00:54:29,662
Come on, get him.

How is he, nurse?

Can we see him now? - I think
so. - You fellas wait. We wiil right on.

747
00:55:21,205 --> 00:55:22,772
That'll do mr. Grant.
- Oh, thank you.

748
00:55:23,118 --> 00:55:24,867
Well, where's mr. Adams?
- How you feel mr. Grant?

749
00:55:24,902 --> 00:55:27,307
Better take it easy for no.
- No, no, I'm all right.

750
00:55:27,596 --> 00:55:28,809
We're is miss Adams,
in my secretary?

751
00:55:28,959 --> 00:55:31,278
Well he's in jail, and
she's trying to get him out.

752
00:55:33,502 --> 00:55:35,968
Oh, Lucy. - Did the
doctor say if it did?

753
00:55:36,003 --> 00:55:40,392
Oh yes, I'm fine. Where's Bill?
- Still in jail. I've tried everything

754
00:55:41,337 --> 00:55:43,404
They're holding him
for a 15.000 $ bail.

755
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:46,269
In finding for riot.
- This is outrageous

756
00:55:46,574 --> 00:55:48,618
We'll have to find
judge Hockley. - We try to.

757
00:55:49,235 --> 00:55:50,599
And he couldn't
be found as usual.

758
00:55:51,047 --> 00:55:52,288
You can find him
at connaissance rally

759
00:55:52,323 --> 00:55:54,478
About an hour from now
out, there on the platform.

760
00:55:54,733 --> 00:55:57,497
Shoot hs big maut of.
- We'll find him before then.

761
00:55:57,811 --> 00:56:01,113
It's no use, mr. Grant.
It's all soda, it always do.

762
00:56:02,589 --> 00:56:04,506
Yes, but they took one stitch too
many this time they always do to.

763
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:05,977
Come on.

764
00:56:10,587 --> 00:56:14,336
Do you think you sai?
- I've got to get the boy out of jail.

765
00:56:15,554 --> 00:56:19,787
I'm glad you feel that way, sir. -  yes,
well let's not keep judge haki waiting.

766
00:56:32,318 --> 00:56:35,140
I want to talk to you that ugly. - sorry
I haven't any time to give you right now.

767
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:37,135
I'm afraid you'll
have to find time.

768
00:56:37,648 --> 00:56:41,405
Say you... - Judge Harkley,
acting on my rights as a citizen,

769
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,933
I demand that you swear
out warrants for the arrest

770
00:56:44,285 --> 00:56:46,957
of Ridges, Swade, Blaxton
and mayor Connison.

771
00:56:47,301 --> 00:56:48,753
You are crazy.
On what charges?

772
00:56:49,018 --> 00:56:52,402
Conspiracy abuse of
public
office inciting to riot.

773
00:56:52,437 --> 00:56:55,612
I suggest that you come
to the jail with us now

774
00:56:55,647 --> 00:56:58,037
and release mr. Adams
and sign those warrants.

775
00:56:59,059 --> 00:57:00,996
We'll need a couple of more
warrants too for some hoodlums,

776
00:57:00,997 --> 00:57:02,198
I have their names.
- You are crazy.

777
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:04,967
You can't push away into my
house in order to be around.

778
00:57:05,663 --> 00:57:08,144
Do you realize I can have you
arrested for disturbing the piece?

779
00:57:08,392 --> 00:57:11,085
All of you. - Aaaah.
- Let's just postpone that judge.

780
00:57:11,422 --> 00:57:14,253
Ladies and gentlemen, would
you excuse us for just a minute.

781
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:33,869
Ladies and gentlemen, I have persuaded
judge Hockley to change his mind.

782
00:57:34,479 --> 00:57:38,023
He has kindly consented to release your
candidate in time for the rally tonight.

783
00:57:40,784 --> 00:57:43,428
I didn't know how you got it.
- Oh, that's not their say. (?)

784
00:57:43,772 --> 00:57:45,748
What's the deal mr. Grant?
You know something about him?

785
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:48,960
No, on the contrary. He
knows something about me.

786
00:57:52,433 --> 00:57:55,505
<font color=#00FFFF><b>CONNISON FOR MAYOR
TRIED AND TRUE</b></font>

787
00:57:56,984 --> 00:58:00,568
Ladies and gentlemen
I mean my friend.

788
00:58:02,186 --> 00:58:05,699
For a long time I've been
hoping a man would come along,

789
00:58:06,596 --> 00:58:09,611
a young man because
like I always say

790
00:58:09,612 --> 00:58:14,476
the future of our great country
belongs to the young folks,

791
00:58:15,059 --> 00:58:18,780
who could take over and
give us old folks a chance

792
00:58:19,085 --> 00:58:21,255
to sit back and
take things easy.

793
00:58:22,318 --> 00:58:24,915
Well, this year
I said to myself,

794
00:58:25,462 --> 00:58:29,422
Jim, maybe this Bill Adams is the fella,

795
00:58:30,278 --> 00:58:33,022
but he dashed my hopes
and prayers to the ground.

796
00:58:33,903 --> 00:58:37,065
I saw that he's not the
man we've been waiting for.

797
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:40,424
That is nothing but an
agitator a troublemaker

798
00:58:40,856 --> 00:58:43,016
start up neighbors
against each other.

799
00:58:43,642 --> 00:58:45,154
He said he'd be here tonight.

800
00:58:46,050 --> 00:58:47,812
I wish he was.

801
00:58:48,343 --> 00:58:50,798
I hope that when
I got up to talk,

802
00:58:51,262 --> 00:58:53,443
he'd be here on
the platform with me

803
00:58:54,117 --> 00:58:59,287
to debate with me the
issues so close to our hearts.

804
00:59:10,189 --> 00:59:13,355
Well, Adams, if you think you're
gonna break up this rally you're crazy.

805
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:18,115
Did you let him out?
- Mr. mayor, I... uh... well,

806
00:59:18,176 --> 00:59:22,556
chief Perkins here he is...
he's got a warrant for your arrest.

807
00:59:23,084 --> 00:59:25,131
And for the arrest of
Blaxton, Ridges and Swade.

808
00:59:26,869 --> 00:59:28,965
Take your ands f me!
- Jim, I couldn't help it.

809
00:59:29,877 --> 00:59:32,863
Honestly you just
better come up along.

810
00:59:36,654 --> 00:59:38,829
Attention, please, everibdy.

811
00:59:39,661 --> 00:59:42,782
My friend. I never
thought he'd dare do this,

812
00:59:44,841 --> 00:59:45,305
but you can see for yourselves now

813
00:59:45,753 --> 00:59:47,887
to what lengths
this radical will go

814
00:59:48,455 --> 00:59:50,962
to sabotage a piecefull
miting of the people.

815
00:59:51,825 --> 00:59:53,731
But I am calling his bluff.

816
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:57,979
I'm going to make him bring
out witnesses to prove this.

817
00:59:58,683 --> 01:00:02,765
As mayor of this town I got
a right to call a special hearing,

818
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:09,095
and I do so the issues will be clear
when you go to the polls to vote tomorrow.

819
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:14,611
We'll be sorry you
were the Scot of this.

820
01:00:19,978 --> 01:00:21,739
Better remain with
us mr. Hartley.

821
01:00:21,889 --> 01:00:24,556
We wouldn't want you to
prejudice the mayor's testimony.

822
01:00:26,173 --> 01:00:27,251
Any place therefore.

823
01:00:28,371 --> 01:00:29,805
I find seets.

824
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:35,502
That Adams birch gets lucky
ain't got a thing on the mayor. - No?

825
01:00:35,887 --> 01:00:38,894
Find a seat and sit dawn.

826
01:00:43,864 --> 01:00:45,668
Mr. Grant, I still don't understand.

827
01:00:58,684 --> 01:01:01,398
Order. Order. This hearing
will condor

828
01:01:05,835 --> 01:01:10,494
Judge Harkley, my friend,
I'm not on trial here.

829
01:01:11,249 --> 01:01:14,135
Bill Adams has made
accusations against me

830
01:01:14,530 --> 01:01:16,700
he's had a warrant sworn
out for my arrest

831
01:01:16,789 --> 01:01:21,476
This is a hearing to show you that
he has no proof of anything he says.

832
01:01:22,141 --> 01:01:23,807
But he's trying
by a cheap trick,

833
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:27,510
to win election, he can't
win by fair play. - Judge Harkley.

834
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:33,314
Mr. mayor you'll have to moderate
your tone. This is very irregular.

835
01:01:33,728 --> 01:01:35,282
That was I'm very ugly.

836
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:51,623
Mr. Connison it's true that
you are not formally on trial here.

837
01:01:51,658 --> 01:01:55,701
You asked for this hearing, to demanded
by what right we had you arrested.

838
01:01:56,501 --> 01:01:59,055
we're here to tell
you and to accuse you,

839
01:01:59,462 --> 01:02:01,819
of conspiring against men
who honestly opposed you

840
01:02:02,419 --> 01:02:05,862
of inciting a riot with reckless
disregard for human safety

841
01:02:05,897 --> 01:02:08,490
of abusing the office to
which you have been elected

842
01:02:08,814 --> 01:02:09,941
by the people of this town,

843
01:02:10,573 --> 01:02:12,889
and these accusations we
are prepared to prove.

844
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:15,735
I hate to see the whole boy
get himself involved like this.

845
01:02:15,770 --> 01:02:18,465
Don't worry about
the old boy now darling.

846
01:02:20,041 --> 01:02:25,050
Mr. mayor, mr. Grant has
obtained two sessions from these men

847
01:02:26,217 --> 01:02:29,934
they have told mr. Grant
that acting on your orders

848
01:02:29,969 --> 01:02:31,607
they started the riot this morning

849
01:02:31,642 --> 01:02:34,448
in order to make
possible mr. Adams arrest.

850
01:02:34,759 --> 01:02:36,779
They have sworn to
these facts.

851
01:02:37,356 --> 01:02:42,860
Because of this mr. Grant was able
to demand a warrant for your arrest.

852
01:02:45,043 --> 01:02:48,217
Mr. Grant swore out a
warrant from my arrest?

853
01:02:49,417 --> 01:02:51,258
A man who doesn't
even live in our town.

854
01:02:52,003 --> 01:02:55,221
I mentally old fool who does nothing
but shoot ducks,  and start trouble.

855
01:02:55,708 --> 01:02:58,965
Jim don't say that.
- I'll say anything I please.

856
01:02:59,798 --> 01:03:01,462
I demand to know who
who is this man is.

857
01:03:01,975 --> 01:03:05,900
Who is this Jo Grant?
- Jim, do yourself a favor.

858
01:03:06,414 --> 01:03:08,878
Don't ask that.
- It's all right, judge Hockley.

859
01:03:09,727 --> 01:03:14,120
Mr. Connison, it's not Joe
Grant, it's John josephus Grant.

860
01:03:14,737 --> 01:03:20,299
Where are you from Grant? - Washington
D.C. - Jim, please no more questions.

861
01:03:20,334 --> 01:03:23,977
Mr. Grant... - Shut up. I'll
ask all the questions I please.

862
01:03:25,137 --> 01:03:30,762
By what right, and what do you do
mr. Grant? - Mr. Connison and I am a judge.

863
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:35,041
An Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court of the United States.

864
01:03:41,619 --> 01:03:47,548
Mr. Connison, you have asked by what
right I have interfered in this situation.

865
01:03:48,254 --> 01:03:49,791
You still want an answer?

866
01:03:51,471 --> 01:03:57,044
JusticeGrant, would you
cared of it... - No, no, no. thank you.

867
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:03,349
Bill. Bill. - Just throw some water
on him, Lucia, he will be all right.

868
01:04:10,187 --> 01:04:13,999
Your honor, mayor Collison,

869
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:18,048
it's only right that you
should know why I, a stranger

870
01:04:19,130 --> 01:04:19,575
become involved
in your affairs.

871
01:04:20,311 --> 01:04:24,224
Believe me it's not because I
am a Justice of the Supreme Court.

872
01:04:25,449 --> 01:04:28,049
It's because like
all of you here

873
01:04:28,612 --> 01:04:30,275
I am a citizen of this country...

874
01:04:31,587 --> 01:04:34,540
that is no little honor...

875
01:04:34,872 --> 01:04:39,548
men of 40 revolutions
have died to we call citizens...

876
01:04:40,508 --> 01:04:44,031
and as citizens, we carry
a burning responsibility

877
01:04:45,329 --> 01:04:48,590
it means that when we
elect men to public office we...

878
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:51,633
we cannot do it as
lightly as we flip a coin.

879
01:04:52,842 --> 01:04:55,646
It means that after we've elected
them we can't sit back and say...

880
01:04:56,224 --> 01:04:59,495
our job is done what they
do now doesn't concern us.

881
01:05:00,968 --> 01:05:03,105
That philosophy of indifference

882
01:05:03,148 --> 01:05:05,969
is what the enemies of
decent government want.

883
01:05:06,673 --> 01:05:10,147
If we allow them to have their
way to grow strong and vicious

884
01:05:11,189 --> 01:05:13,033
then the heroic struggle which

885
01:05:13,474 --> 01:05:17,890
welded thousands of lovely towns like
this into a great nation means nothing,

886
01:05:18,982 --> 01:05:22,157
then we're not
citizens, we're traitors.

887
01:05:24,292 --> 01:05:26,932
The great liberties
by which we live

888
01:05:26,986 --> 01:05:30,999
have been bought with
blood the kind of government

889
01:05:31,034 --> 01:05:34,159
we get is the kind
of government we want

890
01:05:34,936 --> 01:05:37,492
government of the people by
the people and for the people,

891
01:05:37,690 --> 01:05:39,100
can mean any
kind of government

892
01:05:39,276 --> 01:05:42,047
it's our duty to
make it mean only one kind

893
01:05:42,082 --> 01:05:46,905
uncorrupted, free United.

894
01:05:47,903 --> 01:05:50,696
I believe mayor Connson
that I've answered your question.

895
01:06:02,169 --> 01:06:06,909
Now as soon as court adjourns I'll
meet you back here in my chambers.

896
01:06:07,268 --> 01:06:09,125
What's the matter mr.
justice? You seem nervous.

897
01:06:09,671 --> 01:06:13,308
Oh, no, no, no, not at all.
How about you, mayor Adams.

898
01:06:13,564 --> 01:06:14,624
Have you the ring?

899
01:06:18,056 --> 01:06:23,357
The United line sir? - Well, I
autorized the past and I learning. (?)

900
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:36,398
Hello there Grant. I'm
glad to see you. - Thank you.

901
01:06:36,619 --> 01:06:40,538
You're looking fine as you have
residing. - Oh best I ever had. (?)
