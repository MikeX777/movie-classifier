When asked
I began dance
I reply In mothers womb
result oysters
champagne
Aphrodites food
Thank you

How nice come
Lets go
My folks into
mystic Puritan
prepared heroism
definitely removed
from sensual expression
When I started dance
child
I moved
interior urge
the joy ran
nerves
was strong
that simple idea
physical contact
even imaginary
shiver ecstasy
And I swooned
awaiting sting
sweet
and painful pleasure
I wanted scream
As fibers body
were waiting for
apex love
which lasts instant
As nerves
vibrated intensely
that I longer knew
I enjoying endless joy
or pain reprieve
I felt sensations
so languid terrible
pleasure kill me
And I swooned
My soul battlefield
Apollo Dionysus
Christ Nietzsche
Richard Wagner
fought possession
Its Dorotéia
She lives us

How old she
Eighteen

Cadillac
Blaise Cendrars
todays greatest poets
asks
The woman
But irony
Havent modern poets picked

 Three days ago
During Herr Ecksteins embraces

 Freud
This revolting perception
repressed
and substituted memory
by innocent sensation
pressure breasts
Dora evoked
tender scene infancy
where sucked
nurses breast
while pulling rhythmically
at little brothers penis
Clearly primary erogenous object
nipple
was substituted by
the sexual organ hand
Herr Ecksteins penis
We observe
perverse fantasy
of penis sucking
has innocent origin
as remote memory
mothers nurses breast
In cases
teats certain cows
play intermediate role
breast
penis
