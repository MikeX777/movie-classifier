Thank you
Thank much Im excited
tonight
My Richard Gage AIA Ive
practicing architect 20 years
Im member American
Institute Architects
I interested World Trade
Center high rise collapses 911
hearing startling conclusions
reluctant 911 researcher
David Ray Griffin San Francisco
Bay Areas KPFA radio Guns Butter
Bonny Faulkner March 2006
This changed life radically
launched personal professional
quest 911 truth inspiring
Architects Engineers
911 Truth
numbers hundreds architects
engineers demanding
real investigation
destruction buildings
Im employed San Francisco
Bay Area architecture firm
way affiliation
work 911
Like architects I
designed numerous proofed
steel frame buildings career including
3 10 million dollar gymnasiums
day day construction
administration services
120 million high school
San Ramon California
Im working 400 million dollar
project Nevada 2 million
square feet retail parking structure
proofed steel framed mid rise
office space 1200 tons
steel framing together
Id like start thanking
willing consider
difficult subject
destruction World Trade Center
staggering loss life 911
Just architecture engineering
projects joyful
difficult particular
project proven
extremely difficult
Not difficult terms reaching
conclusions difficult terms
implications conclusions
finding people open minded
willing hear facts
building collapses check fact
point out
Because its extremely important
know truth event
After all served pretext
invasion 2 countries
million people perished
Also pretext loss
cherished liberties home
United States
recent legislation
Patriot Act Military
Commissions Act forthcoming
Senate Bill 1959 Violent Radicalization
Home Grown Terrorism Act
named
terrorist right
attorney trial jury
Another 911 happen
dont dedicate finding
exactly happened why
bringing actually responsible
justice
What I mean happen again
Well basically were promised 911
members Congress media
Bush administration
official statements this
The attack
September 11th pale comparison
a nuclear weapon middle
cities
a nuclear terrorist attack
US imminent
weapon mass destruction
 summer early fall
itll bigger 911
Michael Chertoff a gut feeling
attacks imminent
summer evidence
facts suggesting that
These reasons
peer painful
recent history reexamine
relatively new physical evidence 911
seen main stream
media instance
2006 poll New York Times CBS
reveals 28 Americans believe
Bush administration lying
Iraq
events 911
And Time Magazine reporting 36
Americans consider likely
somewhat likely government officials
allowed attacks carried
carried themselves
And recent poll Zogby
2007 finding 51 Americans
want Congress probe president
vice president 911
Of greater concern poll
year Scripps Howard Ohio University
shocking 16
Americans believe
World Trade Center Twin Towers
brought explosives
NIST National Institute Standards
Technology claims evidence
explosive demolition
Twin Towers
Later admit theyve
looked it
How
youre looking for
Well architects engineers scientists
looked
hard find Weve
speaking 2 years now
3 dozen cities
dozen states Canada
Were proud
international 911 Truth Movement
growing millions
year
We hundreds architects
engineers 911 Truth
demanding real investigation
This website
You right bullet
points information were going
going today
its AE911Truthorg
On left youll Power Point
step pace

read text absorb
information were rapidly
going going through
You watch DVD left
purchase DVD online
You sign petition
convinced evidence
worth looking at
Lets clear start
The growing number architects
engineers 911 Truth

conspiracy theorists
Were building technical professionals
looking science based
forensic evidence destruction
high rises 911
As Joel Hirschhorn PhD says
First let technical truths emerge
Then necessary cope inevitable
conspiracy questions
Tonight were presenting
technical truths evidence
explosive demolition 3 World
Trade Center high rise collapses 911
iconic Twin Towers
mysterious Building 7
911 Just utterance brings
right terror filled morning
We subjected
shocking attacks
killing thousands Americans
destroying cultural icons
These 6 years given time
step examine events
objectively
To step shock
induced trance really evaluate
relatively new evidence
come couple years
reexamine 3 high rise
collapses objectively
Lets begin overview events
morning order start
page looking
jets impacts
myth developed
On September 11th learned
4 passenger planes hijacked
taken radically course
Within hour 2 planes thrown
enormous steel towers
World Trade Center creating fires
eventually toppling them
Dazed news American public
soon believed fires towers
burned hot caused
steel frames buildings way
A myth developed fed official sources
trough media bewildered audience
Elements myth impact
airplanes gallons burning jet fuel
steel melting buildings failing
suddenly imploding
In mere 10 seconds 110 stories hurdled
earthwards pulverizing dust
Right start street
official story born

exploding side
I witnessed towers collapse
second
structural failure
intense
We need look kinds people
kinds events
ones interviewed main
stream media planting official story
minds people
The myth bled FEMA report
echoed experts
It combination impact load
great damage building
followed fire
caused collapse
Well lets look that
What apply scientific
method learned
7th 8th grade
Its best way discovered
winnowing truth lies delusion
The simple version looks
like this
We formulate question
Twin Towers collapse
We perform research
observations
We construct hypothesis
idea collapsed
It collapsed fire It collapsed
explosive controlled demolition
We predictions test
predictions assumptions
experiments objective verifiable
repeatable experiments
We analyze results
draw conclusions
And conclusions
corroborated evidence report
open transparent manner
experiments findings
repeated
If corroborated
think try construct
new hypothesis new
observations new research
Buildings destroyed number
different forces
different
identifiable characteristics
For instance fires affect buildings
differently controlled demolition
Fires nature tend creep
place place run fuel
moving fresh new fuel sources
leaving burned area cool
So collapses occur way
youll note theyve occurred
examples hot
large long lasting fires
Buildings tend fall over
fall asymmetrically
theyre burned
organically will
Its natural process
They dont fall straight
path greatest resistance
Lets listen Jonathan Barnett
FEMA talk fires
expected steel buildings
The way steel framed
buildings behave fires
depends construction
In test British Steel 1995
large typical office furniture
burned happen
heavy steel beams
supported ceiling
When steel bare heats
gets weaker Its melts fire
In fact normal fires arent
hot melt steel
Even example
use unusual fuel like kerosene
achieve temperatures
hot melt steel
But happens
starts lose strength
And its loses strength
starts sag
softer sags
longer support load
This largest test
kind conducted
It showed unprotected steel
distorted normal office fire
But typical steel buildings
structural beams slowly
progressively warped sagged
There chance sudden collapse
In 20 years I seen
recently protected steel structure
collapsed fire
So cause
devastating explosive failure
happened World Trade Center
These particular buildings collapsed
They follow path resistance
Or fell over
You building
structure holds building
recognizable form
The structural elements
dismembered
concrete
pulverized dust
They follow path
resistance generally over
These buildings exploded
Witnesses hear sounds explosions
flashes light
Theres thick billowing enormous
pyroclastic clouds pulverized concrete
The expansion gasses quickly
produces cauliflowerlike formation
smoke
This controlled demolition Lets
focus type destruction first
We hundreds examples
country
comparison its
commonly method demolish
high rises
This high rise looks like
its demolished explosives
Controlled demolitions
engineered different ways
Normally purpose controlled
demolition remove structure
avoiding damage adjacent
structures economically
Typically tall building like
demolished placing thousands
cutter charges columns
beams building
detonating precise order
starting interior structures
progressing outward
synchronistically timed floor floor
Destroying interior columns
allows unsupported weight
pull exterior inward
Destroying building ground
allows weight building
harnessed
destruction
So result implosion producing
vertical symmetrical collapse
free fall speed consolidated
rubble pile thats broken
ready loading shipment
Now feat handful
companies United States
accomplish
Lets look key
characteristics controlled demolition
First sudden onset
destruction base structure
We straight down symmetrical
collapse footprint
demolition waves
remove column support
resulting free fall speed
virtually path
greatest resistance
thousands tons structural steel
We total dismemberment
steel structure its loaded
ready shipment
We minimal damage adjacent
structures sounds flashes
explosions heard seen witnesses
enormous clouds pulverized concrete
Squibs sometimes explosive charges
wrong time
Chemical evidence cutter charges
These fairly typical
direct evidence
explosive destruction
Now interesting thing
typical characteristics
controlled demolition
explained accounted fire
let them
Typically government
documentation expert corroboration
foreknowledge video documentation
supports
hypothesis controlled demolition
Providing proof reasonable doubt
Lets look World
Trade Center 7 now
It 47 stories tall wouldve
tallest building 33 states
Half height Twin Towers
dwarfed proximity was
couple years
tallest buildings world
It hit airplane
It 3rd World Trade Center
high rise collapse 911
520 afternoon
World Trade Center 7 hit
debris North Tower
pelted here
sustained 8 fires
according NIST floors
This World Trade Center 7
47 stories high dont confused
shadow building
Here 13th 14th floor fires
7th floor North
building opposite
building pelted North Tower
Curiously enough Securities
Exchange Commission operating
floor lost thousands
files related hundreds cases
actively pursuing Wall Street
companies like Enron Worldcom
So looking investigation
goes buildings course
Now lets look evidence
World Trade Center 7
stacks typical
features controlled demolition
starting
sudden offset destruction
Lets listen emergency worker
We watching building WTC7
actually cuz
The floors
building
heard sound
sounded like clap thunder
turned around shocked
building ah
well looked like shockwave
ripping building
windows busted
About second later floor caved
building followed
saw building crash
way ground
shock
A sound clap thunder
A shock wave ripping building
And windows busting out
And building coming down
Do straight down symmetrical
collapse buildings footprint
Lets listen Dan Rather narrate
collapse look
collapse Building 7
What youre seeing high shots
Now going
video tape collapse itself
Now video tape
collapse building
Its amazing
Amazing incredible pick word
For time today
Its reminiscent pictures weve
seen television
building deliberately destroyed
placed dynamite knock down
What Dan Deliberately destroyed
placed dynamite knock down
Dan repeated
words day
In fact didnt building
coming 911
Lets look West Street
Maybe havent
understood whats going on
Well Im convinced yet lets
look comparison
known controlled demolition
right
Did building fall
footprint
Petty so little bit
overlapping street
I couldve better job myself
A tidy rubble pile nevertheless
Do demolition waves
remove column support
Well heres floor plan Building 7
Now bring building smoothly
symmetrically footprint
falling over
remove core columns
want bring
outside building itself
This involves high degree
precision capable of
organic process
Were told NIST December 18th
update meeting attended telecon
theres virtually influence
collapse debris
North Tower damage
caused it diesel

spilling diesel line
Why Well East penthouse
building collapse
seconds
global collapse
And NIST targeting column nr 79
And thats
collapse initiated
Do free fall speed collapse
path greatest resistance
Lets listen David Chandler
We measure downward acceleration
Building 7 video frame analysis
I magnifying glass place markers
corner building frame
From
data table graphs
The slope graph indicates
acceleration shown
minus 10279 plus minus 06
Free fall vacuum
minus 98 units
That falls margin
error measurement
In words rate fall
Building 7 seconds
indistinguishable
free fall vacuum
What talking about
You see second second building
gaining downward momentum
You plot drop distance graph
time fits free fall curve
perfectly
What mean
That columns
removed removed
vitually simultaneously floor
synchronistically timed
building resistance
virtually way down
Do total dismemberment
structure
We 47 storey skyscraper compressed
4 stories How happen
This building moment
resisting frames floors
Thats beams welded
rigidly columns
Do sounds explosions
Heres Craig Bartmer
New York Police Department
And time youre hearing
thoom thoom thoom thoom
So eh I think I know
explosion I hear it
I real close Building 7
fell down
That didnt sound like
building falling
I running away it
Theres lot eye witness testimony
hearing explosions
I didnt reason
building fall way did
And lot guys
saying thing
How Kevin McPadden
Air Force Special Operations
Search Rescue
He came hand
radio sounded like countdown
And seconds took
hand heard 3
2
1

saying
just run life
like 2 3
seconds heard explosions
like BABOOOOMMMM
like distinct sound
Its like compression
like booom booom booom
like floors
dropping collapsing
This like BABOOOOM
like felt rumble ground
like like wanted
grab something
That me I know explosion
There doubt mind
OK thank you Kevin
Do enormous clouds pyroclastic
smoke pulverized concrete
Watch concrete entrained air
racing street direction
35 miles hour incredible volume
pyroclastic dust folding itself
It takes incredible quantities heat
create kind action
A lot heat 8
fires floors
Do pools molten iron
Lets start South Tower now
This section applies World Trade
Center Twin Towers Building 7
Were told NIST substance
melted aluminum airplane
But melted aluminum looks
like melted aluminum its silvery
It doesnt glow day like conditions
As 21 days attack
fires burning
molten steel running says
World Trade Center structural engineer
Leslie Robertson conference
structural engineers October 5th 2001
month 911
Fires burned molten metal
flowed pile ruins
settling beneath feet
says Sarah Atlas
What responders demolition
contractors molten metal
Saw pools literally molten steel
Molten metal beams
totally melted
It dripping molten steel
Steel flowed molten streams
Theyre finding molten steel
Seeing molten steel
Uncovering red hot metal beams
Molten metal red hot
weeks event
Molten steel heart
towers remains
Molten steel beams
The streams molten metal
leaked hot cores
flowed broken walls
Molten metal dripping beam
The end beam
dripping molten steel
And structural engineer
Abolhassan AstanehAsi Berkeley
cites documents
I saw melting girders
World Trade Center
Still hot molten metal dripped
sides wall
Building 6
Debris past columns
red hot molten running
A truck 10 feet ground
burning 2 weeks
Tower collapsed metal
hot looked like
vat molten steel
Pieces steel cherry red
One unusual artifacts emerge
rubble rocklike object
come known
Meteorite
This fused element steel molten steel
concrete things
fused heat
And architects engineers
people work steel welders
seen level
destruction level deformation
material lives
These cooled meteorites
aluminum aluminum doesnt rust
Its melted airplane
What gentleman charge
clean World Trade Center Ground Zero
molten metal
Mark Loizeaux president
Controlled Demolition inc
told American Free Press
basements World Trade Center
47 central support columns
connected bedrock hot spots
literally molten steel discovered
month September 11th
These incredibly hot areas
bottoms elevator shafts
7 basement levels
The molten steel 3
4 5 weeks later
rubble removed
He said molten steel
WTC7
The highest temperature
East corner South Tower
temperature 1377
degrees Fahrenheit recorded
The molten steel basement
double temperature
What talking here
Here Building 7 A B
North Tower
South Tower
These hot spots
1340 1370 degrees
These temperatures
hottest office fires
There surface
Ground Zero collapses
What measuring here
Were measuring molten metal
seen responders
4 5 6 stories
basements surely
twice 3 times temperatures
Whats problem that
Office fires Eager says 1200 degrees
NIST claims 1800 degrees
evidence office fires
temperature
Trade Center Towers
But salmon lemon
colored its 1518 degrees
And structural steel doesnt begin
melt 2700 degrees
Were missing 1000 2000 degrees
temperature heat energy required
produce stuff
Where coming from Well
taking look possible suspect
thermite reaches
temperatures 4500 degrees
Molten metal flowing substance
held jaws backhoe
Now lets listen John Gross
lead engineer NIST
tell molten
metal perspective
Im curious pool molten steel
Towers
I too tell it
seen it
Well personally eye witnesses
huge pools molten steel
beneath Towers scientists
dont think collapse
building
melted steel
A physics professor analyzed
steel Steven Jones
evidence thermate residue
explain buildings
collapsed means
pre planted explosives
So analyzed
steel residues
Eh lets basic
premise pool
molten steel
I know absolutely nobody
eye witnesses said so
whos produced it
Youd youd
molten steel molten steel
running channel rails
like youre foundry
Like lave volcano
Out rubble I believe
its 11oo degrees
The guys boots melt
hours
This its day one
Its unbelievable
6 weeks later
closer center
gets hotter hotter
Its probably 1500 degrees
Weve small windows
thought core point
looks like oven
roaring inside
Just bright bright reddish orange color
Underground hot molten
metal dripped sides wall
Building 6
I know absolutely nobody eye witnesses
said so whos produced it
What problem here
We plenty eye
witnesses produced it
Somebody lying Im going leave
conclusions
The extinguished
3 months 911 Tom Manley says
You couldnt begin imagine
water pumped there
It like
creating giant lake
Well thermite contains source
oxygen burns water
How chemical evidence though
What produced molten metal
And thermite anyway
Thermite An incendiary
military thermite
compound iron dioxide
aluminum which ignited
sustains extreme heat reaction
creating molten iron
In 2 seconds thermite reach
temperatures 4500 degrees Fahrenheit
liquefy steel
We know open air fires
burn hot melt steel
metal melted
base towers
Appendix C FEMA report
describes sulphur residues
World Trade Center steel
The New York Times called
deepest mystery all
Sulphur slightly lowers melting point
iron iron oxide iron sulphite
formed surface
structural steel
Sulphur thermite called
thermate producing faster results
NFPA 921 guide
explosion investigations Was used
They say Unusual residues
arise thermite magnesium
pyrotechnic materials
At crime scene
example of NIST guide No
They acknowledged didnt
look evidence But did
Dr Steven Jones performed chemical
analysis previously molten metal
He background research
again scientific method
Thermite create characteristic
burn pattern white ash
white yellow hot liquid metal
intense white reaction zone seen
It leave
chemical evidence
Common elements iron
aluminum copper calcium silicon
Unusual elements fluorine
manganese left residue
These elements here
Hes sent sample 40 pound
chunk previously molten metal
meteorites
He finds its predominantly iron
rule aluminum jet plane
It small amounts
aluminum sulphur potassium
And manganese
fluorine abundance
The manganese potassium
permanganate commonly
oxidizer thermite
Fluorine solgel
type thermite charges
So appear
thermite fingerprint
Lets look dr Jones
slag memorial
Clarkston University
He performs xray fluorescence
small piece slag finds
again iron sulphur
potassium manganese calcium
Gel explosives super thermite
tiny aluminum particles iron oxide
solgel
cast shape like clay
Lawrence Livermore Labs research
invention offers
a thermite based apparatus
cutting target materials
You pack thermite ignite
comes its forced through

Almost effective high
energy explosives RDX C4
common
classic controlled demolitions
If solgels
leave unique signature
13diphenylpropane
And fact EPA finds molecule
toxilogical studies
levels dwarfed others
13diphenylpropane
Erik Swartz says weve observed
sampling weve done
But evidence
thermite WTC dust
Dr Jones received
4 separate samples WTC dust
apartment
street Janet McKinleys apartment
windows blew filled
apartment foot dust
Another sample like 10
minutes later Brooklyn Bridge
Well takes magnet
finds small particles
come magnet Some
angular round
They look like this
In fact calculates weight
spheres finds
dust
10 tons dust
available
Theyre 16th inch diameter
largest ones
smaller human hair What
produce incredible array
microspheres
Well thousands cutter
charges going columns beams
building theyre
incredible pressure

like this
Tens thousands
millions tiny droplets
Whats shape droplets
When liquid dispersed like
surface tension forms
perfect sphere
In case molten iron
droplets cool fall
dust everywhere
He compares spheres
known thermite experiment
performed John Parulis Nevada
finds spheres
In fact XEDS
microspheres
kinds evidence
We iron manganese and
case known thermite signature
matches basically
In words controlled
experiment compare results against
And know read
graphs dr Jones others
pretty exact
match indicating
signature thermite
Dr Jones
finds iron rich microspheres
The EPA finds dust
toxilogical studies theyre doing
They idea
came from
dont report results
tiny bit theyre curious
They sweep rug It
possible formation
liquid molten iron
extreme pressure
RJ Lee finds iron rich microspheres
Deutsche Bank building
toxilogical studies
Is corroded tops
cars atomized thermite cooling
Manganese
large proportions toxic stuff
citys Chief Medical Examiner
concerned it
Dr Jones concludes given mix
trace metals present
high concentrations dust
zinc copper manganese
formation
iron rich aluminum spheres
its clear significant aluminothermic
reactions occur
reverse engineer suggests

thermite mix powders
aluminum iron oxide copper oxide
zinc nitrate
potassium permanganate
Well possibly
unignited thermite pieces WTC dust
Indeed finds it
It comes magnet
dust samples
Many chips
This 16th inch long
red side grey other
The red composed tiny
iron oxide particles aluminum
In fact XEDS
stuff too
And finds little bit sulphur
aluminum lots iron manganese
Compare traditional thermite
its match unignited thermite
This stuff
cave Afghanistan
The Lawrence Livermore Lab came
papers year 2 ago stuff
The particles small allow
instantaneous ignition
2 chemicals aluminum iron
oxide producing explosive results
Los Alamos Lab Lawrence Livermore
Lab produced results
Then continues study finds
additional chips partially ignited
spheres embedded them
indicating source spheres is
intents purposes
identified clearly here
Partially reacted thermite
These results documented
peer reviewed journal
Open Civil Engineering
Journal volume 2
14 Points agreement calls it
with official government reports
World Trade Center destruction
turns common
NIST report FEMA
report work doing
And course theres lot disagreement
well But dr Jones optimist
So were going look
points agreement
He documented

We need lot this
Now direct evidence
explosive destruction Building 7
Were going jump
Building 7 now
None characteristics
explained fire let them
Why Well buildings
protected fire
High rise steel frame buildings particular
2 3 hour protection
designed allow
occupants escape fire
But after fires
longer 2 hours larger
buildings collapsed
Why Lets look
Heres New York 1970
Burned 6 hours 5 floors
Los Angeles 35 hours
5 floors
Philadelphia 18 hours 8 floors
Caracas Venezuela burned
17 hours 26 floors
Not fires brought
high rises down
In fact high rise steel framed building
brought fire
Yet relatively small randomly placed fires
lot smoke brought
skyscraper Building 7
65 seconds
burning afternoon
How FEMA report
investigations
Well 4 investigations
starting 2001 ASCE
American Society Civil Engineers
Were told volunteers
average PTA volunteers
These guys earn 10 million dollars annually
average working
Defense Department expertise
mainly blast resistance buildings
Then FEMA report 2002
finally got funding
600000 dollars
Compare 40 million dollar
effort source stains
Monica Lewinskys dress
This easily 3rd worst
structural failure modern history
It deserves far greater
response resources
In 2002 SilversteinWeidlinger
report responsible reversing
theory FEMA came
basically pancake theory
zipper theory truss
pulled away columns
caused pull away
chain reaction went
floors
pancaked way down
Well talk that
SilversteinWeidlinger report
responsible changing theory
true wouldve
bolts broke
Larry Silverstein overall owner
complex paid
56 billion dollars hes
paid insurance settlement
Why Because wouldve
buildings fault
instead terrorists fault
So theory
And new theory states
trusses sagged pulled columns
blame persistence
connection columns buckled

thing came down
Either way its were
going looking critically
moment
Then NIST investigation
took investigations 2005
came 3 year
20 million dollar effort
Well close look
NISTs work
These experts worked
buildings worked FEMA report
them Weidlinger
report NIST report
These independent investigations
means whatsoever
Lets listen FEMA
conclude its interesting
Evidence severe high temperature
corrosion attack steel including rapid
oxidation sulfidation
subsequent intergranular melting
Very interesting
Remember office fires dont melt steel
What melted steel
Sulphur formed hot
corrosion attack steel
Here intergranular
melting documented us
Thank you
Capable turning solid steel girder
Swiss cheese like column
wide flange column
structural steel Building 7
Now document carefully
appendix C Listen this
Gaping holes larger
silver dollar let light shine through
A inch column reduced
half inch thickness edges curled
like paper scroll having
thinned razor sharpness
This flange curled itself
This web wide flange column
NIST swept entire appendix C
rug
official report today
Listen though
The collapse WTC7 small debris
field façade pulled downward
suggesting internal
failure implosion
The specifics fires WTC 7
caused building collapse remain
unknown time

What Unknown

best hypothesis fire  random
damagethen complete collapse
low
probability occurrence

Wait minute
You spent 600000
dollars tax payer money
year investigating
best hypothesis isnt right
What hypothesis
corroborated facts
You construct new
hypothesis In FEMAs case punt
And thats did
They further research
investigation analysis needed
resolve issue
But unfortunately hoping
resolve issue evidence
destroyed
About 99 fact
By FEMA
Before report came
May 2002
Lets listen real investigation
shouldve performed
Normally structural failure
carefully debris field
looking item photographing
beam collapsed column
ground
pick carefully
look element
We unable
case Tower 7
Why Because steel
removed report came out
In fact 800 truck loads day
Easily 3 worst structural
failures modern history
250 Pieces saved
Crucial evidence answer
questions slow boat China
exclaims Bill Manning editor chief
125 year old Fire Engineering Magazine
brings protection
engineers communicate other
Showing astounding ignorance
government officials value
thorough scientific investigation
The removal destruction
evidence stop immediately
Commission fully resourced
blue ribbon panel conduct
clean thorough investigation
calling for
If evidence contradicts
hypothesis destroy it
Thats tax dollars going
How 911 Commission
tasked giving
fullest explanation
No Not sentence 571 pages
911 Commission report
mentions destruction WTC 7
Is reasons
senator Max Cleland
resigns Commission citing
Its national scandal
The investigation compromised
How expert corroboration
How Danny Jowenko
27 year controlled demolition expert
It starts below theyve
simply blown away columns
Its controlled demolition
A team experts this
Its professional work
doubt
How Hugo Bachman professor
emeritus chairman Department
Structural Dynamics
Earthquake Engineering Swiss
Federal Institute Technology
In opinion building WTC7
was great probability
professionally demolished
How Kamal Obeid Architects
Engineers 911 Truth
structural engineer
A localized failure steel framed
building like WTC7 cause
catastrophic collapse like house
cards simultaneous
patterned loss
column sat key locations
building
Does sound like fire
No
How protection
engineer again Jonathan Barnett
We surprised
tower 7 collapsed
We team investigated
occurred day
Building 7 Do
foreknowledge destruction
Were moving command post
way building coming down
says Chief Nick Visconti
Well
structural damage weve noted
concerned it
By noon o clock told
triage site
Pace University little
away Building 7 going
come down brought down
says Indira Singh interviewed
Bonnie Faulkner KPFA
Did actually use
words brought down
Yeah thats said were
going bring down
This involves volition Listen
construction workers walking away
Building 7
police officer caught CNN
Keep eye
building its coming down
The building blow up
Move back
We walking building
blow up Flames debris coming down
Keep eye building
its come down
The building blow up
Flame debris coming down
How know And
Kevin McPadden say
And seconds took
hand heard 3 2 1
Countdown Does
imply foreknowledge
Do fires bring buildings
countdown
Unlikely
In fact BBC announces collapse
20 minutes happened
Its true Jane Standley
announcing it She says
The 47 storey Salomon Brothers Building
close WTC collapsed
standing her
The BBC apologizes grievous error
citing confusing events day
But psychic
Unlikely
Is kind script thats
handed like guy street
Twin Towers answers
I believe weve shown Building 7
matches features
controlled demolition classic sense
Is likely Al Qaeda
access building

secure outside Pentagon
We ask question
times because didnt
did
This far go
You need farther
And resources
disposal that
I point
look WTC Twin Towers
Because clear evidence
destruction Building 7 explosives
evidence clear
case Twin Towers
When look new pair
glasses look forensic
science based evidence
Lets introduced here
Some crowning achievement
International Style
pair buildings
Others  heartless modernism
In fact architect Robert Stern calls
gigantic dumbness
Its 2 squares extruded
point
highest buildings world
Well way matter feel
buildings
innovative structural engineering led
John Skilling aide Leslie Robertson
helped Minoru Yamasaki preserve
simple sculptural purity forms
And compare building
elegant Art Deco
Empire State Building come
conclusion design
But eclipse highest building
world 1976 couple years
Sears Tower outgrew it
The structural engineering innovations
extraordinary lending award

American Society Civil Engineers
Lets look achieved
We 60 foot spans
We perimeter structure thats like
tube structure inner core
Lets look it
Most high rises time built
dense grid steel concrete frames
way building
20 30 foot grid
The Twin Towers built
tube structure dense
strong mash steel surrounding
exterior acting baring wall
resists lateral loads earthquake
and case particularly wind
hurricanes 140 miles
hour designed resist
This perimeter structure 14 inch
columns 3 foot 9 inches center
Inside core dense
grid 47 immense box columns
4 inch base
2 inch mid height
Prefabricated floor assemblings 22 gauge
steel decking poured
reinforced concrete held
29 inch deep open web steel trusses
All this way completely
pulverized floor structure 911
Well look that
Now trusses bolted
perimeter columns core columns
58th inch bolts
talked different theories
happened bolts
Now structure structure
This dense core structure
remained standing 1300 feet
air surrounding
strong floor structure
collapsed it
In fact perimeter structure
left standing
lack support gave in
This core columns 52 inches
22 inches long edge
solid steel bottom
continuously welded
way top
Now 1800 degree
immediately conducted
100000 ton heat sink
Thats reason theres
collapse steel frame high rise fires
Because its steel
Hold spoon stove
long hold it
Almost instantly youll
forced let go
Lets look structural imperative
given John Skilling
John Skilling Les Robertson
structural engineers designed
streamlined steel frames
Twin Towers 1960
Because wayward army bomber flew
Empire State Building 1945
Towers built
skyscraper crashes mind
We designed project
impact largest airplane time
Boeing 707
That is jet airplane
run building
destroy lot structure
stand up
The building designed
fully loaded 707 crash it
largest plane time
I believe building probably
sustain multiple impacts jetliners
structure like mosquito netting
screen door intense grid
jet plane pencil
puncturing screen netting
It screen netting
A robust structure fact
The forces coming routed
around arched opening
created airplane
In fact Eager says The towers
withstood initial impact aircraft
ability withstand initial impact
hardly surprising given robust nature
We North Tower hit 846
morning 102 minutes later
fires travelled floors
floors case North Tower
building collapse
The South Tower hit 15 minutes
later 56 minutes
collapses fires
fact diminishing severely
Skilling noted designed towers
hit Boeing 707 traveling
600 miles hour
When asked
considered plane crashes cites
Our analysis indicated
biggest problem fact
fuel
dump building
But building structure
there
This FEMAs theory
We sagging trusses
pulling away column
subsequent pancaking down
Again trusses other 6 foot
8 inches truss disengaging
perimeter wall be
rate buildings fell
speed
sound disengagement truss
next way
building floor
floor floor
So NIST turns blames
persistence connections
pulling columns
causing columns buckle
Its generally difficult people
understand Towers
controlled demolition
outside frame reference
wed seen like this
So this combined shock
kept objective
But plan induced
collapse result airplanes
youd start explosions
point jet plane impact
So WTC 2 1
key characteristic features
controlled demolition
key differences
We beginning detonation
point jet plane impact
base building
In addition implosion
exploded
outside footprint
We squibs mistimed
explosions occur 20 40
60 stories below
And weve discussed
evidence thermite molten metal
dust
iron rich microspheres
So lets look starting
sudden onset
What evidence
produced
Its produced sounds
flashes explosions
Now citys Fire Commissioner Thomas
von Essen requires EMTs
fighters record
experiences 500
12000 pages turns out
collected 2001 2002
The New York State Court Appeal
overturns Citys request hold
information
law suit New York Times
They failed City
holding information
Was 118 fighters
witnessed sounds flashes
explosions
We felt ground shake You
towers sway
came down
All sudden ground
started shaking
It shook bones
Shortly tower came
I remember feeling ground shaking
Somewhere middle
World Trade Center
orange red flash coming out
Initially flash
Then flash kept popping
way building building
started explode

like television
blow buildings
It like going way
like belt explosions
Pop pop pop thats I
heard building coming down
Saw brief number light sources
emitted inside building
floors 10 15
I saw low level flashes
We actually heard pops know
heard pops building
It blowing 4 sides
With popping sound initially
orange red flash came
building
building sides
I saw flash flash flash
looked like building came down
I thought terrorists planted
explosives building
Thats loud was
crackling explosive
Well hear
explosive video
Yeah Heres guys
tell Im OK alright Hold on
You wanna mother
Does sound like fire
Or collapsing floors
None explosions
official story
Another loud boom upper
floors series
smaller explosion swhich appeared
completely building
upper floors
Before came
I saw low level flashes
Flash flash flash looked
like building came down
Did flashes
I said yeah I thought me
He said no I saw too
What guys experience
You saw
It like detonators
planted
building
boom boom booom boom boom
All way down
How news reporters
say
They tend tell truth
pointed earlier day
And dont hear truth again
What happens it
Anybody watched building
demolished purpose knows
youre going
infrastructure building
bring down
The entire building collapsed
demolition team set
When old demolitions
old buildings
folded
its anymore
At 1030 I tried leave building
soon I got outside I heard
second explosion rumble
smoke dust
I ran inside building chandeliers
shook black smoke filled air
Within 5 minutes covered
silt dust
And marshal came
said leave because
3rd explosion
building last
A huge explosion now
raining debris us
gotta way
And sudden
big explosion I dont know
Just like youve seen
Thats went
came building
There big
big explosion tower
Now watch gentleman
experiences North Tower collapsing
ask question
Is reaction justified witnessing
were told gravitational
collapse happens
1700 feet away him
People standing
talking other

Oh God
Do know
explosion building collapse
To sounded like eh
There huge explosion
Chief Albert Tury told
events took place morning
He tried men quickly
said
explosion took place
And then hour
explosion towers here
According theory thinks
actually devices planted
buildings
It went like BABOOOM
like bomb went off
It like holy hell
coming stairs
And finally got bottom
coming out explosion
sent flying
Like sound gun fire
bang bang bang bang
suddenly 3 big explosions
I 5 blocks away
I heard explosions 3 thuds
I turned building
got tip
fold itself
We heard reports secondary explosions
airplanes impacted
Whether fact
base towers fact
coup gras
bring ground
As getting gear
making way stairway
heavy duty explosion
Again explosions
official story
Now compare explosions
known explosion left here
Upward outward arching streamers
pyroclastic volumes dust
symmetrical display like mushroom
Does look like
gravitational collapse you
How explosives placed
WTC Twin Towers 50000 occupants
knowing it
Well floor plan
Lets enlarge closer look
We note core structure columns
immediately adjacent
elevators
lower levels certainly
If access elevator hoist way
hack 2 layers
¾ inch gypsum board protecting
building rising it
access core columns
beams you
How elevator modernization
know going months
prior 911
Yes Elevator World
March 2001 documents it
In fact
middle modernization
ACE Elevator contract
Were conspiracy theorists its pretty
obvious somebody needs asked
key questions
There people noted
elevators locked turn
guards placed
locked elevators
modernization
Of course youd
access security
Securicomm brought in
Who sits board Securicomm
Marvin Bush younger brother
George Bush
Lets somebody ask
questions
Wireless detonation common
industry dont need miles wire
detonate
remotely great flexibility fact
Well precedent
NIST tells couldnt
controlled demolition
didnt start bottom
Thats controlled
demolitions start buildings
Lets look
theres way it
The words senior blaster
We blow basement
columns basement
Then crack
started
We floor
way down
Every explosive timer it
thats its controlled
When columns go floor goes
impacts below
keeps going
Mark Loizeaux president
company called Controlled Demolition
You dont floor

structure and given right
circumstances release
stored energy converting
whats called kinetic energy
thats energy motion thats
brings building down
Well heres 3 storey
controlled demolition lets count them
One  three
Now high energy
explosives C4 RDX
Very loud booms visible flashes
Perhaps reason thermite
dont loud
explosions like
high energy explosives
And dont
flashes either
Heres 20 storey middle
controlled demolition
You start demolitions
like
Lets look North Tower now
What I want point
youre going explosions
building curiously
whats going happen
entire section going telescope
half it upper half destroyed
movement
jet plane impact down
Lets look
Heres evidence explosions
here
collapsing
Of course violent clouds
emerging prior collapse
Were going closer
look second look
A new fuel source
jet fuel wasnt burned
thats getting new oxygen
Lets look closer up
Right away were seeing
clouds forming here
Wait collapse
supposed here
We asymmetrical
damage building right
The plane went side
completely symmetrical collapse
well use quotes
lets going
And time
Belts like firemen saw
way building
The antenna falls 12 meters first
falls
indicating core column damage
first trusses pulling away
perimeter columns
Now look this
tower bottom
noting violence underneath
mushroom cloud
The collapse supposed
occurring way here below
youll second run
incredible quantities squibs
explosions bursting out 3rd
time Id like direct attention
racing series explosions
right
corner building
About 40 stories
collapsing building
It gets painfully obvious
while doesnt it
Note multiple nodes
independent explosions
its little different North Tower
But its incredibly while
explosions developed
Do straight down
symmetrical progression collapse
outside footprint
We 207 foot wide building FEMA
tells us document
1200 foot debris field
equidistant tower
Asymmetrical damage symmetrical
distribution site fact
beyond
Do squibs
mistimed explosions
Some believe
appropriately timed explosions
In videos collapses explosions
seen bursting building
20 30 stories
demolition wave
Here
Here
Here
Here
Here
And here
Now NIST tells
puffs air produced
collapsing building pushing
air hoist way like piston
its gotta come somewhere right
Well puffs air
theyre pulverized building materials
And occur 160 200 feet
them second
These velocities
propelled explosives
20 40 60 stories below
piston producing that
And fact focalized
ejections occur half way
corners building
Also
open office space 60 feet long
elevator hoist way here
piston going shove air
room its going room
fairly uniformly air pressure
breaks windows right
And break
focalized pin point accurate
geometrically precise
violent ejections
No its extremely unlikely
But lets look couple them
As South Tower begins explode
track 2 squibs near frame
They shoot quickly first slow
merge rest rest
dust cloud
Using data points
squib shoots
4498 meters second
100 miles hour
Doing second squib
speed 563 meters second
works close 126 mph
126 mph instant ejection velocity
Does create that
Do near free fall pace
path greatest resistance
Lets look
Galileos law falling bodies calculates
time object travel
certain distance complete free fall
Distance D equals 1608 times
time seconds squared
The South Tower 1362 feet tall
1362 equals 1608 times 847
92 seconds
The Twin Towers came
nearly free fall speed
What talking here
Lets try perspective
storey problem
We 15 storey building
hold crane 95 stories
air
No resistance right
Just air resistance
Next 15 storey building held
95 storey building with say
80000 tons structural steel it
Now were going pull levers
cranes drop once
I brought 95 storey
building today
were going
test theory NIST
Ive got 2 15 storey buildings
Weve got 80000 tons structural
steel right
weve got air resistance here
So lets try it OK
Well here well
little impact load too OK
Ready 3 2 1
Oh God The
resistance hit ground first
At virtually free fall speed
This doesnt much it
What happened here
The building above met resistance
energy deformation
came halt
In fact youll website
wwwAE911Truthorg 
Ken Cutler Gordon Ross produced
papers calculate
fact buildings downward
momentum
immediately arrested
Then 15 storey building
driving building ground
free fall speed
In 2 seconds saw reduced
half mass blown outside
couldnt influence
downward progression building
In 2 seconds 4 seconds
totally its destroyed itself
Theres crushing building
Its tearing apart free fall speed
And its dismembering steel structure
In fact leading edge mushroom
clouds perimeter columns
aluminum cladding steel
Lets look South Tower
terms dismemberment
See whats going here
South Tower left
It hit lower aircraft
And see descent
rapid destruction starts
begins tilt left
Now fact disappears cloud
We expect building
tilted 22 degrees
continuing angular momentum
center building it
How crush symmetrically
free fall speed its center
We dont mangled
heap pavement
Its completely dismembered
Lets look though
Because Im convinced
We asymmetrical damage
theres symmetrical destruction
occurring underneath cloud
way building like firemen saw
mass
fallen over
Free fall speed
It doesnt sense me
The steel framed structure
completely dismembered
There large chunks building
Only shards saw
perimeter structure
Does look like
gravitational collapse you
Do lateral ejection
structural steel
Lets look
Now lets look
collapse Twin Towers
Were seeing explosions
implosions demolition history
A sequenced rumble
roar debris thrown outward
The damage contained
Windows blown
neighborhood buildings
What kind energy enabled this
Would hurl metal
concrete sideways air
Here chunk steel blown
400 feet wedging deep WTC 3
Vesey Street
A FEMA photographer taking pictures
Ground Zero wondered
steel beams
jutting neighborhood buildings
What shot pieces Towers
way street
In fact portions tower
greatest structural members
sky lobbies mechanical
floors perimeter units
thrown farther perimeter
wall units upper floors
theyre higher
gone further right
No perimeter units landed
Winter Garden 600 feet away
Lets look physics this
Girders weighing tons
600 feet base North tower
How fast ejected
depends originated
If came high building
thrown outward 50 mph
If came lower
speed greater
Gravity account
high lateral ejection speeds
In fact lets look
couple specific ejections
Using special software analyze
motion video clips frame frame
Ive placed markers frame
track particular projectile
From markers
data table plot graphs
The data shows objects
tracking shot horizontally
70 mph
The energy needed hurl 4 ton
girder speed comparable
energy needed hurl
200 pound cannonball 3 miles
What floors
pancakes
If pancake collapse were
looking pancakes below
This 7 storey lobby
Theres 2 3 stories stuff there
Well look stuff
Im looking 110 floors
kind metal decking underneath
4 5 inches concrete
An acre size them
110 acres these
How floors
bottom
Not 50 10 1
We dont metal
decking there
Or concrete Theres hardly
macroscopic chunks concrete
What happened metal decking
What happened concrete
Tom Patrezza brought
floor decks out
6000 them says I couldnt
believe it Not floor panel
notes comes
help clean up
Pancakes occur pancake collapses
Enormous pyroclastic clouds
pulverized concrete
Where concrete fact
Lets listen Jeff King
One significant things
thinking indicates
sort collapse
were told presence
dust clouds
And youve seen pictures Im sure
seen like
large clouds
dust enveloped area
crossed river
way New Jersey
pictures Ive seen
This type flow
were familiar physics
It occurs 2 situations
know naturally
One volcanic eruptions large
material suddenly exploded
air basically
forms small particles
Thank you Jeff
How New York governor Petaki
And look
theres concrete
Theres little concrete
All aluminum steel
What happened concrete
The concrete pulverized
When I Tuesday
like foreign planet
All Lower Manhattan site
From river river
dust powder 2 3 inches thick
The concrete pulverized
And fighter
You 110 storey office buildings
You dont desk
dont chair
You dont telephone
computer
The biggest piece telephone
I half keypad
big
The building collapsed dust
And dust
New Jersey river
Thick billowing laying carpet 4 6
inches Lower Manhattan
Pulverized 100 micron 10 mille
particles like talcum powder
it
Its fine
Where grinder produced this
90000 tons it
In clouds expanded 10 times
volume buildings
30 seconds
Now available gravitational potential
building 110000 KWH
Thats basically weight building
times height ground
evened out
But expansion clouds
calculated require 10 times
energy heat
produces expansion
So problem here
In fact gravitational potential
entire building needs produce
4 heat sinks
But first 15 storey building
gravitational potential alone
its converted gravitational
potential kinetic energy
They cant anymore work
In words cant fall
free fall speed crush
80000 tons structural steel
It cant fall free fall speed
grind 90000 tons concrete
It cant fall free fall speed
create friction
tons molten metal
seen responders
The energy doesnt add up
Were talking overall 50 times
gravitational potential energy building
produce phenomena
How victims
In April 2006 New Yorkers
distressed learn bone fragments
human remains 911
roof nearby
Deutsche Bank Building
And Gods
fragments there
And bone fragments
centimeter long
How small
700 bone fragments half inch long
skyscraper street
Think one
Theres 2749 victims
300 bodies found
20000 pieces bodies found 6000
small fit test tube
1151 victims completely unaccounted
for words
pieces large
DNA from vaporized
200 pieces matched
single person
Can gravitational collapse account
massive pulverization people
We talked iron microspheres
We talked chemical
evidence thermate
slag
ends beams
And talked evidence thermite
unexploded thermite dust itself
All direct evidence
explosive destruction
And
accounted fire
Lets dr David Ray Griffin
sum us
These facts taken render
likelihood official theory
essentially zero
In fact 10 phenomena
likelihood occurring
explosives
essentially zero
But lets generous suggest
maybe theres 1 chance
things occur
Virtual free fall speed straight down
enormous dust 1 chance
But figure probabilities

2 occur 3 occur
time 10 occurring
explosives youre talking
likelihood trillion
So official theory
Towers disproved thoroughly
theory possibly
evidence explained
alternative theory according
Towers brought
explosives
The official theory
outrageous theory
alternative theory is scientific
point view possible theory
Thank you
How FEMA report
What Fire Engineering

Final report collapse
WTC Twin Towers
They probably called
Final report initiation collapse
They cast doubt theory

In fact 4 mock samples
35 foot spans 17 foot spans
35 foot spans proofing like
Twin Towers floor decking
Now theres 2000 degrees fires

What happens
None fail
These 4 tests
The steel temperatures
