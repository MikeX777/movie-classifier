communicate
base GPS
But light waves arent blocked
theyre refracted And
Its radios
Signals arent gone
Theyre scrambled
That leaf hand
Do know youd
sequenced it
What
Human Hox genes
Hox What Hox mean
Theyre genes
define body plan
physical structure
And plants human body plan
Arms attached shoulders
legs hips
Its literally possible
Its literally whats happening
The Shimmer prism
refracts everything
Not light radio waves
Animal DNA Plant DNA
All DNA
What mean DNA
Shes talking DNA
Shes talking us
All right I guess bedroom
Lets secure doors windows
This mistake
Okay
You spend time away
husband him
You cant talk work

I dont think wanted anything
But it It attacked you
It mirrored me
I attacked it
Im sure knew I there
It came reason
It mutating environment
It destroying everything
It wasnt destroying
It changing everything
It making new
Making what
I dont know
A team reached lighthouse
hours ago
Everything ash
If encountered alive
its dead
Now tell
