Why content

policing schools
My longterm goal
remove policing schools
create socioemotional
traumainformed care
programmings
kids getting
different levels
social support
policing
whirring
pensive music

The video focused
everyones attention
excessive force
cant forget
brought officer
classroom
He enforcing law
crime to quote
disturb schools way
That means disturbance
kid causes
school crime
overlapping remarks
grim music

Where law come from
The original intent
control young people
The very original version
South Carolinas law
law flirting
written 1919
And
state lawmaker
concerned
flirting
saw going
near womens colleges
white womens college
jurisdiction
tense music

And then
late 1960s
law expanded
apply schools
girls
womens schools
late 1960s
So know
going then
You know coincidence
Kids protesting
Vietnam War
kids protesting
civil rights violations
ugly
like violence
scary time
many people
So
attempt lawmakers
educators
tools
word thats used
tools control kids
time status quo
threatened
And case
designed

outside agitators
phrase
used
And fact
was
know tens thousands
kids schools
They outsiders right
And disproportionately
kids color
In 1990s law
started time
prevent else
student misbehavior
And got point where
I dont know
I think 2000 something
like 30000 kids charged
disturbing schools
South Carolina
The use
disturbing schools law
harmful
lawful
um form structural violence
And so we
utilizing law

Okay
Youre critical ofof

I acting
uniformed police officer

shape form
You know I political
victim situation

politically sense
If I follow policy procedure
I follow law

I
thats responsibility
thats oath I took
Uh I just I continue to
law enforcement level
I stand I day
So said came
eyes police officer
didnt far
Im looking criminal
child
yeah far
Because I read reports
The class wasnt
interrupted teacher
got upset

Because youve said
youve known
deeper stuff
So like
Shakara
thats making
want leave
Well theres certainly
theres people close
feel way
situation

management things like that
So its time
Ive heard thats fair
If I went toIf I patrol
I got called
movie theater remove
somebody movie theater
I wouldnt ask
movie theater leave
Or I went restaurant
needed remove somebody
restaurant I wouldnt
ask restaurant leave
right And I viewed
police standpoint
And thats thats
going
created happen
You havent focus
The focus
I dont believe police
schools
Theres reason
shouldve called period
All right I got you
Yeah
So let me let
couple things
One I say obviously
know know SROs
school doesnt mean safety
I dont disagree that
One biggest issues
right
theyre sticking SROs
schools
arent
trained properly
youve got goal
post little bit
Its okay discipline kids
Its okay hold
kids accountable
Im saying kids dont
held accountable
All were saying like
accountability
look like
We law
kids arrested
things
cant arrested
outside streets for
Look system
What
referring to
You system
need change system
Uh help understand
little bit
So I
Im talking governmental
education institutionalized
racism policies
create laws
create
thats I mean
system
Okay so know know
uh systematic racism
kind stuff
I think its talking points
I think sounds good
face
its things
were taking onus
kids saying
Hey youre responsible
bad behavior
were going
were going
blame system
And things that
know looked
disturbing school law
brought lot
disproportional
Black kids
arrested white kids
right
And disproportional
Black kids suspended
white kids I mean
look whole
I mean
school district
thats going case
Okay
Why happening
opinion
There tendency
think Black kids
automatically fault
This running
hallways
running hallways
got discipline
referral like
Well know
cant that
Its going on
There way
were young people
depending theyre white
versus children color
And thats statistically
proven
In schools the um
disproportional
Black deputies
How explain that
Are these Black deputies
Black teachers

thats hurting
um Black people
Absolutely talk
internalized oppression
So I Ive
trained life
better this
I push narrative
I act accordance to
SO yes
We day
problems
I dontI cant talk
problems
know
theyre there
My focus is
create solutions
How create solutions
And talking
holding kids accountable
hold
adults accountable too
were responsible
generation
We are
Right I think thats good
I think that
going something
I think great point
I think classroom management

Lot process
Its internal battle
Im having
I forward ask
I stuff right
Am I harming
Am
How I sit
conversation
man whos created harm
somebody I love
Its going sense
everybody especially
half time
dont sense me
Do I feel like

I wouldve like left alone
I saw
youre man willing
step new
Youre man grappling

knew
white privilege
So think
wrong
white privilege

But want
room kids
I believe its
responsibility sure

So
speaking today
Just book
wrote I guess
Yeah book know
root cause
Parkland School shooting
The tag line
Parkland School shooting
avoidable
mass murder American history
policies
inevitable
come kids school
Youve seen
line right
The way strip SROs
strip teachers
Absolutely ignore
crime bad behavior
people hurt
minority people
You know theres just
school prison pipeline
biggest hoax
Ive heard of
It simply isnt true
And yet
thats sell
And its disgraceful
This issue Ive working
trying expose underside
discipline reform
business right
Fight school prison
pipeline
reducing suspensions
expulsions arrests
We numbers
frequently
simply systematically
hiding misbehavior
refusing
enforce rules
The Parkland shooter story
If single individual
Broward County School District
single responsible
decision him
probably couldve
averted
irresponsible decision
actually makes total sense
given policies
govern system
I appreciate
coming today Max
Id like acknowledge
Ben Fields
His claim fame
job
disagreed
job
When I saw incident
Officer Fields
Spring Valley High School
mirrored incidents
I seen high
schools I
incidents
described
multiple teachers
control students
students came school
obey
directive teacher
You cant allow percent
population determine
education whole
When people say know
need able exclude
student classroom
need able
school resource officers present
need
police present schools
wanna sure
learning place
watch video
Because certainly
learning taking place
girl
dragged room
Certainly learning
taking place day
week followed
months followed thereafter
students
live aftermath
witnessing school
wondering
happen
again
I asked young lady
come me
She said no
hadnt wrong
To response was
I hadnt said did
stuff
come me You know me
You know Im fair guy
Ive dealt before
To refused
And point time
I approached
went place
arrest fight on
She cracked jaw
She pulled away me
I got chair
And getting
chair
went viral
Schools need good
fair firm discipline
Look me camera
Ill
and spell me
All right Ben Fields
BEN name FIELD
Tell
you wanted here
Were allowing teachers
administrators this
matter police officers
jobs
schools safe
One things I talk
lot race thing
This thing race right
And happens is
have
You Black white people
day
well
You Black white people
coexist daily basis
They work together
school together
together
And happens
media takes
try divide us
meaning regular
everyday working class person
makes
country tick
try think
civil rights
ended yesterday
slavery
ended yesterday
that know racial
disparities country
great
My story good story

white deputy Black girl
She decision fight
uniformed officer day
And person
punished day who
Ben Fields I lost job
Regardless else
Ben Fields
punished situation
rain pattering
When cant trace past
present
left deeply
problematic explanations
current conditions
Victim blaming explanations
Im thinking Trayvon
Martin I saw interview
jurors
said George Zimmerman
like
nice guy relatable
And I think thats worth noting
Trayvon Martin didnt
like nice child
didnt relatable
He threatening
But George Zimmerman gun
like nice guy
relatable
So Black people seen
inherently criminal
Black children seen
inherently criminal
The core concern I
know now
Its open question
We know conclusively
research
Black kids engage
disciplinable type
offenses schools
It theres
particular gene Black kids
makes misbehave more
Thats accurate
And so need throw away
frankly racist notion
kids color worse
educate kids
like believe them
Educate kids like
theyre valuable treat
like somebodys beloved
baby classroom
Mm Im frustrated
About lot
You know
I feel I put
time I step
forward Im taking
like I good path
come
set way back
What come
moms
My sister
Just her
reason
Once
unhealed trauma
If talk her
I wisdom
Shes people
grandparents like
Thats wise child
Her dreams hope
passion
certain things
barriers
barriers
Are okay
What need okay
That incident sheds light
quickly
like leave people
Theres lot stake
Well
like practice test
maybe section
just know
work
really
feel like it
Like easy
I know
multiplication
thats I division
I like
Its confusing
Okay
Hopefully zone in
The pressure
is
know
yourself
Like youve come far
So know
especially getting
close
youve
got piece
I know it
Well these
So these
Im assuming dont
calculator this

What Charlotte What

Okay Charlotte today was
individual
Manhattan Institute

discipline numbers down
thats essentially
what its about
Well behavior

When youre talking
criminal youre definitely
talking criminal
somebody goes
shoots everybody
criminal doubt it
But looks
starts teacher
calling assistance
cause student

Obviously theres
comparison somebody

And somebody just
Because Black girls arent

Understand something
disrupting classroom
