Youre starting sound
like Jocelyn Abney
Thats cause weve read
book
Weve read
kids
Its local folklore
Its here
There are
In 1621 Lord Misrule
man named Tobias Bron
claimed contacted
Gallowgog
This great spirit promised
bless town miracles
The old families rejoiced
wonders
In return
Tobias instructed villagers
build great Black Barn
Gallowgog
left gifts
offerings
Seems odd way
things God
Rebecca
understand
left offerings
Their children
Nobody knows
young souls sacrificed
Whos this
People didnt believe
Gallowgog
No dear
Thats Tobias Bron
followers
When Church learned
heresy
came Berrow
executed them
As imagine
