Any huntergatherer tribe

Any records old records

people untouched
modern civilization thing
Look Native Americans
They legally like

James Imagine youre

hunting ability

That matters huge
huntergatherer society
It improves cohesion
tribal unit
If little

incredibly
important tools
Michael Human language

James Youve got somebody
whos severely depressed
Been depressed years
works
And dose
psilocybin theyre
depressed anymore
What happened
And answer is
like things
important world
havent faintest idea
But think
it youre taking
body
theres kind myth
psychedelics brain
Now reality
body goes
bloodstream
goes
cell body
So were seeing
people report
physical pain
uh better eating habits
social behavior
um people
skin conditions clear up
course lot ofof mental
behavioral changes
But were seeing
reestablish
healthy equilibrium body
So psychedelics
combination of uh
neuroscience pharmacology
psychology
single treatment
instead separating
things its usually done
The current pharmacotherapy
picking different
drugs try hit
targets
This kind like having
dysfunctional electronic circuit
dont know whats
wrong it
start
replacing pieces starts
working again
Thats way
pharmacotherapy works
lot conditions
Psychiatry hasnt got new drugs
Antidepressants work in

neural chemistry
Starting gaggy yet
Well thats I want
mow em down
Oh
Fuck it
When gonna done
Done I dont like
thinking it
Weve come believe
wise responsible use
drugs like psilocybin
constitute major
frontier psychiatry
incredibly effective
helping people uh
deal depression anxiety
addictions simply
live fully
And interesting thing
drugs dont
taking them
Whats helpful memory
single experience
its experience
helpful versus biochemical
effect medication
Even people
psychedelics people
interested
open minded
it like But
stay like forever
Oh mythical perma trip
What stay
like forever
Which drugs work
Lets I mean
experiences
change certainly
experience

But cant magically
psilocybin chemicals
floating

point
This isnt forever
So I think scared
unsettled experiencing
negative emotions
associated
definitely risk
run messing
stuff
Maybe people
existing
psychological conditions
prone
sensitive kind thing
severe
me
When totally
shatter brain
personality
comes apart
ego dissolved
know youre
cosmos and
start come
its kind like rebooting
hard drive
Its like defragging
hard drive
When youwhen falls
leave lot
crap didnt need
know kind of
kind clogging
system
Thats therapeutic idea
Shane Heres actually know happening brain
Amanda The Eco mechanism
controlling debt rock
brain
called Default
Mode Network
Its network superimposed
networks
basically censors
enters consciousness
not
A psychedelic um tends
disrupt controlling
brain
reducing blood supply it
its like
government conductor
orchestra

When repressive
control reduced
parts brain start
communicate other
Instead limited form
communication
permitted networks brain
suddenly have
its like anarchy

So brain cells
functioning simultaneously
comes lessening
control Default
Mode Network

called ego
So
repressive control
Its comin on
You average
dose mushrooms
hour
start tripping
start feeling
45 maybe 30 minutes
That trip
That biological reaction
That gut going
Did eat poison
What hell
doin there
audience laughing
Oh great pull
alarms lets nausea going

adrenaline anxiety panic
Wheres sweat
Fire auxiliary sweat

Waking parts

So people
set ways
set
ways limited
options become
After while cant
possibilities anymore youre going routines

Every needs help
I need help
Everyone needs help
And people
scared confront
psychedelics
bring surface
And things

And I uh figured way
living that
Eric Because Im
legally helps
people
people ask
I I know theyre
gonna uncomfortable it
like I kind kick
of uh initial
theyre like
And like
moment theyre
kind freaked
like dump
information
benefits
And theyre like theyre
surprisingly open
theyre theyre
state shock
And theyre like
Oh oh Youre like
like reversal
People know plants
potential
medicines exist
nature
pharmaceutical
laboratory
theyre pumped out
We study University
Alabama going
lookin ability
psilocybin treat uh
hardcore cocaine addicts
Um think probably theyll
work eating disorders
These intractable
diseases
real treatments now
You know drug
HIV itit looked promising
like looks like
cure people
scientists funding
agencies beating
doors this
But its psychedelics
theres this
echoes 60s
Americas public enemy
number United
States drug abuse
In order fight defeat
enemy necessary
wage new allout offensive
The history drug
prohibition its
stopping drug abuse
its
persecution minorities
power jobs
We started getting
little bit of uh hint of
uh prohibition marijuana
early
century
alcohol prohibition
Which sort
moralistic campaign
Not
thought
short lived fortunately
And prohibition

prohibition agents
gonna do
And Harry Anslinger
charge them uh started
big scare marijuana
announcer Marijuana
burning weed
roots hell
Rick Marijuana
illegal 37
took pharmacopoeias
medicine 42
Then marijuana
Mexicans blacks
jazz musicians
So kind way
minorities

And marijuana
picked 60s
young people
LSD
psychedelics
And big
counterculture drugs
integral their uh identity
theyre identified
counterculture
Vietnam War
protesting government
So psychedelics agents
counterculture
Nixon Haldeman
said biggest
enemies Civil Rights people
also uh hippies
And couldnt
criminalize ideas
criminalize
drugs
try break
meetings leaders
jail them
When Nixon
escalating drug war
decided pass
Controlled Substance
Act 1970
thats created
schedules
Schedule I drugs
accepted medical use
accepted safety use
medical supervision
high potential abuse
And thing thats confusing
people schedule I
doesnt mean
government decided
medical use

accepted medical use
Schedule II drugs
accepted medical use
accepted safety
medical supervision
high potential abuse
Schedule drugs
include cocaine
Theyre scared cocaine
cocaine medical use
its schedule I drug
Im sure
big important medical
value cocaine
qualify schedule II
I guess youre super
sleepy constipated
and dont time 50 cups
coffee I that
audience laughing
So schedule II drugs
high potential abuse
medicines
Schedule III medicines
medium
potential abuse
Schedule IV V lower
lower potentials abuse
control
And get uh
counter medicines
Shane I Adderall
time like
years ago
I like Oh Ill
try its crazy
science says is
And I tried things
I like right away I
like Oh cocaine
Whoa were giving cocaine
children Thats crazy
And refused
wear off
Its like Oh
meth Yeah
We giving
meth children
Then 70s
was um
attitude openness
sort hope
marijuana
decriminalized
Jimmy Carter 76
elected that
started
backlash parents
And 1980 got Ronald
Regan Nancy Regan
massive escalation
drug war
Thirtyseven federal agencies
working
vigorous national effort
year spending
drug law enforcement
tripled
1981 levels

Rick And time
MDMA
widely known
It secret
therapy drug middle
70s early 80s
And people
context
thought people
available
And named Ecstasy
party drug

male newscaster Chemists
MDMA short
Users word
it Ecstasy
Federal officials
underground drug
thats going nationwide
Soon hope
illegal
As awareness its uh
use party drug grew
Nancy Regan escalating
just no drug war
inevitable MDMA
going criminalized
Prohibition drug
culture manifests
misuse abuse drugs
pretends
its preventing
sends message
young people drugs
risks theres benefits
If use
hedonist uh
you youre immoral
And colors perception
young people
substances
enter
relationship
thats unhealthy
They think rebellious
thing Im bad
And consequently
use much
They dont arent
moderate use
We dont model healthy
psychedelic use young people
way
alcohol
You know glass
wine kids
teenagers
they know
dont binge drink later
these
alcohol responsibly
We need
thing psychedelics
So theres drug market
highly adulterated
MDMA market
But adulterant isnt
right word
Whats happening
drugs
substituted MDMA
precursors
MDMA expensive
risky obtain
So instead producing MDMA
criminals producing
paramethoxyamphetamine
um bath salts now
class drugs
called cathinones
uh pressing tablets
selling Ecstasy
selling Molly
young people think
theyre getting MDMA

Saved life
So I embarked in um
wanting help others
Theres drugs
approved FDA
posttraumatic stress disorder
Both SSRIs
Zoloft Paxil
They tend
mild effect
They reduce symptoms
leave

MAPS uh stands
Multidisciplinary Association
Psychedelic Studies
The essence is
um FDAapproved research
trying psychedelics
marijuana prescription
medicines
MAPS uh has know
funded studies
actually
FDA approval process
normal psychiatric drug would
People uh studies
difficult time
Its easy process

medications
And them we
people took

different medications
different medications
taking

challenge
difficult uh
thing do
My experience MDMA

And reintegration process
MDMA
MDMA inhaling
changed entire life
You know I longer

And treated
seven
people way
And year
MDMA session
looking
shortterm effects long

Two thirds people

resistant chronic PTSD
um longer PTSD
The tragedy field is
uh were seeing
studies now
power drugs
potentially have
And early psychiatrists
said that
man LSD isolated
Stolen Hofmann
Sandoz Pharmaceutical
Company Basel Switzerland
Erika There lot
promising research
unfolded 1950s
1961
thousand published
articles LSD
The idea treating people
alcoholism LSD
came
watched people going
delirium tremens
watched pain
suffering
people experienced
hit rock bottom
And thought
possible
hijack experience
giving people LSD
physiologically
reach rock bottom
And thought
work kind scaring people
would know
subjects
terrible experience
frighten
seek
help result
But didnt
work way
What happened
alcoholic patients
come treatment
actually
reflective experiences
Some
beautiful
overwhelmingly spiritual
Ive seen
intimate beauty life
Its like a
curtain spider web
Can it Its right
me Right now
Watch
No
Good heavens
You know went me
It passed right me
Erika And know
Bill Wilson Bill W
cofounders
Alcoholics Anonymous
sought psychedelic
researchers in United
States came Canada
search mechanism
determine
way
people
Alcoholics Anonymous having
LSD treatment initially
One things
Alcoholics Anonymous
offered people
wasnt necessarily
offered hospital setting
step two
recognizing
God
And alcoholics
asked come
talk feelings
accept God
uh wasnt
paired
prepared do
As subjects told me
know I wanted drunk
I wanted to know
hit women
I wanted fight guys
I didnt want sit
talking feelings
thinking God
He said But I took
LSD I saw God
I prepared come
listen people
uh talk feelings
And I appreciated
understood I needed
context there
And years people
treated psychedelic
therapy alcoholism
claiming um success
rates of units
ninety percent success
rate year followup
And thats
complete abstinence
No research units
claimed kind
success level
alcoholism treatment
For lot people its
miracle drug
cutting edge science
psychologists
therapists rushing
new field
Then US
theyre like
Ooh weaponize it
Cause thats do
And thought maybe
dump bunch
enemies drinking water
drive crazy
pacify
maybe torture
people it know
use truth serum
Who knows amazing
possibilities
Every country like
Seems like were helping lot
people stuff
The US like
But destroy them
Its cultural differences
its wackiest thing
audience laughing
So start
weird studies
can know
stuffs declassified
read it
do strap
military troops chairs
way LSD
drive
minds whatever
So didnt
way theyd hoped
All happened
study like
Huh I military
audience laughing clapping
LSD
scares
vile
thats like hits
dont know whos making it
Ideally prohibition wasnt
thing youd like pill
know exactly
pill

accidentally five
hits LSD lose mind
I wish LSD
therapy settings
Im saying
psychedelics
I honestly dont believe
theyre everybody
I believe theyre me
Uh I dont believe
theyre everybody
And Im psychonaut
Like I can uh I compare
myself like Im
psychedelics
exploring mind
equivalent
astronaut
I genuinely believe thats a
thats word culture
thats I fall
culture
And Im like peer
pressuring people it
Just Im like pro NASA
doesnt mean Im like Hey
everybody shuttle
You to
No Im okay here Im
enjoying here
No worlds going look
totally different
there You got try it
Dont explode
sometimes
Well yeah sure

overplayed news
audience laughing
And Ill honest you
I meet
whos like little off
audience laughing
And its always
went little
overboard LSD
decided try forties
trip like that
Yeah its uh
explorers
So its so the
moon isnt good enough
got Mars
And laughing
youre like Whats
going like out
Who knows Lets go
Were going pack
anything Fuck no
Shouldnt
calculations Uhuh
We got fuel lets go
So time
psychedelic research
uh combining subjective
side psychological interviews
psychological
questionnaires
physiological side
studying the
bloodstream heart
rate respiratory rhythm
looking brain
live humans awake
healthy conditions
This completely unprecedented
shed light
LSD
therapeutic effects
better understand
whats brain
mind
Shane A standard hit LSD
micrograms
Ive
micrograms
And hear
people thousand
thousand micrograms
crazy
All LSD experiences
are like
Oh chill
A lot times I like
housework LSD
Its nice sit
thinking
little bit differently
But I dont like
crazy patterns like
lot people do
Each researcher tends
metaphor try
explain whats going on
Uh favorite uh
analogy radio
radio dialing
So youre driving car
youre listening
radio station
youre
youre youre filtering
others
They transmitting
frequencies
youre killing
listen
specific station
And thats good
listen clearly
the sound qualitys good
understand
thats playing around
However radio
finetuned

stations
time
What LSD
brain
like this
So brain finetuning
specific moment
paying attention
things
environment
filtering rest
And LSD to
disturb
filtering mechanism
start kind perceiving
brain
regions differently
time
So hand thats
confusing
you cant
focus in thing
So people
talking cant
focus
shifting
attention people
feel uh confused
On hand

creativity example
creativity
connecting together
uh things
separating
different frequencies
You considering
different stations
shows different
topics sudden
youre hearing
connections
making before
Psychiatrist Humphrey
Osmond introduced word
psychedelic 1956
wanted capture
sensation way
mind brought light
subsor concepts
brought light
So word psyche
Greed word mind
word delos Greek
bring light
combined
mean psychedelic
So way mind
manifests brings
things light
And clever rhyming
couplet this
To fall hell soar
angelic youll need
pinch psychedelic
Shane Today Im
Ketamine time
Its time
psychedelics professional
therapeutic setting
I
believe in
And Im excited
nervous
Im little nervous
Ketamine actually
I dont
know lot about
All I know its
notorious
called K hole
I dont totally
know means
sounds horrible
Most holebased
terminology positive
Ketamine
schedule III drug
That basically means
FDA DEA classify
having accepted medical
use lower potential
dependence
strictly
regulated schedule I
schedule II drugs
distant explosion
woman Heres
depressing
The Centers Disease Control says roughly Americans today depressed
One Americans
antidepressants
I think swings
cycles social
medical history
Shane If
depressed people
responding antidepressants
clearly
isnt working
When drug comes market
uh pharmaceutical companies
interested launching
trying

begin money
And uh actually
screen out cases
patients treatment
resistant mood disorders so
uh original work gets
drugs market
doesnt apply
patients multiple
comorbid psychiatric soars
failed
different antidepressants
Uh treatments exist
like
ecosystem okay
Where like little
replicators competing use
They compete things like
money time interest
One things makes
compete
theyre effective
treatments thats
factor
its easily overwhelmed
factors
good treatment fail
doesnt replicate
economically
medical marketplace
Uh unfortunately theres
money Ketamine
its patent
isnt financial
incentive

promising drug
Terrance Ketamine
dissociative anesthetication
thats
late 60s
It help
brain rewire itself
And work
demonstrating uh
benefits Ketamine
uh uh treatments of uh
depression bipolar depression
work PTSD
And probably
data Ketamine
medicine
thats treat
uh treat mood disorders
You mentioned depression
going age
thereabouts
Shane Mmhm

Shane Id

compared smoking DMT
I low expectations
I took I think

Some sort universal
consciousness

And like couple
seconds of Oh I think
Ive before
echoing This minutes

Ive
days manic state
trying figure
physics theres
dimensions
were able communicate
somehow
cant normally perceive
And I start thinking
kind complicated formulas
time works
messages sent

changing future theyre
sending ripples
time changing
environment
After week this

I heard you

So definitely
I expect know
Lorazepam Gabapentin
It sounds like sort
euphoric kind manic
episode man
know like doctor
tries tell somebody
obviously having
better day I
theres wrong
need medicine
like thats tough sell
Thats dangerous place
in
People known
blow family fortunes
fortune
peoples fortunes
grandiosity leads
risktaking behavior
People normally wear
seatbelts dont wear seatbelts
drive dangerously
jump things
they know general
risktaking fashion
So think that uh
psychedelics responsible
taking
bipolar II bipolar I
Its
existing predisposition
extreme mood states
thats way
reacted stressor
I interested
know
manic episode

psychedelics I think
I wouldnt surprised
wouldnt
manic episode
required hospitalization
I I know crazy sounds
I sort feel
like ayahuasca
finish job
Would advise that
Uhhuh
Uh well hopefully science
day know
answer to know like
Yeah yeah
what happened
place and
Yeah
whether its safe
Thats tragedy
war drugs
dont know
answers like
ancient compounds
despite sort
colloquial knowledge
but plural anecdote
data was know
Mmmm
Its lot stories
sound promising
its thing
truly designed
know investigation
scientific question
So know
mental health standpoint
I wouldnt recommended
place
I good friend
hes shaman
learned Peru
many years
ceremonies Europe
And says its easy
forgive father
ayahuasca session
What difficult
home act
forgiveness know
forgive father
And what
integration
means know
practice act
teachings learnings
experience

easy do know
So intention
know
want work
know objectives

know
experience
need something
So experience like
magic pill experience
gonna things
youre youre free
choose
youve seen
path begins
We
actual work begins
experience
When I
integrate things
I integrate things
life open
loops drive crazy
Like I said
stupid girl
I sixth grade
embarrassed
crush
I liked
I revisit
painful thing
Or Oh I bullied kid
gay
I fourth grade
I didnt understand
I didnt know better
I known better
And got
relive way
forgive it
Thats hard
process
plaguing you
Like that
personal hell
We open loops
bad or uh
happened life

fully processed
brains
screaming like
Hey dont forget this
This threat
environment You got
remember lesson
Its important
And lot lessons
use anymore
happened
kid
different phase life
So going kind
reliving brings closure
closes open loops
Um thats I think
anyway
So thats
I think integration
exceptionally important
But its still like I look
the
like drawings
I
best ideas
day
Ive life
But I also
came
delusional
ideas Ive had
So then thats
like embarrassing and
worry I dont want
like friends
family again
But uh fuck
interesting
Careful wish for
That bit intense
little scarier
I anticipating
I end getting
I wanted
Ive quit drinking
I quit smoking cigarettes
Ive taking
better care myself
Ive meditating
help sensory
deprivation tanks
Ive eating right
exercising
And I think Ive
excitement
life while
Although psychedelics incredibly positive influence life 21 years
potential drive completely
insane month so
I dont think psychedelics
everything
spending years
interviewing scientists
sorts different
fields science
psychedelic research
point view
potential
create real positive change
individuals societies
Of course
MDMA talking
Hopefully future well reasonable laws research
well better
understanding
use things correctly
