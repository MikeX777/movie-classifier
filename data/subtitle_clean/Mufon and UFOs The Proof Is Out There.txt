 Ever I little kid
Ive obsessed idea
extraterrestrial life outer space
Its like born me
 To me its belief all
Its truth
its open
different hypotheses
different data
trying learn
can
 Ive interested UFOs
Its sort
lifelong obsession
 When I MUFON field investigator
I started investigating
phenomena myself
like fish water
It I meant do
I born do
I view mystery
I think its
ridiculous think
theres life there
I like investigating things
Its nature
So coming soon
cant talk this
You know
old saying I want believe
Thats me
 Here Jeff Krauss
outside MUFON headquarters
Newport beach  We it
 We it
 In piece  Two pieces
 One two
I think MUFONs creed says all
The scientific investigation UFOs
benefit humanity
 Well its mutual UFO network
They reports
sightings experiences

sort research
entire subject
 MUFON started
midwestern UFO network
1969 project blue book
air forces official
investigation UFOs closed
thats MUFON
mutual UFO network
weve
air forces job since
Its private group
Were volunteers
Ive got little team
people work
ya know MUFON
 Specifically Im
interested astrobiology
search
life planets
Now interestingly enough people
field astrobiology
necessarily interviewed
UFO documentary
 Mostly
love phenomenon
quest
understanding phenomenon
The way I UFO investigation
its MUFON
Ill report come in
People will ya know UFO
dont wanna
air force police
ya know
I mean
usually theyll shuffle
doormat
But MUFON Com
itll report UFO
Ya click
itll ask questions
What area sky saw in
time day evening was
theyll wanna know at
ya know city was
Ill sent witness email
tell I
Im responding
MUFON report
good time
talk phone
schedule interview them
 Part bit hunger
Okay I gotta figure is
Im gonna best
research out
Im gonna newspaper reports
Im gonna search
Internet sighting reports
organizations ya know
social media like that
Im gonna I can
Im gonna look local flight paths
Im gonna look
I possibly
try determine mightve been
 If people thing
thats good especially

perspectives of
And details match
account
 When I start going
Im sure yet
sort feeds itself
The exciting is
work I do
Then comes moment
I cant I sit while
It bothers me
It eats away cause I dont want
close report
I dont wanna tell witness
I dont wanna tell
people organization
sure thats unknown
I sit I worry while
And I think Im like Ill
leave Ill come
day
Im like no I gotta know is
I gotta its not
And gets exciting
its nerve racking
 Okay somebody
UFO sighting
just right
I mean its huge thing
UFO
It depends distant is
If its
distance
its like visual thing
ya know its like
saw
distance sometimes
somebody sees
UFO distance
weird thing happens
It like telepathic
connection happens
Suddenly UFO right them
 And usually thing I
I close case I
contact state director
chief state
investigator I hey guys
I think I here
Will look Ive got
Look notes look report
tell think
 In mind holy
grail UFO investigation

actually kind
material fragment
UFO artifact
Thats assuming
physical objects
lets second
If actual piece one
game changer
lab
You look isotope ratios
You look
elements its
ya know
matches know
come earth
And tell
pretty substantial
things actually
origin is
 Its fun its exciting
A lot basic day
day investigations
easily remote
Phone video chat email kinda thing
Depends type report is
Your basic day day
hey I saw weird
I phone
I conduct interview
I
investigation way
Ill research locations
through look
air traffic area
check news reports
corresponds
date sighting
I idea
person

happened
As type sightings level up
merit
person investigation
Say investigate actual landing sight
face face interview somebody
whos actually
face face experience
else
All way MUFON division
underwater research
trained scuba divers
They 24 hour response team
So ya know theres
Roswell incident
people
24 hours ground
I think public surprised
theres scientists
ex military police officers
lot highly credentialed people
involved MUFON
theres housewives
Just anybody whos
interested wants help
 I think helps
If youre pure skeptic thats good
If youre like everybody space brothers
everythings UFO
thats good either
Ya know
able look stuff
try skeptical
try figure
prosaic thing object
person saw
mightve
thats UFO
Its like check

end day
I cant scientific
explanation ya know
sighting theres UFO
Doesnt mean its
alien planet
I mean
black project
Im aware yet
But its unidentified
UFO is
unidentified flying object
 Its pretty easy actually
You MUFONs website
read
theyre about
You member
Theres little membership
fee newsletter
theres different levels membership
After couple years I decided I wanted
involved I
applied investigator
Theres training process that
You sign up training
tests eventually
certified field investigator
 But thats pretty it
We generally months limit
long case
I somebody ya know UFO report
rocket launch
Vandenberg night
He happened
boat Catalina island
looked strange
Ya know spacex
launches look strange
Ya know
ya know stage
land
landing platform
So youve got kinds activity
sky
I understand person
thought UFO
I wrote guy
nice email told
saw
I said want talk
We talk
Just let know
Send email Ill ya know
explain little better
but know
knew rocket launch
expecting people report it
 The vast majority
people Ive spoken
excited it
They wanna know like it
What I see
What it
Did anybody it
They wanna know think was
Ive talked couple
people thrilled
opportunity
thing happened them
saw
contact
Some people ask
directly this
Because feel like
speak me
speak MUFON
think were experts
We know
But dont know
And thats kinda point
We dont know
We want know
Were trying gather information
different sources
reports

this
We cant that
My favorite reports ones
classify unknowns
An unknown basically
definitively
not
You know theres situation
somebody saw something
maybe photographs
And certain percentage
reasonable doubt
airplane kind
I cant tell kind was
I cant identify it
manmade vehicle
sort
satellite whatever
planet star thats thing
An unknown cant sure
I Im looking picture
airplane
Thats favorite
Those me
exciting ones
makes think
You research
You talk people
You look parts
sure
not
Theyre probably
rare cases
me theyre exciting ones
Theyre ones interested
 Yeah lot
secret craft ya know
atmosphere plasma
phenomenon misperceptions
Again are
But cases

flying aerodynamically
bizarre ways right
Its suddenly stopping
insane gforce
Its reversing direction
 I best not
I dont wanna burst someones bubble
If believes
hard saw
theyre excited it
I dont wanna break them
I best
explain I cant
sure is
I cant tell
alien UFO whatever
I I think
wasnt
 The answer cases
cant know
sure
But ya
try rule
conventional explanation
 Theres times
I absolutely
man its balloons man Im sorry
There birthday party street
balloons got away
I try easy possible
For me its
matter disappointment
Im figure
best ability
not
 Ya know theres lot
different ideas
UFOs be
Classified technology
country country
drones sort people
misperceiving things
yeah time
Could kind
new atmospheric phenomenon
Could kind plasma
like ball lightning something
Could extraterrestrial
I
like 98 UFO sightings
complete prosaic explanation
completely explainable
people misperceiving
things optical illusions
Sift minority UFO
reports interesting
majority
sort people
seeing international space station
What in
look explanation
rule one
Its
skepticism lot ways
If cant debunk it
definition its UFO
So its thing I
lot people
kind mistake
A UFO isnt unidentif UAP
its unidentified flying object
unexplained aerial phenomenon
Its thats
unidentified unexplained
youve
power explain it
Does mean its necessarily aliens
 I know I want be
I want contact planets
civilizations
Thats I want be
I think its ridiculous think
theres life there
 Theres idea
fermi paradox
like sort
statement astronomy
like everyone
Where aliens
theres
stars
host life forth
Classic argument UFOs alien
its too stars far away
It takes energy
star system
So that
Why that
How possibly
time
its true
Stars far away
Itd voyager
furthest thing
weve sent solar system
like 50000 years
leave solar system
The
space big
Its very very
very very very old
So took age
universe it
scaled calendar year
human history happened
60 seconds January 31st
Yes theres stars far away
itd long time
But time
So lets alien
civilization wanted spread
galaxy right
The way
send craft
neighboring star system
It there
It arrive
equivalent asteroid belt
whatever consume matter
maybe 3D print
dot probes send
way
different solar systems
And that
Now youd kinda snowball effect
million years
blanket
entire galaxy probes
its possible timescale
much
age galaxy

10 billion years old
Is kinda crazy theyre
driving spaceship
Zeta Reticuli Monday
hover Billy Bobs farm
Sure is
But its ludicrous
probes
couldve passed solar system
ya know waves traffic kind
colonization scenario
solar system
They hiding
asteroid belt
Kuiper belt edge
solar system wherever
maybe are
periodically send probes
observe earth
And
physics astronomy
astrobiology
completely reasonable thing
speculate
its completely possible
 When I years old
mom disclosure me
Now wasnt family secret
We knew mom worked
Howard Hughes
private personal secretaries
I five reason
mom got talkative told
she story
shed gone through
That working Hughes
took this
middle nowhere said
great American desert
She little security
bunker shack
way it shack
outta concrete
kind low slung ground
looked like nothing
She said wondered
taking
looked like maybe
kept tools ya know
machinery something
But opened doors
Everythings locked secured
There elevator
So got elevator couple
security guys
thought gonna
couple floors
But kept going down
And said kept
going
bit speed
felt butterflies stomach
finally stopped moving
said doors opened
little
city desert
She said one
little cafes places
food movie theaters
bowling alley
talked funny
cafe
yellow umbrellas
little tables
like French cafe
She kick outta fact
umbrellas cave
But apparently
people feel comfortable
surroundings
My mom said lot German
rocket scientists work there
Now I tried I ask mom
guys working there
She answer question
I dont know
I idea
In investigations guy
RAF pilot
mom secretary
Hughes told story
I heard friend his
She detailed
talked lab
She said Howard Hughes lab
They little cat walk
went

working there
It elaborate set up
It like
James Bond real
 I I
fascinated
question
life universe
I grew science fiction
Basically young
imagination kinda got captured
idea life
universe
it happen
contact
 The time I
heard talk
kind general
well were alone
Were universe
Theres stars planets
its impossible
So didnt
learned exotic
There incident cousins
visiting aunt brought
copy look magazine
Betty Barney hill
story cover
While aunt
skeptical Betty
Barney hill case
ya know saying
happen
wouldnt everybody
seen this
ya know space ship coming down
Wouldnt air force known it
Blah blah blah
My mom said her
from I know Ive learned
this
actually happened
We arent
government knows this
My aunt point
said oh well crazy
Its like bad science fiction film
It says stuck
needle naval
That time I
heard mom that
ya know real thing
UFOs real phenomena
it
 When I little
I thought I
visited monsters devils
I little kid
The like frozen place thing
bed lifting ground
things room moving weird sounds
footsteps things like that
Being frozen place I
specific memories
things like bed
lifted ground
actually tilted sort
slide end
bed kinda thing
Because Id
UFOs things like that
I started thinking thats was
Little bit later on jump
forward 90s bit
Ya know theres thing
called Internet now
I reading news
group UFO abductions
cause I kinda feeling
like
going on I pretty
convinced time
And then I
thing called sleep paralysis
essentially
sleep states
Your body shut
mind moving
Your eyes open
giving sensation
frozen place
And hallucinating
youre it
So lot people
report hearing footsteps
seeing shadows room
activity outside peripheral
outside vision
Turns Ive
chronically entire life
isnt common
thats I experiencing
That feed directly
UFOs
Ive talked people
genuine abduction situations
Thats I experiencing
A lot people think
theyre abducted
turns sleep paralysis
And I think people
maybe abducted
tells
its sleep paralysis
its not
Its kind gray area
But fit
interest got deep
cause I wanted research
I figured
condition was
 So happened 2017
I taking astronomy
local community college
We observing
moon long time
mapping craters forth
So I trying
telescope trained
Orion nebula then
I heard group people me
group different telescope
freaking object sky
Theyre going like holy
shit thing
So ya know I like okay ya know
moon Orion
nebula gonna
billion years
Im gonna plenty
chances look those
This thing
second
I better is
I walk theyre pointing
Im standing was
vshaped object
It gunmetal black
big
circular white lights
arm V
Sort like seen 1997
Phoenix lights incident
know
drifting
really slowly
One witnesses
said looked like going
like 15 miles hour
Really low really really low
It started maybe
level tree tops
got
1000 feet I say
It pretty big night sky
I comparable
youve seen moon
It kept going kept
going kept going
then 20ish seconds
kinda got point so
account
diverges witnesses
I remember seeing
little bit different
people there
What I distinctly remembered
got point stopped
looked like faded
rest sky
The best way I
like borders
edges V
shaped craft sharp
distinct
kinda like borders
looked like getting
fuzzier fuzzier structure
kinda faded rest sky
Thats I remember
Now witnesses only
witnesses
remember differently
They remember seeing trail
couldnt anymore
So didnt cloaking
What Ill
people
gonna remember event way
So I car crash
Ill red Honda

orange Lamborghini
thats extreme example
remem
Details remembered
eyewitness account
gonna differ certain ways
But agreed there
We agreed happened
There people
So I like okay well
I saw weird
didnt video
Im kind annoyed that ya know
Especially scientific sort person
I like evidence things
So I said myself okay
I want investigate this
I wanna figure I saw
And I wanna I
it
 The way I
MUFON field investigator
mom passed away
I started veraciously
reading literature there
Ya know before mom alive

chance
golden ticket finally ya know
tell outright everything
Theres chance now
I kept reading watching shows
finally realized ya
know Im better
I before
Ya know I dont know believe
whats true whats bogus what
Around 2014 15 hangar 1 TV came
MUFON produced UFO
cut
there
It ya know case files
watching show I finally decided
I wanna this
I wanna investigate cases
way Im
reading somebody elses
ya know investigation did
Im questioning
veracity reports
Its feet ground ya know
And its it
But I state
director Jeff Krauss
time told me know
MUFON Com
itll
MUFON field investigator
Just click itll
information
Technically ya know
field investigators
handbook excellent document
Very professional
Based Dr J Allen
Hyneks work Vallee
Jacques Vallees work
And ya know 54 years
MUFON this
So I studied book
ya test
They background check stuff
dont want ya
know serial killers stuff
this yeah
The thing know
I field investigator
I started getting cases
You know case
come state director
assign cases
Thats I Ill
assign cases other
field investigator team
Once while Ill
like
it
I feel affinity while
Ill grab
cause ya know
youre UFO
investigator youre not right
So I current cases going
I share wealth now
 We dont
confirmed cases
I actually piece UFO
lab study it
But
lot evidence
affecting environment them
So evidence
bouncing radar waves
themselves
We evidence
having heat signatures
picked infrared camera
 Theres definitely great
military capabilities visitors
This things like
friend Robert Solas instance
commander
ICBM base Montana
1968
They UFO hovering right
missile base
The guy guard shack calling down
Everybody sees thing
Each missile went offline
Boom boom boom boom boom
And went online
Boom boom boom boom boom
Its like do
Yeah build things
You aim other
But youre control
finally
actually happens them
We final word that
I think power
It showing us I mean
repeating thing people hear
alien encounters ya know
nuclear weapons evil
destroy humanity
People left visions dreams
having contact experience
desolation like
book revelation ya know
But brought
people
told future
youre careful
I heard
interesting person recently
told Mars isnt
colonization
learning tool guys
This
dont change ways
 Were age data finally
released stuff
Tick tack stuff yeah
USS Nimitz those
You multiple eyewitnesses
Honestly thats new
Thats UFO
literature decades
The point now
difference
its talked lot
mainstream
So now NASA
openly getting involved
investigating UFOs
That announced
like weeks ago
 Well I know theres
string sightings
years military pilots
seeing strange objects
flying theyre
air visual
picked radar
The pilots picking
radar towers
bases picking well
Theres plenty audio
recordings pilots
talking forth
describing sightings
theyre seeing them
Seems like lot
taking place water
coasts
And theres theory aquatic UFOs
I interesting
militarys finally acknowledging
releasing it
 Best evidence Ive heard till now
I I harken
kind talks
tic tac incident
 As far tic tac
way government
I think very very
foot draggy it
I mean event happened 2004
It wasnt 2017
public knowledge
A video got theres

video
It wasnt supposed out
It went privately sly
pilots
ya know
videoed radar screen
flir video screen
seeing
And
craft thats things
impossible
do
 Yeah
visible means propulsion
weird
Really weird
I mean shouldnt
possible know
No visible means propulsion
able maneuvers
And able to I mean
think right
physics standpoint youre
fast moving thing thats going
thousands gs suddenly stopping
turned
paste ya know
youve
car suddenly stops
know inertia thing
You thrown
wall thing
really hard
Somehow thats
happening piloting
things pilot
I think likeliest version
extraterrestrial
hypothesis I know
machines probes
 So I think
government kind forced
acknowledge yes its thing
opened worms
 At point I think original footage
leaked
little later
military officially released it
Thats amazing step
Thats huge step compared
lets 60 70 years
no no its nothing
We dont know anything
We dont research stuff
Turns
researching along
Theyve keeping tabs
stuff day one
 And I think
afraid put
stuff public
youre putting enemies
Youre putting ya know
foreign nationals
self mind
So I theyre
foot draggy it
I didnt
want information there
its time
 I think tic tac sightings
huge step direction
getting disclosure
government saying
yes heres know
Heres weve got
file stuff
They bleed
little bit time
I think theres lot
theyre saying
I know theres lot
theyre saying
 Cases multiple sensors
picking things up
So its eyewitnesses
its sort things
designed monitor sky
Ya know cause thing delusion
hallucination cant
bounce radar waves
cant infrared camera
 Especially near air bases
nuclear weapons
sort
Sort high security areas
They tend lot more
traditionally near missile
silos things like that
Theres plenty
cases
strange lights
theres historical cases
having alarms things set
triggering launch sequences
Theres reports
military necessarily
NASA test rockets
test flights messed with
seeing lights seeing
things moving
launch site having
launch shut down
Oh didnt it
Well shutting off
Well ya know breaking
figure
lined
weird lights
sightings time
 Its difficult Id say
Its difficult the
physics have
thats makes
interesting right
So analogy I if
alien
interstellar origin
its kind like
level technology
need
I described
colonize galaxy
possible advanced
Advanced enough fact
I harken
Arthur C Clarkes old quote
any sufficiently advanced technology
is indistinguishable magic
It little bit like
magic sense that
ya know sent nuclear reactor
Victorian England

magic them ya know
Cause dont understand
That wouldve
Marie curie sort figured
radium figured ya know
wouldnt sense
One signifier
extraterrestrial technology
got star
doesnt sense us
It shouldnt sense us
 I mean yeah
I mean theres
stuff I dont necessarily
like talk
I dont like definitive answers
I like cases
Ive personally worked
I dont like talk

private citizens
said
hey talk
cant
When file report
box says
do wanna remain anonymous
Do want stuff quiet
care
Theres thing that
I assume dont care
I dont like that
oh lady specific town
on specific day saw thing
Because people
together
Theyll figure Mary Jane
lived ya know
Las Vegas shes a
Theyll figure
maybe person
doesnt want anybody know it
So I tend shy away
giving
ya know actual real
cases Ive worked personally
 Ya know theres different reasons
The subject stigmatized
stigmatized
standpoint
scientists
involved search life obviously
tell yeah
theres probably life
wouldnt spending
careers it right
But idea ya
know its difficult
interstellar travel hard
And aliens
come sort
hover
dudes farm Kentucky
abduct cattle
Or youve heard old
stereotype UFOs
You know it
So big it
I think thing UFOs
difficult thing
study scientific method
cant predict
UFO gonna up
So I wanted
observe star lets say
I train telescope
I know stars
gonna tomorrow
So I train telescope again
So I reproduce I find
UFOs dont know
ones gonna up
You cant set observation station
experiment
everything its not
its completely unpredictable
Its difficult sort
repeated tests
 This case
thats kind
interesting straight ahead UFO case
MUFON case number 95355
Kinda blows away I do ya know
touch main witness
Witness friends
weekend camping
fishing trip lake
silverwood near big bear
Driving rural area
witness observed
bright Amber light flying
silently low distance
The object noticed
object didnt
proper FAA lights it
witness pulled
truck shoulder
witnesses
got truck
They leaning
bumper truck
watching object slowly
approached position
As object approached
resolved object
witness described
black boomerang
wedgelike shape like giant pair
wraparound sunglasses
By way Ill mention
main witness
case aerospace engineer
working major aerospace company
All witnesses
hear low humming sound
We feel bones feet
It uncomfortable
The witnesss friend said sure
truck engine turned
heard UFOs cause
car electrical problems
cause electrical
burn out
And thats true
Weve seen case case
The witness states
object visible
decks facing
actually
backlit silhouettes
people possibly beings
standing walking louvered decks
visible giant window
looked like giant window
encased craft
Im guessing
kind force field
material dont or
dont know about
As object passed witness
panels
look electronic snow
like old television set
thats channels
And Ive heard cases
theres propulsion seen
looked like snow
youll television
The witness states
craft continued heading
its original trajectory
finally
lost sight
visual vanishing point
The witness
camping trip friends
worked lab technician
electroplating circuitry boards
exclusively
aerospace work
Guy sharp tack
No reason story up
Heres interview
He said Ive seen like
what witnessed Sunday
We saw it
My best friend passed away year
was well
He didnt want report
we know MUFON
sighting
But John recently passed
away freed
to finally
sighting report this
I dont know its
its theirs
but Im hoping help
because looked like
flying aircraft carrier
I interviewed witness
It says here know I
interviewed thoroughly
times months
A witness changed story
embellished said
What Ill I speak somebody
like case
main witness left
So Ill kinda cold person
repeat ya know
know somebodys
reading piece paper
theyre embellishing
making
theyre telling
memory
This guy
emotions
seen
amazing like that
He said we talking
about seeing
We excited scared
imagine
We columns deck deck
and upper deck
we humanoid
figures moving around
We saying things
like look guy
Is driving thing what
It looked like somebody
shining light
up like UFO
seen China
There similar
sighting seen
Beijing airport years ago
Everything
crackling
and I feel insides humming
Thinking now Im glad I
turned truck
As looking
craft
there boxes louvered
and shimmered like
road hot summer day
The boxes looked like TV
theres channels on
Black gray
craft
When I worked aircraft I
the worlds largest building
Everett Washington
I aircraft hangar
and fit there
The ceiling wouldve
collapsed structures
having removed fit in
The way I closed case was
I said witness point lucid
He diverted
original interview
statements
He recounted experience memory
stumbled
recounting sighting
recalling remembered incident
Witness worked
years technician
aerospace industry
having originally worked
electroplating components
grandfathers company
Considering witnesses
background aerospace
witnesses composure
levels emotion
describing sighting
methodical
interviews I conducted him
I believe witness describing
remembered event
explain
And I closed
unknown aerial vehicle UFO
Thats favorite UFO cases
Its abduction
beings possibly
ya know I wonder
was ya know
Could time travelers
Was future ya know
It kind human craft look it
Ya know aircraft carrier thing
I kinda that ya know
In illustration
But certainly I dont think its
now
Or is its secretive
 Ya know Ive
told time time
ya know this
involved
UFO research
You tend start having experiences
like somehow pop
radar somehow
are
They realize youre interested
youre poking around
poke eventually
I havent happen yet
Its little frightening
Depending degree
poking thats done
But I wanna experience myself
 If anybody there
youve affinity
things Ive talking
youd like yourself
its possible
Its pretty easy do
You apply yourself read book
test
start getting cases
mentor first
You know
mentorship program
kinda gets people
square join
know it
youre going cases
90 95 percentage
cases prosaic objects
people misidentified
But 10
percent I cant explain
thats keeps going
keeps
day day out
I dont foresee time life
I wont this
Ive got bug
I love too
 And thats kinda
point
MUFONs safe place
submit reports
You absolutely
anonymously want
You dont
personal information
dont want to
You check box says
this
Dont contact me
Im giving information
needs it
Absolutely free that
You know old saying
I want believe
Thats me
 I think thats
its end
It working ya know
Ive got team working
Ive got ya know
speaking engagements
I tell people
amazing
phenomena like magic
real ya know
And I love it
I love it
Theres way Ill this
