On rocks clouds

Lola Montez cursed me
She hated face father
l leave progeny
She
exhibited circus
King Bavarias mistress
When discord arises
guests shamed insulted
plunge depths darkness
fettered gloom
await vain
judgement
But remain
eternal feasts
tables gold
They stride peak peak
From yawning chasms breathe
sulphurous breath Titans
rising light clouds
like sacrificial smoke
The rulers
turn indulgent gaze
away families
avoid seeing descendants
mutely loved traits
forbears
Do know rape is
Or bastard son
Women angels wings
arent they
But dream such
Recite Iphigenia
When heavenly powers
assign mortal
life changes
prepare
changes joy sorrow
sorrow joy
deeply shattering experience
Then
near town
distant shore
help
moments distress
