protected fear
You men mafia
you Boss Passalacqua
 you
way wise just
 you preferred
bloody cutthroat laws
 condemn disrespects
protect condemning
 laws allow live
slaughter like beasts
Now Ive finished
For time I arrived here
were speaking face face
I know well now
expect you
And know
expect me
Because I remain here town
long necessary
 duty
end you
Until blow shotgun
 sends Paolino company
Isnt right Boss Passalacqua
You spoken harshly Judge
More harshly
spoken before
But spoken justly
My men I came today
listen words
 punish Paolinos killer
 deliver justice swiftly
way
But I thinking
son I listening
 thought
proud hear speak like this
I tell friends time
arrived return law again
Perhaps killed Paolino
small way man shot him
And I deliver Sir
tried laws State
Go on
Francesco Messana
arrest law
In law
