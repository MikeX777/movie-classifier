Wherever ass ends
Down diner
Dont need tell
Why Im
They know diner
And single bite
Is little bit life
So days endure
In row
Its little things
That afloat
Thank God oasis
The people places
That save serve
As reminder
Thats come
To diner
At diner
Ah
Ordered I
like My days
Everything
Its place timing
Ive
Who fits right
But I
Organizing condiments
Down diner
Im exponentially wiser
Down diner
Whatever
Theres room bar
Every day begin
Take seat settle
With rest
Were
Trying
When gets hard
This small town
Is
Its heartbeat
The center
The lifeline enter
 Its heartbeat
 The heartbeat
 Center
 The center
 The lifeline enter
 The lifeline enter
Every day got
Bring
Share love
Its rest
Were
Down diner
Ah
