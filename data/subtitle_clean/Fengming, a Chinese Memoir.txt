Well I guess Ill

It liberation colleges
Lanzhou accepting students
I trouble getting Lanzhou
University department foreign languages
English major
Id English classes
All high school
Id dreamed going college
Id good student
I figured I went college
I use knowledge
contribution society
So I took entrance exam passed
accepted Lanzhou University
Then August 26 1949
Lanzhou liberated
When PLA troops entered city
turned greet them
Not long that I went visit
Lanzhou University friends
The PLA there
passing revolutionary songbooks
songs like You Beacon
The East Red
It didnt long
learn songs heart
We felt liberated like skies
blue changed
Suddenly going college
pointless boring
Joining Revolution
way go
I gave college
At time Gansu
Daily recruiting staff
I decent writer high school
journalists editors
Gansu Daily said best
I figured Id better throw
Revolution start serving people
I gave college applied
job paper instead
The hiring process simple
All wanted
brief background statement
Of course seventeen I didnt
background write about
I wrote family I wanted
job hopes Revolution
They hired straight away
start revolutionary career
I remember I wore
cheongsam interview
I got hired issued
grey uniform else
Back then uniforms came job
I felt proud wearing uniform
like real revolutionary
In May 1957 I got attend
national agricultural exhibition Beijing
papers sent representatives I
chosen represent Gansu Farm Report
sent Beijing
deputy director Gansu Daily
At time werent
opportunities Beijing
attend big
agricultural exhibition
I felt lucky chosen
No paper got go
Id good work
secong section
kind reward
encouragement sorts
On May 1 papers announced new
directive Central Committee
That start anti
rightist rectification campaign
At time gave thought We
busy sightseeing visiting people
After all time Beijing I
went famous sights friend
Forbidden City
Summer Palace etcetera
I met
old classmates Lanzhou
I remember surprised
lychees markets
You couldnt buy Lanzhou
Beijing everywhere
Back then lychees cost
5 6 jiao 6 cents pound
Right left Beijing
The Peoples Daily published major
antirightist editorial Why This Happening
again I didnt pay mind I
certainly didnt think affect me
After that I returned
post Lanzhou
But editorial signaled start
antirightist struggle come
At point Party
mobilizing soliciting viewpoints
I naive then Since
Party leaders soliciting opinions
I considered activist
I wrote big character posters
spoke small
minority cadres erred
I didnt thought
While I Beijing husband Wang
Jingchao written essays
request
leadership course
At time Chairman Mao calling
The Peoples Daily publish essays
change tenor paper
In days The Cultural
Reporter vanguard
The Peoples Daily
lagging behind
When center called essays
course Gansu Daily followed suit
They mobilized staffers
talented progressive ones
write essays new campaign
After that husband wrote
essay A Brief Critique Bureaucracy
It created
sensation paper
That time Chairman
Mao gave famous speech
contradictions people Feb
later came
bureaucratic excess
Whether culture academic discourse
let schools thought contend
flowers bloom Dont
stifle people bureaucracy
In essay husband
responding Chairman Maos call
It incisive essay frank
powerfully worded critique
He felt bureaucracy
stifling people
bureaucrats arrogant
position alienated talent
That hit nerve
caused stir
A lot people expressed support
After that wrote second essay
I think called like
On ThriceEstranged Cadres
It cadres estranged
Party Leadership Masses
He pointed cadres
unwilling accept constructive criticism
Of course essay didnt
endear leadership
Certain cadres toadies began
distance Jingchao
masses followed suit
By point leaders
unhappy husband
Theyd branded writings poisonous
weeds unaware this
Then wrote essay
I think called
On Conflicted Morale
That essay published
At time Wang Jingchao
Gansu Dailys leading writers
Originally leadership thought
highly writing
He studied Xians
Northwest University
When Xian liberated joined
revolutionary unit Gansu
marched Lanzhou
In September 1949
helped establish Gansu Daily
group alumnae
Northwest University
He core group

Whenever important

But antirightist struggle
essay branded subversive
At time I

While I Wushan Id

As evil mastermind
We tried imagine

That night hardly slept wink He

The morning

When I got back colleagues handed
work didnt speak me
That afternoon I
working second floor

Though I wasnt allowed attend
I hear shouting him
trying confess
Why deep hatred
party society He couldnt explain
People cursed him saying You
meet God granite head
When shouted shit
dared shout shit
He didnt admit
party socialism
But situation like that
 couldnt word edgewise
You couldnt defend yourself
Struggle sessions supposed
dialogue dialogue onesided
It went like week
Then came big
character posters me
They wanted clear class
distinction denounce husband
They wrote things like Why
speak march lock step
They wanted clear
class distinction I
In heart I knew innocent
How I denounce husband
A week later started holding
struggle sessions me
I need use bathroom
Shall continue
A week later struggle sessions started
I considered minor rightist
But day I joined revolution
Id toed party line
Whatever leaders said do I did
I conscientious obedient
worked hard job
So sessions
small 20 people
colleagues
But already Id branded rightist
I stand sat
stand hands side
I listen
criticism slur
It painful experience
I wanted die shame Hadnt I
forsaken college Revolution
Hadnt I served Revolution well
From 1949 1957 Id earned
praise work
How I possibly antiParty
Standing there I wanted die
Suddenly I class enemy
Someone criticize denounce
They accused
collaborating Jingchaos essays
asked possible
I Beijing time
Then said
talked home
plotted
going say
They wanted confess secrets tell
talked home
But werent secrets confess
Our union
based shared love
Socialism Party
We outstanding jobs
Hed dropped college
join Revolution
Id sacrificed college dreams
In days
Lanzhou University
A lot classmates didnt in
I did
I gave Revolution
Id devoted life Party
And branded class enemy
It I bear
How I face anyone
Better die living like that
But I wasnt allowed talk
struggle meetings
I couldnt even
couldnt try defend myself
I listen twisted facts
sorts horrible accusations
When I got home night I upset
I told Jingchao struggle session
Hed going weeks
knew exactly felt
I remember hugged said
How struggle
little Jiao Jiao little sweetheart
We young then
He sorts pet names me
hed called before
It struggle sessions
began started calling that
Of course home
cruel world powerless
He couldnt speak out
How comfort me
There say
At time I figured
I better dead
Life hard
The thing stopped suicide
thought selfish
If I died Jingchao left alone
We small children I
couldnt leave raise alone
What happen children I died
What mother
I couldnt leave mother
So I felt like dying
I thought husband children
I couldnt leave husband
children face hardship alone
After came struggle sessions
They usually took place afternoon
In mornings I sat office
morning office
interrogations
I decided I want die
Forget it lifes painful
I thought Id die
In valley death maybe
pain disappear
I didnt stop think
family I couldnt stand pain
So I left office went
pharmacy buy sleeping pills
Because Id insomnia
I didnt know pills buy
When pharmacist
asked I needed
I told
times normal dosage
Then I went straight home
swallowed alonee pills
I took pills lay down
Leaving office I run
youngest son nursery
I remember crying
mama I ignored him
I didnt care
anymore son
In pain Id
mind I wanted die
So I went home swallowed
pills lay down
When I didnt come office
colleagues started worried
They came knocking dormitory
wanting know Id left office
Then saw packet pills
asked it
You see concern
people attempt suicide
I told nothing
office
I didnt want go forced me
As turns out pills didnt work
They drowsy
days passed
Nobody Id done
Because Jingchao
considered major rightist
struggle sessions expanded
include media syndicate
At time syndicate included
print broadcast media
They started holding big
sessions auditorium
At time
hadnt appeared print
So meetings I tried stay
I wouldnt attract attention
Starting Jingchao called
major rightists onstage one
Then stand
stools strike poses
Thats called
it striking pose
After that started shouting
Wang Jingchaos wife there
So I got dragged
inconspicuous corner
stand
onstage others
And strike pose course
The sessions heated
But worst happened
I got called pose
There
sessions like that
Some involved syndicate
newspaper staffers
Of course Jingchao painted
mastermind black clique
They tried confess
dark plot secret scheme
After that things began escalate
I remember session
hed left office me
I came home smell pesticide
Our dorm infested bedbugs
wed gotten bottle
66 Powder kill them
I remember coming home
bottle missing bed
house reeking pesticide
I scared hed taken it
I said You took it didnt you
I kept crying asking
You took it didnt you You took it
He admitted hed thought
taking it decided to
He said lot pressure
confess antigovernment plot
But confess
charges fabricated begin with
When saw wouldnt confess
struggle session turned violent
Thats started feeling
like maybe hed better dead
Thats thought suicide
When I realized hadnt
taken poison all
I cant tell relieved I was
That night didnt eat bite
didnt turn lights on
We lay bed together
Jingchao cried shoulder
In seven
years marriage
hed cried me
It time I saw cry
He told wouldnt confess
plot didnt exist
The black clique fabrication
secret plot so
Both miserable then
We felt like
wed better dead
couldnt bear leave
face pain alone
In midst aloneat hardship
love sweeter ever
It sweeter
wed known
During time
love blossom
beautiful
It precious
belonged us
It share
understand
That night bittersweet
moment joy midst sorrow
Eventually antirightist struggle
ended way leaders intended
The black clique course
guilty
membership roster public
Innocent not confess
Everyone black clique
signed confessions dossiers
Like not sign
You choice
Once signed fate sealed
Finally late April 1958
sentences handed down
Of 7 8 rightists Gansu Daily
man named Chen Shuren
He didnt live dormitory us
He dead
pronounced guilty
I heard committed suicide taking
overdose sleeping pills
They called proof guilt said
killed escape punishment
One day didnt
struggle session went house
Thats family
killed himself
But struggle sessions didnt end
dead
Theyd claim killed
escape justice
Anyway seven
paper sentenced rightists
They kept adding people list
Five said belong
black clique
Most Id talked to
got dragged it
Because I Wang
Jingchaos stinking wife
I guess gang
When verdicts handed down
husband named
Gansu Dailys biggest rightist
They said vile attitude
hed dared curse accusers
That proof enough I guess
He branded ultra
rightist fired job
sentenced Jiabiangou
labor camp Jiuquan
I accused
having bad attitude
punishment severe
I demoted pay grades
grade 23 grade 18
Because children then
kindergarten
nursery school
Jingchao asked boss I
serve sentence Lanzhou
look children
My mother ill years
relied support her
With health problems
couldnt possibly
look children own
Jingchaos boss refused request
said options
Jingchao
hometown work
way
support himself
He didnt Jiabiangou labor
camp But advantage labor reform
rid
rightist label sooner later
accepted society
We naive then
We believed sooner
politically rehabilitated better
Jingchao hadnt
hometown years
To loss face
set political
rehabilitation indefinitely
Thats simple were
If Id known end
Id let camp
 death sentence
But naively believed Party
promises rehabilitation
So 28th 29th April
boarded train together
train
separate labor camps
We didnt arrive Jiuquan
afternoon day
When close
Jiuquan idea He said
Lets talk cadre
took personnel department
He thought going Anxi check
me Mainly worried me
In twenties I frail
The girls paper tease
strong wind blow over
Although family wasnt wealthy
eat
And joining Revolution
course I I needed
Unlike Jingchao Id
weather hardships
Therefore worried me He
said wants send Anxi Mountain
After sending Anxi return
Jiuquan Jiabiangou Dry Gulch
But cadre wouldnt allow it
Since Jingchao lost job
couldnt afford extra train fare
So didnt it He
got train Jiuquan
There
people traveling us
They
rightists families
Because couple
I think felt sorry us
When got station helped
Jingchao unload bags boxes
shook hand goodbye
I goodbye
Then left station
continued journey
When I saw standing
platform heart just
 he looked sad pale
He couldnt wave goodbye
I distraught I knew
long time
saw again
But I think moment
he afraid
himself
I world heaven sun
And suddenly
sun gone away
I think afraid losing forever
I think afraid
lost me hed fall abyss
As me
I felt like Id struck lightning
The future bleak
How I alone
At
struggle sessions Lanzhou
sweet whispers
things outside world
wouldnt allow say
But far apart
I confide in
Who I pour troubles to
It like wed hit rock bottom
Wed lost freedom
lost right confide
people loved
Thats thats I remember thinking
left continued
camp Anxi
The No 10 Collective Farm
dozen miles Anxi township
wasnt connected rail
We lot luggage
stayed local inn
You know saying Weep ye
travel Jiayu Pass
Wed traveled far it I
naive think didnt apply me
I figured place
ticket rightist
If I worked hard years
Party rehabilitate me
Id welcomed
arms masses
Then I new start
I imagined hardships lay ahead
A days later loaded
luggage bags pull tractor
It long trip miles
set right breakfast
The farm nice They
held little welcoming ceremony
It brand new collective started
demobilized soldiers local farmers
I remember welcomed
our comrades erred
We bit surprised hear that
After branded class enemies
people refused comrade
That painful things
me called comrade anymore
So I moved hear camp
director welcome comrades
He said long
worked best ability
treated
else distinctions
I remember thinking I heard wrong
Because Lanzhou
longer comrades class enemies
But I guess antirightist struggle
hadnt reached far yet
To people here
comrades mistakes
After that called comrade
For years
years I guess
we work hard
Thats society worked then
If political mistake
offended Party way
work hard
try reform yourself
You figured little hard work
good stronger
Those years ate
fill Hunger wasnt problem yet
And rightist special skills
teaching accounting
leaders effort
transferred job
utilize skills
Although work physically tiring
didnt deal
political discrimination
All all I spent fairly
happy years farm
In late summer 1959
National Day celebrations
rightists
farm rehabilitated
That glimmer hope us
But late 1959 decided transfer
rightists No 4 Work Farm
That troubles began
Because No 4 Work Farm
mainly exconvicts
cadres wardens stricter
They clear class distinctions
To them class enemy
From moment arrived
eat
The cadres ate white flour
We got bran
I didnt want transfer I
afraid political recriminations
At No 10 farm didnt
guard
We laugh talk worked
But No 4 workers
male exconvicts scared me
The sexes segregated
wardens didnt want trouble
I told foreman I
didnt want transfer
I thought I making real
progress labor reeducation
I didnt think mind
After all isnt came
But reported farm director
Xu Fulian female
rightist transferred
One day I ran her told me
Youd better hurry up I heard Director Li say
if lady rightists dont transfer soon
Ill trussed bound
brought ropes 
Youve talked camp
survivors know
truss tight
youd paralyzed life
I terrified I asked
transfer minute I got camp
I transferred women
Shi Tianai Wang Guifang
It easier working fields
lot political pressure
I wasnt allowed talk colleagues
werent allowed talk me
No said word me
I accounting machine
You worked worked

Then gave little bottle it
At time I knew

No roommates saw

accounting section chief

Of course I admit it
Then said seen it
He kept saying thinking

Now guy think owe him

It awful things said
Sure I took bottle cod liver oil
But I drawing salary wasnt I
entitled medical care Who

But sound like
Id compromised office
gave big long lecture
remember like yesterday

Later I started doubt

After transfer I learned
food shortages Dry Gulch Farm
Of course I anxious
letter husband
About weeks later I got letter
It page long
It didnt much
busy digging irrigation ditches
He said got food subsidy
yuan month
But allowed

disappointed
Because Chairman Mao promised
rightists wouldnt
stripped civil liberties
Before left Lanzhou promised
write possible
Letters
means communication
I tell censors read
letter wasnt sealed

privacy violated
How write
personal letters now
My communication wasnt censored
I wrote nice long letter
telling job
roommates came from
After I wrote letters month
Both I signed
letters With kisses
When away interviews
wrote long letters week
But I tell right away

All wrote work daily life
The letters I wrote longer
I signed with kisses
I figured censors
wanted censor that let them
In second letter wrote
Today I got paid l
bought pound biscuits

I think I lost weight
My glasses dont fit like to
When I read letter I knew
sure starving
Hed gone hungry child

But now rightist choice
He couldnt afford break rules
He sit starve
Of course broke heart

But wasnt I do
After salary cut I
earning 5824 yuan month
Of I sent 35 kids Lanzhou

buy biscuits
I figured help little
Most letters I got
werent sealed
point reminding
seal letters
censors it
arrived unsealed
The censors knew letters
worth weight gold us
them better dogs
After reading letters
couldnt bothered reseall them
So didnt want
write personal
I write life
Jingchao couldnt
tell suffering
Anything wrote
could him
Of course knew that
When rations cut 15 pounds
grain month I wrote it
I knew situation worse
mine important news
I thought hed want know
At point
stay alive
Soon I stopped writing letters
stopped writing back
After rations cut I worked
accounting office day
cadre named Zhang told I didnt
come work following day
He said hospital ward
patients
needed help stoking fires
kangs platform beds
It makeshift hospital housed
building camp
So day breakfast
walked camp
I brought tin gasoline
case l trouble lighting fires
When I walked hospital
saw rooms
kangs full
The blankets filthy
place crowded patients
I knew Id need kindling
I took scythe went outside
cut wild grass

Of course I wasnt happy
sent work hospital
Id eaten breakfast I
knew Id hungry soon
But I job do I it
Al patients men workers
graduated labor reform
They knew camp rules

concentrated work
stoking fires beneath kangs
That day young
men working there patients
workers called patch
windows newspapers
They looked better fed others
remember offered
flour paste hed using
Do want eat some
Thats asked me
said no Even I starving
I wasnt going eat filthy paste
On second day

I working
remember hearing voice
ask What here
It Ouyang Xia rightist
foreman camp
I told Id sent
light stoke fires
Then said Ill forget
Right now were
struggling survival
He stood moment left
Those words important me
important
Ours life death struggle
Id dared
think it it
Back then struggling
factionalism struggling Party
But struggling survival
dare thing
But I thought it
I realized right
This struggle survival
Our lives danger
way living
way fight survival
I couldnt stop thinking
words I afraid
loud
That morning I finished
work hospital
went home
wait meal
All starving
But way I tell
roommates Id heard
If complained hunger
criticizing Partys grain policy
add crimes
To struggling
survival practically treason
But heart I knew right
One night roommates
Igot talking
bad things gotten
We trying think
way feed ourselves
At time I worried
rightist status
l said stupid
wanting break rules
set labor reform
As soon I said that
women started scolding me
Tianai said How worry
political status time like this
With people dying thats
thing cadres minds
In end agreed
We drastic
wanted survive
We knew Wang Guifangs
husband escaped starvation
running away camp
hiding Xinjiang
She said ought
heads together
In end decided
stealing best option
I hardly bring
word
To cadres wardens camp
stealing worst offence
commit party
Taking ones share
meals bad enough
stealing far far worse
But steal wanted live
Right accounting office
big pile cottonseed
The girls suggested l
night try steal some
Since I worked accounting
office think strange
saw hanging back
At wasnt bad stealing
grain violating rationing policy
This little cottonseed right
Since I it
night I took big handkerchief
snuck steal cottonseed
But I got there I saw
pile covered big tarp
Finally I managed loose corner
started stuffingseed
handkerchief
Suddenly I heard
shout Hey whos there
But I turned around
saw cadre I knew
No 4 camp
Wed acted play together
As soon I saw him
I knew wouldnt tun in
I kept stealing seed
went dorm
Of course told me
He rightist too
We ate cottonseed didnt
difference
The seeds small up
werent nutritious enough
We decided
eat
Shi Tianai said scavenging
seeds wasnt going feed us
Shed October
cut rations 24 pounds
But didnt
nutrition soon wed collapse
She said
steal flour mill
Shed stuff little bit pocket
then got dorm
mix hot water drink it
She said lotbetter
cotton grass seeds
She suggested try
steal flour mil
It better nothing
All aware
high death toll camps
Id seen deaths hospital too
I told roommates it
Anyway Wang Guifang
Shi Tianai worked mil
agreed try
steal flour us
Of course wanted die
Survival mattered
Shi Tianai single mother
daughter raise
I didnt want die either
stay alive family
I didnt know
husband dead alive
I wanted chance
children parents again
tell Id falsely accused
If died speak us
No matter what survive
But managed
steal flour
going cook it
Shi Tian ai said good
making boiled dumplings
She dumplings
wiser
But boil them
Then suggested pancakes
But dorm close
salaried workers quarters
afraid theymight
smell baking them
We talked making noodles
walked
cooking them
wed caught redhanded
If got caught roommates
fired mill
Theyd lose jobs
wed lose access flour
We racked brains thinking
turn raw flour
edible
Finally solution
One day I came home
saw Wang Guifang
stolen flour mill
That night brought home
soup canteen
mixed stolen flour
soup hot
drank like that
From on thats did
Steal bit flour there
much
case noticed
Wed wait
dorm
mix hot water drink it
That trick
We relieved
At time I working
hospital morning
One day I working
l broke cold sweat
I knew sign collapse
When I got home I told
Xu Fulian happened
The doctor labor camp
worker gave medicine
But didnt work I
asked do
She said cadres
salaried workers
stopped showing work
If werent working
we
She suggested day of
So day
Xu Fulian I stayed home
We hadnt day
got there exhausted
Our roommates asked cadres
day off
stayed bed rested
Xu Fulian watch
woke 930
line food
The salaried workers got
15 pounds rations month
hadnt worked weeks
We wait line ourselves
If asked else
half food gone
time got you
When people starving
things like that
afraid serve
me I got decent portion
Back then kept
careful eye ladle
You wanted sure
got fair share
serving size
gruel wasnt
watery
Of course said anything
sure paid close attention
When I got line
I happy gave me
Xu Fulian thought gruel
watery mine
couldnt complain
We went dorm
waited return
They came little raw flour
split us
After eating felt lot better
At little raw
flour supplement diets
We fortunate
roommates worked mill
Not lucky
That little bit stolen flour
probably saved lives
Then in
I think December 20 1960
raised rations
15 24 pounds month
We werent aware theyd
decided disband worst camps
The cadres northwest region
held big meeting Lanzhou
started disbanding Dry Gulch
husbands camp December 1960
By Dry Gulch disaster area
We deaths camp
nearly Dry Gulch
But December 20 monthly
rations 24 pounds
Since coming No 4 Id given
hope visiting husband camp
The atmosphere No 4
lot stricter No 10
I figured cadres
turn request
Another problem money
Dry Gulch far away
couldnt afford train ticket
Besides I hated rightist
freedom movement
They wouldnt let leave
Even did I
possibly help him money
Then late December
I got letter father
He said wished help
Jingchao kids
small parents
old trip
He suggested I try save him
I lot closer
I showed letter Party
Secretary man named Liu Zhigui
He gave permission leave
right away surprised me
By time cadres aware
crisis camps I wasnt
My parents werent party members
didnt know either
I went straight home
wrote letter parents
telling I going
save husband
needed money trip
I asked Du Bo loan
However
demoted time
But salary 5824 yuan
Another thing is
cook didnt family burden
As soon I got permission leave
I asked loan
lent 100 yuan
asked loan
lent 100 yuan
It snowed lot I left
I sit roof truck
The person got sit cab
wife canteen worker
There pecking order camp
wanted
good canteen workers
So I sat roof
coat wrapped me
A hours later got station
managed ticket right away
I got Clearwater Station
I think oneminute stop
I bag food money
grain coupons Jingchao
And clothes case
I Lanzhou
case Jingchao wasnt there
Clearwater Station small
didnt platform
It was dark
hopped train bags
asked directions camp
shack near station
The man pointed
little path snow
said I followed west
Id eventually reach camp
By time completely dark
The path covered snow
I person around
From time I left station
I didnt meet soul
walked
miles snow
My luggage heavy
I think
Jingchao waiting me
waiting save him
Maybe breath
I couldnt waste minute
I walking
Finally I reached stand date trees
path started disappear
I set luggage down
looked left right
All I miles
snow
person sight
Years later I met Gao Jiye
camp survivor
He wrote book called
Flight escape
He said I lucky
run wolves night
But night wolves
thing mind
I save husband
He waiting
If I reach time
breath left body
I knew I save him
So didnt think
wolves that
I focused saving husband
Remember book
Gaos mentor eaten wolves
Gao said I lucky
met wolves
It occurred me
At camp I knew man
named Feng Shiwei
Once went town buy
supplies got chased wolves
They followed ox cart
way pacing him
speeding did
slowing did
Id heard story I wasnt
thinking survival
All think Jingchao
waiting save him
So I lost sight
road I looked
finally saw
looked like road
I picked bags kept walking
A later I ran
man road
asked knew way camp
He said See lights
ahead Thats camp office
I concentrating hard road
I hadnt noticed lights
Ill bet man came camp
looking family member
Maybe hadnt them
way home
I doubt cadre
cadres didnt night patrols
I followed lights office
When I walked in I saw
men sitting inside
I told I
looking Wang Jingchao
They took ledger
started flipping pages
I figured camp huge
look big

Finally page
looking for

That hit like thunderbolt
Here I thought I rescuing
husband dead
I sat wooden bench
There wasnt furniture
At I shock
I couldnt cry
Then hit me
husband gone

They didnt leave world willingly
The world rejected them
Now another darker place

Even uncles considered

When I got sent down paper assumed

So I warm bed sleep night
After dinner I went straight bed
The morning

But farmers didnt mind
brigade leader
He type Cultural
Revolution excuse bully
But women I worked
friendly curious
asked sorts questions
At I worked brigade leader
women told
loaded baskets heavily
They said I joined them
work lighter
It wasnt like labor farm
work quickly couldnt stand around
The farmers said Youre working
state nowtake easy
Thats then No matter hard
worked earned points
So work easier
labor camp
The brigade leader quit
work wanted to
men play Go
clods dirt homemade board
He putting working
Since second strike I figured
wasnt chance rehabilitation
The farmers commune
treated like outsider
I remember day goofing off
saw boss coming
They said Careful boss here
Dont let working
They knew didnt mater
slacked of I got caught
Id seriously punished
The farmers looked me
They treated like family
I remember right I arrived Mother
Wang told shouldnt treat

guest member family
The day I there I
didnt know light stove
helped light it
They kind
Every day Mother Wang left
pile kindling door
They called sister
sure
I warm bed sleep in
After years cold labor camps
like Id gone heaven
like Id personal freedom
But life hard farmers
They didnt wells
They relied stored rainwater
If wanted wash face
youd splash bit water
face it
But exception me
let use wash basin
The family took good care me
But month
things got difficult
After I finished ration flour
I grind wheat myself
There werent machines
donkeys turn millstone
The donkeys commune property
turn millstone hand
The help
winnow prepare wheat
grind
flour yourself
The work feel faint
I wasnt it
It wasnt strenuous work
reason dizzy
One day I broke
sweat working
Mother Wang came
asked wrong
She said Why sweating
You dont look good
So I told I felt faint
I dont know why
grinding dizzy
She told sit down
finished job herself
The work labor camp
hard I got it
This lighter work
reason I couldnt handle it
worried
I going do
I couldnt grind little
wheat feeling faint
But family rescued again
Mother Wang knew family
mountain owned donkey
There donkeys team
borrowed farmers mountain
I spoke kindly lent us
Even I couldnt work
family way help me
After that I grind
wheat hand again
The year I arrived Huining lot
rain harvest good
young healthy then
able work lot
managed earn grain year
second year
But year
droughts food shortages
In Huining farmers didnt
harvest wheat sickles
They pulled roots
I learned cut wheat farm
pulling hand difficult
And causes blisters
Mother Wang middlelower level farmer doesnt
work fields She household chores instead
Mother Wang took look
blistered hands said
How going work
tomorrow hands
When I told I
knew use sickle
said Why didnt so
Weve got sickle borrow
The wheat low
squat harvest it
But women
bound feet couldnt squat
Instead theyd kneel ground
pressure feet
Most women
homemade kneepads
Mother Wang
bound feet
lent kneepads sickle
It wasnt heavy work
like labor camp
And commune
were good me They treated
like person class enemy
Then came drought
wasnt eat
Times tough
Even dogs water drink
People let dogs night
drink river
The river water bitter people
barely water themselves
let dogs
The winter got
large ration potatoes

We stored cellar
potatoes handy
Even noodles ate

To day I cant eat potatoes
I got sick them
But year drought
peasants starving
got grain coupons sent home
It worse peasants
Even dogs died
The brigade leader
went hungry stole
While peasants dogs
starving death
Rumors fattening
pigs 40 bowls lard pigs
His kids got
easiest jobs commune
received work points
They steal grain
went hungry
By then class
struggle intensified
I think Lin Biao said
directive other
I cant remember number

urban residents countryside
I think thats was
I cant remember exactly
At rate people
evacuated Lanzhou countryside
Our brigade leader liked
lecture that
Once war breaks now
If ists dare activities

But 1972
Cultural Revolution

For fear family members

injustices theyd suffered
wouldnt let rest peace
After 1978 Central Committee Directive
No 55 rightists rehabilitated
cases overturned
According official figures
552 877 rightists
politically rehabilitated
That number accounts 9998
percent total accused
Only 96 people werent rehabilitated The
book Leftist Calamity confirms number
Nowadays people tell
5 6 left
actually 96
Dai Huangs book Nine Lives
cites number 96 people
But scope entire movement
greater reported
In end 9998 percent
rehabilitated innocent
I think remaining 02 percent
96 people left examples
repudiate
entire antirightist movement
But I believe
fully repudiated
And figure 550 000
includes recorded cases
Many went unrecorded
College students example
dealt harshly
Many students Lanzhou accused
rightists sent labor camps
Some alive
Our family wasnt persecuted
I knew lot people
suffered badly
I write truth it
Thats why I retired
1989 I started writing book
At I encountered lot
resistance sisters
Why write this asked
Why bother writing book
published
Some friends worried
experience painful relive
They didnt understand I want
dredge old memories
Why dredge past Wasnt
painful time
But thats exactly I
record period history
The fact Id lived
personally
reason write it
After all story
