HOW ABOUT THE BANK
NO SWEAT OF YOUR FACE
GOOD MORNING MR HARRISON
GOOD MORNING MR ADAMS
GOOD MORNING MR PALMER
WHAT DID YOU WANT TO DO
CHARLES
I WANTED TO BE A TEACHER
WHY DIDNT YOU
LOST MY WAY SOMEWHERE
I GUESS
FIRST A GIRL
A DECENT SUIT
THEN AFTER A WHILE
I GUESS WHAT I WANTED
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE
WAS A LITTLE PIECE
OF SECURITY
930 TO 400
3850 A WEEK
EVERY WEEK
SECURITY
WELL HOW IS
THE AGRICULTURAL PROJECT GOING
WE DONT KNOW
IF THE SEED WILL GROW
WHY NOT
THINGS ARE SO STRANGE 
NO BIRDS NO ANIMALS
SO MANY THINGS
I DONT UNDERSTAND
HOW DO YOU FEEL
FINE
I THINK ID BETTER SEE
HOW THE FARMERS ARE DOING
ISNT THAT A MISDIRECTION
OF ENERGY
WHY THIS RETURN
TO PRIMITIVENESS
THE SHELVES OF THE CITIES
ARE BURSTING WITH FOOD
A LIFETIME OF FOOD
MICHAEL DOESNT WANT
TO GO NEAR THE CITIES
DO YOU WANT
TO STAY HERE
I HAVE TO NOW
I MEAN AFTER YOUR CHILD
IS BORN
I THINK I WILL TRY
TO GET UP TOMORROW
OH THATS WONDERFUL ERIC
YOURE VERY SWEET
EVERYBODY COME ON
HURRY
COME ON
TAKE IT EASY
WHAT COULD IT BE
ITS GROWING AT LAST
SO
PRETTY GOOD
FOR CITY FOLKS HUH
CORN ON THE COB
I WAS A FOOL
A LONG TERRIBLE TRIP
TO REACH HERE
ENDLESS DAYS AT SEA
ALONE ALWAYS ALONE
NOW I HAVE FOUND
MY CIVILIZATION
AS LONG AS THINGS
KEEP GROWING
EVERYTHING WILL BE
ALL RIGHT
YES I KNOW
NATURE SO ARRANGES IT
THAT WHEN A WOMAN
IS IN YOUR CONDITION
CLOUDS ARE LIKE RAINBOWS
AND ALL THE WORLD
IS LIKE A CRADLE
HEY THEYRE ON
THEYRE ON
HOW WONDERFUL
MUSIC
IVE WANTED IT SO MUCH
WE FOUND 100 RECORDS
I WISH I COULD DANCE
ME YOU SIT
ILL DO IT FOR YOU
ITLL KEEP BURNING
THERES PLENTY OF GAS
IN THE GENERATOR
I KEEP THINKING
HOW I NEVER SAW THE LIGHTS
ALL MY LIFE IN THE CITY
AND I NEVER SAW THEM
Michael VERY NICE
Charles AND HERE I THOUGHT
YOU WERE SEWING BOOTIES
IT IS VERY NICE
THANK YOU
YOU HAVE DONE ENOUGH WORK
FOR ONE DAY
COME OUTSIDE AND TALK TO ME
ID LIKE TO FINISH
THIS SEWING
THAT CORN OUT OF THE CAN
WAS MIGHTY TASTY TONIGHT
THE BLESSING
OF OUR AGE 
THE AMERICAN
CANNING INDUSTRY
AND YET IT DEBASED
YOUR TASTE DOWN
TO THE LEVEL
OF BAKED BEANS AND HASH
I DIDNT NOTICE
ANY LEFTOVER BEANS
ON YOUR PLATE TONIGHT
WHEN IN ROME EAT SWILL
LIKE THE ROMANS
ID LIKE
TO GO PLACES TONIGHT
AND HAVE A BIG TIME 
ORDER A DOUBLEDECKER
HAMBURGER WITH ONIONS
AND A SIDE ORDER
OF FRENCH FRIES
AND A DOUBLE CHOCOLATE MALT
SPARE RIBS
BARBECUED SPARE RIBS 
I CAN SMELL THEM
I LIKE STRAWBERRIES
STRAWBERRIES AND CREAM
WHERE I LIVED
THE SMELL OF TRAFFIC 
FROM MORNING TO NIGHT
YOU COULD SMELL
THE TRAFFIC
TELEPHONE  I COULD HEAR
A TELEPHONE RINGING
A NEW YORK COP
EVEN A NEW YORK COP
BAWLING OUT A HACK DRIVER
WHERE I LIVED THE FAUCET
WAS ALWAYS DRIPPING
IF I COULD JUST
HEAR THAT DRIPPING
OF ALL THOSE THINGS
WHICH WOULD YOU LIKE
THE MOST
I DONT KNOW
KIDS RAISING THE DEVIL
AROUND THE SUPPER TABLE
I HARDLY THINK
THIS IS THE TIME
FOR NOSTALGIC SENTIMENTALITY
IVE BEEN GIVING
A GREAT DEAL OF THOUGHT
TO WHY WE ARE ALIVE
OF COURSE
THERES A DEFINITE
PRIMARY REASON
WHY HE AND YOU AND I
ESCAPED THE RADIATION
I WAS AT A TREMENDOUS HEIGHT
AND YOU TWO BEHIND METAL 
THE BANK VAULT
THE XRAY ROOM
AND YET WHAT ABOUT YOU
YOU HAD NO SUCH PROTECTION
AND WHAT ABOUT
THE OLD MAN WHO DIED
IN SPITE OF HAVING
THE SAME PROTECTION
AS THIS ONE HAD
THE ANSWER TO ME
IS OBVIOUS  IMMUNITY
SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE IS
SOMETHING WITHIN OUR BODIES
A CHEMISTRY WHICH GIVES US
SPECIAL IMMUNITY
TO THAT WHICH KILLED
THE OTHERS
I SEE THE DOUBTFUL LOOK
ON YOUR FACES
THEN MARK THIS
DURING THE MIDDLE AGES
WHEN THE BLACK PLAGUE
SWEPT ALL EUROPE
WHEN MEN DIED
BY THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
WHY DIDNT ALL MANKIND DIE
THE DEADLY ORGANISMS
WERE THERE
THERE WAS NO PROTECTION
AGAINST THEM
AND YET A SMALL PERCENTAGE
OF PEOPLE LIVED ON
AS WE HAVE LIVED
WITH THE REST
OF THE WORLD OF MEN
DROPPING DEAD AROUND THEM
THE ANSWER THEN IS IMMUNITY
TO THE ORGANISMS
AND THE ANSWER HERE TODAY
IS IMMUNITY
AGAINST THE RADIATIONS
IF WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE
THEN THERE ARE OTHERS
OF COURSE
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD
THERE WOULD BE OTHERS
WHOD HAVE OUR SORT
OF IMMUNITY
NOT MANY
ONLY A FEW PERHAPS
BUT VERY DEFINITELY EXISTING
AS WE ARE HERE
SOME WILL DIE FROM
THE LINGERING RADIATIONS
BUT A SMALL NUMBER WILL LIVE
AS WE HAVE LIVED
THAT GIVES YOU HOPE
DOESNT IT
YES
LOOK THATS JUST A THEORY
AND A THEORYS
JUST A BUNCH OF WORDS
SET FRONT TO BACK
BUT A THEORY BECOMES A FACT
WITH PROOF
AND THAT IS THE VERY REASON
WE SHOULD GO INTO THE CITIES
AND LOOK FOR THESE PEOPLE
WHO MIGHT BE ALIVE
WE WILL NEVER KNOW
WAITING HERE
SHE WILL NEVER KNOW
IF HER HUSBAND
IS DEAD OR ALIVE
TOMORROW WOULD BE
A GOOD DAY TO START
DONT YOU AGREE
SHES NOT WELL ENOUGH
TO TRAVEL
ANYWAY WERE SAFE HERE
WE DONT KNOW
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO US
IN THE CITIES
MICHAEL I WAS THINKING
WITH YOUR PRIMITIVE MIND
AND TIMIDITY
IN A FEW YEARS
YOULL BE SWINGING
FROM THE BRANCHES
OF THE TREES
FORTUNATELY I 
AND I BELIEVE I SPEAK
FOR ROSEANNE AS WELL 
IM NOT QUITE SATISFIED
WITH THIS RETURN TO NATURE
OF YOURS
NOT WHEN THE CITIES ARE OPEN
WAITING TREASURE CHESTS
EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD
IS THERE FOR US
EVERYTHING FOR THE TAKING
AND BEYOND THAT
WHAT OF THE OTHERS
WHO ARE ALIVE
I WANT TO GET THEM TOGETHER
IN ONE PLACE
WHY SO THEY CAN BEAT
THEIR HEADS ON THE GROUND
FOR KING ERIC I
THE MAN WHO CLIMBED
MOUNT EVEREST
MICHAEL I DO WANT TO GO
TO THE CITY
IF WE DRIVE CAREFULLY
ILL BE ALL RIGHT
BUT YOU WONT BE ALL RIGHT
DONT YOU UNDERSTAND
ITS THE CITIES THEMSELVES
WHERE THE BOMBS FELL THE
RADIATIONS ARE THICKEST
HE TALKS ABOUT IMMUNITY
HAVE YOU GOT IMMUNITY
TO DEAD PILED UP
LIKE CORDWOOD
WITH THE FLESH
OFF THEIR BONES
I WANT TO KNOW WHATS HAPPENED
OUT THERE TOO
BUT MIKES RIGHT
WE DONT KNOW
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN THERE
WE KNOW WERE ALL RIGHT HERE
WHO IN GODS NAME
ASKED YOU YOUR OPINION
BUT IM TALKING TO HER
AND IM TELLING YOU
TO SHUT UP
I HAVE HAD ENOUGH
OF THIS INTERFERENCE
WHERE HAVE I INTERFERED
WITH YOU
THAT IS THE QUESTION
YOUR VERY PRESENCE
IS DISTASTEFUL TO ME 
THAT I MUST EAT WITH YOU
SLEEP UNDER THE SAME ROOF
WITH YOU
NOW ITS OUT
NO IN THIS WORLD
YOU MUST FACE REALITY
IT IS A MISTAKE HE IS ALIVE
ALL RIGHT LET HIM
GO LIVE SOMEWHERE ELSE 
NOT WITH YOU NOT WITH ME
DO YOU HEAR ME
I WANT YOU OUT OF HERE NOW
DONT ERIC
AAH
ITS LIKE IT NEVER WAS BEFORE
AND GOD STEPPED OUT ON SPACE
AND HE LOOKED AROUND
AND SAID
IM LONELY
ILL MAKE ME A WORLD
AND GOD SMILED
AND THE LIGHT BROKE
AND THE DARKNESS ROLLED UP
ON ONE SIDE
AND THE LIGHT STOOD SHINING
ON THE OTHER
AND GOD SAID THATS GOOD
THEN GOD REACHED OUT
AND TOOK THE LIGHT
IN HIS HANDS
AND GOD ROLLED THE LIGHT
AROUND IN HIS HANDS
UNTIL HED MADE THE SUN
AND HE SET THAT SUN ABLAZING
IN THE HEAVENS
AND THE LIGHT THAT WAS LEFT
FROM MAKING THE SUN
GOD GATHERED IT
IN A SHINING BALL
AND FLUNG IT
AGAINST THE DARKNESS
SPANGLING THE NIGHT
WITH THE MOON AND THE STARS
THEN DOWN BETWEEN THE DARKNESS
AND THE LIGHT
HE HURLED THE WORLD
AND GOD SAID THATS GOOD
THEN THE GREEN GRASS SPROUTED
AND THE PINE TREE POINTED
HIS FINGER TO THE SKY
THE LAKES CUDDLED DOWN
TO THE HOLLOWS OF THE GROUND
AND THE RIVERS RAN DOWN
TO THE SEA
THEN UP
FROM THE BED OF THE RIVER
GOD SCOOPED THE CLAY
AND BY THE BANK OF THE RIVER
HE KNEELED HIM DOWN
AND THERE
THE GREAT GOD ALMIGHTY
WHO LIT THE SUN
AND FIXED IT IN THE SKY
WHO FLUNG THE STARS TO THE MOST
FAR CORNER OF THE NIGHT
WHO ROUNDED THE EARTH
IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS HAND 
THIS GREAT GOD
LIKE A MOTHER
BENDING OVER HER BABY
KNEELED DOWN IN THE DUST
TOILING OVER A LUMP OF CLAY
TILL HE HAD SHAPED IT
IN HIS OWN IMAGE
THEN INTO IT HE BLEW
THE BREATH OF LIFE
AND MAN BECAME A LIVING SOUL
AMEN
Michael HERE HE IS
HE
THANK YOU MICHAEL
I STILL THINK
YOU SHOULD BE IN BED
LISTEN MISTER
WHOS THE DOCTOR ON THIS CASE
THATS RIGHT DONT ARGUE
WITH A SPECIALIST
