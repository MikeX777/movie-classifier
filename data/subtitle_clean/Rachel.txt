I Chief Forensic Pathologist
When Rachel died
I director center
I performed autopsy
The report circumstances
brief imprecise
saying hit
tractor
So looked tor mechanical damage
indicate injury tractor
We minor damage body
head arms legs chest
But relatively minor
No signs having run
tractor
She signs
like bleeding eyes
characteristic death suffocation
These findings led conclusion
death pressure
heavy object
The heavy object
blade
It been usually
tractor blade
metal object
leaves tell tale marks
body victim
In case
exerted pressure
softer metal
I rule blade
possibility
However so layer sand
body blade
absorbed
impact blade tractor
