Writer
Grown human ruins
of madmans love
AT SEVENTEEN
BY JANIS IAN PLAYING
 I learned truth
seventeen 
 That love meant
beauty queens 
 And high school girls
clearskinned smiles 
 Who married young
retired 
 The valentines
I knew 
 The Friday night charades
youth 
 Were spent
beautiful 
 At seventeen
I learned truth 
 And
ravaged faces 
 Lacking
social graces 
 Desperately remained
home 
 Inventing lovers
phone 
 Who called say
Come dance me 
 And murmured
vague obscenities 
 It isnt
At seventeen 
 A brown eyed girl
handmedowns 
 Whose
I pronounce 
 Said Pity please
ones serve 
 They
deserve 
 And richrelationed
hometown queen 
 Marries
needs 
 With guarantee
company 
 And haven elderly 
 Remember
win game 
 Lose love
sought gain 
 In debentures quality 
 And dubious integrity 
 Their smalltown eyes
gape 
 In dull surprise
payment 
 Exceeds accounts received
At seventeen 
 To
knew pain 
 Of valentines
came 
 And names
called 
 When choosing sides
basketball 
 It long ago
far away 
 The world younger
today 
 When dreams
gave free 
 To ugly duckling girls
like 
 We play game
dare 
 To cheat
solitaire 
 Inventing lovers
phone 
 Repenting lives
unknown 
 They say
Come dance me 
 And murmur
vague obscenities 
 At ugly girls like
At seventeen
