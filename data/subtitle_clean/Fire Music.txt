soft instrumental music
A musicians music
is music
Some sad
Some happy
Some fast
Some slow
avantgarde jazz music
If think jazz as
let begin way back
You guy porch
singing blues hes himself
So blues chorus 12 bars
It 13 14 half
It nine
Its hes doing
add bass player
Now agreement you
And obviously necessary
add musicians
suddenly big band
scored composed
What avantgarde began do
way say
know mastered music
We understand talk other
Now lets away agreements
see talk other
Can improvise freely
Theyre saying dont like past
Theyre saying were better past
Theyre saying way hear music
crowd cheering
This I love music presence
You know long I live I mean
I dont care I played yesterday
I home right write music
presence know
Thats machines know
So can want past
theres machine thats got past
right there know
I think good know
So means human beings
present
Every movement jazz reflects time
And ironies jazz 20th century
moved quickly
brought era
played else
You brought listening loving swing
listening Duke Ellington
ended playing Charlie Parkers music
One two three four
Bebop see wow
Bebop urgency
It kind arrogance
There way by
narrow player play ensemble know
If bebop band soloist
See swing bands records
dont lengthy solos
With boppers got chance hear Charlie Parker
I saw I kid
That 1949
I forget it
And I amazed human being man
stand looking like saint angel
white suit playing beautiful music man
It changed life
Charlie Parker looked like Buddha
Charlie Parker recently died
laughing juggler TV
weeks strain sickness
called perfect musician
Charlie Parker pray me
Pray everybody
Charlie realize time
effect going jazz
Well I mean
Ive heard music
I thought clean precise
I mean course stand improvement
Most likely 25 maybe 50 years
youngster come style
it know
Just imagine itd like
New York 1959
wake death Charlie Parker
whos alive everybodys heads
Miles Davis hes doing
come town say well
thats wonderful this
Ornette creating notes
previously existed
Ornette comes in
thing breaks standing rule jazz
People dont want Ornette Coleman credit this
I dont problems it
Im sure people historically
point said well
maybe improvise following chords
mind Ornette Coleman guy
work
Many people discouraged
cause got lot abuse musicians town
didnt coming from
Theres occasion playing guys
eyes closed playing
got walked stage
One musician left stage
Ornette left alone
Then waiter came said Mister Coleman
somebody wants talk you
He walked door took saxophone
threw mountain
It hill
beat up
His lung collapsed
He hospital
Thats I started trying worry
I value
good bad it
Whatever Ornette doing worked
I converted
You know conversion
instant conversion
instant adoration
It like religion
I cant imagine it
compare anything
The thing Ornette Coleman pitch
lot people werent getting
people saying tune
playing quartertone pitches
meant hes playing notes
adjacent keys piano
If play exact ratio quarter notes
youre tune
Youre tune
Youre tune rest planet
youre tune yourself
In classes college
I teach history jazz
I play people say
gives migraine headache
Well I dont know you
I agree its easy listen to
thats think
youre writing music
Is gonna easy listen to know
To perfected
acknowledged having
sell out sell out
Im way
scat singing
dissonant piano music
It music is do
Straight heart
So
So read dance know
converse making music
Cecil Ornette come
different parts musical map
You Ornette comes southwestern style
raw jagged approach
tempered scale thats lot people
compare blues rhythm blues
avantgarde piano music
Cecil Taylor obviously listened Ellington
He knew Bud Powell
He studied formally
He studied New England Conservatory
He education Europe
grew listening lot pop
So listened stuff growing up
approach
A lot people misunderstand him
Hes kind microscopic improvisations
But certain way its dense
reminds mountains
oceans kinds elements
human elements
avantgarde piano
The point understand music
terms traditional jazz youve heard before
Next question please
Now talk jazz
use terrible semantic terms
sort create battle lines
For example bop meaningless word bebop
It sound drum lick
Its shorthand communication
So I bebop
immediately think Charlie Parker
Dizzy Gillespie Bud Powell
If I avantgarde think Cecil Taylor
Ornette Coleman John Coltrane Albert Ayler
Swing Benny Goodman Count Basie
Although know truth is
farther away time movement
real logic
musics interactive
progression
sort feed other
gun firing
A gun
Mingus initially interesting remark
Ornette
He said Ornette like
hes playing world
doesnt relate anybody elses world
This bass
Mingus Mingus
But eventually Minguss music
consciously avantgarde
Charlie Mingus ahead game
I mean played period Bird
big divide
doing
One remember came
neighborhood Eric
I came oriented bebop style
I saw Eric Dolphy time
I couldnt stand Eric Dolphy felt like
couldnt play saxophone
And second time I seen Eric Dolphy
turned favorite musician times
So I embraced kind music
freeform avantgarde jazz
One things makes avantgarde different
school jazz
certainly proceeded it I think thats followed it
major figures
come discreet backgrounds
I mean artists spread
United States geographically
So off tell youre from

I think I met Ornette Coleman Texas
Then I moved Los Angeles
As fate it
Im street car day
Ornette Coleman
And months followed
I played town him
There places jam sessions LA then
When Ornette Coleman started
Los Angeles
going jam sessions sit in
real brick wall hung there
You finally got people surrounded him
know sympathetic
empathetic doing
When Ornette came town
ran Don Cherry
They didnt know other
And Don Cherry ready
And Charlie completely willing able
joined band
And Ornette write person
You ran people town
time went play
I jam sessions Eric Dolphy
heres guy great player
disrespect Eric saying Im saying
A lot people think Eric
figures Los Angeles
playing sort free jazz
Thats true
He going town

And Eric good man
But I sophisticated bebopper then
Now came New York

This bullshit man
That young musicians
thinking similar way

A lot people lot trouble that

Now Ornette Colemans earlier recordings

making way early tunes free jazz man
That apron string or
whatever umbilical cord bebop
certainly disappears that man
Thats Ornette Coleman
I knew new era
scene jazz music America
wind blowing
avantgarde jazz music
gasping
Most people having
melody going time
cope polyrhythms polytonality
But looking
freedom play kind tempo
individual play tempo
create melodies independent
way players playing
You break
able create new
I said improvisation thought
informed passion
conditioned knowledge
Dont mention it
And course Cecil Taylor great impact
positive people liked it
negative people hated type music
We talking difficult music
lot people
And Cecil said
musician prepares audience prepare to
You know prepare understand literature
understand painting
Why music different
It scared hell people
everybody grew thinking jazz this
You know beat is
Even dont know harmony
brain tells harmony resolve
All things suddenly taken away
And terrifying people
A lot people just hell this
This isnt music
With avantgarde
critics thought
lot untalented musicians
squawking instruments
Downbeat said poisoning
minds young musicians
A lot older musicians felt way
One time man I sat Max Roachs band
Clifford Jordan band
Everybody playing Jordan took solo
Freddie took solo
everybody taking solo
I reached hit cymbal
looked Clifford took cymbal away
So I go like I say man that
You see man I got tired listen shit
What kind fucking shit that
How dare you motherfucker
come sit Max Roachs drums
Ah man kind thing I get
But eventually Max Roach later years
was know bebop drummer
magisterial drummers come 1940s
duet albums Cecil Taylor
And couldnt that
But time old guard felt
right dismiss
avantgarde charlatans frauds
For me far I see
wasnt mingling the
established players avantgarde players
Miles critical
He good them
There notorious essay Downbeat Eric Dolphy
A friend opened club Berlin 64
wanted play opening
said like bring somebody person
And I said Eric want play
We told open club Berlin
And I said hey Eric
And Downbeat lap
And looked sad said
I dont know Miles like that
I like him
avantgarde jazz music
We brought hotel Berlin
He ordered ice cream juice
Coca Cola stuff like that
That dinner
And turned later like heavy diabetic
He clue
He clue it
He played song us
Then said excuse me
I dressing room
didnt come anymore
And I said Karl songs
look Eric is door opened
And Eric cried out
floor
said help me
And immediately brought hospital
And doctor told
seen sugar anybodys blood
Like way saving him
And called mother
Did tend realize great was

muffled speaking
He real honest
He wouldnt anything
We realized
thought was

Man cat genius
Here genius right
He like Ive heard know
I aint gonna Dolphy now

supreme musician
human rare day
And especially music business
slogan dog eat dog
In New York its certain energy creativity
kind hard explain
maybe its of know
I myself man I dont believe in
I dont think competition music
You know I dont think better worse
its different
And I think kind thing brings certain ego
keeping lot development
musicians coming together
You know wants feel
theyre different
doing
And innovators Ive known life
playing music
trying develop music
It wasnt try innovator
And meeting Ornette Coleman
coming bebop period
like study I see
like now Im like disciple music
Don Cherry smitten Ornette
They played like identical twins
music created
point think Ornette Don
together werent
And Don
absolutely inventive unique musician

He lived point got him
said oh know Don that
got him
And I certainly got him
I awe till day gone am
But beautiful
He came house

And told then
going New York downfall
New York like Ive New York times
hard place sleep food no
I mean then I mean

I mean paying dudes

In New York time

club
What amounted Ornette decided point
clubs werent paying should
The club happened focus
Five Spot
We played there
place packed night
And Ornette decided wasnt gonna work
paid price
Theres magic here
Youve got wife couple kids
Ornette fighting musicians paid better
It alone everybody
When I retreated America

Then doesnt sense
I thought I was
I thought I wasnt know
So I said okay know I mean
I grew being
I grew hungry I hungry now know
Its gonna different know
That shock life
European
finding respectlessness
fantastic jazz musicians
For me its true art form US
Jazz happened happened else
No respect
So I said Karl Im going Europe
We went Ornette
Ornette insistent
He said gotta stay gotta stay gotta stay
It devastating musicians living
going music treated
When bands coming Europe
concerts
glamorous flashy performances make
idea mind it
Oh theyre stars
But I came States
I saw musicians living
I said theres wrong here
The situation
AfricanAmerican musicians
things gotten better
Well I dont better

We cant protect culture
actually alter economic social institutions
reflect better needs desires I think
The music 60s

In fact reason
I formed Jazz Composers Guild

word free jazz little meaning
I hated afterwards
But time like needed that
England radical
They called free improvisation
The German guys English jazz
washing machine music
playing around around around circles
The Dutch most lets eclectic
We Holland treaters traitors

You forward
ideas
If dont ideas back
The forms simple here
Were talking 12 bar blues 32 bars
I got rhythm something
To rehash again
makes want regurgitate
You cant use it man
Its like going back digging dead man
You know I mean validity
today man period
Its times well
dont thing
again know
its like reinventing wheel
Its lost
I mean its musicians themselves
aware era is
Its conservative attitude
new art new expression
new ways expressing yourself
If somebody wants forms expression
tied up its unhealthy
And its betterment society
And messengers
creative people
define language different way
Its creativity
And history greatest players
taking music forward
fighting camp camp
It doesnt sense
Its music
Were this
We need stronger music
Because I think its good time man
Whats happening politics going on
Whats happening country
How screwed country is
administration have
For long time I thought that
naive I suppose part
vital jazz music
sort care itself
Somebody sort help jazz stay focus
I dont know is
A guy like Ornette Coleman doesnt come
years Charlie Parker
John Coltrane
Maybe guy
10 now right
Runny nose kid
playing basketball blacktop now
Thatll big Jazzer
ethereal jazz music
crowd murmuring
When hear music its over
its gone air
You capture again
