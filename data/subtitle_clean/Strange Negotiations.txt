Theres lot different
factors come play
caused pretty
severe ghetto thought

right I
need evaluate those
The faithful response
hide them
questions cant hurt God
I certainly reading Bible bunch
like trying read like
I seen
I didnt
bunch assumptions

That picture
God I accepted
Christianity true

errancy followed pretty soon after
Original sin came pretty quick
Moving assuredness else
matter is is
pretty destabilizing
