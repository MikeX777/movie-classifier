Dad right
One thing livin Santa Carla
I stomach
All damn vampires
Doors song begins
People strange
When youre stranger
Faces look ugly
When youre
Women wicked
When youre unwanted
Streets uneven
When youre
When youre strange
Faces come rain
When youre strange
No remembers
When youre strange
When youre strange
When youre strange
When youre strange
Faces come rain
When youre strange
No remembers
When youre strange
When youre strange
When youre strange
