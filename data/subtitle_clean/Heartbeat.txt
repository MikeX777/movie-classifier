The film shall tonight
One bit parts own
serve highlight me
featured second comic
A role unimportant
Meyerboom gave
debutant was I believe
thirtyfifth props man
I Galubert accepted play
alongside props man
You kind
But class
Alongside you hell vanish
All him That I know
When Galubert plays
thankful
When expensive Galubert
launch star whos paid peanuts
Galubert doesnt stand it
Master

I attend projection
I presented bailiff
For crimes art
akin sacrilege
Ladies gentlemen I leave
Exit backstage
The old ham
What says isnt true
Oh its perfectly true
This glory
enticed trap
And old ham throat slit
You exaggerate
No I dont
Im Marseilles
The future clear
Irénées perfect

But Galubert dead
Time buy fishing rod
Hell retire comfortably
He millions
So Irénée
Does bother you
No Im glad him
Anyway he
He dressed projection
Then hit sudden nerves
hes pacing corridors
He wont attend projection
But I prefer that
Why laughing much
Must idiot Galubert
At theyre having fun
But thats case
love scene wont them
Theyll probably laugh that
Especially as
Oh laugh its end
At I fall
grocery
Ill to Françoise
 You it
 What
 They applauded twice
 Who
 You Personally
 My love scene
That hasnt come yet
 Will like it
 Im sure
Im sure too
 Are sure
 Absolutely
Will cry
Let tell
youll surely hear later
The film huge hit
But maybe way
think
A hit me
No Youre complete smash
But scenes
ones youd emotional
The main ones
Well theyre having huge impact
But theyre inducing
emotions mixed
comedy
 When I cry laugh
 Not meanly
 But laugh
 Not grossly
In fact
truth is
great comic actor
 Me
 Yes Everyone says so
The producers critics
Youre revelation
Theyre looking
contract
 And love scene
 Will laugh
 But I played real
 And thats why
20 pm love scene
Theyre sitting mocking me
There different ways
laughing
Of laughing
feeling sorrow too
Why feel sorrow
Youll rich famous
So what
My misfortune worst
Not achieving aim
true disappointment
But achieving opposite
aim
absolute proof
youre total idiot
Untrue
You fully know yourself
Imagine inventor invents
gun fires others
At try
gun shoots backwards
The inventor
hope pride
takes bullet guts
topples dies
Well gun backfired
I feel sadder I dead
Your success revive you
You think Ill accept success
comic No way
Why not
Laugh Make em laugh
Become king laughter
Its scary guillotine
equally defamatory
But why
Around 9 pm dining
wives mistresses
men say Now were replete
days business over
lets watch film
stop thinking
pose problems
and shake guts
help digestion 
You exaggerate
No Its worse
What want comic
man
look better
So comic
makeup artist deepens wrinkle
He accentuates defect
Instead correcting face
creating superior being
degrades
skills art
And Im success comic
mean France
man able say
Tonight Im happy
I saw showed wife
a man uglier
stupid I
And Ill success
educated people
Professors doctors priests
Ill laugh
For souls high
moved pity
Françoise man laughs another
feels superior him
The man makes laugh
shows inferior all
 Only shows But isnt
 Why not
Because actor isnt man
Youve seen Chaplin
having butt kicked films
Would real Chaplin
accept slap
Hes likely them
The real Chaplin leader
Then debase himself
Those people laugh film
dont debase themselves
Making laugh farm labourers
hands calloused
wont close
Or office workers
shrunken lungs
forgotten taste air
Or factory workers
bowed heads
broken nails
oil ingrained skin
Or slowly dying
Or lost mother
 Who people
 All us We lose mothers
He who instant
makes forget misery
fatigue anxiety death
makes laugh
cry
gives strength live
love benefactor
Even debases
them
If agrees debase himself
greater it
Because sacrifices pride
lighten loads
We
Saint Molière Saint Charlie
But laughter itself
Its absurd vulgar convulsion
Dont speak ill laughter
It doesnt exist wild
Animals dont laugh
trees dont laugh
Mountains laughed
Only man
Man babes
havent learnt talk
Laughter human
The domain man alone
Maybe gift God
console intelligent
When played lead
