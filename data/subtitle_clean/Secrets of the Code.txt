You dont need mystical traditions

The pagan
Roman Church Christians

The truth course

immensely sophisticated
This philosophy
ancient civilization
The civilization gave

Its actually Ironically its
Christianity took over
That And
destroyed
went
idea Earth flat
killed
saying that
Denying Earth

Dark Ages
Religion its big
man sky beard
message
Do I tell you
And women message
basically
Shh Dont anything
You know Dont anything
Youre
involved this
In fact
debate Middle Ages
know
had women souls
And weve inherited
think its Christianity
Thats about
And weve lost
half equation
Weve lost inner mysteries
Weve lost mysteries
Feminine
After crucifixion
Christian sects arose
telling story Jesus
different point view
To create uniform religion
Church fathers
chose gospels
Matthew Mark Luke John
later
books New Testament
Dozens gospels
declared heretical
hidden
lost history
discovered
Egyptian desert 1945
The discovery Gnostic
Gospels surprise
It discovered villagers
small town Upper Egypt
And later learned
contained ancient library
Its treasury
early Christian writings
including Gospel
Thomas Gospel Philip
Letter Peter Paul
Secret Book James
Secret Book John
Over 50 writings attributed
Jesus disciples
You know thought knew
early Christian movement
Now
knew
small slice
wider range
So instead gospels
New Testament
dozens others
Now knew
dozens others
fathers
Church said this
They said heretics written
terrible secret gospels
And
knew were
We knew
awful
And time ancient
Christians speak
people
called heretics actually said
While traditional Church
sought oversee
persons relationship
God
Gnostics believed
spiritual revelation
come within
No intercession required
priests rabbis
If wake
discover Christ within
recognize
one thats gnosis
come love
everything thats heaven
So original message
understanding powerful myth
wake
are
discover
parts body Paul says
Were parts Christ
were one
Back second century Saint Iraneus
hes definitely supporting gospels
gospels more less
He knows Gnostic gospels
He says theyre garbage I mean theyre
invented theyre real thing
Matthew Mark Luke John
gospels
People fudge dates
Gnostic Gospels
use
purposes claiming
middle
century
Well thats maverick claim
overwhelming majority
scholars dont accept
One needs read Gnostic
Gospels beginning end
realize well thank God
list
It easy youd say
Well ones true
Well Church says These
Theyre New Testament
After all real ones
These fake ones
Its lot harder now If look
range text say
What believe
There
gospels New Testament
hundreds probably Gnostic
Gospels found
And theyre mythological
You
theres natural continuum
synthesis pagan
Jewish tradition
Jesus kind
ancient superhero
Hes like Batman
meets Superman
He combines Messiah
pagan GodMan
attributes both
The important myth
ancient world
story dying
resurrecting GodMan
He changes water wine
wedding
performs miracles bringing
people dead
things
associate Jesus
right
crucial things course
dying Easter
crucifixion
He resurrects
share eternal life
bread wine
commune God
Now thats Christianity
existed
idea
Jesus
The Jesus story stand
it looks like myth
its story whos born
virgin goodness sake
comes dead Ive
met born virgin
came dead
It looks like myth
myth
The gospels New
Testament like Matthew Mark
tell Jesus preached
hills thousands people
But Mark says Jesus taught
disciples privately secretly
secret things And doesnt
tell said
Now gospels claim
secret teachings probably meant

going deeper level
Now whats happened
myth literalized
Its literal man
literally believe
came literally died
sins
historical event
And thats its
cut power
power actually transform
help experience gnosis
The Gnostics mystics
Instead worshiping Christ
literal figure
man flesh blood
considered life
teachings allegories
stories helped guide
journey truth
So instead speaking Jesus
utterly unique
believe
picture Jesus
manifests become
And different
kind message
The Gospel Mary says Son
Man you follow him
You dont
Jesus Nazareth

whats you
Throughout
Gnostic scriptures
little
bone contention
fact
disciples Christ
Mary
slightly longer
Shes Shes
more
She knows
secrets than do
She acts
of cowisdom him

questions
intelligence
understanding
questions
disciples show
And closeness
um seen
people whove read
Gnostic scriptures
evidence personal
literal sexual relationship
Certainly Dan Brown
wrote The Da Vinci Code
took lines

secret texts
provocative
The ones started
Gospel Philip says
Jesus loved Mary disciples
kissed her
And text breaks
dont know
What actually happens texts
different
There described companion
Jesus language erotic
But its language
mystical writer
talks Mary
manifestation Holy Spirit
If look
mystical traditions
Judaism Islam
Christianity
Divine
spoken Father
But
mother daughter
sits alongside
helps Divine
And Jewish tradition um
figure Shekinah
presence God
Shes seen female
In Islamic tradition um
shes called Sakina
behaves
similar way
She accompanying
soul life
In Gnosticism
lives ordinary life
suffers shares
understand human condition
She makes mighty things come about
She powerful lady indeed
Dan Brown given
impression
Mary Magdalene gets exalted
point being the equal Jesus
The problem
be
Because Jesus God
So she God
In case dont same
were talking religion
I mean cant
Catholic
Church hiding you
clearly
religion were talking about
There God
gods
I mean I impression
kind laid
Ten Commandments
ago
A lot people today
concerned issues
women
feminine language
But people think
its new issue
Whats interesting
appeared
beginning
Christian movement
Sometimes people me Well
know sounds new age
And I think well know
2000 years new
It Chateau Villette
Sophie Neveu told
churchs role denying
importance Sacred
Feminine Mary Magdalene
The center story
The Da Vinci Code
its experienced right
here Chateau
The bulk story history actually
told right here room
right sofa
actually
And fact right sofa
hide keystone
underneath sofa
The keystone
The Da Vinci Code
relationship Mary
Magdalene Jesus Christ
Their story resonates
people
some message
far enough
Of things
The Da Vinci Code
makes angriest
man writing book thats
supposed Divine Feminine
denigrates Mary Magdalene
says
perpetrator bloodline
instead talking
passionate preacher
independent woman
right
If anything The Da Vinci Code
suddenly raises questions
that know
discussed publicly
No It absolutely clear
The bad guys Catholic
Church Opus Dei
The good guys
Priory Sion
It Indiana Jones
way
But its weve
brought believe
Yeah I I See I
again I think
book says
taught believe
dont remember really
taught believe
tell that
say Oh yeah thats right
Yeah I taught believe that
Because hey I slept classes
But talent He suspense
Its polar
Its book read
nights
because I read books
Dan Brown novel it
easier read
interesting read
And I kept falling sleep I
read The Holy Grail Holy Blood
It difficult read
 What think about
 To use Da Vinci
Da Vinci weird guy
And Im sure codes
things there
I dont think
what
The Holy Blood Holy Grail
The Da Vinci Code said
Leonardo
interesting person
I dont think
anybody understands him
Maybe mother
Architect engineer inventor
Leonardo complex
impossible
comprehend
Which
stopped trying
The Last Supper obviously
famous paintings world
In fact its probably
famous paintings
Mona Lisa
Leonardo Da Vinci
um theyre
weird
The core The Da Vinci
Code symbolism
Leonardo Da Vincis
Last Supper
We people
notice everybody knows
Um say
Thanks Dan Brown
Its Thanks Dan
Brown its thanks us
Um thats fact world knows
that suspects that uh
person sitting
Jesus right hand
Last Supper
young St John all
And looked it think
Wait minute thats woman
Basically
look new eyes
Well Jesus sitting there sort
of going like this isnt He
And she was
what isnt
Oh hang on

I doing
Yes youre that
And And is know
sort leaning away like
joined
joined hip
Together giant
spreadeagled M shape
Uh well M
gives clue
Its some
begins M
Not Virgin Mary
It Mary Magdalene
Oh I 12 male apostles
I mean figure Mary
Magdalene Jesus wheres John
Assuming figure
Mary Magdalene
hand cuts
neck visually
Um looks like disciple
leaning shoulder
like this leaning forward fact
visually hand threatening
um disciple is whos
that Saint Peter
The interesting thing
painting
Peter portrayed
hand Marys throat
knife
Now whats that
Peter Judas and uh Saint
John group together
Peter angry news
Jesus betrayed
hes hes
right traitor
John
contemplative tranquil
And thats normal way
its understood
Once Peter Gnostic
mythology represents ignorance
the represents
lost
shown
Gnostic gospels
antagonistic Mary
hes jealous Mary
Saint Peter hugely jealous
kept going Jesus
saying Lord let Mary leave
cause women worthy life
He doesnt like fact
Mary ear Jesus
this
allegorical course
Then understand
Peter knife
trying silence Mary
You know Saint Peter founded
Catholic Church
authority
given Jesus
Supposing got it
Supposing authority
given woman
Mary Magdalene present
Leonardos Last Supper
It painting
sitting wall 500 years
Its looked
greatest art historians

keen observers
forwarded
figure Mary Magdalene
It not
Sometimes
stories ancestors told
forgotten suppressed
remain
collective unconscious
waiting emerge
And like Robert Langdon
Sophie Neveu
pick threads
stories
hoping lead
Mary Magdalene signpost
Shes destination
She messenger
case
model all
she keeps on
um disciple
She keeps faithful people
shout her say No youre wrong
Were We know better
She faithful I think thats
faith learn from
These I Magdalene
pilgrims come Vezelay
looking Mary Magdalene
true Mary Magdalene
They define
pilgrims
following
footsteps medieval pilgrims
coming Vezelay venerate
relics Mary Magdalene
These Magdalene pilgrims want contact
way energy
think
relevant women
They believe Mary Magdalene
simple disciple Jesus
actually
teacher
According pilgrims partly
thanks Mary Magdalenes teachings
Jesus
did
Well Catholic Church treated Mary
Magdalene ambiguous way
gospels
Mary Magdalene prostitute
This came later
sixth century
Pope declared that
according point view
Mary Magdalene
female figures gospels
woman
So 1969
Catholic Church
considered Magdalene
prostitute
repentant sinner
converts
moment meets Jesus
moment Jesus
heals seven demons
Hail Mary grace
Lord thee
Blessed art thou women blessed
fruit thy womb Jesus
Holy Mary Mother God
Saint Mary Magdalene
Saint Joseph
saints God
pray us sinners
hour death Amen
Mind head
Mind head
Relics said
Saint Mary Magdalene
acquired
11th century
were
fact ratified
officially pope
day year 1050
It meant
pilgrims came
brought money
building church
basilica
built pilgrim offerings
The kingdom God close
And evidence message
true resurrection
And thats Saint Mary
Magdalene important
Shes person
hear touch see
smell Lord risen
He says her
Dont touch me
Meaning Dont cling me dont
try hold world
I ascending Father Ive come
words heaven
Shes person communicate
knowledge world
She goes apostles resurrection
morning dont believe her
Shes woman know
Silly woman
Why choose
Mary Magdalene
I think real answer
that youd need ask Lord
Its
Gods humility
The way God express
choosing broken woman
like Saint Mary Magdalene

announce resurrection
And living experience
Christians
relationship Saint Mary Magdalene
Shes alive dead
Shes died sure terms
life world
Christian terms
shes alive
Spiritually shes
shes work
Shes work
Holy Spirits work
That doesnt mean shes
kind goddess She isnt all
Shes Christian saint
important one
There history whatsoever
married
theres history
children
And certainly didnt kind
relationship kind Lord
That thats sheer
20th century fantasy
Not Church institution
suppressed it isnt there
Its consonant
Lords life hers
It said Jesus
rabbi married
But Jesus lived
Essenes community celibate Jews
western shore
Dead Sea
One things
know Essenes
people crazy
ritual purity
For example
bath

going bathroom
mikvah
spiritual bath twice day
These group celibate
men living
according
ancient writers
These people fanatical
ritual purity
Who Jesus hang with He
hung prostitutes
blind
lame halt
These type people
Jewish point view
want
youre Essene
And Jesus hung
people
Jesus
allowed near place
Well its clear Christians
influenced people
Jesus here No way
Not far
sea Galilee
Jesus revealed
miracles
town Migdal said

He wife
The Torah says

The role wife

I think wife
There legend
tells Mary Magdalene
fleeing persecution
Palestine
arriving
south France
boat oars sail
This beautiful door represents
Saint Marys servant Sarah
It said boat
Marys arrived
there girl
Egypt
The story Mary Magdalene
child Jesus Christ
That Sarah
I dont believe all
I believe Jesus
totally dedicated God
I cant imagine
time human love
It contradiction
His mission
Celibacy priesthood
mirrors celibacy Christ
Its question time
the time takes dedicate
God others
If youre married spend lot
time wife children
With child
story Mary told
region people listened
The fact is Christians
arrived brought faith
I believe beginning
rapid conversion
The poor class
touched message Christians
Jesus message
liberation love
And disenfranchised
moved
After Mary Magdalene arrived
Saint Marys
she continued
way
Her story picks
Sainte Baume
Its far here
mountains
In Middle Ages Christians
told believed
Mary Magdalene
ended days Provence
mountain called La
Sainte Baume means the grotto
And contemplated
repented sins
In order so divested
clothes
meant
close God holiness
She wasnt concerned
worldly goods worldly life
She didnt eat
fasted wept
And order covered
order decent
hair grew down
body
Everyday taken heaven
angels gave heavenly sustenance
spiritual sustenance
She need human food
But came
pilgrims
middle 13th century came
pray think her
Sweet Lover God
I mean exemplifies
medieval concept Mary Magdalene
sweet
friend lover God
Theyve coming
1250
coming
pilgrimage
Mary Magdalene
spent days
This final end
pilgrimage grotto
Mary Magdalene spent
30 years life
Were entering
huge cavern
amazed believers
pilgrims
And wrote back
wrote memoirs
miraculous was
They come here
pray think
Mary Magdalene apostle
person converted
France Christianity
This crypt
Mary Magdalenes bones
believed Middle Ages lie
When monks claimed
relics bones here
said entire
body minus arm
The skull see
woman age 50
Claiming having relics
bring Church money the
pilgrims came thousands
The powerful saint
money coming in
With powerful popular
saint like Mary Magdalene
economic ramifications
enormous
When I writing book
people said
I want bother write
book prostitute
repentant prostitute
I said I wasnt
said Well
writing about
And I said Well woman
right Which I felt was
Um
And I finished book I
angry Church
women
Christianity
I didnt want
think longer
I stonecold angry
happened us
And having Mary Magdalene
showed women
2000 years
women now
men understand
women able now
The guilt of uh sexuality procreation
goes Garden Eden
Eve eaten
apple
Adam eaten
apple too
theyre expelled
garden
The blame guilt heaped
solely squarely woman
Eve
Adam Eve
And living
consequences that
its its
powerful story
affects
modern world
More 5000 years ago
began rewrite
ancient stories
In time God replaced many
Sacred Feminine
changed temptress
brought sin world
Weve taught very
different form Christianity
blind belief
somebody died

original sin

believed that
wed heaven
died
And didnt
wed hell
tortured forever
God love
Its
acceptable prejudices
putting boot
Catholic Church
And I mean have theres
big shadow there
but I mean its bad
that there
People
hungers really
People want live
They want meaning
want love loved
I think basic human hungers
life meaning love
And I think faith real faith
answers hungers
But Catholic Christian I
life meaning love Jesus
I mean He satisfies
hungry heart
The men formative
church terrified
Mary Magdalenes legacy
come centuries
They said Were having
more
Any Any likelihood
Mary Magdalene
coming of
know flock
so going suppress women
Were going lie it
Were going lie
Jesus said
And
2000 years
result
tthe men Vatican
very early
Church fathers essentially
reacting
Mary Magdalene image
Well I I love Mary Magdalene Im
priest really
My mother
got married
went Church Saint
Mary Magdalene in uh Paris
prayed
son hed priest
And Im result
Im happy priest
Im grateful Mary Magdalene
The idea vilified
official Church nonsense
I mean Rome
lovely church
Mary Magdalene
prominent facade
So shes notable
figure early Christianity
uh remembered
with affection gratitude
In ways books
like The Da Vinci Code do
puts in beginning beginning
beginning new storylines
Heres new storyline
Oh Jesus married
child
Now right now
fanciful
religious story
imagine told
The interesting thing is 500 years
now 1000 years now
millions people
heard story
generations
expansive
nature earliest stories
gets grafted on

begins affect society
I think The Da Vinci Code great
job uh stirred things up
I think its great sign people
longer happy traditional history
meaning Christianity
And its pointed rightly
fact traditional history
stand
scrutiny
But its uh it
itself superficial
It created Creates new
mythology literalizes
this idea
Mary comes France
and theres bloodline
this
Theres evidence that
How depressing be
people
history risked lives

precious secret alive
And
aristocratic bloodline
point were going
We dont need anymore
In fact real Da Vinci Code
shocking
because um know basically
Leonardo saying um
Jesus fake messiah
Leonardo da Vinci
fact Johannite
He believed John
Baptist true Messiah
Jesus
One Johannite uh
works Leonardo da Vinci
The Adoration Magi
So in foreground
wise men
theyre presenting
frankincense myrrh
think Wait minute
wheres gold
In Leonardos time gold represented
perfection kingship
thats withheld
baby Jesus
Look Virgin Mary
to her essentially
theres
roots tree
Theres tree Um carob tree
represents John Baptist
theres group young
people standing tree
worshiping apparently
worshiping tree
And young people are
uh well obviously young
theyre vibrant
healthy glowing
theyre John
Baptists worshipers
Jesus worshipers
foreground horrible old things
To fascinated
Christian saint
heresy itself
course
But fascinated
obsessed point
believe
saint superior Jesus
thats heresy
Heresy means choice Greek
church
came mean enemy
Philosophers
unorthodox views
noblemen disobeyed
papal edicts
people accused
witches
Dan Brown tells
Catholic Church
burned million witches
stake
That depopulated Europe
I mean its absurd
In fact 50000
women men
died centuries in
At Salem aalso Europe
And evil wicked
million
I mean he multiplies real number
hundred sounds better
I mean things
Spanish Inquisition good
things
At time people preferred
case heard them
thought
theyd justice
And number people executed
Inquisition minuscule
I mean its uh Somehow
got bad name
No safe churchs
pursuit spiritual purity
Not order knights
formed protect
pilgrims traveling Holy Land
The Knights Templar
traditionally said
group knights
formed Holy Land
year 1118 1119
The nonorthodox speculative
version Templar story
holds Templars requested
based the Temple platform
actually
carry excavations
underneath believed
Temple Solomon
Well writers
suggest
Templars
documents
proved
origins Christianity

bargaining tool Europe
They initially money
basically
impoverished start

successful
Within 10 15 years
Templars were
modern day equivalence
um sort multimillionaires
In stories
Templars said
guardians Holy Grail
But tales secret
rites heretical beliefs
that time
led destruction
Well Friday
13th October 1307
Templars France
arrested orders
French king Philip Fair
grounds
heresy basically
Uh denying Christ
spitting cross
institutional sodomy
worshiping devil
A group charges
pretty severe
Within years
Templars gone
Either killed exile
Today remains
ties Grail
places built
Following false clue
Robert Langdon Sophie
Neveu come Temple Church
encounter
murderous albino monk
belongs Opus Dei
secret organization
viewed suspicion
I mean conspiracy
theories Opus Dei
late 1920s
But Dan Brown did is
took conspiracy
theories mass market
And theyve got
ask question
Why people
willing believe
that kind
Darth Vaderesque
you know boogieman
hiding bed
of nefarious thing
happens Catholic Church

Do I know truth

You a An enormous range
people secular world
hostile to
skeptical of

profound way
willing ways
swallow a version events

demonstrably false
nevertheless
appealing ways credible
story
peddled officialdom
Uh I think
kind examination conscience

institutional Christian churches is
Why that
From know

25 years ago Richard Leigh
Michael Baigent Henry Lincoln

underlying The Da Vinci Code
The chief components
hypothesis were

Secondly like Jew

Fourthly Magdalene

If child

yeah uh Jesus bloodline
have uh transplanted
France her
That bloodline descended
Magdalene Jesus
intermarried
royal line Franks
arose
Merovingian Dynasty
Holy Blood Holy Grail
based set documents
called Secret Files
contained genealogies
linking Jesus Mary
Merovingian Royal Family
Priory Sion
secret society dedicated
protecting bloodline
We knew uh
secret society
semisecret society

That sounded bonkers
Baigent Leigh Lincoln got talking
guy called Pierre Plantard
claimed Grand
Master Priory Sion
Plantard saw
illustrious

Leonardo da Vinci
Pierre Plantard

Priory Sion
So everyones kind swung between
know end extremes
Its kind believe
the uh Priory Sion
read
The Da Vinci Code
its
cheap modern hoax
Um fact research weve
shows its those
There Priory Sion

So Leonardo died 1519
theres bit gap
Um but um I dont know

Mont Segur
stronghold Cathars

long standoff 1243
French crown crusading
soldiers surrounded Mont Segur
One interesting myths
Mont Segur
the That
Cathars possessed treasure
people thought
Holy Grail
So link
Templars Cathars
Templars
traditionally said
guardians
Holy Grail
The end
Cathar movement close
They surrounded armies
King France surrender
Four Cathars escaped
Mont Segur night
They climbed
rocks ropes
took away alleged
treasure Cathars
The Cathars known
smuggled Mont Segur
shortly
citadel fell
So
Cathars smuggled out
seen again
When mention treasure people think

They knew end coming
important save

Another clue sign
The Burial Christ
Everything normal

added Berenger Sauniere himself
If moon
means night
The Jewish religion forbids
bury sunset
Christ dies Friday On
Friday sunset Shabbat starts
Theyre burying Christ
taking away
If away night
means hes maybe dead
He died cross And
Cathars said
Christ survived

Or gonna commit suicide
die free men
In Judaism its forbidden
commit suicide
man took family

happening 2000 years
ago happening today
No The Da Vinci Code

kind stability
Im gonna rest on
Im gonna lean wall
But I use difference
exclude people
I use difference
superior
Ive turned wall
meeting place
wall
separation place
No place brings
faiths closer
keeps people
apart
The Temple Mount I mean any
symbolizes
madness sadness literalist
religion its got there
