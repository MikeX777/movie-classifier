On 3 May 1968 Davis Cup tennis
match set played Båstad
Sweden Rhodesia
This match took place
The following film covers
circumstances surrounding this
Why want stop
match Båstad
I think politics sports
belong together
sport real
political function
politics permeates
aspects society
permeates sports
I feel tendency
society consider
politics preserve professional
politicians government party officials
And man street
incapable
unqualified
position political issues
But channels information
available Sweden today
mass media
actually inform
able adopt
political position
This tendency causes people
pretext socalled
objectivity passive
apolitical
And I think that’s absurd
means
renounce democratic
opportunity change society
I want change society
that’s I feel it’s important
protest match
Our neutrality policy
condemn silence
Silence ally injustice
Silence seen
supporting reaction
We right assert
ideals universal freedom
fellowship
solidarity justice
Let opponents right beware
don’t try use neutrality cover
muzzle Swedish
labour movement
You succeed

mean
Well able respond
firmer hand
its necessary
And necessary sometimes
saw
Do rest feel way too
Y E S
You’ve drawn petition
government
What say
HENRY SWAVING
GOLD MERCHANT
Heres says
Due chaos took place
I way leader
Båstad residents
I citizen
wants help citizens
This petition consists following
We undersigned
residents Båstad
looked dismay events
took place town
conjunction demonstrations
held 2 May 1968
Sweden supposed
meet Rhodesia tennis match
The police worthy
attempts order
Unfortunately
lacked authority
use necessary means

effectively stop hooliganism
Therefore
petition government forthwith
provide police command
authority
If happen
fear experience
town future
How far feel police go
How authority have
think
I cant comment authority
police given
hooligans attack community
Thats government comment on
Even means armed
Then government
absolutely sure
elements
allowed country
doesnt lead armed conflict
Because Sweden hasnt gone
completely communist yet
I hope
There’s brisk flow traffic
area Hovs Hallar
demonstrators
supposed holed up
Do know that
Yes there
These black groups
belong FNL
aggressive gates
Båstad residents got wind
wanted ahold
those types
Yesterday
youths there
Then I went
editor Kvällsposten
Buhre is
Birger Buhr Then
minute discussion
Birger Buhr
demonstrator
looked like
going turn lynching
Then police officers
asked I wouldn’t involved
try calm thing down
So I showed bit aggressiveness
told
stupid demonstrators
finally I said
Come on people Båstad
lets disorderly
rowdy people
Let’s home I’ll treat
refreshment
And that
came quietly
KLING NOW WE REALLY
HAVE TO STOP AND THINK
Has police commissioner
informed happened
It
I got information I have
I learned
southern Swedish press
And I ask
changed view
similar incidents handled
The police commissioner
clearly stated point view
greater commitment personnel
prevented violence
breaking altogether
In press following day
intimated
police going
given greater authority
Would care comment that
It Kling said it
National Police Board
given greater authority
I pretty shameful
thats thing
Kling
business
Rhodesia
One expect he
governments expert
legal issues
ought able
comment fact
signed boycott
Rhodesia UN
breaking pledge
Rhodesias colored population
support Smith regime
crime allowing
tennis match Rhodesia
Sweden entails
Everything else
confrontations broke
match
seocndary comparison
moral treachery involves
formally allow Smith regime
gain recognition playing
national match Rhodesia
And that’s I think
Kling upset
instead coming
upset
secondary consequences
If police use
harsher methods future
think mean
Its alarming development
But things
headed direction
You lot
different areas
look subway
Stockholm now
new city centre
thats built banks cars
people
That causes anxiety
people want
go
But instead grappling
root causes
try crush
expressions discontent
TV coverage
tougher police action
I think face period difficult
reevaluation country
West
beginning
unpleasant development
instead facing
new situation
try crush
expressions dissatisfaction
KLING ON THE RIOTS
STOP THE HOOLIGANS
I heard
justice minister Kling
statement
Svenska Dagladet
called
bunch hooligans
I
worrying situation tendency
reveals enormous lack
information public press

demonstrators are
I think it’s awful
role press
respect
continue
fan prejudices
they’re engaging
persecution propaganda
demonstrators
The combination increased police authority
increased police violence
increased politicization
police
I
frightening
When
Sven Davidson
beneath Wallenberg
giving orders police
attack
in
time police

opinion this
controlled
political force
I think its dangerous
authority
Instead ought examine
exactly police
supposed defend
role have
let
politicized freely
That’s Kling doing
The Swedish Tennis Association
issued communiqué
read follows
We reveal
Rhodesia match
going played
played
Do feel
especially appropriate formulation
No certainly isn’t
Because  
Well feel compelled play
I consider
superfluous tournament
surely ought
way people
it want to
No I don’t want speak
length this

formal situation
stand principle
But like I said
enter country
organizations allowed
organize events
Without Swedish government
able stop it
Yes
Okay Thank you
The match ultimately played
Bandole France
Final result
SwedenRhodesia 32
