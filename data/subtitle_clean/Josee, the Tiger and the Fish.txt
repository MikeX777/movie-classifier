The mermaid saw world grow expand
The seasons changed spring arrived
The day
young mans departure came
The mermaid sad
walked woods
Again ferocious tiger
appeared her
Claws sharp fangs bared
pounced mermaid
Look out cried young man
appearing time save her
But time injured
gorgeous wings broken
Sobbing grief
mermaid took
magic shell hands
wished Please save him
Within seconds wounds healed
youth awoke alive well
wings return
I longer reach
shiny sea lamented
The mermaid said Raise head
You larger wings heart
With wings sheltered
push forward
With wings heart
fly anywhere
The young man set
shiny sea boat
In driving rain stormy winds
pushed forward
Im afraid
Im pursuit dreams
His heart wings
strong supple beautiful
And all unbreakable
At last shiny sea
With great joy dove it
He started swimming freely
orange fish
happy dream came true
an8Oh shell

But legs turned fins
occurred
The magic shell spoke
Wishing anothers benefit

So heart filled
shiny jewels memories
