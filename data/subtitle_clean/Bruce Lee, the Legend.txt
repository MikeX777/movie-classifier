interesting conjecture
Bruce Lee roles
like classic period Chinese swordsman
films like Duel Death
For time actor James Coburn
writer Stirling Silliphant
Bruce trying
project called Silent Flute
Finally 20th CenturyFox
agreed it
tiny budget
providing shot India
Bruce colleagues spent weeks

India decided waste time
Nepal
pagodas like
gave Bruce inspiration
Game Death

Well gung fu originated China
It ancestor karate jujitsu
Its compete
its fluid
By I mean its flowing
There continuity movement
instead movement
movement stop
The best example
glass water
Why Because water
softest substance world
penetrate
hardest rock anything
granite it
Water insubstantial
By I mean
grasp hold it
You punch hurt it
So gung fu man
trying that
soft like water flexible
adapt opponent
A karate punch like iron bar wang
A gung fu punch like iron chain
iron ball attached end
wang
And hurts inside
Well gung fu practiced
