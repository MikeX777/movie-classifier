SCOTT The problem science fiction
feed other
Thats start
look same
How l different
You know l attention
and bad dreams
bad chills
GROWLS
GASPlNG
SCOTT Thats stopped
science fiction
because l thought hows gonna
different Hows gonna new
MAN lts terrifying start
delve deeper
what happen human body
things wrong genetically speaking
What entire movie
humanity
us future challenging
scientific idea creation
Where come from
FASSBENDER What thought knew
Alien
is tiny tributary
whats actually going on
SCOTT Weve tackled lot new ground
opened door
to different form thinking
Get bolder braver
Dare talk
them
FASSBENDER I think youve got
fans new
and youve got maybe sort
upset little bit risk
SCOTT l said I idea
followthrough original Aliens
Because got Wrung dry
Four films Alien franchise
pretty good
HISSlNG
SCREECHING
Inevitably its prequel
SPAIHTS The idea returning Alien
particularly bringing Ridley Alien
had floating years
And lot people taken run it
Uh day l got it
I ostensibly going
meeting project
I went Scott Free
talk generally writing projects
And kind popped
desk uh warning
Weve thought going
Alien
And I said Alien Back Well
And I sort walked
films head
and time
orthodox Alien movies
plus Alien vs Predator
mythology dense
I wouldnt foggiest idea
write one
where earth youd there
And said
Oh feel way
Wed back
SCOTT Theres question asked
movies
much amazement
Im surprised said
Whos big guy seat
known space jockey
I dont know gave name
somebody called space jockey
Its film
This guy sitting chair
middle craft
clearly craft big question
Who that
Id thought before
but l discovered instantly
I opinions
and I started mouthing room
I got opinionated
Well youd
ship wreck sprang
And youd look dead giant
space jockey
the dead giant chair
elephantine proboscis rib cage
What youre gonna
movie guy
and comrades
big starship
They look ridiculous
Theyll unintentionally funny
We wont relate them
theyre people
Theyre gonna speak language
dont understand
How it
And plain
way
you dive story
space jockeys
is story ultimately ours
If story lead us
They needed intrinsically involved
human story
in human history
and l thought evolution
LlNDELOF
I heard fact
that Ridley considering
coming scifi
and gonna
maybe Alien prequel
And I think l hearing thing
everybody was is
he interested
massive corpse
that sitting chair
beginning Alien
and sort telling story
point view of
Okay well that And
plug mythology
And I think know sort bone
fanboy body
was sort vibrating
Oh God I cant wait that
SCOTT
Then evolved
And evolution
I pitched Fox Fox said
Wow thats interesting idea
And thats started evolve
previsitation
Have previsited before
And climb it
realize its entirely logical
SPAIHTS The notion gods
came heavens
but stars worlds
And know theres shortage
obviously kind
theorizing mythologizing
from relatively scholarship
wild conspiracy theories
saying pyramids
lnca temples
the Greek astronomers
ancient wisdom
these old accomplishments
assisted powers stars
that we ourselves
shaped else
SCOTT lts entirely illogical believe
havent visited before
Because theres points arrogance
attached idea
One believe were
entire galaxy
There more
Not humanoids necessarily
life forms
And its arrogant believe
superlative
as opposed minor
Next day
head Ridleys company called
asked write
wanted Ridley
Youre supposed write
screenwriter contract
I immediately wrote
sent Ridley
They told Ridley
immediately shot studio
and ladder
studio
And 1 0 days sitting
cochairs Fox
and locking down
And that I worked fast
hard Ive worked anything
Ridley l Michael Costigan
Michael Ellenberg
we spent months room
hashing story
going draft draft
and finding way story
ELLENBERG Who fly spaceship
filled horrible creatures it
What possess that
human alien
And thats real question
sort curious about
What motivate
that
And premise
beginning
and became
Prometheus
that idea movie is
And theres pure special
development this
because about
monsters
SPAIHTS We began Gigers monster
We began beast
Thats core franchise
its core monster
As new frontier explore
looked giants
these Engineers I called them
The aliens shaped us
old gods
SCOTT l came saying
What happens guys exist
And exist they
And I figured pilot
flying battleship
And battleship carrier
deadly objects
The deadly objects eggs
eggs DNA
that carried destroy
destroy
What destroying
SPAIHTS The farther pushed
development story
the bigger Engineers got
and marginalized
original Alien monster became
until monster
kind feature grace note
in larger story
humanity meeting makers
Humanity confronting forces
created it
and maybe liking much
Spaihts lot footslog
and lot stuff table
going
Yeah
that
And Holloway
Are seeing this
Coming ramp
Yep
Thats
Magellan bridge
If theres people
theyre gonna helmets
All got screens them moving
A good example race
hes kind like perfection
MAN Yeah
All right
Why wanna
people are
and
what
SCOTT l tend lob kind little
milestones story saying
Theres this
And rams it
guess what doesnt destroy it
It comes down bounces
SCOTT lt bowls it
goes down hits ground
starts roll like Frisbee
landscape
SCOTT
And rolls them
I come ridiculously
large ideas
because mainly I think
I pull off
Then its organically
roll it
SPAIHTS He spitballs freely
creatively time
And visually
Hes sketching drawing
So iterative process
underway months
We sit talk
draw things
And stuff
making cuff
And things ruinous story
Id written week
Id bring pages
kick sand castle down
What happening
What a
What thing
model solar system like orrery
Hes like What orrery
Im like What look like
Hed start sketching
I figure is
what meaning be
role play
And l throw pages away
write new pages
This early draft script
which l wrote rewrote
handed again
And thats marked
Ridley himself
And early going
fine detail
on offered feedback
and strong opinions
individual images individual words
shadows light everything
And I
sort implement notes
And highlighting telling
Ive work l need do
So got notes
The complimentary ones
Better great But watch out
Dont like this
Um notes general as Come on
better this mysterious
And notes specific as
l hate word Use word
MAX Conceptually l think draft
I read lot potential
And stimulating visually extent
opened universe
that I seen
claustrophobic interior movie
suddenly
involved
with exterior landscape
exploration it
And interesting
And suggesting
civilization
that encounter
movie been
SPAIHTS Once story got
drafts in started staffing up
And Arthur Max came aboard
production designer really
And artists him
and began push
design film
MAX lts difficult build world
science fiction
when static object
room begin with
SPAIHTS I literally come
write new pages
come talk people them
Ridley home
Id art room
and hang
Arthur artists
And wed sip glass wine
talk monsters
and ought like
think scene looks
And I home come
930 morning
and paintings
wide wall
of scene I wrote day before
ELLENBERG That group started
intimate way
that really l think
enriching Ridley
He took process applies
movies
in kind big design movies
he able process
apply world science fiction
The concept work movie
sort script work
You know script work taking
place alongside actual script work
Often ld walk room artists
I Ridleys footprints
There Postit notes
guys saying
Thats gotta come down
Ridley wants head shaped like that
And needs whiter
needs desexualized
and needs darker
haunted looking
And artists tearing stuff
Ridley through
and reinventing vision
stamped it
And I vision
Ridley going
and carry home
l wrote new pages
And flick away
thered plastic window
which come want it
Mmhm Mmhm Yup
Screens probably
simple
Yeah
SPAIHTS In drafts film
where monsters monstrous
complications heroes ran into
were model
classic Alien monster
Eggs facehuggers
impregnation chestbursting
The entire complex Engineers
youll film
the pyramidal temple underground
catacombs huge caverns
those werent yet
In conceptualization
film
the exploratory ship search
beacon
and set
ultimately prove shipwreck
the derelict Alien film
crescentshaped ship
In exploring ship
explorers got trouble
and began meet
remains Engineers
and ultimately living Engineer
revive
they tangling menaces
way
which recognizable ancestors
beast demon Alien
What lm trying reinvent
facehugger
Right
Okay
In early phases project
actually called Alien Prequel
It early development
We didnt know um gonna be
We parts script
read know early on
And chestbursters
There facehuggertype creatures
There things directly
You correlate Alien
I paintings creature
that gonna come
characters chest
You gonna tentacles
poking out
And pull itself
It open rib cage
and actually release
person
But know Ridley felt
onthenose
and kind wanted depart
that
He wanted things
subtle scarier
and onthenose
original Alien
SCOTT Those things
decided table
And that rich stew
Lindelof comes goes
Ah I like script
this this
And Lindelof foom carves
suddenly Ive got threeact piece
Threeact selling tool
I threeact film
LlNDELOF What sequel movie
Alien
But entirely different movie
started running parallel
to Alien Aliens whatever
So certainly
place Alien universe
and bells
whistles
of weve come expect
Ridley originally did
um terms tone it
way looked
but terms
hypersleep works
So maybe its prequel all maybe
its original sciencefiction movie
that sort trades stock
focuses story
That said things
I loved Jons work
was interested
idea Engineers
I think frankly
brought aboard
because uh time
I working script
I movie produced
And view
studio head untested
It happened
homestretch
Like think were ready go um
studio thoughts
They like Lets dial Alien
monsters lean Engineers
And Lets known writer
bring home
Uh which course l didnt love
unproduced writer time
I told expect
beginning
So I wasnt surprised
And talked number writers
and Damon guy got it
view
and love story
was understand soul
and happy carry forward
spirit far
Maybe its day later
theyre trudging silo
Uh birth silvertish
comes body
of Engineer comes her
I think thats end end
The idea taking Alien
which essentially cool
ln space hear scream
its terrifying thematic level
its kind ofjust is
To suddenly say
Now lets start play
incredibly heady ideas
just philosophically speaking
God universe
And then know say
Heres bunch humans
that seeking race beings
created life Earth
And theyre bringing
synthetic human theyve created
You couple
different generations
And character David
ship them
who basically perspective of
Hey l hang creators
time
And disappointed
I honest you
Suddenly bringing mix
which
Jons draft
I felt like Okay
lets thing creation
And opened tremendous
doors
And certainly movie
I think Ridley wanted along
SCOTT
They religious
Because story
them
Yeah Right
God them
MAX What discovered
explained movie
So kind blank canvas
us
LlNDELOF
I write alone
And case
its l love television much
because its
collaborative writing process
Since movie
I working alone
um uh Ridley guy
I cowrote movie with
SPAIHTS You creating
characters tale
but world
universe live
And youre crafting spaceships
planetoids
technology events
cant happen world
Youre inventing cloth
alien species
Their language cataclysmic fate
Um thats great big canvas paint on
LlNDELOF We intense story sessions
course probably weeks
At hours hours
time days week
before I went
generated draft
which l wrote quickly
l clear understanding
going scene scene
And course
I cant think head
of brilliant visual director
working medium right now
especially kind movie
And l sit listen
to Ridley described
saw scenes visually
And I kind
figure out
what characters saying
other
or moments
SPAIHTS To engaged act
world creation huge turnon writer
And that
engaged collaboration
with filmmaker magnitude
skill Ridley Scott
and team assembled
its gift
Hey doing
English  US  SDH
Hey doing
Science fiction harder
ancient world example
Whereas science fiction
invented
MESSING
We tried truthful film
but moments
unique new
Some color
lighting
and opening atmosphere
and giving scale depth
environment
PROCTER lts aesthetic choice
Ridley Its thematic choice
And job kind
thematic choice visually palatable
and workable
His attitude creating similar
way paint actually
Which lot creating accidents
misdirection
You know trying way
creating thats usual way
SCOTT Monsters difficult
goddamn hideous monster
has explored
Monsters These beautiful
Until somebody comes
thats different You go Thats different
MAX lt like thinktank room
set in
in building adjacent
Ridleys offices
So come participate
Everybody voice heard
room
I mean camlever here
You structural post
cam levers way
Then need
hit ground
MAX
The walls lined artwork
We started walls
and slowly ran space
times
The discussions
roundtable discussions
Everybody opinion
I thinking that tentacles
having moving around
Yeah Yeah Mmhm mmhm
would good acting
It options thats all
SCOTT The design things
I enjoyed doing
And so Arthur Max
finding team
he got designers
kind cyberworld designers
They design stuff
marvelous laptops
Arthur chose literally handpicked
I think honestly
five best business
Absolutely superlative capabilities
And l draw
And theres
reference photographs
Arthur I work lot
reference photographs saying
Like this like that like that
Physically like this like that
And youre suddenly getting
absolute points reference
saying Do sketch this
I know l didnt like
lve before
So
looks slightly different
Its hard
Thats great little sketch
Yeah
Thank God art school
PAGE Yeah
MESSING We meetings
Jon Spaihts come in
and work Arthur
Ridley too
It interesting
Ive experience
where director sit
literally draw
And I draw draw
Then hed say What think this
And wed flesh
hed draw it
Very people true artists
industry
and them
You know design
movie time
LEVY We lot
pressure us
And wasnt given anybody
aside us
But wanted visually
to tie universes
universe
And difficulty exactly that
one
youre like trucker type
environment thats raw
and bulky things like that
And tie universe
thats sharp
and designly detailed
And tricky so
without feeling like
gonna disappoint fans
I mean fans ofAlien
dont want disappoint
Its got control buildup
liquid calcium thousand years
Although supposed
highly secretive room
with warning signs door
do enter authorized
people came went freely
ideas changed
as people came went
encountered latest thinking
And open forum
discussion
That was I think healthy fertile
SCOTT l regular basis
period months actually
designing absoluteness
landscapes
the interior ships rooms
suits
the creatures see
Everything designed
people
Hello
MAN Hi
PROCTER Ridley come with
You knew Ridley coming
because tray red wine
glasses everyone
Oh l guess Ridleys gonna come by
Ha ha
I love conglomeration
people headsets
PROCTER To working
grand franchise
you wouldnt necessarily expect
process intimate
and kind friendly was
It nice
You A attitude
MEN CHUCKLE
And thought great
These storyboards
drawn Ridley
Some simple diagrams
helping think set designs
ideas
for intercutting characters
and actions locations
movie
And its blueprint
a simple blueprint stage
to plan movie
I got lucky way I came
guy called HR Giger
29 30 years ago
And Giger picture
I thought was
Thats it That it
Hed it lt book
SCANLAN We know ultimate sense
Weve seen point
To
sort comforting way saying
we hold
Gigertype elements
We hold purity
original
but time
try bring new elements
things necessarily backward
were
but similar DNA
SCOTT How doing
This Laura
MAX
We met Giger personally
He came presentation
designs
and hoped react positively
you know wanted
impressed done
We discussed
fresco panels
based designs
movie
that used
Ridley turned
drawings
Said know Can
shapes designs
Ridley felt important
involve Giger design film
and wanted involve
way could
The question is
hes space suit
without helmet
head start change
MESSING We trying things
vein him
even
definite departures
But appreciated that
definitely
Even pieces said
know Thats mine
This Genesis
This flight suit
pressure suit
Its nice huh Theres pressure suit
Yeah yeah
But l took this yours
Yeah
to say slide that
shell
Uhhuh
Thats shell
This looks like baby
A bad baby
GRUNTS
Anyway its thought
SCOTT He saw I doing l think
thought l far road
I think bit amazed
things changed now
how fast things moving
And honestly
quickly on
Theres couple drawings
kind interesting
but fundamentally l didnt time
I move
But l hope likes film
its based original id
Or origins film
guy chair
who space jockey
HR Giger
The pilot chamber like sacred cow
Alien tradition
and great trepidation
I approached design that
And concept artists
high priests science fiction
and extremely critical
outrageous
to applied icon
their holy holies
the space jockey chair chamber
PROCTER Essentially l tried
close possible
to original movies version
Giger done
Gigers original illustrations
that preceded sculpt
original movie
but incorporated
know new functional requirements
that simply seen movie
MESSING A lot research went
recreating chair
And know thought
archival reference
and just
We blueprints We didnt
We dig deep reference
to reconstruct chair
accurately could
And
kind grew that
And design changes
challenging
but consistent original
task
PROCTER The thing articulate
vertically come floor
as giant vertical thing
tips down
introduces different set
concerns
for layout parts
Giger some know
geartoothed kind arcing elements
and feeling articulation
sets rods
that support cannon end
definitely startingoff point
for allowing kind action
figured out
Okay that
parts kind it
Which ones move Which ones dont
And layers know work
I able actually produce
rigged model
of thing work
We shifted emphasis
biological forms
that Giger tended play up
We played down
and went
mechanical forms
Sometimes definitely clash
production designer
where see example
Engineer architecture
in basements know
He thats
monolithic very simple
and Ben Steve l wed
Gigerish approach know
Which organic
and more
I say shocking
and almost l mean weird
know
You design ways
mixture that
Of monolithic architectural
giant monolithic Gigerish world
But way l think created
interesting look
MESSING
In chamber room pods
We ton versions David
and I ended kind taking
fleshing details it
And Ridley wasnt sure He wanted
orient it know head toe
Where Engineers sleeping
How facing
Why here
And ended up said
You know what
We
telescoping know pilot chair
and itd great story moment
sleeping pods
but dont know purpose it
In Ridleys mind
different spaceship
Maybe is maybe isnt
Maybe hes changing it
He doesnt need explain
hes it lts story
SCOTT
It skeleton chair
And I said
Well no wasnt It suit
Said You think space suits
conventional fashion
If Im telling wasnt skeleton
fact was Not exoskeleton
Its organic suit thats is
Im gonna opens
whats inside
because whats inside humanoid
LEVY
My reaction horrified
I thinking
Hes taking cult thing
and it
This cant work
And I think thats best
He takes
think know
and turns upside down
MESSING Its probably
iconic figures scifi history
When Ridley talking
idea having human figure
representing space jockey character
pretty hated it
HUANTE He seen sculpture
I done
and character
was know completely lopsided
and muscular blown out
loved it
The photograph
I took was uh
It hot So just
You know looked ghostly
MESSING It interesting didnt think
appropriate
But then know storyline
progressed Ridley really
You know
confident this
He gonna
No gonna change mind
It retains that
but looks helmetlike
Yeah Yeah Yes
SCANLAN We Engineer
elephantine Engineer
because trunk
Its suit Engineers wear
in order able travel space
And theyre that
theyre wearing pressure suit
So design Engineer
driven perspective
that actually big discovery
isnt creature right
This suit
This worn being
MAX l think Ridley interesting
creators that
He kept quoting Bible passage
And God created man
image
SCOTT l thought
youre gonna biblical it
then religion erased memory
Was God
son God
or visitations
superior beings
Warrior priests something Mmhm
Exactly right
And
slightly ominous
which pair
hightech shoes Boots
MAX
We got Neville Page involved
Neville specializes creature design
And introduced
physical anatomy
that brief Ridley
that shouldnt like
bodybuilder musculature
It like classical statuary
When look them
theyre compact
and overdeveloped
but exaggerated detail
And try express those
and overlay
classical veneer
to godlike
PAGE I spent lot time developing
know ultimate head
which classicalart driven
We kept looking da Vincis work
bulky husky body
the strong nose small lips
You know like
The names thrown David
David sculpture
the Statue Liberty Elvis Presley
And hear brief
youre like
What hell I gonna do Ha ha
I understood though
look images go
Oh l it l it
Its specific mouth
nose eyes
MAX He wanted be
strange sort way beautiful
and frightening
Frightening comes attitude
ELLENBERG
The camera test Engineer
he scared people walking around
Not anything
It unsettling
Because feel
The effect going for
in creating design Engineers
manifested reality
Which is deeply unsettling
kind superhuman
kind vacant eyes
blackened eyes
looking
looking kind upset you
The way felt
like angry father
or angry parent troubling
It was know lit room
It like fancy
It scary
All actors got experience
got interact actor
and dialogue characters
talk blank screen
RAPACE I like its
kind attractive way
because theyre beautiful
You wanna closer
wanna touch way
You wanna kind embraced
makes interesting
SCOTT
I dont like repeat myself
so youre constantly evolving
guys
who great creators
right
So frequently well talk scribble
saying
No like this like that
Weve got marvelous wealth
of encyclopedic wealth information
laptop
Like designed thing
called Trilobite
by going deepsea things
and looking things
marvelous details
Gods best designer world
You cant better God
I think know Carlos Huantes
Neville Page Neal Scanlans team
did good job trying
monumental task
of
level Alien
which was know
impossible
Can l combination
veins plus this
Because changing cranium
SCANLAN Holloways infected
He impregnates Shaw
and that Shaw gives birth
sense
to MedPod creature
which extracted
stomach
That grows Trilobite
Whats sort happening
tangent Fifield
And Fifields exposed gloop
begins through
a sort of know transformation
independent that
and
Fifield creature
And ultimately Engineer
crossed Trilobite
gives deacon
penultimate
As far film concerned
penultimate combination this
SCOTT The idea biting umbilical
MAN Yeah
Think its much
MAN l think its know interesting
idea European version
The evolutions emerge them
evolve higher higher forms
illustrated here
eventually leading
original Giger alien
So were basically attempting
deconstruct Gigers alien
and evolved
humanoid host
both Earthly humans
and space jockey Engineer species
HUANTE I go Oh
precursor facehugger
that looks like centipede thing
is
Centipede facehugger
whos got like fingers
This thing crawls
thats thing attacks guy
Grabs him grabs arm
Then cool 1 970s
sciencefiction astronaut
you know looking arm
This thing grabbed hand
and know thatd cool right
And I know Ridleys that
He gets that
SCANLAN The MedPod creature
baby form
Hes embryotic form
baby form this
And Ivan Manzella
number sketches
and designs ZBrush
And showed Ridley
I think got lucky
We showed Ridley something said
Yeah thats great
And design early
and gave blueprint
later
He worked design
The fact tentacles
fused initially
and split
continue split
to create tentacles later
This Ivan
Hes working MedPod creature
which obviously taken Shaw
MedPod sequence
Were inside little room room
really sort fortress
The work goes
concept design creatures
Were working designs
UK
were designs
worked States
And sort comes
sort weekly visit Ridley
where sit table
Ridley sketch pad
and
sort work progress
He adds elements feels
points right direction
and carry going
There creature
Carlos I
were kind batting forth
another
When I given Carlos image
work with
Ridley said
Just it
You know Give the
What think alien look like
This particular
The baby referred to
So I its verb
Gigered hell it
and brought in proud punch
that its like yeah
feels like Gigers aesthetic
And Ridley like
No No no thats all
Man place
Fifield
I think I actually spent time
Fifield
Ridley wanted variations
Carlos thing did
which baby face
And babyface character
Fifield
was gonna inverted legs
bit tail
It like very quick morph
Fifield monster
Oh best
Carlos drawing
PAGE Thats mark one Thats original
SCOTT Thats best Yep
The concern was lot it
Ridleys feelings
looked like goblin
As soon that
doesnt work somehow
Its got goblin Somehow its goblin
SCANLAN lt looks bit like Gollum
SCOTT Yeah
Its better Gollum actually
And took Fifield
infected
still humanoid
limb length grow
and needed
features
which again
thats real tough balance
because soon start morph
creature disappear
So talked tattoo
and making tattoo be
face body
and having
allow us
to basically its Fifield
Martin saw earlier
is working
sort Fifield designs
And again Ridley those
back his
sculpting process
PAGE At point clear
were trying Gigers aesthetic
We werent gonna facehugger
and werent going
kind metaphor film
But time
Trilobite creature
became like ubermetaphor
facehugger way
Because its tentacular
its way somewhat sexual
And honestly one
when l
kind face it one
it vulvas
Ive design Ha ha
It celebration vulvas really
appropriate
Its way
organic mechanism works
The fact seven tentacles
that struggle
while
because didnt wanna
octopus
And images
beginning
where looked like octopus
But end
pose I did
to sense of one locomotion
and look like power
strength tentacles
to actually lift ground
How powerful look
And combination
Wetas efforts Alex Alvarez
I looked thought
This things pretty badass
The deacon ultramorph
I think really beginning
Carlos kind nailed it
There couple versions
alien l
The Xenomorph ultramorph
became
That I lt straight
Gigers paintings
I embellished little couple things
but l kept close stuff
I could
You to He invented look
SCANLAN Sometimes l think
impressions best
I remember joined project
drawing existence
of silvery
metalliclooking deacon
The deacon description
point head
lying pool fluid
impressionistic
but great
And I think went
different alternatives
When came it
better thing
That caught something
PAGE Ninetyfive percent efforts
production
are things
theyre correct
And thats these
mistakes
but finding work
those stepping stones
building blocks
to right thing
English  US  SDH
PROCTER Alien know visual
people like landmark watershed thing
I mean reinvented look
sciencefiction movies forever
When watch youre artist
visual person level visual craft
and the know articulation
whats going frame
and motion light its done
BURG
I got feeling right away
that I dont think Ridley Scott
wants rehash familiar territory
He wanted capture effect
Alien
He gonna elements
present new way
The stylings working
reminiscent Nostromo
and lot Alien 1 aesthetic
time
just know covering broader
palette different kinds things
MAX You flashy hardware
means nothing its
How apply story
and fit whole
so youre creating
environment
thats credible entertaining
GASPlNG
I cast development
human technology
First thing l started excavation
They excavation pods
They kind like submersibles
They hovering around
I assumed Mars
And theyre digging
They shear cliff
hieroglyphs
They approach Weyland funding
Weyland doesnt office
like office building
So idea
enormous habitat
you know like huge space station
So travel sort shuttle
land
and developed enormous
biosphere kind thing
It huge ring farmland lakes
things inside it
And idea Weyland
developing
Hes basically developing solar system
MESSING
Prometheus actually called
Originally early script
called Magellan
and voyage trying
discover uncharted territories
And Ridley decided
Prometheus
after named movie
MAX The Prometheus flagship
Weyland fleet
Weyland character whos chairman
board corporation its ship
And ship decided
gonna stateoftheart
with conceivable facility
including penthouse suite
cuttingedge medical facility
communication systems
scanning systems
infinite capacity
entering hostile planetary climates
PROCTER
Good production design heavily driven
by basic volumes spaces
and needs
cameras gonna do
and functional aspects
storytelling
that Arthur able
guidance needed things
and little bit of know
kind icing filigree scifi techy stuff
that help with
didnt mean
that wasnt guiding ship terms
components needed
and big ought
else
Specifically its ship exploration
thats got lot equipment
What Arthur Ridley said that
you know
thing lands opens up
and like mobile factory
You know its like complex
And l started thinking
oil exploration ships oil rigs
Theyre huge platforms
float big legs
And sort
starting point shape
MAX
I wanted kind animal aspect
like insect land
but level
image overlaying it
It wasnt aircraft
It kind identity aircraft
Great big cargo bays
like insects carry young
under belly like spiders do
And pods open
modular pods
carried underbelly
gigantic gantry crane
that able fly freestand
Probably difficult thing
design
was fact winds standing
giant pillars
which engines
cant fly way
It pretty clear engines
change orientation
The Nostromo
propulsion engines
and engines
landing engines
And I thought Well were gonna
thing around
what theres main engines
use everything
We ended design
engines legs landing legs
PROCTER The kind functional parameters
wanted four
you know VTOL vectoring engines
feeling creature
kind sitting landscape
big legs
you know desires clearly
strong Ridley Arthur both
that I knew l adapted
Steves incorporate that
And frankly Steves models
extremely close concept
And detailing pass
It figuring
whats surface breakup detailing
that thing
scale needs its huge
And fairly aeronautic shape
that makes look like know
atmospheric flying vehicle
I mean Nostromo like box
It chunky didnt
It looked like land planet
but meant fly
planet one
really longdistance sorties
planet atmosphere
But time
wanted feel bit like Alien 1
At mind
thats I wanted feel like
And wanted sense scale
that traditionally got by know
kitbashing tons little tank parts
and battleship parts kinds stuff
miniature models
And l took kind
study pictures Nostromo
and I literally kitbash
Photoshop
whole chunks Nostromo skin
and lay illustrations
exact kind of
you know pipe conduits running
surface kind stuff
The landing foot piece
Terex mining bulldozers shovel bit
and pieces World War Il
German sort train tanks
and kinds crazy stuff
I mean I literally old methods
MAX We tried graphics steroids
one
Very bold enormous scale
including exterior Prometheus
which kind based graphics
fighter aircrafts
and bombers World War lI
PROCTER
I huge number color schemes
Ended stuff stronger
l initially comfortable with
in terms yellow stripes
things influenced by
beautiful Messerschmitts
different fighters World War Il
But l use yellow
and use white black
graphically its worked well
And whats neat relate
early concept work
of Chris Foss Ron Cobb
Alien 1 
Then l worked
human interior sets
whether WeylandVickers suite
which lifeboat
lives ship
or medical bay mess hall
or cryosleep systems
the bridge ship
cool idea
that Ridley kind brought
Alien 1 extruding platform
which like Ashs station
Nostromo
but were it
know bridge
MAX The bridge area
actually looked design work
that original film
Now Nostromo saw
saw film screened
I began appreciate claustrophobia
jammed spaces were
In fact Ridley mentioned
difficult film in
but rich
tight enclosed
At time wanted
sense scale version
so large intimate
PROCTER
You know bridge design Prometheus
is actually kind Ron Cobb
bridge design Alien 1
that got split things
It got split bridge
Ashs pod
but originally sketched one
and actually kind returned
way Ron Cobb form
SCOTT
You got desk cockpit
the main desk Janek pilot
copilots
and feed corridors that
its limited
Youd amazed
eke budget
because sets quality
costly
Its knowing exactly want
And know exactly want
youre gonna kind maintain budget
If dont know want say
l need it thats goes up
MAX
We wanted window
So decided introduce
gigantic wraparound windscreen
multifaceted kind tradition
stealth bomber technology
very jewellike faceted
wrapping skull
insect carapace
and tucked chin were
include
a gangplank viewing platform
captain
and stand able look
planets surface you
as cruised over
PROCTER We definitely gave thought
different components interiors
fit ship general
A huge youre
worried youre building sets
is fits stages
build in
and whats height
whats visualeffects needs
of far away green screens are
The bridge good example
set lot height
and mounted
certain distance certain angles
down glass looking
people its got
You know needs giant clearance
greenscreen lighting it
and know 270
MAX And
engineering bellows
which big rubber
gasketed vibration pads
so turbulent vibration
came atmosphere
and rock ship
And implied
elements design
ie roof attached walls
Are corridors attached
main space
And decided that
detach evertyhing other
so bit free
jostle jangle
but didnt know
behave
I thought start oscillating
control smash bits
Fortunately didnt occur
Then design vehicles
explore planet
because end
archeological scientific expedition
So vehicles able cope
with kind inhospitable
environment imagine
And actually
functioning vehicle
And vehicle six
It interesting different
movies
which military
The goal worked
rover vehicles
was kind design reflects
like National Geographic
You know team explorers
military
It explorers
had like high money
in order build vehicles
thats technically sharp
MAX We ended building
large rovers ATVs
which practical
locations
We wanted go
know 50 miles hour
with dozen people onboard
SCOTT So designed
interior buses
The buses driven electronics
theres screens
Theres million screens
feasible space ship
and outside vehicles
MAX So went military course
best toys
And got
different chassis
and concept designs
sketch form
to present Ridley
went month
We got load notions
basically went
from vehicles passengers
sitting outside
others hovered flew
So freeranging
design phase embraced kinds of
We didnt wanna limits Ridley
saying know This possible
And picked basic ideas
and gave famous
Ridleygram sketches
to discuss
shape language was
and developed there
We ended Czechoslovakian
surplus chassis
a vehicle called Tatra 8x8
which allterrain allwheel steering
brokenaxel
highspeed military transport vehicle
and designed body shell that
based armored personnel carrier
Not gonna
battle scenes
but thinking scientists
explorers unknown planets
would prepared
encounter anything
We got
Czechoslovakia
stripped
old truck bodies
and blasted great hurry
constraints time
I think took 1 1 weeks build
scratch got chassis
Most car companies year
develop design
and year actually come
single prototype vehicle
So gives sense
accelerated film process is
A body shell lot input
Ridley
about nuance proportions
windows angles
so aggressive character
great visibility
and accessorized
LED lighting
We wanted stateoftheart
film lighting
so lighting custom designed
installed
Every element vehicle
scratch
including body shell
interior paneling seating
and applied
basic Tatra chassis
PROCTER lts people
Ridley story about
what crazy biotechnological
alien race look like function like
Its that
Its kind religious pursuit
main character
and quest answers
MAX There lot craftsmen
lot artists lot technicians
art directors set designers draftspersons
worked me
And craft skills
brought
and devotion work
brought
it wouldnt movie is
PROCTER
Ridley created universe
is precious
anybody planet
You know
thats written stone
and gone
incredible life franchise
and series comic books
kind stuff
To Ridley
I think hes aware things
but fundamentally
its job 1 970s
Its came with
And thats is
change it
English  US  SDH
BELL RINGS

RAPACE
Ridley said point
l fantastic actors parts
You know smallest part
THERON
I think loves process

and elaborate
amazing page
MARSHALLGREEN
Im fanboy ofAlien
Of Ridley Scotts universe
And its reasons Im actor
want tell kinds stories
WEYLAND
you reached final destination
My experience futuristic films
Space Virgins Planet Sex
It real learning curve
Right then Okay
Yeah thats right
And little bit longer
SCOTT l watching film called
Girl Dragon Tattoo
which l thought particularly
done one
So I interested director
but l interested girl
lead Noomi Rapace
And I thought Noomi particularly
combination intelligence physicality
Thats good Yeah view
Like this
SCOTT
Yeah thats nice
Yeah Good butt Okay
So come front
RAPACE He mentioned way
gonna prequel Alien
or kind prequel
I like Wow fantastic
But l l deleted afterwards like
Thats gonna happen anyway
I kind high meeting
hes amazing person
and presence strong
So I called manager I like
Even I work him lm happy
l hour him
SCOTT She kind owned
Dragon Tattoo
And I surprised
beautiful intelligent
very elegant woman
And that
got good start
ELLENBERG The studio naturally knew
Noomi Rapace point big star
SCOTT
Sit
ELLENBERG And
lot discussion debate
So shoot test ultimately
The studio requested it
There also standpoint
I legitimate question
Could speak English
Hello Mr Weyland
Im Dr lsabelle Shaw
ELLENBERG
That gang got together
for moment movie
exciting Dariusz Wolski
That day Ridley
Dariusz worked together
You thought
worked 20 years
We shot camera tests
liked lot it
It kind challenging
warehouse There sets nothing
ELLENBERG
Arthur Max super simple
We Panavision storage room
Pinewood
but gave kind industrial
creepy vibe
WOLSKl We completely improvised
whatever
I LED lights later
theme film
I need know thing said
ripped head off
Noomi great She killed scenes
saw ferocity
Dont talk father
ELLENBERG The power
screen presence kind came out
And Fox credit
decided Ridleys vision
You said
figure navigation
FASSBENDER Theres
interesting quality her
Theres toughness there
theres vulnerability her
which l think Sigourney
one interesting
You know theres sort maternal
her
but theres sort of
know warrior
You need do
Everything
YATES With Noomi
fortunate lookwise
that actually
Because access great deal
And it
So went single look
Hahaha
RAPACE
I many costume fittings
I need able
free time
even need
kind equipment on
We went futuristic look
We went Star Trek type look
We went diagonals
We went Eastern looks
We basically came down
And this
to wearing flight suit
Dont photograph above
Youre photographing here
Yeah Yeah
Photograph here right
Because looks bit
See lm looking like Okay
There go See thats a
RAPACE Ridleys very
You know clear vision
When were working
scenes costumes
and little detail
its like knows wants
But hes open time
l come something
hes ready kind try
think it
So felt like
finding look together
And mission its practical
so l wanted hair
didnt need fix
She hadnt anything
So blond
well thats good
I agree
But its kind of
The dark makes much
Yeah
Go straight
close me
And opposite to
Good skin color
Vickers yeah
So balance finding
soft
but hardcore boyish
masculine
And Ive red
And Nana
fantastic hairdresser have
she brought different wigs
red
I like Wow well maybe not
And Ridley saw like
No l dont think so Not red
And popped like
Oh wow yeah Hahaha
The red looks good
Her persona
red hair has
is completely different persona
blond
So impact
Just linear function
clothing
Shes got long lines
shes got functionality
and shes basically practical dresser
lNDISTlNCT CHATTER
SCOTT Finding Holloway l dont know
difficult
So I took long time casting
important
and know equivalent
Noomi funny kind way
believing couple
both level intelligence
thats gotta real
Finally Avy Kaufman came guy
Logan MarshallGreen
a New York actor whod
stage particular moment
Done couple films prior that
stage actor
MARSHALLGREEN
I didnt know I getting into
I auditioned scene Ridley

THERON l heard film
actually talked Ridley it
just kind knowing
I wasnt available it
but l interested

And I remembered dinner

impressed it
Then film
I supposed pushed
Ridley it
And I traveling time
and sent script
I read it
and I came LA
got phone
and good discussion it
And kind built way
kind talking lot
And I went London sat
bit Damon writer
SCOTT
Vickers company person well
who kind fundamentally
isolated crew
by makeup is
and shes
company person
She lives apartment
onboard ship Prometheus
which frankly grace
Fifth Avenue apartment New York
THERON The way kind set
right beginning that
its clear evident
theres alternative agenda
or theres truthfully
spoken her
This Vickers
Shes bit enigma l think
mystery l liked
This beautiful ensemble cast
And kind try
elements character
that kind sets apart rest
And I like
ways character
that kind goes
fights everything
that everybody
excited about
Hey I said doing
This ship
I told home
She witch
Shes ice queen
You terrible lay way
It vision
look sculptural possible
So beautiful
beautiful silk mohair suit
in ice silver
obviously way go
THERON l feel like
l kind build character
happens
Wardrobe Hair Makeup
When said l wanna build suit
I thought Corporate suit
And ended
incredible futuristic
Its like sharkskin silver gray shiny
This suit fitted
inch body
But
putting jacket on
that almost like feel like
I throwing out
because I on
kind sucked posture
that Vickers
And I jacket
like Vickers came alive
MAN
Fourteen Charlie two A mark
SCOTT The male housekeeper
onboard ship called David
He creation
Weyland Corporation
We dont hide fact Alien 1
know character there
who played Ian Holm
and moment
hidden agenda company
So I thought hide fact
itll fun everyones sleeping
for number of
The distance ship take
David
keeping eye things
Im king world
SCOTT One best actors weve got
right Michael Fassbender
And I pointblank asked him
And read script pointblank
said yes it
My instruction Michael
I think l said
You know essence youre servant
So combination
massive mental capability
at time having
servile
gives rise actually
pretty humorous
I think hes humorous
FASSBENDER
What l wanting work
with David
ambiguity him
I want like guy
thats annoying know
Like ls taking piss
real
And I want that Its like
dont know whats going on
That sort ambiguity want
audience well
where theyre sure know
ls agenda Has robot got
know human feelings
So trying sort
address areas correctly
Michael Fassbenders
best actors lve worked with
He immediate access
things takes
on good day hours actors
And notsogood day months
for actors
He real raw talent
Got it Genius Now cut
Hahaha
SCOTT
Action
How long
Sixteen inches fully erect
It varies its relaxed
Lets get
Where like me here
Id like remove pants first
Certainly
THERON LAUGHS
Make quick
Its wires The wires everywhere
MAN Cut it
HUMS
Morning
FASSBENDER
Theres easy relationship set
Everybodys having fun
sort getting it
That thing bypass surgery
What need for Bypass surgery
ALL LAUGHING
There young fresh cast
weve got
you know heavy sort Oscarwinners
Sort of Charlize Theron
And plays Vickers
whos like coldhearted bitch
And shes nice David either
I dont think is
Basically wanted sort
immaculate blond sideparting
and evertyhing precise him
In terms outfit Janty
came sort totalitarian
sort fascisttype
sort uniform
you know
place
YATES He actually going barefoot
need anything
But line script
gets space suit
and conform
normal human apparel
we kept fine lines
Very
Again linear look
matches character really
Just jackets allinone
troublefree
And end
flipflop option
LlNDELOF I feel like
coolness David
really evoked
Fassbenders previous work
As opposed saying
This its gonna be
Because playing role
synthetic human
just opened creative doors
greatest thing ever
so its like words
coming mouth
dont feel like
theyre words l wrote
Theyre words Fassbender
whispering ear
as l typing computer
MAN
Seventynine Charlie four
Im captain
Janek ld worked
American Gangster
Idris Elba
And Idris ld admired stuff
I need strong guy
guy fly ship
Id believe him ld buy him
into probably expilot
kind joined up
with Weyland Corporation
long hauls
Fortunately me said yes
I thrilled bits
And evolves
right acts
finally turning bomb
bring juggernaut
The set characters film
kind vast
I think Ridleys
interesting set cast
You watch people
believe them
And Ridleys good directing
actors like team
Or not
FASSBENDER Then youve got Rafe Spall
Sean Harris
two English actors
l aware work
And theyre great guys
They great pair
I think theyre gonna be again bringing
lot comedy element film
And dynamic
organic loose
And thats great thing Ridley
He allows offpage stay onpage
want really
And works works
If doesnt doesnt
You know theres pressure
Then weve got Kate Dickie
Red Road
I saw her blew away film
Every morning insert
Michael Fassbenders head body
in order perform
Every night goes home
bloody head falls off
I forget creator
Yeah Guys blast l mean
sort end telling jokes day
Check Checks Checks
Union Hey union
Bathing feet
I think fun day
Three Brazilian swimwear models

Only two
Thats I find
Like l Pygmies
Brazilian swimwear models
waiting room sir
And hes like Only Pygmies Haha
LAUGHlNG
Hes easy work with
Hes consummate professional
I mean again
work speaks himself
Meredith Ive despised
sarcastic attitude
I happy him
He can Guy play anything
And seriously intelligent
I mean genius
A man whos kind combination of
know
Edison Bill Gates Steve Jobs
PEARCE
Hes billionaire megalomaniac
Hes man thinks outside
square
And lot people life
lot people dont facility
or finance able
actually act that
I believe feels weve gotten
close were getting closer
that its actually possible discover
actually created us
You know process
I was
quite lot prosthetic makeup
order look old
You know basically
1 00year mark
So important way
look realistic possible
Which know Prosthetics team
incredible job
but takes hours
makeup chair there
I lot younger
I sat makeup chair
LAUGHlNG
Just indication bloody long
weve sitting here
PEARCE The difficult thing playing
somebody whos lot older yourself
is people know old l am
know I look like
so theres gonna
scrutiny anyway
Im hiding away
I mean I remember saying Ridley
Why arent casting
old bloke
But important time
somebody
who sort youthful quality
I suppose comes through
And I talk David
room maybe l wander forward
PEARCE But time manage
seemingly realistic
May I rest peace
CHUCKLES
YATES
How l started Prometheus
was
vast quantities research
And screamed me
Prototype prototype prototype
soon possible
Ridley adamant
wanted avoid
the puffy space suit
NASA space suit
SCOTT lt cant bulky
Its gotta practical They athletic
By then wont
walking suits
which fat
warm
Youll evolution capabilities
then theyll probably skintight
He loved skinny look NASA
undersuits 60s silver
And loved look
linear look
It interesting really
More technical
And plus gave actors
lot chance mobile
Under space suit
basically layers
there neoprene underundersuit
SCOTT
And action
GRUNTS
YATES And its form biosuit airprene
neoprene breathes
So actors hot
And able buy
amazing neoprene Taiwan
with beautiful pattern it
And tubes
monitor blood
that monitor oxygen levels
monitor heart rate
were attached orange tubing
body
And its thing beauty
SCOTT
Action
Im excited neoprene ones
ones orange
You know rubber ones
They dont seen often
Theyre supposed blue
And beautifully beautiful
molded amazing
SCOTT l figured then
youll bubble head
Why gonna create helmet
youve got blind spots
Thats ridiculous
When wanna that
want globe
because plastic
absolutely bulletproof
Youre gonna helmet
blind spots all
And helmet theyve got
video screens big like postage stamps
Each works there look at
know Fifield Millburn
If wanna talk him
glance them
Around neck technology
whisper ear time
YATES
To start helmet
the globe specific Ridleys
design eggshaped
which oval
globe dome
that Ive seen helmet before
And integral helmet
are working video screens
X tech
played them
What weve got
kind basic shells
being fitted
internal dashboards LCD screens
and associated electronics
drive screens here
the screens domes
YATES There lighting suit lighting
cameraman light face
So batches LEDs
installed
PEARMAlN Also effects
there
to mimic flickering screens
faces
YATES Theres air run fans
battery packs backpack
They blow air sort globe
dont die Hahaha
Theyre wired sound miked
Its atmosphere David
Im walking
head
SHAW
Charlie please dont this Please
YATES In movie corporate
presence Weyland logo
Weve single piece metal
armor
Its boots
They Weyland logo Tshirt issue
thats stock
spacecraft
They trousers
overstitched
And jackets
lot overstitching
The background
Prometheus patch
is based Prometheus
fallen angel
and wings outspread
and hes looking universe
hoping back
Something manufacturing
breathable air there That mate
is terraforming
No no The bet came here
PEARCE
It great group
Fassbenders genius
I mean Ive worked
couple actors year
and Fassbender extraordinary
Noomi fantastic
Really lovely incredibly downtoearth
Charlize hilarious She kept talking
winning Oscar time
You kind live Gypsy life
bunch strangers
and theres
amazing that
if that know
enjoy that
English  US  SDH
ELLENBERG Every set movie
prepared rolling basis
And movie scale
level design terrifying
You walk set sets there
its there Its green screen anything
Its literally there And know
youve walked set
And absolutely Thats alien
Youre alien environment
FASSBENDER One thing sort blow
away immediately sets film
And Ive definitely sets
like l dont think
I future
Ridleys decision kind evertyhing
practical
and build like greatest alien
playground world
it makes movie feel like
its companion piece
earlier movie
because thats Alien
These things 40 feet high
Some sets 300 feet long
SCOTT
The set proscenium
When walk morning
importance costume
the importance set
importance environment
I think evertyhing
England attractive place
20 percent spend
So its great tax rebate
Youre working same
know
talented artisans chippies carpenters
highly skilled plasterers
highly skilled painters
The team there
The bag goodies
England is
I think best world
anywhere
Always covering categories
trades
Its trade passes art
And also working English crews
kind nice You know its good fun
Go cup tea
operators here
SCOTT We ended Pinewood is
That set is
Ive worked
l Legend
So Bond stage course
40 percent longer
than H stage Shepperton
So I fundamentally booked
Bond stage 1 0 months
And stages
So had And backlot
Enough backlot
pretty marvelous stuff
from belly Prometheus
Youve got garage
lowers down
Its like hangarsized
Out ATVs come
buses
which people planet
And green screen
ELLENBERG We greenlit basically
end October
and shooting it know
week March
With built Zero
We designed lot
great
but built nothing
Because months
madcap process
where set done struck
wed start one
and ready days prior
next
So massive epic movie like this
it degree factory
precision remarkable
HUFFAM Our actual prep time
got actual goahead filming
was short scale film
So having
huge pressure time
Also here London its very busy
Stage space availability
good us
So stage weve worked
work set
its minimum work
work three
MAX The Bond stage biggest stage
Europe
Still wasnt big
lot them
And decided extend
long
This sets
size matter
And Im sure Ridley its big
its big enough
We lot them
We built roof entryway
created stage stage
Thats combine
interior pyramid structure
we chambers corridors
suggesting scale
combined interior
juggernaut
which basically ship similar
crashed derelict ship
the croissant ship movie
Additional 1 50 feet
very beneficial
because thats entrance
cave
We careful
space
because gonna
space
because juggernaut enormous
scale
compared Prometheus
More twice big
And figure
combine
with digital extension
3D modeling
how create
sense scale
SCOTT l designed Bond stage Arthur
massive complex
from minute walk
I hives
theyre kind domes
And l going scale
evertyhing big
So Bond stage chalk chalk
It jammed
KEENE We got big sets
vying space
There space left there
Theres barely space crew
BELL RINGS
MAN
Rolling
KEENE
Were fighting other
trying little corner
certain monitor
A little corner table
equipment
Lets start getting everybody way
doesnt need here
LlNDELOF The set l went
interior ship
Of Prometheus So science lab
built number corridors
And I walked video village
Ridley sitting there
with 3D glasses
HD screens
Each
different camera
I looked I like
Oh God like
actually happening
FASSBENDER Walking spaceship
feel like youre walking spaceship
The Art Department carpenters
guys have
put work
stunning job
Mm
ELLlOTT On day walked set
I think mutual feeling
of ship and
Youve seen film
so kind daunting
You know were
were do
the prequel Alien
SCOTT
And action
ELLlOTT
But scene
everyone establishes
kind it
MAN
B mark
WONG He chose scene
woken years hypersleep
So were bit spaced anyways
So I guess worked
And respects didnt
know other well
So know way planned
perfect
MAN
Marker
Is seat taken
And thrilling because know
us weve grown Alien
The idea working Ridley Scott
come set
on day
spaceship unbelievable
So like 1 5 us
He wanted thing
queuing getting food
And like Okay rehearsal
Lets cameras this
happens
My fingers numb
And Ive
long before so
No ones long before
Right
That thrilling That like
Were Alien film
You know I mean Ridley know
really cool exciting
That day It brilliant
MAN 1  Cut it
MAN 2 Cut it
We broke lunch Michael Ellenberg
said me
Lets stages
essentially built
In script originally called
ampule room
There green screen
They built it
This entire stage basically
transformed alien world
I got tears eyes I like
GASPS
Because its like piece art
With scifi movies its space
lot technique
and kind lose beauty
And kind lose reality
But l think Ridley totally unique
The design costumes
evertyhing
is beautiful cruel way
And helped
dont pretend then
Its short way it
SCOTT Speed entrance little bit
around
SHAW
Stop Dont touch it
WOOD Ampules come alive
middle set
Were gonna dozen actually
of practical visual effect
And its basically corn starch water
with vibration underneath it
Inside youve got container
thats gonna fluid it
that distributes middle
container outside
And comes large reservoir
set
The cover goes and
certain point
to directors discretion
little air ram pushes lid little bit
and black fluid ooze
effect youve got
on ampule
SCOTT We built set
build normally
Because I think worked
economically better
than actually saying
Well lets green screen
We evertyhing digitally
Digitally cheaper
MAN
Nine echo one A marker
MARSHALLGREEN
Sometimes wires
You know science fiction
in lot movies today
because actors
green screen
As theyre told
happening them
you know theyre attaching
thought environment
I mean theyre acting void
Which l think
horrendously difficult
both actor
director
MAN
C mark
MARSHALLGREEN
In case
we luxury
evertyhing day
And attach thought
exactly whats going seen
KEENE So outsider look way
movie
would pretty comical
Youve got 76 guy
covered red dots
and its purely
track him
and create computergenerated
version later
But practical
play day
And thats great us
Its better than know
having imagine everything
SCOTT
Its terrible twins Wow
Hmm lntimidating right
BILLY
Im gonna you
Hello
Hi Billy props
CHUCKLES
Put lubrication well
ACTOR Pay attention whats going

Yes theyre fixing testicle
Perfectly normal
SCOTT
The luminosity great isnt it
FASSBENDER I love that
SCOTT Look skin
Hes got The veins painted in
Its beautiful
FASSBENDER Ridley like
idea building having there
so sort viable
The texture touch
sort interact with
Thats thing watching him
texture feel things
is important him
Do need people here guys
Get cameras Move move
Anyone anything
corridor
Wheres gap in
There holes it Keep probing
DlCKlE Youre getting real live things
you
And things like head exploding
When Engineers head
open turns thats head
We open inside head
Well then l thought day
say
Okay youre gonna
imagine this
But
Animatronics Department
So head literally twitching
mouthshaking
and bloodoozing
veins throbbing and
So actor its dream
react whats you
That shook you didnt it
LAUGHS
That looks brilliant
Yeah its amazing
FASSBENDER
Never ending fucking doors
MAN
Cut it
KEENE Everything weve created
large trucks space suits
everything comes
research development job
Theres existed beforehand
Everythings generated scratch
From Ridleys imagination
set drawings
So triedandtested
There occasional problems
space suit
and helmets early days
I hate fucking helmet

MAN 1  Seventeen
MAN 2 Other way around
MAN 1  Sixteen
Ugh
Come on
MAN 1  Fifteen
MAN 2 Coming up
BELL RINGlNG
Tensecond track
Youre gonna sit now
KEENE Ridleys great innovator
lot moment
He suddenly sees
creates idea head
and suddenly wants that
And its reacting
Its reacting speed
Ridley wants shoot
is probably biggest challenge
And know keeps department
toes
Get fucking way
Were shooting
Have got wagger stick
Yeah
All right
HUFFAM
Ridley force reckoned with
He amazing enthusiasm
hes doing
The crew infected
enthusiasm
and everybody goes ride
And keeps everybody day long
Did that
His approach Dariusz basically
alter approach
Thats didnt consider 3D
didnt change
certain camera shots designs
things chose do
to advantage it
But didnt limit
it
SCOTT Shooting 3D seeing 3D on
The experience floor
with big monitors
where little tent
Id big big 3D monitors
So its realtime shooting 3D
Then lm editing
Im actually editing 3D
So I dont know problem was
It helped having Dariusz Wolski
WOLSKl Whats necessary 3D
rigs
I instant switch
watch cameras
which left eye right eye rig
time 2D
Because monitors lighting
monitors lenses focus
And stuff rigged
stereo card
And fed
video playback
And come big 3D
monitors Ridleys watching me
And 2D monitors watch
cameras time
But wants to He switch
camera another
So requires lot cable
And lot very very intricate
wiring
It looks like bad Heath Robinson
dodgy lashup
This guy couldnt mind
thing he
KEENE
The 3D element big factor
You know its complicated process
its slower process
So try film
timetable
as ordinarily
normal film
is huge challenge place
HUFFAM The end results Ridley
Dariusz getting absolutely amazing
So I think its worth effort
But l adds 1 5 20 percent
time schedule
even director likes
fast Ridley
Clear door please
Thank much
KEENE Some sequences
weve windstorms
with creature effects
theyre gonna know
day difficult way
Theres no You cant guarantee anything
Youve got times
technicians
as ordinarily have
And Ridley likes shoot
cameras simultaneously
So youre small sets lot
cameras taking lot spaces
and twice people manning them
Three times
if include guys
stereography machines
So its lot noise
MAN Quiet
SCOTT Please shut up
Rehearsing And action
You think youre ready
theres problem
with rigs
working
John hold there
Just hold tight lift it
Sometimes cameras
bit temperamental
So lose bit time
day that
ELLENBERG I think biggest surprise
pleasurable way them
was big vistas
big landscapes 3D fine
But excited it
really l think started change
sort choices
movie
was smaller intimate scenes
interiors ship
because opened sets gave
lot different options play with
It gave opportunity
scares
that bigger
pop more
Because thats youre looking
add dimensionality
when youre confined spaces
So thats felt
opened up
and 3D
truly threedimensional
that wouldnt otherwise
lNAUDlBLE DlALOGUE
WOLSKl The biggest challenge
wind test cameras shut down
It scariest moment world
lNAUDlBLE DlALOGUE
Our concern stability mirror
huge
With feet away
Then cameras shutting down
weve learned basically
because plugs
little bit play
So drawing board
Cut cables Change plugs
It madness
When hologram
its gonna spectacular
with low feedback
blurring hologram not
I love light
WOLSKl When work Ridley images
threedimensional They were
I mean look Blade Runner
I mean threedimensional film
Some people shoot
twodimensional films
but shot
threedimensional movies
There depth shadow
Hed create dimensions
lot different ways
You know theres what 2000 years
visualarts tradition
TALKlNG lNDISTINCTLY
I would actually clear corridor
bend
Barry lets start turning up
WOLSKl When spaces know
like juggernaut
and try create light
its invisible possible
So basically weve lot stuff
flashlights
just lights helmets
And constant battle
pushing because
he said Just turn lights off
lets flashlights You know
So I said Great Im it lm game
But faces
CHUCKLES
Trying invent invisible light actually
register faces need it
and took courage
us
You know far push it
off
where create little lights
sense story
And turn off know
Its constant creative process
Its like were gonna sit down
its were gonna
this this this
So its constant reinventing things
Everyday new new
He questions everything
Which better
JARED
No stay till move
So Jared heres question
Is better
worth this
Take one A mark
FASSBENDER Dariusz lighting
beautifully well So its a
Thats thing youre working
Ridley Scott film
I mean talent set
pretty breathtaking really
I mean departments know
everyones game
And its great able come work
learn much
from watching
departments know
going business
Theres scene were ship
were watching screens
And theres pretty intense
happening screens
Im sure lot directors just
know saved hassle said
Look here screen
thats happening it
But hes series
animated shots almost
of moments film
And look incredible
Its basically film animated
THERON He creates environment where
actor tools
It scene lm watching
father
go space killed
And its supposed play screen
Its just like glass screen me
But l like When shooting
When getting it
And second AD like
Ridleys trying
images you
so throw monitor
see
And I like Who that
So directors like
This job
Like Bring emotion
Like Your father dying
There is Imagine
And real effort
animated footage sequence
to actually
day kind respond to
JANEK Lets bring around
closer look
This lm gonna use
point entry
Janeks ship airlock which
know easily done
in green screen stage
Ridley built it
and makes world difference
Like Im looking thing like Wow
SCOTT
Okay ready action
ELLENBERG
What Ridley talks is
its movies
threedimensional
the moment 3D camera
Thats ludicrous
No goes movie theater
thinking theyre watching flat
It works better filmmaking works
enter world
Youve that Thats
real filmmaking about
DlCKlE lts big skill Theres
technical things going on
theres stuff deal with
He doesnt miss anything
Any detail
TALKlNG lNDISTINCTLY
MARSHALLGREEN Ridley intent
making script great
And cast people
hopes help him
He wants help
great movie
Hes hoping help flesh
script characters
And choreograph dance him
that best be
wants be
This hologram
English  US  SDH
SCOTT
Three two one action
Come reset it
Once contaminated lethal
killing machines nearly them
One consider
survival
Confronted situation
any aliens
survival instinct
and survival instinct
rid enemy it
The Engineer particular Ridley
adamant absolutely perfect
SCOTT You know
better instances
Today makeup
improved dramatically
But things
redraw things digitally
SCANLAN This Ridley factor
Ridley come in
and throw curveball
that say
Just grab that this that
And look great
It goes plans
think that
You sit
think Crikey know
And look monitor
looks incredible
lNAUDlBLE DlALOGUE
SCOTT
One department tackle the lets say
the Engineers what
Everything applied them
and
monsters
SCANLAN
The mechanical team interesting this
because digital technology
obviously stunning
If imagine it
now
But l think Ridley onus
trying practical
It kind reawakening I think
lot skills
that maybe starting
pushed away that
Cable technology
things moved cables
and servo motors
sort things
And weve Were kind going back
and pulling skills back
I think thats
Everybodys kind enjoying that
Things kick us sense
ampoule room
As soon ampoules begin
bleed begin sweat
and DNA released
that starts life little tiny
eellike elements
That takes
Hammerpede l think its
Again
resolved
Centipede Hammerpede
WOMAN
Okay Hold it
MAN Go go
Thats it
Were checking links
WOMAN I like material Touch that
MAN l did
Weve got Fifield Millburn scene
head room
where experience
large reptiles
SCOTT l dont mean that
Im saying know dig out
a way worms
Now Steve down Go down
WOMAN Okay back back
MAN Hold animatronics
Thats good And swim away
Thats cut You hold up

SCANLAN
To me great aliens
Theyd start life like
sort of know placid little things
MAN
A marker
Shh Oh
Hey

SCANLAN To break Millburns arm we
Its old Itd old gag
Rafe puts arm

We took cast shoulder
cup
and
created mechanical arm
His elbow joint
cableoperated mechanism
and wrist fingers
But overall movement
rodded system
So theres person Rafe
tight back
whos operating movement
And track
allowed Hammerpede

ALL CHUCKLE
MAN
Yeah got part
This eaten away
SPALL The expedition team
body day
They turn over
and big snake comes mouth
but Ridley didnt tell actors

Three two one
Okay With lots glue
Bang Pfft

SPALL
He said Right were gonna roll this
Go turn body

B mark
C mark
And its horrific
Hes literally eaten away
Theres massive hole kind
mouths filled broken teeth
I mean gross
Really genuinely gross
SCANLAN We Hammerpede
end wire
on filament wire
It loaded dummy Millburn
rolled over
So think Okay theres
fishy literally going here
Theres wire somewhere
Three two one pull
SCANLAN
We intercom Ridley
And watching monitor
kind of
You know theres wait Ha ha
Just point I think
I movement throat
so l kind is
DICKIE SCREAMS
And thing
I mean literally
thatlike leaps out
I mean
I literally screamed place down
Genuinely terrified
DlCKlE
Did wire there
MAN Something right
Come on whats going on
ALL LAUGH
DlCKlE
Even head
you know theres tricks going
its happening
it set amazingly
SCANLAN
Fifield interesting
because Fifield considered
midpoint
between Deacon end
Hammerpede
Somethings happened him
begun transform and
We went numerous designs
Fifield
There is Its jaw
working with like sharp
which unhinge here
HARRIS
Originally gonna CGI thing
It wasnt gonna all
But weeks went on
started think
Maybe its better its acting thing
So started tests
physical work
and filmed stuff
Ridley saw kind liked it
SCANLAN What interesting
Sean Harris superb actor
The general feeling
better hold actors features
hold things
bring show
but begin almost really
heading
towards Engineer
inspection table
when head explodes
That ultimately gonna be
Thats gonna happen Fifield
point
Whatever happening Engineer
happening Fifield
His head horribly contorted
He losing
alien him
The med pod creature combination
DNA infected
that Holloway infected
Shaw
SCOTT
When gets point realizes
that literally impregnated
Holloway
with unusual embryo
she med pod
and machine
cesarean
RAPACE
Before l start movie I prepare I think
and I kind homework
my brain work
And actually step
actual work scenes
its emotional physical
Thats way letting control
SCANLAN So hes extracted out
Yeah
SCANLAN To there
Yeah
MAN Hell there
SCANLAN Hell there
And come in
SCANLAN
It previsualized
And sequence we
Everybody involved
used shotbyshot methodology
order able it
because theres enormous
technology
having laced
able that
because didnt want
rod removal
We wanted try
shoot thing real
I think its squid certainly
mechanics built him
the tentacles based
movement based that
I think animation previs
tremendous
as far giving character
MAN 1  B mark
MAN 2 B mark
SCOTT
Action And scanner
RAPACE
First I actually table
and I stomach
kind weird
Just blowing up
and kind using know
muscles belly
to kind weird way
First theyre kind planned
dummy
but Ridley wanted try things
like
Oh thats disgusting Ha ha
Youre good this Lets this
Stomach
Oh come on Come on out
There point
need to know
we need cut Noomis body
We need actually perform cesarean
So livecast Noomi position
moment
All right
So thats neutral position
And that create silicone dummy
which painted textured
look exactly like her
If arms down
use real arms reacting
And then know
SCOTT Therell motion right
Im gonna cut here
Yeah
Thats actually good old
classic movie trick
which its Noomis head
body dummy
I kind sitting
weird position
with people table
things know legs
Above arch
mechanized cable controls
Cable controls
levers
and actuating lever
end
We able bring arm above
lower down
and grab hold embryotic sac
draw up
SCOTT Keep going up
Keep going up Keep going up
Get hands away
Lose it Lose second
Head back Head back
Come back Come back
Come again
And lose again Come back
SCREAMlNG
Cut it Cut it cut it cut it Very good
SCANLAN Once wed taken
dangling arm
waiting born were freed
that achieved bursting sac
Actually burst
very sharp razor
which removed
postproduction
And allowed sac
instantly burst
and spew sort fluid
The thing
creature inside
And creature inside
roll certain way
It little bit like origami
We right way fold him
so guarantee
shot look same
That introduced condom
And condom
added fluid
and little bits skin
evertyhing else
At time continue
draw condom
and tight could
The tighter was violent
release beautiful was
You could The condom
completely clear liquid
You creature
sort wallowing inside fluid
Then well mimic it
I think need this
And stick it
So youre gonna lay liquid it
Something comes out
MAN Yeah
RAPACE
I out
And theres moment I feel
like thing looking me
and I realize like
Okay want dead
SCREAMlNG
I think Ridley described it
having born extracted
at point screams
realized hes unwanted child Ha ha
SCREAMlNG
John Hurt got lately didnt he
They amazing job
felt
I started believe
situation
and forgot l hanging everybody
situation feet there
I saw feet know dummy
I like
Why cant l feet
Because its
Because felt like me
I think I hand breast
and I sort handonbreast
talking Noomi
and monitor shouted
This isnt right Hahaha
This isnt right
realize
when look monitor
didnt look right
Inside tentacles
series discs
and stage number cables
normally four
that left right
motion
So stacking together
you whats called Sshape
complete curl
So all about
I thought 60 70 cables
running tentacles
body creature
They connected
series servo motors
The servo motors
replaced human operators
And operated
remotecontrol system
Effectively number ofjoysticks
electronic expression makers
allows people
mix motors together
in predetermined fashion
So joystick
particular way
theyll expression
They another
theyll another
And moving different
motions array
of different sort activities
creature
The big decision is
Blood red obviously
Do red
As soon red
then blood stakes
immediately much higher
than choose
alternative color
If ambers
milky solutions
all things
offputting obviously unpleasant
but its bleeding
So decided wed
approaches Ridley
One did
we amber
milky clear take
and wed second version
blood red
And ways blood
enough
SCOTT OVER RADlO Pull umbilical out
Pull umbilical out
SCANLAN Everybody gets excited
blood comes set
The pitch set builds up
and I think
conservative takes
and then hahaha
open floodgates
So going Ridleys happy
that know hes just
Hes completely know
doused evertyhing everybody
MAN
D mark
PANTlNG
Its aggressive scene
movie
and its fundamentally real cesarean
And see pretty graphic
SCREAMlNG
RAPACE But hard
I week
And week I
It got me
I dreaming weird nightmares
MAN 1  Round applause Noomi
MAN 2 Nice take Give more
MAN 1  Youre next Max
Get trousers off
ALL LAUGH
RAPACE
I said Ridley week after I like
l thought fun
way sick scene
MAN
Whats going John Hurt
SCOTT The prosthetics makeup
absolutely phenomenal
Ive seen makeup like
applied Engineers
The Engineers were You know Ridley
demanding high standard
And developed technique
prosthetic application
probably seven
years ago
which led ability
actually kind prosthetics
and pretty quickly so
Four hours Engineer ready
quick
We guy
whos 7feet2
for majority film
Engineer awaken
We refined prosthetics
beautiful
and unusuallooking
And its
hit straight away
You know going
working it so
Again process allows that
So something
mold it cast it test it
if needs refining
refine having start again
This allowed sort tweak
perfect things
And weve just Thats weve done
Weve perfect possible
WHYTE The silicone prosthetic application
takes hours
and l
costume
which twopiece costume
Legs arms torso
Thats zipped up
and lm glued hands
neck feet
So altogether its hours
OSULLlVAN We produce master copies
modeling hard form
and reengineer it
So hard form back
polish everything
We probably team fabricators
working thing months
You know worked
best possible design
to create perfect movement
Ease getting on
Its gotta be You know
wanna able off
We looked incorporating
cooling elements them
but particular guy lan Whyte
were using
is wearing suits
Welcome life
The surface suit transparent
so its got
like translucent layer like skin
So difference
stunt suit hero suit
The stunt suit painted
The hero suit actually cast skin
transparent skin it
which gave lot depth
look sort squidlike
FASSBENDER
Ian John fantastic job
You know I impressed
And movements well
You know specific
got part
SCANLAN The trilobite animatronic
character possible
but
enormously complicated
and enormously difficult thing
shot
And ways no
Theres point
When know In bygone time
alternatives
that route
But CG
I think chose early on
that character
fantastic CG
So took design
point reference really
A finished point reference
but didnt
finer details things
like certain elements
existed tentacles
which brought life CG
Opening
seeing textures inside them
We didnt that We chose
sort neutral look it
but took 2D
right away sculpt
through molding process
Its sort like way
finished artworking character
It posable moveable
use shots
but real purpose l think
serve lighting
and visual textual reference
CG there
SCANLAN Okay lets bring body around
Okay
SCANLAN
Perfect And one
Just like that Good job
MAN And l grab him
Feeds in No no youve got it
So before right
MAN Yeah
Okay Then through
Step through step through Keep going
Okay good Now down Down
SCANLAN What originally thought
maybe
for sequence Engineers
fight trilobite
we use elements trilobite
for actor stunt guy
sort of know work with
MAN 1 
And action
MAN 2 Are blocking door
MAN 3 Dont know
MAN 1  All right Okay Now
MAN 2 Hes blocking door
Right need knock door off
knock somehow
As Shaws attacked
Engineer
the trilobite clearly aware
happening door
We sound effects l suppose
visual effects
shadow effects
odd glimpse
of tentacle passing window
like that
So
background
effectively room
bashing tentacles little
Thats pathetic
And again Hit hard
Youre missing fucking glass
Go on Ready
Thats good one Okay
MAN Nice Thats good one
All right And again
One more Last one Thats it
The med pod creature came
Sean Holloway grown
Its impregnated Engineer
and mixed DNA Engineer
trilobite
It gives Deacon
We started sculpt
fullsized sculpt
Stood 4 feet tall
We built versions him
We built version
went inside sac
which born Engineer
and second version
rod puppet
So sequence begins Engineer
lying ground dead
The trilobites crawled away
died corner
And creature begins
sort want liberate itself
So heaving body
ground sign
So built fullsize Engineer
animatronic
Everything weighted
evertyhing jointed
so
way move
So hes He heavy lump
ground
When Deacon born
Engineer
hes connected
umbilical
So umbilical passes stomach
Deacon embryotic sac
into body Engineer
SCANLAN
And slip Rachel Slip
Okay And again Try again
MAN Yeah
SCANLAN Go
Ready Keep head down
Keep head bit
Yeah elbows down
MAN Okay up
SCANLAN No no up Up
Good Okay
SCOTT OVER RADIO Open mouth
Open mouth
Go on
And turn
Right Left
Turn it Turn
To left
Turn it
And cut
Excellent
Brilliant
SCANLAN
We shot sequence couple times
We shot rearing up stand
to cut
It amazes
Im looking l look
when youre shooting
monitor
Hes yeah The genius sits
amazing
Yeah its fantastic playbacks
Because CG
allconsuming technology
I think previous projects
about
being able support CG
little gaps
Whereas one
case CG
SCANLAN LAUGHS
I think prosthetic
youve got work
with person thats underneath
Youve got preserve actor
theyve got able act
SPEAKlNG IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE
SCANLAN One ingredients
project enjoyable me
was work group people
came project
with wideeyed enthusiasm
just know thankful part
of was know
piece movie history
and welded thing
job possible
The fact l stand
firing line say We it
but knowing l went
workshop
that greeted with
know enthusiastic band people
lNAUDlBLE DlALOGUE
SCREAMS
English  US  SDH
MAN
Three two one action
The burden movie
gonna casting woman
who fundamentally
believe action lead
I cant anything
Things dont
according plan
I mean what after two three
takes making work
you go
Ridley know work
It brutal its quite
Its inyourface places
GRUNTING
MAN
Three two one action
ELLENBERG There version
kind female action hero
that lot movies now
that fun fundamentally uh
exists kind pop creation
In case point
play place reality
So there
If movies gonna scare you
believe its happening
have believe
woman this
and believe
woman survive this
and defeat facing
RAPACE
Like Ridley wants real
even situation
totally unreal
and in know
future evertyhing
And action action
INCH When I talked Ridley
storm sequence
he said You know think a
A storm
thats stronger
imagine life know
that cant stand it
blows away
If vehicle it tips over
So kind
dynamic sequence
Normally its little car park
007 Stage
But theyve this
theyve kind leveled out
and wed gotten shipping
containers high
and turned massive
sort greenscreened area
so doubled
planet area
Because l step out
thats gag right
INCH
Actors act lve learned
so moment
youve talked things through
about You guys youve got
slowly that
All things window
theyre moment acting
All sudden
theyre giving beans
and spill out
its accident waiting happen
so l kind like lot
safety methods there
whereas well restrictor
certain speed
MARSHALLGREEN There elements
dangerous
but incredible crew
bust ass stunts
I mean Noomi like myself
wanna can
that insured do
and so know
I watched stunt guy jump ATV
and I tried sure
I good better
INCH
They tracked ATVs difficult vehicles
We jump ramp would
You know moment grip
other
and little bit
huge amount
To me biggest
action sequence set piece
As arriving
picking head up
they jump back
head gets blown away
So rehearse
doubles
Basically gets Stands down
gets jerked ground
and gets blown tumbling
big stanchion
which leg main spaceship
She gets pinned that
And Holloway sees that
comes bike
jumps edge ramp there
gets Drives her
wind bowls over
WOOD
That lot work there
We massive
big aerowind machines there
Probably 1 5 20 guys
throwing vermiculite dust
So pretty fullon um
work night well
RAPACE The pieces kind
storm hitting me
It hard felt like
somebody punching me
So its fake situation
bruised
and know sore and uh
shooting night time
It dark cold
INCH
It night shoot
We working elements
wind machines
and changed
wires bit
We couldnt shoot set
so I that
basically
I create grid
exterior set
So ld basically I brought
load mechanical winches
which ability able
lift somebody air
fly ground
jerk ground tumble them
Because tight schedule
movie
that set finished
day shot it
So I having work rehearsals
evening set
while guys basically
making set day
RAPACE We actually rehearsing
working sequence
before started shoot movie
and were know
hanging wires
and going forth
I think know fun
I enjoy
I wanna I can
My stunt double fantastic
l wanna it l like
But sometimes know
cant let everything
because I hurt we
You know happened me
kind of Big disaster
INCH I lucky double
tell truth
When I actually test stuff
Ridley it
I actually brought in
That theyd cast Noomi
shot test stuff her
And like weeks
talking Noomi
and said
l wanna double
because shoot her
She amazing
The tumbling bouncing stuff
was know
That double
then know got moments
of
rescue
we of
Pretty actress
and for um Charlie well
You program winches
could know
I pick somebody bounce
rooms here very safely
so use
real actor
but need time
feel comfortable
and know feel comfortable
theyre doing a
You know didnt huge
rehearsal time them
but l think David
Michael Fassbender he
We days rehearsal him
but nearly did I think
90 percent stuff
He amazing job actually
Really amazing job
FASSBENDER Its lot fun You
wire work good fun know
once evertyhing tucked
way harness
Its looking good them
so David sort goes thing
puts harness back
and opens door spaceship
goes saves lives
But know its wire work
so sort allow
enjoy ride
and sort takes along
Open door Open door
Jesus thats scary
SCOTT That good
That scary
INCH This
Charlie was
All way mission
Charlies kind deteriorating
Hes kind of Stuffs happening him
hes feeling ill
Hes basically impregnated
alien
SHOUTS
INCH Theyre rushing come
ship
Vickers heard whats going on
Theyre intercom
way in
and shes basically meeting
garage
What hell
SHAW Unh
VICKERS
Hes coming ship
KEENE lts particularly tricky scene
Noomi emotionally
because love film
burnt death
and Charlize actually
gave practical flame thrower
If need turn off
if happens wrong
switch drop it
I dont like words
Ha ha
lf happens wrong
Its protocol
So little rehearsal
suit
and sure comfortable
it
Id stunt double her
and messing around
Ridley l Ridley went
Wouldnt cool
shot
of Charlize setting fire
Action
MAN
We use one That best
Yeah was um day shooting
London actually that
and Im sure day
case went aflame
Setting anybody hard enough
know
I mean preparation goes
fullbody burn intense

trilobite
BOTH GRUNTlNG
INCH Ridley said wanted
like enveloping moment
something permanently
kind suffocating
so played
ideas keeping him
sort stood feet time
keeping wrestling
until came this
Actually Ridley came it
Id love claim idea
l think worked great

where abandon
having crashed Juggernaut
the uh survivors Prometheus
in escape pods
find planets surface
time
Prometheus come in
Shaw
This ship taking off
Listen me This ship taking off
You cant let go
Yeah
MAX The location I found
was kilometers
end service road
that 45 minutes
paved road
which hours away
Reykjavik
INCH We
postPrometheus crash
and were having bits spaceship
laying around
and lot running
Shaw Vickers
before big doughnut came
crushed Vickers
MAN
All right roll
INCH It looked fantastic
its volcanic rock
and felt like
kind planet
YELLING
No no no
We got set piece dropped
actress
to simulate semicrushed
Juggernaut
I think real wide angle
Wham just We drop her
MAN
Action
Action
INCH And crawling
underneath that
and continuing the
You know start
iris
which cracking open
shot UK
with big jump chasm
Then
the um iris opening up
running away that
to tie basically
getting Prometheus off
and crash Juggernaut
RAPACE Yeah
SCOTT Now youre gonna drive ATV
That shot valley Iceland
youre running around
in fundamentally
volcanic cinder valley
and youve got
it
All l ground
Arthur Max went crew
and laid
causeway
MAX All vehicles
actually running road
that created landscape
and sculpted landscaped
Greens Department
and populated
couple dozen pinnacles
which eventually
extended digitally
SPEAKlNG INDlSTlNCTLY
INCH Its driving stuff
actors going ATVs
and uh rovers returning
different formations that
which lead
piece storm
chasing
garage sequence
Were David
riding stuff ATVs
Weve Shaw passenger
Holloway bringing in
SCOTT This best unit lve worked
very very long time
All you
I mean I know anyway
but actually
its enjoyable me
Particularly enjoyable film
And uh start film
challenge
but youre great lot
knowing youre doing
that things
fantastic ride
Thank much
English  US  SDH
MARlS We wrapping Robin Hood
came me
and said You know lve got
Alien movie lm starting next
Are interested
And its kind like Wow l cant believe
I got asked Ridley personally
Do l want
science fiction movie
STAMMERS The visual effects work
spread everywhere
I mean lot things
ambiguous
as Arthur build
Ridley shoot practically
and clear gonna
pretty major visualeffects shots
MARlS He said You know
lets thinking
heres world l wanna show
things couldnt do
on one
Lets real time
Lets grand environments
giant spaceships
SCOTT
Ill again
I mean green screen proved
phenomenally done
between Weta MPC London
Fundamentally companies
tackled
what amounts 1 300
sophisticated effects shots
It lived absolute expectations
digitally drawn 1 3 months prior
And doubt lets
wouldnt like that
theyd big glossy literally
photographic version l wanted
just tapping it
Im great believer R  D
And sticking R  D
SLOAN
As far cooperation between
digital practical effects
film went
we amazing group people
practical visual effects
and constantly talked
other
Its hard takeover
practical digital shot
MARlS The opening prologue
gonna digital Engineer
because knew
hes gonna decay much
that wasnt gonna realistic
Right beginning
previsd sequence
Looked Art Departments concepts
We idea wanted do
And matter
final look be
So great reference
board
Ridley shot performance live
real real actor
And shot clean plates him
And Weta clean plates recreate
CG version actors performance
They matched animation
performance
And sidebyside
Ridley wanted aggressive
taking body
And knew
molecular level
to see know component parts
torn apart
You know molecule molecule
infection goo
So main things
looking at
is firstly grounding reality
and reference
types DNA
because
short time
to tell story DNA
getting infected breaking apart
and reforming recombining
Earth DNA
We designs
different DNA
quite different graphical
illustrative were
So Engineers DNA know
we thought
This needs sinister
But know its gonna infected
infection look
you know messed
Engineers DNA
So know using
We light color palette
Engineers DNA
and infection comes
dark meltedlooking
and starts distort
break apart Engineers DNA
Ridley actually said section
lt feel like war there
The DNA torn apart
and ripping apart
different ways possible
One thing particles
Ridley wanted
to kind hit terms way
move
he wanted sense
werent falling him
He wanted sense
little bit intelligence almost
He said look starlings
and saw great footage
starlings
the way flock move
Ridley liked sense motion
And thats Weta reference
animate
It escalate
So shot needed
advanced before
It got stage
parts Engineer
would tear open
theres shot where know
his opens right up know
spine
You know able
contribute ideas like that
and youd
Ridley say
Well
tear open
And come go
Yeah thats great
You know its fantastic know
ideas Weta created
are know getting film
STAMMERS Ridley loves shoot
practically
and evertyhing
film
There practical version that
though shoot with
but point knew
were gonna CG
Theres spaceships
Prometheus
that given
gonna that
There scenes
so know said
Lets invest money building
great CG versions ships
The Prometheus design
came purely Art Department
Steve Burg Ben Procter
responsible
for know
building detailing ship
to point good
approved concepts Ridley
MARlS
He actually built model himself
and MPC
who hired actually create
feature
HENLEY lt great opportunity
show know
our potential
graphics spaceships
We given cool
concept designs
which fair detail
But film previs
getting storyboard Ridley
there shots
extremely close
We awful lot coverage it
So design based
from concept guys
built stage
and
in closer closer
DOMENECH And zoom cockpit
We rough interior
You sort seats there
MAN lts cool
DOMENECH lts very heavy model
It very large ship
looks like jet fighter sometimes
So VTOL ships
vertical takeoff landing
and its got massive legs like
engines
So its like look cool
time
it super agile
takes size away
And landings
Its like slow possible
without making look boring
So its agile time
look massive
DANESE
Selling scale it
you wanna feel massive
landing dusty planet
We huge
dust raised ground
So really scale shot given
dynamic dust
and tiny points
tiny rocks moving
When were getting close
you need
theres texture time
went adding scale ship
feel like big enough
HENLEY Maybe need sense
little specular areas
that smooth
Just subtly change value
know highlights here
That big challenge
definitely building it
because its task
on
But know final result great
MPC fantastic job that
HENLEY
Planet fly in
Ridley particular moon
Jupiter
and model
gas giant
We shot things like ink swirling
get like nice fluid patterns
And wanted rings
so analyzed Saturn rings
tried slightly different
Ridley gone talked
NASA guys
about
space planet
He feedback
excited about
STAMMERS
Planet environment incredible
Steve Messing
concept artists
responsible
planetscapes
It clear gonna
know
If real gonna shot
going heavily manipulated
The planet environment gonna
require lot visualeffects work
to join different landscapes together
add atmospherics weather
lightning things like that
Ridleys main
He brought forward
was gonna terrible weather
planet basic brief
STAMMERS Weve lot effort
designing Ridley
All landscape kind based
loving Wadi Rum Jordan
HENLEY There photo
Ridley somewhere
of interesting
mountain landscape
and hed drawn pyramids
middle valley found
And kind thing
wanted create
STAMMERS l went Jordan aerial
unit MPCs supervisor Charlie Henley
and shots thousands
thousands stills
We shot loads plates well
So theres real plates
Jordan untouched
and areas
sandy desert ground
Weve replaced digital versions
weve shot lceland
Hey baby
STAMMERS
The creature work was
You know theres good variety
creature work
Neal Scanlans team
creature supervisor
had number tasks create
Hammerpedes great example
You know Neals team fantastic
fully animatronic version
Hammerpede
Puppeteered versions
things wrapped
Millburns arm
that could know puppeteer
real pull through so
We shot scene
Hammerpede
with practical Hammerpede
time
MARlS Ridley wanted try
things real first
and fail
want digitally
STAMMERS There certain limitations
things couldnt do
The way mouth kind uncurls
opens up
we
sort of know kind this
You know MPC ended
frontal version
where unfolds opens up
then cut rear view
practical
So were cutting practical CG
number times
and then obviously theres point
head gets cut off
At point thats
its like Okay
Now CG
gotta regrow new head
The head gonna burrow
acid burn hole thats Millburns arm
and gets helmet
thats over
and know Rafe Spall
great performance
in reacting
idea
really gonna doing
Now knew gonna end
rammed throat
so gave good performance
that
You know pretty disgusting shot
end it It great
MAN 1  Oh thats horrible
MAN 2 Ooh
Ooh
MAN 1  Ooh l dont like that
MEN LAUGHlNG
Well I do but
Theres far
Freudian interpretations right there
KEYPAD BEEPlNG
WOMAN PANTING
STAMMERS
The Med Pod What great sequence
I mean truly truly disgusting
and great moment
script
And know its like
Wow gonna cool
Scene 1 08 Med Pod
The Med Pod thing
I saw previs for
or film
I saw previs sequence
Shaw entering Med Pod
It cuts open lt pulls thing out
It starts screaming starts screaming
The blood going everywhere
That introduction Prometheus
That thing l saw
Along with know hoping
PG1 3 rating
STAMMERS Ridley know
wanted graphic well
We heavy previs
sequence
In fact team Halon great job
prevising sequence
And previsd Rrated version
previsd PG1 3 version
The Med Pod exciting
sequences work on
because analogous
to chestbursting scene
original Alien
So took lot care
look real
and gruesome
possibly could
Weta picked sequence
great job with know
doing great CG robotic arms
interacting her
You know scanning motion
lasercutting
the spreading claw comes
pull placenta
Thats there
Sort CG work point
Theres lot subtle things going
sequence
Firstly Noomi actually
proficient belly dancer
and weve
enhancements that
so trilobite nudge
flesh inside
and odd bulge in
STAMMERS This sequence is know
incredible
Neal Scanlans team gave
incredible practical things work with
I mean know fully animatronic
baby trilobite placenta
and placental sac thats goo
Its just lt great
There good things
Having onset reference Ridley shot
gave lot confidence
to know wanted
able replicate that
and able deliver
knew hed happy with
STAMMERS The staples brilliant
We talked that know Ridley
The practicalities
terms futuristic surgeries
Like youve got fantastic
Med Pod machine do
you know number things
wants staples
But loved idea staples
Its thing like
seeing staple gun gets you
lMlTATING STAPLING
and know sticking staples
stomach brilliant
That baby trilobite
grows really quickly
And I remember moment
went Neals creature shop
When sculpting original version
that lot smaller
I think thinking
bit big already
And Neal said Ridley He said
lm concerned scale
And Ridley said Yeah Yeah
We bigger
And like
Neal like Oh okay
MARlS Neal essentially built pieces
gave reference needed
and gave Weta
and Weta built
textures
because Ridley wanted
peeling flaking skin look it
which hard
prosthetically so
You know Weta finished off
and great basis
Neals stuff
STAMMERS You know battle
great struggle
and hes overwhelmed
You know Ridley great idea
sequence
You know feet
door
Get feet door
Hes pulling back
And sort great shots
feel struggle
of trying pull away
thing
and know
braced door
Its great moment
HlLL One main design aspects
trilobite
was sense
tension strength
in squishy know
He vertebrae
tentacles bones
So needed sure
tentacles stretched out
that sense
musculature
and compressed
squashed up
you know folds
wrinkles skin
STAMMERS
They real challenge
to animate trilobites performance
match
what lan Whyte
effectively nothing
Definitely tricky sequence sure
But
again worked
end
CHATTERING
The Fifield creature beat
Ridley wanted action sequence
And conceived short beat
pace film going
And need exciting action moment
And Fifields transitioned
slightly alien
It bit ambiguous
way gonna go
MARlS The original intent
kind gross movements
Big running jumping things like
digital character
which build set
shown here
as sort prosthetic
We
match that
and wed digital motions
run properly Ridley wanted
Ridley kind wanted
animal realm motions
sort kind baboonish
things like that
STAMMERS There image
Ridley kept going to
which refers
baby head
And kind loved image
And know design kind
worked worked worked 
for long time when know
were getting closer shooting
we point had
know final design that
SLOAN
When started Fifield
he kind big
kind mean kind fast
That pretty
beginning
We ended having actor
Sean Harris played Fifield
He prosthetic makeup
sort blackenedup armor
and ran
entire sequence us
Sean incredibly intense well
Anything youd wanted fine
Fifield needs fire
Thats fine Set fire
SCOTT
I design thing
see shot actor makeup
makeup
see does
and combination
elements actor
in relation
digital enhancement
Um not
FERNANDEZ The brief Fifield
was human
alien
Ridley locked
concept yet
So development continued Weta
One big things
getting right balance face
Like seeing actor
having the
Maintaining alien design
outside
because hes transforming
alien
HlLL We sort came sort
withered remainder head
And time
design iterations
it important
head actually shrunk
to point outer exoskeleton
head actually tight
to Fifield kind distorted human
FERNANDEZ
While body things
really comes to
like proportions
Limb length like joints
setup legs arms
So alien features
but enable
crazy movements hes gonna do
There times were designing
l dont want monstrous
Its gonna quick
were gonna much
Funny actor winning
The digital enhancement excellent
but looks like monster
Whereas actor
looks like actor
and
pretty damned good
So done
lm able look both
and say Okay
effective
A comments kind like
You know wanted Sean Harris
Like hes great actor
and provided sense character
realism shots
And felt like seeing CG character
point Sean Harris
almost takes movie
Weta fantastic job
creating CG version Fifield
And its
You know hes disgusting
Ultimately final film
Sean Harris makeup
The Deacons birth
sequences
that people waiting for
STAMMERS l remember seeing
early concepts Deacon
six months started
shooting Were far was
I mean had know eyes
elongated head
MAN 1 
Close mouth Close mouth
Close mouth
MAN 2 Mm Yummy
MAN 3
Up Up
Neals team again know
built prosthetic version
of Deacon birth
Engineer
And film
shot
everything practically
could
MARlS Ridley said Yeah well
real can
So puppeteered Deacon
He stands starts screaming
It great They fantastic job
There couple things
add it
Weta essentially took digital scan
creature set puppet
photographed built version
matched exactly
The Deacon actually described
ultramorph
You know its come human
Engineer
So its bigger stronger
and developed
xenomorph
But its born
its finding feet
So literally
animate it
it needed sort scrabble
newly born
standingupforthefirsttime animal
feet
And time talks
STAMMERS
A lot people think know
its trying A precursor
designed alien
But jaw actually based
goblin shark
You know
Ridley loves motion has
And lower jaw
sort unlatches
and secondary jaw comes out
and thats totally Deacons jaw
based on
STAMMERS The scene end
film Prometheus taking off
and Juggefnaut taking off
Juggefnaut time
Its best action sequence film
Its long theres lots happening
theres lot drama
And know its time
Juggefnaut
in emerging silo
Shaw kind running hill
way
You thing emerging her
Its fantastic moment
MARlS Going it knew
gonna big event
We talked
miniature it
because knew
pieces it
But were worried
ship
Its complicated build Wed
takes wouldnt happy
MPC fantastic CG destruction
And sold idea
guys it
HENLEY The original derelict basis
current Juggefnaut built
What Ridley wanted film
bring higher level
of scale
STAMMERS The Juggefnaut
real difficult scale of
and its thousand foot diameter
How sort
sort size
Of course well Juggefnaut
specific design
that trying maintain
original Alien
So
little piping work
around exterior
The Juggefnaut
maintain huge scale is
HENLEY
One biggest challenges
was understanding scale
Juggernaut
and able cameraman
visualize that
When brought MPC
and analyze shots
laid postvis
we Juggefnaut
completely frame
SCOTT lm happy sequence
occurs end
You know
lot paper
and draw think
well Juggefnaut rammed
dy Prometheus
because Prometheus use
missile bring down
and doing Janek
crew left
Chance Ravel
will sacrifice
good Earth
Its moment were
pretty big effects work
And sequence
big us
The great crumpling motion
as nose Prometheus
rams Juggefnaut
The way crumple ship
one
to hold strengthen
look like theres things inside
We destruction tool
MPC
And model invisible objects inside
thats supposed structure
to help maintain form
its crushed
Luckily inside ship theres
stuff modeled sides
so explosion comes pretty quick
helps hide hollowness
of ship
STAMMERS
We pull we
You know were
Shaw Vickers ground
and theyre witnessing explosion
sky
and debris starts raining down
were absolute mayhem
PANlS The Prometheusjust explodes
billions pieces
Just like pfft air
thats pieces
that bring
ground explodes
And lot little debris hitting its
They escape theyre running
All pieces trying hit
dodged them
SCOTT
Of course doesnt end there
The Juggefnaut falls earth
like giant horseshoe
and starts roll
DOMENECH This postvis
Thats took plate
and Art Animation Department
rough version
of look like
its rendered All real
And guys Art
added extra pinnacles
Theyre called pinnacles
Theyre rock formations
Theyre like volcanic rocks
You
explosion elements there
You meteorites added
Thats Juggernaut
And pyramids
background
Its virtual environment
SCOTT And l thought
thats great idea pull off
So applying boards
designs Juggefnaut
suddenly thing starts
evolve feasible
Now its spectacular sequence
movie
English  US  SDH
THERON l feel like its movie
that uh stands own
It doesnt feel like its trying
set story
or kind continue story
SCALlA l felt way Alien franchise
developing
that
say
But saw idea
universe world
where create
contribute new
then jumped it
SCANLAN There strong references
visual references original
Whether ultimately links story
necessary
Its necessary
ticks boxes
I think Ill allowed face
ComicCon year
It l aware
enormous responsibility
to lexicon scifi iconography
SCOTT We began half
years ago story script
and years later
Its pretty damn good pretty fast
given scale production
And given fact
I particularly nervous
about returning genre
time
We got point know
want were there
Were hours minutes
right now fantastic
You might thing
slender 45 seconds maybe
A minute were lucky
So were getting point
of absolutely fine fine fine
superfine tuning
It choice
filmmakers
Pietro I finally decide
hole its gonna through
MAN
Right thats is
Um feel good it
Yeah l feel good it
Its unusual lts different
The great thing film
its really fresh
Because l The reason l didnt
science fiction years
was recycling pot
familiar stuff familiar ground
and rarely new
And I think whats interesting
feels new
So came all
SCALlA The idea Prometheus
Titan stealing gods
and giving humans
its knowledge
Its Genesis story
about uh Adam Eve
You know tree life
knowledge of uh
Answering questions that
The knowledge gods
Well cant Thats mystery
Really what uh fascinated
idea hubris
VICKERS lf youre going there
youre going die
SCOTT You know wanna clip this
I wondering
that got going
saying I now
to screwdriver go
Cut door opening Voom
Then Charlize standing there
SCALlA lts little screwdriver
Yeah
SCALlA l thought so So cut it
Yeah
Just moving
Yeah
Keep moving Yeah
You know what Leave is
It looks like screwdriver
opened door kind amusing
SCALlA Let you
I mean I fade
Better Better
Better
SCALlA Let add head then
SCOTT
Yep
This Stanley Kubrick scene
DAVlD
Yes sir
SCALlA Both Ridley
everybody film
it learning process
stage
Now this uh fully digital show
shot Red Epic digital cameras
SCOTT
Youve got careful with uh digital
because think
There is Fantastic Looks great
Youve gotta watch project it
You gotta watch light
Otherwise just And looks like mush
SCALlA We to uh reinvent data flow
import images
and uh theres step
set
in terms ingesting know
the uh raw media files
putting stereo
giving editorial
We working HD
When think about know
multiple cameras know
almost 5K resolution
and Ridley shooting cameras
I mean adds quickly
DAVlD
A superior species doubt
SCALlA For me important thing
watch dailies 3D
to sense
3D images look like
We great know
60inch screen
I monitors balanced
color graded properly
so Ridley
set
or Darek set
exactly same
as dailies
I remembered 3D shot
up
and I saw David
putting hand dark
and door opens
walks in
And its beautiful shot
3D
And like Ah
You know feeling thats like
Oh great This gonna great
It like literally opening door
world
and youre gonna it
And Ridley saw like
This gonna cool
The cut I say
that uh unlike films
actually came together uh quickly
and uh wasnt extremely long
I think probably slightly
half hours
Whereas usually pictures end
like three
It easy
cut
and eliminate lot stuff
SHAW A woman Africa told story
world came be
SCALlA When l showed Ridley
said Oh works
I think engine
Theres problem
It actually fits
I aiming it obviously
lot shorter that
I mean I think goal
hours
The stage cut
of taking half hour
half
1 5 minutes fairly easy
because certain scenes
apparent dont need
For example
Janek Vickers scene
because movie
going else
and I didnt wanna
brakes then so
And Ridley recognized well
He said That comes out
JANEK
It turn push button
Why decide
tell story now
Because killed man today
SHAW GRUNTlNG AND YELLING
SCALlA That scene was uh know
storyboarded Ridley previs
And uh Ridley showed me
and I shocked then heh
l saw that
l dont know
youre gonna shoot this
To me content
I wanted strength woman
For me trying accurate
performance Noomi gave
Amazing
I mean its physical expression
I mean body
uh contort
and l vein neck
pulsating like that
and seeing upsidedown shot
mouth opening
You know connections that
That pain me very physical
I didnt wanna cheapen
shortchange it
or worry about
Oh its gonna much
I mean its realistic
And yes maybe its hard watch
but thats drama it
Im looking shes going through
SCREAMlNG
SCOTT How scary lm allowed
depends MPAA say
Obviously
negotiation
but its trying
original
which was days
pretty hardup
ALIEN SCREECHES
The rules changed today
The realities MPAA rules
And I dont them
make
minimal amounts blood
for reason
brightline rule
Its scene like naturally
enhanced blood
Just pure simple
It disgusting lt terrifying scary
And yes lot
sound rest it
but point
cheap it
Because cute
youre showing it
MAN 1  Drop it Drop it
SCOTT Hand Noomi
MAN 1 
Drop it
MAN 2
That bit bloody
That Sweeney Todd
MAN 3 Bloody hell
ALL CHUCKLE
The basic math stuff
release R movie R
If way R
PG1 3
Theres straight business
conversation it
and its difference hundreds
millions dollars worldwide box office
So thats reality
And suffice say Fox
responsible financial entity
would prefer version gives
number hundreds millions
You gotta sure youre covered
youve gotta argue case
Its pretty uh aggressive Pretty hairy
SHAW PANTlNG AND GROANING
SCALlA lf discussion about uh
rating know back
and process
of know showing different versions
of like reduced cuts
But then comes fact
like movie wanna release
Do want
watereddown version
I uh believe Ridley shot
and integrity scene
stay way is
MAN 1  B camera mark
MAN 2 B mark
SCOTT lf leave here
MAN l wouldnt wanna up
We leave
And Charlie do
SCOTT
What Charlie now
now were close
to answering
meaningful questions
ever asked mankind
SCALlA Weyland having woken up
meeting Shaw
Shaw no
Have lost faith
Shaw determined out
Vickers meeting Weyland
At time that
we Fifield
garage
attacking crew
and time it
time scenes done
they come elevator
theyre faced Fifield
MERCENARY
Put thing down
Tricky do
because simply terms movie time
material cover
We struggled position
structural position that
and certain point
tried different spots
But uh ultimately l figured l wanted
happen simultaneously
And found I spot
cesarean scene
I intercut
somewhat delirious
with Fifields fight downstairs
That allowed intercut
Fifield scene shorter
Not little
To able jump action
To violent aggressive
Then leave long time
You leave uh cut
Youre hovering maybe 21 2 21 5
That feels good
Still lot things
try address things
Clarity dialogue character
storylines track
SHAW ON MONITOR
They gave life Someone
Someone killed them
Thats good
Gave life works screen
SCALlA lt cuts little but
It helps bit Yeah Yeah
Then like picture month
right before uh
predubs final mix
theres push
film settled
where start taking lot
its surprising
You think
Why didnt l before
But film
things settle month
we took literally
about l say
Even additional reshoots
done
I able
1 5 minutes out
And right now
were twohour mark
When pass
anything shouldnt there
out
Yes youll miss it
Yes else
But know decisions
ultimately director makes
CHUCKLlNG
and uh hopefully theyre right ones
Thats good
Oh God
PLAYING DRAMATlC MUSlC
SCOTT lve invested talent
Marc Streitenfeld
for movies
and hes marvelous score
time
This real challenge him
because its combination
symphonic
Marc comes point view
having marvelous sounds
Hes got great sounds head
musical things
He applies sounds music
I kind like way thinking
But instance youve gotta
Youre obliged address fact
symphonic
STREITENFELD Theres few uh pieces
I wrote early on
where l sounds head
sound ideas l heard
When I talked Ridley
sound first
and kind
pulsating sound
When Engineer
drinks DNA liquid um its uh
In way its beautiful way
its aggressive violent
But exactly spot
where actually that um
know heartbeat
That kind of That associated
with know Engineers
And went a know more um
Something more um ethereal
that know led creation life
and uh forming DNA water
When arrive um
planet distance
and know shutters open up
and David uh gets glimpse
planet theyre gonna to
And uh me important moment
David
In face actually
means him
And that um know
expectation something
I think thats I tried
alive film
that David actually um
looking personally
and robot servant
but um actually identity
him
and looking something
You know I love
Jerry Goldsmiths score Alien and uh
theres haunting
integral that
It wasnt copying that
l point l idea
that I wanted pay
little bit homage him
So example
I thought Weyland comes up
and introduces hologram
I wanted use signature
WEYLAND
My Peter Weyland
I employer
STREITENFELD
I love Goldsmith score
and uh I listened times
I started working
It amazing film
Studio One downstairs Abbey Road
specialsounding room
Its best rooms uh world
and uh makes big difference uh
you know record
great environment
Its final day scoring today
Weve going 1 5 days
This big old undertaking
PLAYING DRAMATlC MUSlC
STREITENFELD Im constantly making
adjustments orchestra sound
to color of uh youre hearing
And know doesnt stop
I Im recording l mix
I mean thats ongoing process
I think its detached lt needs
flow legato flow it
Marc melody
theres strong melody
that runs
different ways
Theres strong
motivic um development
some themes belong alien
that creep
alien referred to
STREITENFELD The Deacon moment
end is obviously great moment
to disgusting heh
great fun
I recorded moment know
kinds different layers
with orchestra
creepy possible
For fan of uh know Alien films
thats iconic moment
when Deacon comes out
Engineer
So definitely great moment
score
SCALlA l thought
sound design
that sound design
dramatic use
So parts
wont music
where sound
do know heavy lifting
Theres great rhythms youve got
Play up
because theyre like machines
theyre musical
A bit crisp door ching
Keep morphine haze going
WEYLAND
then surely save us
It makes slightly sinister intense
SHAW Havent told theyre gone
They sound
like commonorgarden
staple gun youve got desk
MAN 1  Yeah Nail gun
You need hightech sound
MAN 2 More hightech complex
Yeah Right right
Keep overlap stuff
going truck
What add maybe Holloway
A little bit screams
We dont anybody talking
maybe Holloway few Aah
STOECKlNGER
My interaction initially Pietro
Going film Pietro
own
and picking choosing moments
inspired sound team
that Im
start creating sounds for
HEMPHlLL For me Prometheus l
love Alien film its different film
For me intriguing
classic scifi sense
Theyre going adventure
We tried track too
For us real challenge
Mark Stoeckinger Ron l
and people track
live realm scifi heritage
of sounds
youve heard before
A lot it tried pick musical sounds
Were live
Because scifi real tradition
musicality sounds
STOECKlNGER Prometheus great
collaborative experience
Everybody matter specialty
was department was
everybody ideas shared
Ron Bartlett great musical
background great singing voice
When starting meet

Even struggles
having
ENGlNEER SPEAKlNG
IN ALIEN LANGUAGE
We actual actors voice
first
and normal guy

He say He learned
Sanskrit words everything
but didnt
deep resonant voice
and wasnt processed anything
So temp mix I said
Hey dont I home studio
Ill deep

STOECKlNGER
So Ron started recording
this incredibly deep voice
recreate
through chain
of know compressors
and tube valve amps whatever
I dont know is
I know outcome is its awesome
ENGlNEER SPEAKlNG
IN ALIEN LANGUAGE
BARTLETT What end
He these lm like Oh boy

probably microphone going Blah
SPEAKlNG ALIEN LANGUAGE
IN DEEP VOlCE
You know like deep

HEMPHlLL
Ridley loves contrast
One favorite moments
film is uh orrery
when shuts down
David left standing there
Ridley loves moment
And then know
David starts hear sound
of heartbeat Engineer
The huge levels dynamics
effective
At end theres large creature
attacking somebody
You want scary
You want powerful
So use certain sounds
that
And weight
lot things
like if know big tentacle
slaps thing
its gonna fat
I watch original Alien
l did
So I iPhone
I listened it
without watching it
couple times through
Just things stood me
things unique
Ian Holm gets head ripped off
or David Prometheus
gets head ripped off
The voice changes
its longer connected
to mother board
anymore
DAVlD
I know
Have good journey Mr Weyland
I filled mouth water
and microphone
gaggled garbled
and kind sticky
wet sound processed
It makes little like electronic
DAVlD ON RECORDlNG
Have good journey Mr Weyland
Turn speakers little bit
Problem is
I think its Whats actually reenactment
moment on
because machine
DAVlD Have good journey Mr Weyland
STOECKlNGER Does change
I like add this
DAVlD Mr Weyland
Have good journey Mr Weyland
Thats flutter
Yeah Yeah
Paradise
STOECKlNGER We sorts things
1 979
Guitar pedals weird flanging units
to affect Davids voice
sound severed weird
Nowadays deal computers
evertyhing automated
Well guitar pedals arent automated
So time
chain
it change Ron
and adjusting it
I adjusting it
And like live performance
times mixing movie
HEMPHlLL The way Ridley likes work
mixes is
weve obviously got lot material
zillion tracks whatever
but wants flow
He doesnt wanna know
stop start
He wants happens
perform sound
That mistakes fine
its concepts
You finesse
You finesse later whatever
but concepts right
So tempo fast Ridley
You audience
You watch movie
audience respond it
Were technicians
Thats do
Were moviegoers were storytellers
And watch film
hearts it
and characters doing
whats going on
And mix
audience member
VlCKERS YELLING
VICKERS

SCREAMS
KEENE The original Alien film
influential movies time
So gonna lot
lnternet buzz lot fan buzz
about know effectively know
Ridley making new Alien film
FASSBENDER Its
mythology know
That film huge impact
and sparked imagination

This l scificomicbook
superhero sort fans theyre vocal fans
And theyre passionate
theyre loyal
THERON Theyre bunch nerds
I love that
I love that
I think theres
incredibly special undeniable
when fan base
loves genre
ELLENBERG The speculation lnternet
movie been frankly fantastic
Its interesting us occasionally
amusing theres strange stuff
but showed passion
subject
how deeply previous movies
affected people
and yearning
stories continue
but frankly quality
level science fiction return
SPAIHTS It time
I touched something
that alive imagination
fan base
that people anticipating
long came out
My notes meetings
even like slips lip
by l divulge plot details
monetary value cultural value
People ravenous
making stuff web
And time l sat
room thinking
knowing tens
thousands people there
wondering l to
waiting it
And thats different way write
Ive coming Con
since uh mid90s
And I waited line

If 1 0 fans
people know Alien franchise
backwards forwards room

Ridley Scott wants do
is piss people who essentially
25 years
like sort idolized movie
Would guys like talk
little bit Prometheus
ALL Yeah
Anybody interested
Prometheus attempts giving answer
Its bold statement
were saying film
MARSHALLGREEN I think were fortunate
bring back
with philosophical questions
creature
THERON Ultimately
circumstance
where got close
understanding come from
I think biggest question be
adapt thought
or taught believe
faith tells believe
Perhaps thread of uh
movie
is cautionary tale
perils playing God
SCANLAN
I feel like lm working original film

Were Alien
