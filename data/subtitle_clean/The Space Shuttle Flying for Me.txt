Beauty
The shuttle
beautiful flight

boy
strutting stuff
She kind looking
telling us ok guys were
good were
were stopping it
I want know I
recognize that
Im happy that
accomplished
lot program
The final touchdown
Atlantis ended era
worlds
reusable

I believe
Space Shuttle
going
history

remarkable advances
aviation
space ever
A reusable space vehicle
We before
That
giant leap forward
I think weve
awfully lot
30 years
The shuttle

international
partnership
total spectrum
come

activity
judgment equal

accomplishment
landing moon
It vehicle houses
1960s 1970s technology
We learned
technologies
work

imagined
before
You airplane
launch like rocket
space
spacecraft
spend 2 weeks orbit fly
land runway
like big cargo airplane
Nothing
taken place
The concept reusable
space plane
long
NASA began launching men
orbit rockets
beginning Mercury
Program early 1960s
With Gemini later Apollo
rockets got bigger
United States landed
Moon 10 years
space program
Tranquility Base here
The Eagle landed
The moon landings
mankinds greatest feat
john young charlie
duke scampered moons
surface spring 1972
Congress approved funding
NASAs goal Space
livable workable place
affordable price
The people got
Moon began turn
attention Space Shuttle
The concept reusable
I think
nobel endeavor
turned
reusable space craft
took lot care feeding
goal
Glynn Lunney veteran flight
director Apollo

early program managers
Space Shuttle
NASA space team
pretty clear goal
building
machine
people
things
Earths
orbit bring
home

fairly lively
reliably
Apollo
cheaply
When ultimately approved
President Nixon 1972
project picked
great steam moved
forward design
vehicle turned
partially reusable
thats took
shuttle program
As Lunney oversaw
Skylab ApolloSoyuz
missions mid70s
shuttle began shape
So
major
progress
design construction
Space Shuttle
I credit
Bob Thompson
program manager
years 70s
team people
So issue were arguing
functional test
You ought function
test
We thought want
build stage fully
reusable
vehicle big flyback
booster Marshall
big orbiter
A JSC like Apollo mode
But vehicle
complex
It cost bit
So figured simple
way thing
judgement
turned
better way
thing
The Space Shuttle
new way fly
Its development plagued
cost overruns
delays critics

It took breath away
rattled bones
close space launch
As soon Columbia lifted

Its behemoth its monster
skyscraper
right
you
Gleaming white lights
Making noise
its groaning
moaning
liquid hydrogen
thats inside it
You suit on
five mile trip
pad
turns getting in
pilot
time
youre thinking

scenario
youve
trained for
For me technique
I got strapped
vehicle body
It extension me
You remember its
half million pound vehicle
sitting tail thats
going lift
million pounds
thrust burn propellents
rate
tons second supersonic
minute
Theres vehicle
operates like that
And auto
sequence start
When gets
thirty seconds
thats starts
attention
Firing chain armed
And clocks
counting thirty
seconds
ten nine eight
Tminus ten nine
Suddenly I
felt rush
adrenaline because
oh were gonna right
Seven Six
Were inside seven seconds
Space
Shuttle main
engines ignite
sequentially
Four three
And
produce
million pounds thrust
Two one
The solid rocket
boosters ignite
Zero lift off
Lift Lift Lift
Lift
And it Bang
The shuttle
cleared tower
That explosion end
boosters
ignite
simulated
Roger Roll Endeavour
Houston controlling
You know
leaving town right now
Its lot like driving
car loose shocks
gravel road
bouncing rocking
I remember
read screens

vibrating much
I kind like wow
The sound intense
feel hear it
I remember looking mach
meter increased
mach 3 Im looking
I said holy smokes
And going
wow machine is
One minute seconds
flight were standing
separation twin solid
rocket boosters Discovery
traveling 2695 miles hour
At 60 miles were
leveled accelerating
times
force gravity
Standing solid rocket
booster separation
When leave atmosphere
lose solid rockets
its pure
acceleration
Big flash window
separate away
instantly smooth quiet I
thought second
heart kind leaped
I thought oh God
engines stopped
You know Were going die
And thats experience
zero gravity time
Your introduction
weightlessness
fabulous
All sudden
cabin floating
I dreams I
kid I run
street arms
lift
fly like Peter
Pan Superman
thats
weightlessness like
Its
wonderful experience
Earth Earth
It neatest thing
hover midair
You fly go
You dont walk anywhere
Looking
Earth
daylight
darkness
amazing
So youre going 17500
miles hour 45 minutes
sun comes goes
youre orbiting
Earth watching
transition youre going
darkness daylight
darkness know
45 minutes later surreal
You saw sights
dont Earth
When talk
discoveries things
happen human beings

opportunity space
perspective
Earth changes
My time space I
looked got orbit
I saw big island
I realized
continent Africa
And continent
heritage I
tears come face

lines study
geography planet
went window
The Space Shuttle
actually operated like
rocket launch
spaceship were
orbit its
ton glider
come entry
landing
Atlantis Houston
orbit burn
We hit atmosphere
4000 miles
landing point
heat starts build up
Copy Houston
orbit burn
And outside started
black
Then got kind grayish
outside went white
yellow orange
flashing I floated
looked
nose cap its normally
black carbon material
carnation pink
And eyes got big
And embers going
window I thought
couple things
I thought wow simulator
doesnt
second thing was
I hope its important
Atlantis 6 12
minutes landing
altitude 81000 feet
traveling 1700 miles hour
So sturn vehicle
control energy
lower atmosphere
Once come
runway
pilots work
Thats manual
control time
subsonic
Arrival announced twin
sonic boom drops
speed sound
And remember point
were runway
40000 feet minutes
were going ground
The shuttles decent rate
20 times steeper
commercial airliner
Its angle attack
seven times steeper
You dive
thousand feet start
nose up youre aiming
mile short runway
And remember
youre glider
cant around
At 400 feet pilot puts
landing gear down
The gear locked
And commander
lands 200 knots
Main gear touch down
Pilot puts drag sheet
185 so
And roll stop
That hourthe hour
burn wheel stops
runway
amazing hour
And Ill forget I got
biggest smile face
said Wow fun
I want
again
The Space Shuttle program
That programs
I think country
pooled
everybody together
Whenever
Space Shuttle launch
matter were
felt pride America
The inspiration
American
people

Space Shuttle
program I think
going
hard
duplicate
country
Almost 10 years
Lunar Mission
US Space program
roared life
Space Shuttle
NASA like rest
country
changing times
new shuttle era
Gone
chainsmoking skinny ties
Moon program days
Milt Heflin moving
ladder flight director
witnessed transformation
When shuttle
program started
far men
women
team room
uh way

business
damn thing changed
Yes difference

minorities
women bigger
team
Outstanding did
The Astronaut Corps taking
contemporary look
NASA announced new
class astronauts 1978
Designed carry
7 astronauts
including pilots
mission specialists
shuttle opened
space travel wider
spectrum candidates
It wasnt
Space Shuttle
specifically said
want
include women
minorities
mix
We evolved type
astronauts have
The type things
able space
We women doctors
We kinds people
brought
space program likes
seen before
Well pretty
exciting
largest group
astronauts
taken
They
actually going
women
I
surprised
took
class 35
start mid1978
I think women
immediately pretty close
knew
going different women
They wanted sure
women suited kind
position I felt
fortunate I
group
The thing
I
interesting
NASA
accepted idea
going
women class
Im sure
male colleagues
particularly pilots
Viet Nam probably
werent working
women professionally maybe
doubts
going do
But I think quickly fit
proved
going good job
It wasnt like early
days space exploration

test pilots flying vehicles
learning
We going Space
Shuttle going
live work
space
going need
lots
different skills
lots different
experiences
Astronaut Corps
actually reflected that
America soon
new heroes
Astronauts represented
segment
population
The Challenger crew STS41G
1984 model NASAs
generation space
explorers
We seven crew members
The time seven flew
We time foreign
payload specialist
Mark Garneau Canada flew
board flight
And payload
specialist Australia
Paul ScullyPower so
eclectic crew
women
Kathy Sullivan Sally Ride
Kathy I
going
space walk
Kathy
going
woman
world
space walk
And lot media
attention lot
Bob Crippen flew
shuttle flight
Commander
Sally Ride
flight
American woman
Nobody wanted ask
questions talk us
They wanted talk
three
So lot time
kibitzing sidelines
enjoying attention
folks getting
The diversity class
1978 inspire waves
astronauts follow
I didnt
goal
astronaut
growing up
Frankly little girls couldnt
grow astronauts
early sixtys
And I college
group women
selected astronauts
So reality
potential
My day Houston
Sally Rides day
Houston
And meet her meet
role models literally
opened doors
previously closed women
astounding
Kathy Sullivan
female EVA
There
group women astronauts
look
say this
I now
Cady Coleman selected
astronaut 1992
Today shes NASAs Senior
Astronaut flights
Space Shuttle missions
expedition
International Space Station
Its
clear
recent years
theres
perspective
everybody brings
comes
diversity
If it
it
And dont it
occur you
That importance
actually film
On TV book
advertisement
seeing somebody
identify with
Probably looks little bit
like you value
stated
somebody like
think
maybe I this
During decades
shuttle missions
49 women fly space
Astronauts include people
ethnicity
including flyers 16
different nations
As shuttle hurtled
space
look skyward
know they flying me
Three two one
We SRB ignition
historys largest astronaut crew
its way
In early 80s NASA
roll orbiters
joined Columbia

My second mission
aboard Columbia
launched January 12th
1986 landed
January 18th 1986
We real
high point time
Just days later January
28th lost
Space Shuttle Challenger
lost entire crew
We turned
television watch
training session
liked watch
friends fly
And explosion
happened know
everybody thought boosters
came soon
Where boosters go
What happened
The shuttles
flying its main engines
began things
fall ocean
realized gone
Flight controllers
looking carefully
situation
Obviously major malfunction
You know
close friends flight
A number
class
It time
adult life I
friends die
To die
time watch
incredibly
incredibly sad
We learned awful
lot difficult
painful lessons
Challenger
I forget
world I finished
second space flight
flight
Mission Commander
space
10 days dropping
deepest darkest hole
imagine
Challenger hit close home
husband
landed
second flight
And I remembered standing
roof launch
control center
families watched
launches incredibly
incredibly cold
launched
Some mornings
cold morning
Challenger launched
And realize
husband
I afraid
Hoot flew
More afraid I
going spouse
left behind
The goal frequent access
space like
elusive dream NASA
The failure solid rocket
booster o ring cold weather
caused agency space
industry retool
procedure shuttle
program up
When shuttle returned
flight discovery
September 1988 outlook
program changing
After I left shuttle
severely curtailed
It going

people
thought

accident
A lot customers
went
different launch vehicles
content
going changed
diminished frankly
And shuttle come
flying basically
support NASAs
programs itself
With commercial
satellites defense
payloads going elsewhere
nasa
pressure deliver science
deployment hubble
telescope sts31 like
thing 1990
Hubbles mirrors
nearsighted
challengers
replacement endeavour
sent fix 1993
We lost Mars observer
way Mars
unmanned probe
So NASA collectively
manned unmanned
bit
doghouse time
The December flew
repair mission STS61
I got office
single sheet
paper laying desk
copy
Congressional record
And page basically said
NASA unable
accomplish repair mission
aware future
funding going
jeopardy
That probably
time I paused
thought myself
holy cow
A veteran crew
featured 36 grueling hours
spacewalks
Kathryn Thornton Tom Akers
Jeff Hoffman
Story Musgrave saved Hubble
monumental failure
Thats way I
beating drum
I wanted cadence
spacewalk
problems
closing doors
We overcame Story
Musgrave basically idea
I thought excellent
team ground here
collective team
little bit nervous
Im thinking Story
knows hell hes
hes going hurt anything
And flight director I
the
its easy
I gave
that
And stayed timeline
The thing I enjoy
lead flight
director
flight
accomplished things
mission
I noticed looking
room initially
lot tense locked
jaws smiles peoples
heads working
But mission
occasionally
grin
something
accomplished something
And
superb efforts

shown NASA
promise
more
And grins
kept coming
The EVAs STS61 proved
humans work adapt
space better
imagine
The mission laid groundwork
NASAs future
subsequent service
missions Hubble
making telescope
shuttles greatest achievements
I selected Hubble
because its
icon
shuttle program
NASA
An army helicopter pilot
Nancy Currie grappled Hubble

shuttles robotic arm
STS109 2002
Currie moving
grapple
Hubble Space Telescope
Grapple confirmed
My saying I dont
grapple guys dont
EVA lets
things first
And seeing giant
spacecraft come right

Nancy reached up
grabbed it stacked

climbed
like ants
week
fixed it
Linnehans spacewalking
partner Hubble
veteran John Grunsfeld
serviced
telescope
separate missions
It
combination
humans extending
reach
fix telescope allow
use Hubble look
beginning universe
between
And time Space Shuttle
went Hubble
installed new instruments
new upgrades series
flights transformed
view universe
view
came from
And set story
Space Shuttle
remarkable machine
The Space Shuttle pushed
performance limits service
Hubble crews
knew taking
greater risks
The shuttle
capability 350
maybe little bit
nautical miles
come again
And come
literally
fuel left tanks
burn exhaustion
home
So things dont
exactly right
come home
Hubble mission thats
reasons its
considered bit dangerous
shuttle missions
But risks worth
add Hubbles legacy
The prolific important
scientific instrument built
man Hubble
Space Telescope
Its produced science
PHDs
knowledge
universe terms
universe
weve done
John Grunsfeld recalls saying
goodbye Hubble 2009
8th EVA repair
upgrade telescope
Coming airlock
end fifth EVA I thought
I cant believe actually
accomplished
set
little bit more
The day Hubble
end robotic arm
321 release
Let go Backed away
And course orbit
saw Hubble drift away
And I wasnt sad I actually
happy wed given
Hubble best opportunity
long observant career
ahead it
But Im thrilled

Hubble long life
The legacy
Space Shuttle program
I think folks look
hundreds years now
launch servicing
Hubble Space Telescope
It given
incredible view universe
Its opened eyes
wonders beauty
universe way I think
equalled
And
ability grab
Hubble send people
out like myself
space suits new
instruments allowed
incredible views
When I grew I
Trekkie Star Trek
kid wasnt
And I wanted
astronaut
But couple episodes
theyre flying
giant amebas theres
colors
beautiful things I go
Its beautiful cant
look like that
Well know what got
Hubble pictures back
look like that
Its like its
determine art science
know stop blend
together
Thats magic thing

The fact worked
trivial
extra effort led
lot benefit
world community
Being ISS
program actually fulfilled
dreams
I child
I looked
I thought
imagine itd
like launch

rendezvous dock
space
So
STS92
permanent crew onboard
In fact permanent
crew going launch
week landed
So got there
wasnt anybody home
In fact I slept
night daughters
teddy bear
Thats probably answer
trivia question right
Whos person
slept

Then blooms
windows approach it
fine detail
You incarnation

think
like this
Something thats
twoacres size
complex machine

its glory right

actually youre run

kept growing
growing
And approach

Just magnificent facility
The completion
International Space Station
fulfilled goal
shuttle program space
workable livable place
The astronauts flew
shuttle walked space
achieved dream
Their unique experience
universe remains legacy

The
memorable
experiences

look outside
The hatch faces
earth
youre sort leaning
edge youre
looking down
And its magic sea
miles away going
beneath
clouds maybe ocean
maybe land
unreal
And out
vivid
Theres air theres dust
entire visual field

What struck was
clarity beauty

High Def TV
Two
