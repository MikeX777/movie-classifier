Walking shoes torture
I mean man woman
Certainly werent designed flying

Call out Merlin
Then well draw straws
And lucky be
Yes sir Jim Andrews
Leon

Flying it
Leon mean gonna fly it
I dont think I’m right man job
I got sinus condition

I suppose so
Oh Leon look wonderful
I do Of course do
My boy step training
I want film
Of flying machines action
Lights please Jennifer
Theres chance learn
peoples mistakes
Some flying machines motordriven
So course cant manpowered flight
Stanley
But were interested
In scientific thinking went designing them
The aerodynamics theory flight
Merlin fool ground
Cant you Leon laughing sure
At fella knew heavier load
The power needed lifting
So kept weight down
laughing kept down too
I wonder Mr Green okay rockets
Oh guess not
Any flying machine needs lightest
And strongest materials possible
Light lift
And strong hold pressure
This neither
Now come ornithoptic approach flying
Trying fly imitating
The upanddown movement birds wings
Not unlike trying swim
By imitating wiggle fishs tail
These fellas didnt understand
The fundamentals flying
Now application scientific principles
This wing structure represents great advance
laughing
But isnt perfect
Although looks different flying machine
Is actually like ours
Well look
cliff like
To launch from
Take advantage air currents
I guess air currents day
It shouldve flown
Lights
The important thing Leon weve learned is
Leon
Leon
What earth doing
Im taking off
But feet ground
Didnt learn film
Sure I learned kind bird I am
Chicken
Stanley chattering
You know Leon manpowered flight project
Is making hero campus
All girls sigh mentioned
