WELL HERE I AM
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
HERE I AM
SORRY FELLAS
HERE I AM
COME ALONG JUNE
THE MORE I STAY
INSIDE THESE WALLS
THE MORE I FEEL
LIKE A CONVICT
ALL PLEBES
GO THROUGH THAT
ITS THE WAY YOU EARN YOUR
LIBERTIES FOR NEXT YEAR
I DONT WANT
ANY NEXT YEAR
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
IM JUST FED UP ON BEING
A MIDSHIPMAN THATS ALL
BUT YOUVE ONLY
STARTED
YOU DONT HAVE
TO TELL ME THAT
BUT IF YOU THINK IM GOING
TO GO THROUGH 4 SOLID YEARS
OF THIS NAVY RATTLETRAP
YOURE CRAZY
OH THERE THERE
MR MOUNT VESUVIUS
AFTER THE WAY YOU
TALKED IN NEW YORK
I CANT UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND
ABOUT THE ACADEMY
BUT NOW YOURE HERE
ITS DIFFERENT
NO NO IT ISNT
IM GOING TO GET OUT OF THIS
PLACE ON A GREASED SLIDE
WHAT DOES YOUR FATHER
SAY ABOUT THAT
I HAVENT SEEN MY DAD
UP CLOSE IN 3 MONTHS
NOBODYS GOING TO SAY
IM GREASING MY OLD MAN
IM NOT GOING
TO SEE HIM EITHER
IM JUST GOING
TO CLEAR OUT
IT MAY BE TOUGH
TO GET IN HERE
BUT THEY SAY ITS EASY
TO GET OUT IF YOU WANT TO
IM JUST GOING TO
RESIGN THATS ALL
WE CAN PICK UP
WHERE WE WERE
BEFORE I MADE THE
MISTAKE OF COMING HERE
DICK IF YOU QUIT
THE ACADEMY
I NEVER WANT TO SEE YOU
AGAIN AS LONG AS I LIVE
BUT I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
ME TO STAY OUT OF THE NAVY
WELL THAT WAS TRUE
WE TALKED OF STARS
AND GOT A LITTLE DIZZY
AND WE TALKED ABOUT
MARRIAGE AND THINGS
BUT IM TALKING ABOUT
YOU AND NOW
YOU CHOSE TO ENTER
THE ACADEMY
IF YOU CHOOSE
TO GO YELLOW
ON WHAT YOU SWORE TO DO
WHEN YOU BECAME A MIDSHIPMAN
BUT IM NOT GOING
YELLOW IM JUST QUITTING
IF YOU QUIT ANYTHING
YOU SWORE TO DO
WHETHER IT BE NAVY
OR THE NORTH POLE
I WOULDNT THINK
VERY MUCH OF YOU
OH YOU DONT
MAKE SENSE
IF I STAY IN THE ACADEMY
YOU WONT MARRY ME
BECAUSE THAT
MAKES ME A NAVY MAN
YOU LOST YOUR FATHER AND
BROTHER THAT WAY IS THAT RIGHT
AND IF I GET OUT
OF THE ACADEMY
NOW THAT IM IN IT YOU
WONT SEE ME ANYMORE
IS THAT RIGHT TOO
YES THATS RIGHT TOO
WOULD YOU MIND IF I
SAID GOOD AFTERNOON
IM GOING SLOWLY AND
COMPLETELY DAFFY
AND THAT SIR IS THAT
MIDSHIPMANS OPINION
OF THE UNITED STATES
NAVAL ACADEMY
IF YOU WERE HE SIR WHAT WOULD
YOU DO STAY IN OR GET OUT
IF I WERE THAT BOY
ID GET OUT AS FAST
AS I COULD
YOU WOULD SIR
YES
BUT I DONT KNOW OF ANY
MIDSHIPMAN IN THE ACADEMY
ANSWERING THE DESCRIPTION
YOUVE GIVEN ME
IF HE IS HERE
HE CERTAINLY OUGHT NOT TO BE
BUT I DO KNOW THAT THE
BELLIGERENT YOUNG NINCOMPOOP
YOUVE JUST DESCRIBED
ISNT MY SON
THE SPIRIT OF THE ACADEMY
INCLUDES MANY ELEMENTS
BESIDES THE QUALITIES
OF HONOR
PERSONAL INTEGRITY
AND LOYALTY TO THE SERVICE
IT INCLUDES
SPORTSMANSHIP
THE SPIRIT THAT ENABLES A MAN
TO BE ABLE TO GIVE AND TAKE
AND UNLESS THAT MIDSHIPMAN
CAN LEARN THAT QUALITY
HE MAY FIND HIMSELF
IN THE UNFORTUNATE POSITION
OF WORKING UP THROUGH
HIS CLASSES WITH NO PALS
NO FRIENDS ALONE
THANK YOU SIR
PERHAPS THATS
THE COURSE
THAT MIDSHIPMAN
MAY CHOOSE TO STEER
GOOD MORNING SIR
MISTER
IVE NOTICED
A FADING AWAY
OF YOUR SPIRITS
OF LATE
AND I FEEL MISTER THAT
ITS PERHAPS DUE TO THE LOSS
OF YOUR LATE LAMENTED PUBLIC ACCLAIM
AND AS AN ANTIDOTE TO
THAT GRIEVOUS CONDITION
THE FIRST CLASSMEN ARE
WILLING TO BE GENEROUS
THEIR DRAGS ARE WITH
THEM IN SMOKE HALL
THEIR HEARTS ARE INFLAMED
AT THE VERY THOUGHT
OF HEARING THE GOLDEN
VOICE OF PLEBE DICK MELVILLE
SING A HEART SONG
TO THEIR LADYLOVES
WITH PERHAPS
THE VAIN HOPE
THAT THE LADYLOVES MIGHT
BECOME AMOROUSLY AFFECTED
SENTIMENTALLY
INCLINED
AND WILLING TO WAIT FOR TWO
YEARS AFTER OUR GRADUATION
FOR THE CONGRESSIONALLY
DELAYED NUPTIALS
IN OTHER WORDS
MISTER FOLLOW ME
THERE YOU ARE
MISTER
NOW YOU CAN TURN ON
YOUR PERSONALITY
AYE AYE SIR
EXCUSE ME SIR
WHAT WILL BE
YOUR FANCY SIR
OH JUST TURN IT ON
AYE AYE SIR
 WHEN SOMEONE TELLS ME
TO MARCH OR TO HALT
