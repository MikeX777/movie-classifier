You right friend
thing I feel
learning death
immense relief
Which advantages
Massigny obtained
triumphal entrance
City Council
City Paris
We ask ourselves
Instead
humiliating failure
shed light urgent necessity
improve universal suffrage
abolish it
During 2 months incomparable
polemist Paul Massigny
confined newspaper columns
methodically took distance
And then speaking
proposal new law
renewing banking privileges
risked putting
national wealth
hands Rothchilds
Paul Massigny
threw Minister Bridoux
ferocity
authorities
cant stay indifferent
Accused court
condemned
3 months imprisonment
breathes freely
breach opened
So pervading
injustice marked him
And time
vital part soul
Nevertheless Massigny
carries managerial duties
extinguished
The number subscribers
triples weeks
His team coworkers
closes ranks him
During years
Massigny grand rivals
Some honoring
today presence
died
But
significance force
renewal social thinking
Because
insulted patiently
long time
They ask themselves
rekindle hate again
But believes hate
shows heart mixed up
The profound
emitted work Massigny
resonate forever
free man
Quick close windows
Go water
