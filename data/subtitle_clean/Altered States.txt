It wont interfere work
were Hobart
What getting into

He says youve working
complex drug
which brought Mexico
It hasnt thoroughly tested
dangerous hell
What Mason write you
That past year youve taken
grams drug yourself
and unusual instance
genetic regression months ago
You leukemia lymphoma
Hes trying
complete workup
but youve refused go
Hes worried stiff youre cracking up
He thinks youre behaving strangely
and begged talk
I got back
Mason pathologically incapable
keeping mouth shut anything
Hes stupid starched doctrinaire idiot
Mason firstrate doctor

and evidence
suggestion whatsoever cancer
What Mason write you
Which
baboon vocalizations them

to accept deviant concept
that states consciousness
real waking state
and reality externalized
Youre screaming
I patronizing shit
from Arthur Mason months
Im sick it
Weve got millions years stored away
bank minds
We got trillions dormant genes
us evolutionary past
Perhaps Ive tapped that
I want tank
repeat experiment
The elementary laboratory behavior
Repeat experiment Confirm it
I like responsible scientists
I it
I like little consensual validation
this
We demonstrated
new force nature
For Gods sake dont agree
merits investigation
I tapes notes everything
What time like come
look stuff tomorrow
200 230
