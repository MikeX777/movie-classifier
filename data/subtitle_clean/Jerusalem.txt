Ill eyewash The
swelling gone week
His eyes clear
children
In case let continue
baptism
In Father
Son Holy Ghost
Lift hearts God
O Lord Jesus
baptism ordinated Thee
As said His disciples
To Me given power heaven
O Lord Thou art rock
redeemer sole comfort
On narrow path pain
I lost dear ones
But I fear nothing I know
Thy love eternal
I thank Thee leading
Holy Land
Here Thy light
I salvation
Here Thy light I Thou art
utterly close me
Here Thy Jerusalem
Amen
