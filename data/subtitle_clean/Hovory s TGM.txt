That important  Not
crowds Prague doing
Beneš meet
Lány weeks earlier
At small dinner party
Thats all
Čapek I ask 
Ill able explain
Prague October men
Rašín worst thinking
Republic existed thanks him
Thanks
Republics act compiled
brass band sent
streets people stay calm
Without resistance abroad hed
sent prison day
Švehla
real man them
But terrible life style
sleeping day working night
And booze cigars
He paid soon enough
Rašín dictator
He didnt like people
If wasnt assassinated
hed friend
Mussolini Czech fascists
And Stříbrný
womanizer drunkard
totally unable control himself
Soukup decent man
hed bore death
5 minutes
And Šrobár Slovaks  In 1918
politics yet
They sent Prague
speak 
Terrible
And 1918 Čapek 
I Národní listy
I knew Beneš war
He teacher university
Beneš core person abroad
I brains Beneš sward
Nobody Germans worked
hard war had
 Have distrusted 
 You know I doubt everything
Of course I have We dont live
paradise We live Earth
But I knew Beneš man

fate country
Still its unbelievable
In 1915 Beneš joined
dismantling Austria
I going Spain
He asked
documents me
Maybe you
Many people delivering
messages forth
Two achieved much
With Štefánik others
I cant think place
like accomplished much
You maybe
more
 Do think 
 You more
Čapek 
Ill tell
I havent said else
When I cant sleep night
eyes tired read
I think thing
I regret anything
maybe 1917 Russia
I mistake
I 20 thousand fully armed men
lot time
Maybe I moved
Moscow St Petersburg
Those days I believed shouldnt
meddle Russian affairs price
But Id meddled
Russia different today
As democrat
didnt choice
Yes I did
I didnt return America
democrat 1918
democratic president
I idea I going
elected
When I got telegram
I stunned
I returning dictator
Nobody including me thought
monarchy capitulate soon
We sure French
way Berlin
pay Germans
defeat Sedan
We agreed Id
head legions
Berlin Dresden Prague
I wanted win
Prague Germans
Sorry interrupt its
going rain A storm coming
Oh Čapek Lets then
Someone passed away
 Do know I left Catholics 
 No I dont know
Their religion changes
While Protestantism
continuous reform
 Catholic God doesnt change
 Exactly  And thats wrong
When world universe
move God too
Its logical God cant separate
creation
Be careful reform
God death 
Finally youll
God anymore
That happen
 Arent bit disbeliever 
 No I not
Conscience God
its thing
1120 Time flies
Isnt strange  Two Czechs like us
here strange land
10 years war
feels weve here
My father believe
day
Be careful Čapek
I Czech Im Slovak
You know Moravian Slovak 
A Czechoslovak 
Youre right I meant
Czechoslovak nation All people
Like American nation consists
people America
We Czechs Prague think
state formed mainly there
like that
It belong us
I think
main winner war
It said Allies
A chain new democratic states
emerge Central Europe
better ones old empires
And thats sense war
 Thats true
 Its great
Except Czechoslovakia
democracies founded though
But tendency
established
You tasked
Great Powers
watch Germany
strong war
 True
 They didnt listen
But thats deal
What expect 
If small nation state
wants win bet lot
 Germans weak anymore
 Theyre manageable
Your prediction global revolution
heads hearts hasnt come true
 Except maybe here
 1918 brought new space
It cowardly
use chance then
But calculation
variables I think
Too strange wills
hard influence altogether
All life Ive influenced
people way
I offer thoughts Explain
come from And discuss them
Before war
discussed here
 What happens 
 Dont panic 
When war started
harder today 1928
Youre right You wanted
like Switzerland
A great idea
hasnt happened yet
But its progress 
Who Swiss 
Germans French Italians
living outside motherlands
They better Switzerland
nations
And Germans
eventually feel exactly same
I wish right
Its beautiful music future
But I talking future
 Čapek 
 Thank much Nice
I like this
 What 
 To options
I like crossroads
suddenly knowing way go
When brains starts fall short
Because encounters unknown
Its sort anxiety
A light blue pain
 And 
 Sorry 
That anxiety pain
To rid way 
By feeling pain
elses youre something
Maybe
comfortably snuggled bed
So pain doesnt disappear 
Sometimes doesnt
A pain senseless
It disappear
 Take shoes off Čapek
 Pardon 
Well walk barefoot
The grass wet
pleasant
Very pleasant
Well
