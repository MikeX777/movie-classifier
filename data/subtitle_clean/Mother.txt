FACES OF CHILDREN
SaintLuc
village Upper Valais
The mayors house
On spring morning
kept away toil come
Because sorrow house
The mayor Pierre Amsler
His son Jean
His daughter Pierrette
A neighbor
The mother children
Where Mama
Shes away trip
She’s shock
lifethreatening
A days’ rest she’ll
again
Canon Taillier priest
Vissoy Jean’s godfather
And Amsler
life returned normal
managed
expected
It hurt children
left own
home poorly cared for
And torn sleeve
Every night Jean whispered
prayer mother
Staring portrait did
thought came life
smiled him
Like Sunday
Saint Martin’s day tenant
farmers pay rent
Her daughter Arlette
I can’t pay
The accident cost
husband life

So insurance company invoking
regulations
didn’t pay anything
And spring returned

Before crossed threshold

“What I want

“Mama said I wasn’t
let in”
“Sure I’m Jean I live here”
“Who said use

One day cleaned attic

That evening home

Jean merely hoped Arlette
scolding
He began understand
seriousness done
Lost
“Did hear avalanche”
The solution admit
right away
Whats wrong
“I want speak Papa”
Go pray”
Full shame anxiousness
turned mother’s portrait
image distant faded
Even portrait abandoned him
The morning
His father hadn’t
slightest reproach
Jean thought
object horror family
He felt like criminal
Dear Papa
Goodbye I’m wretch
I hope forgive me
Love Jean
“I’m going away forever
“Since forgive Arlette
