Although fourths
earthquakes originate beneath
the oceans cities far inland
escape devastation
This Turkish city
hundreds miles coast
was struck quake
lasting 27 seconds

15000 lives
As casualty lists grow
pattern earthquake activity
becomes clearer
need scientific study
and action imperative
All earthquakes
Mr Vice President
happened
months year
Six times average number
times average strength
feel
coming greater intensity
Is way
foretell when
Professor Hamaru developed
theory forecasting
Sir prevent
earth sea quakes
But erect
warning system
We new vehicle
The Hydronaut
capable
establishing system
Did prove
shake down
I dont know returned

Mr Vice President
 How you sir
Im glad got here
I heard wasnt easy
Well I help
This warning system
established world
time
evacuate cities
earthquake
