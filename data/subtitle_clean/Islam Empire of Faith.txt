In unfolding history
Islamic civilisation
humatiys grandest achievements
A worldwide power
founded simply faith
A spiritual revolution
shape nations continets
launch empire
For West history
Islam obscured
veil fear
misunderstanding
Yet Islams hidden history
deeply surprisingly
interwoven Western civilisation
It Muslim scholars reclaimed
ancient wisdom Greeks
While Europe languished
Dark Ages
It sowed seeds
Renaissance
600 years birth
Leonardo da Vinci
From way heal sick
numerals use counting
cultures globe
shaped Islamic civilisation
But this began life
single ordinary man
profound message proclaimed
change world forever
His Muhammad
To Muslims life Muhammad
story revered
In mysteries
certainties
beliefs held sacred
Whatever tell
Prophet course
screened filter
preserved centuries
people
wanted preserve
Its difficult pull out
different sources
adoring
ordinary human being
We know Muhammad born
570 AD
sunblasted Arabian peninsula
A land savage scarcity
Bedouin tribes locked
constant state tribal war
While infant
Muhammads parents gave
taste life desert
Muhammad town Mecca
sent
live Bedouin
people
town Mecca
felt Bedouin holders
deeper cultural Arab values
And Bedouin view towns people
having lost authentic
roots Arab culture
poetry animal husbandry
things well
By time Muhammad six
parents died
taken protection
uncle chief clan
Being outsider
gave singular perspective
Hed orphaned early
developed early
passionate sense concern
left society
To orphaned tribal society
clan family relationships
keys everything
success status honour dignity
face feels like
marginalised
That obviously deep
impression young man
In ways detrimental
course grow parents
But ways
adaptable
He parents
He fathers
He mothers
So child everybody
Muhammads clan like Arabs
Arabian peninsula
share stories
told retold generations
Pre Islamic Arabian civilisation
largely oral culture
tremendous respect
admiration
people
express orally
especially recite
poetry drop hat
Some important people
tribe poets
They sang glory tribe
They told story tribe
To Bedouin
word mystical importance
Poets linked tribe ancestors
celebrated values older memory
Poetry sinew
bound Bedouin together
celebrating victories
lamenting defeats
The poems themselves
like poems Homer
celebrate
great heroic ethos
intimate
deepest way
tragedy that um
war ethos constant
tribal warfare brings people
Warfare conflict
grim realities dangerous time
Muhammads uncle taught
skills hed need survive
world prophet
wield bow arrow
In wilderness punished elements
bereft water
rivalry single
provoke blood feud generations
A real rivalry Real battles
bloody
So allegiance individuals
family immidiately
and larger extent tribe
Without tribes protection
endure
Scattered peninsula
countless factions
embroiled bitter struggles
defending precious
grazing lands trade routes
importantly wells
You understand
lands dry
So water
considers precious
For climates
heavily watered
its difficult understand depth
centrality symbol water
societies desert
rains
twice year
little water makes
difference life death
Each clan separate
gods totems
To water wind
night
They kept
caravan town Mecca
shrine wood
stone cloth
It called Kaaba
Arabic word cube
Pre Islamic Arabs
worshipped number spirits
They generally natureoriented spirits
associated natural features
Like trees rocks springs
And Kaaba Mecca
number sanctuaries
centred
particular cluster deities
It said Hebrew patriarch
Abraham
built Kaaba centuries
sacred black stone held
fallen sky
In turbulent times
Kaaba provided rare place peace
Only Bedouin
submit temporary truce
returning conflicts
open sands
There place
middle Kaaba
was pre Islamic times
place of sacred enclosure
people
arms
This course facilitated trading
meant couldnt
carry feuds
buying selling
The spiritual economic
importance Kaaba Mecca
pretty hard seperate far
preIslamic Arabs concerned
The Kaaba Mecca
vibrant centre trade
Here Arabian incense
exotic perfumes Indian spices
Chinese silks Egyptian linens
But greatest treasure
Mecca
rich mixture cultures
They people came town
kinds interesting
experiences relate faraway places
The local religion mixed
There Christians Jews
There Arabs desert
followed animist type religion
Muhammads world centre trade
connecting Mediterranean Sea
Indian Ocean
linking ageing empires
Byztantium Persia
great bazaars
India China
Muhammad merchant
In fact
great flair trade
At age 25 leading
caravan northward Syria
talents caught eye
shipments owner
wealth widow named Khadijah
She taken Muhammad
proposed marriage
Ah Khadijah Well I think
mentor wife
A strong lady
business
Muhammad helping out
So wonderful partnership
Im sure learned lot her
He tremendous contact
merchants coming
different parts world
passing Arabian peninsula
I think intelligent man
open minded
able communicate
great variety people
He
great charisma well
Muhammad way people
resolving disputes
Once Kaaba
fell disrepair
clan chieftains quarrelled
honour
putting sacred black stone
belonged
Before violence erupt
Muhammad proposed equitable solution
United effort
leaders shared weight
honour
In gratitude invited Muhammad
replace secret stone
He known Al Amin
The Trusted One
There kinds indications
tremendously interested
religious questions
This obviously
ordinary person probably
interested days
He talked to
sages Arab sages
He talked Jewish Christian sages
lived area
He
rock hills Mecca
meditate think things
And point
extraordinary vision
spoken
evocatively allusively
In cave Mecca
Muhammad experience
defining moment life
An angel said appear
form man
instructing recite
God Almighty
For Muhammad encounter
profound deeply disturbing
You sense
like
normal person society
unusual sense
intensity things
like social justice finding
meaning life is
endowed
miraculous friends
And sudden
having voice come
come OUT speak
recite people
And beginning
prophetic career Muhammad
The months come
bring revelations
powerful words lyrical quality
beautiful
exquisite Arabic poetry
Above all Muhammad bear
message people
simple radical proclamation
That God
The central tenet Islam oneness
indivisible unity God
Not simply
pays lip service
absolutely
important concept
Divine unity
saying theres God
deities
Its thinking thing
So thinking possessions
thinking status
thinking power
intellectual idols
The implications staggering
One God meant people
No tribal divisions
To poor unprotected
prospect revolutionary
Seems
important things
early teaching
isnt talked
strong social justice message
delivered
In Mecca time
increasing separation
haves nots
He insisted
share wealth
It social justice
message that think
got hearing
folks
So coming Islam
new order new way life
beautiful way life
everybody equal
black white men women children
So type
universal appeal
I think reason
Islam spread rapidly
Many moved
Muhammads message
began speak
community
It suppleness symbolic depth
great preIslamic poems
created people
given
people Arabia
Extraordinary ear
verbal expression
verbal expression
commanding cultural force
Some people called poet
Theres Quranic sura
basically saying
Muhammad poet
Poets speak desire
This voice desire
voice God
Muhammads following began grow
They called Muslims
surrender God
They set preserve message
Muhammad brought
This beginning Quran
The Quran revealed orally
soon people realised
written
order sure
wasnt corrupted
original message
maintained
From early date its
unclear date
early manuscripts
Quran survive
people began copying down
The Quran revelation
spiritual teaching
ethical social guidance
It revealed remains
Arabic
Whats extraordinary
Quran naturalness

powerful cosmic things
sense intimacy
power tenderness come
constanly Quranic language
With words alone Quran delivers
vision faithful
Its imagery conjures
picture afterlife
resonates power
traditional Bedouin poetry
Imagine desert
surrounded dust
glare sun
You wear cloaks cover body
wind
sear skin right face
And walk oasis
The temperature drops dramatically
Theres quiet there
The wind longer howling
Everywhere look
green colour
The world water paradise
symbolically tied another
And Quran conjure
briefly chosen words
Yet imagery paradise
Quran
easy description God
The mystery remain
Its difficult talk God
reifying God
reifying God thing
anthropomorphising God
God projection
human self
Thats Muslims dont like sculpture
example traditionally
believe
theres danger
The Quran avoids
constantly shifting pronouns
cant reify God
image physical image God
Rather physical image God
Muhammad
beauty Quran
celebrated Islam
Islam developed context
pictures favoured
The Quran revealed
Gods representation earth
And Muslims felt
early time
representation
Gods word Quran itself
picture of God certainly not
couldnt represent God
certainly picture Muhammad
wasnt divine
At certain times places people
images Prophet Muhammad
But religious images
images
meant worshipped
images
saint God
Theyre images Muhammad
historical figure
Hes sort given honour having
bright blue background
white cloud near
hes distinguished
characters story
At times
people represent Prophet
white cloth
face hide face
So different
approaches this
But these
devotional images
Youre supposed look
pray them
Youre learn
history religion
emphasis history
them
As Muhammads community grew
opposition
People course sceptical
said Look youre prophet
wheres miracle
And prophets
Quran
Moses miracles
Jesus miracles
Wheres miracle
And Quranic answer
challenge is
This miracle
Quran
But wasnt miracle
people defined
gods ancestors
totems tribe
Their doubts increased
The idea life death
appalled them
So Quran presents people
sceptical
You mean tell I die
and body gone
elements Ive putrefied
that Im going

and brought life
That messages
Quran
struck people Arabia
hard believe
Muhammad spoke
eternal damnation unjust
He language
apocalyptic imagery
talking
signs end time
mountains crumble
skies rolled like scrolls
know responsibility
bear actions
There references
unjust going fire
To non believers
divine reckoning Muhammad invoked
outrage
His dismantling heritage
customs deeply unsettling
It threat ways
social order
age old traditions
economic threat
importance
pilgrimage shrine
Kaaba Mecca
As Muhammads following increased
social fabric caravan city
began unravel
Business suffered pilgrims traders
worried safety left town
The tribal leaders decided
Muhammad message
removed permanently
They didnt want taking
horning control city
They things difficult him
plotted assassination
They tried Kaaba
run town
They demanded Muhammads uncle remove
clans protection Prophet
clear way murder
threat retribution
But uncle refused
The battle lines drawn
Nothing short tribal war
settle conflict now
Muhammad clearly asked
extraordinary things
tell Bedouin
notions multiple gods
attachment
ancestors
tribal warfare
way had
Things that
object scorn persecution
and um attack
Muhammads followers forced
marketplace starved
Those clan protection
tortured killed
In 619 AD
Muhammads wife Khadijah died
uncle well
Gone great love
protector
Here opportunity
enemies waiting for
But lush oasis town
Yathrib north Mecca
refuge opened
Muhammad people
Clan rivalries
deadly town
desperately needed
peacemaker
They heard Muhammad
trustworthy man
Theyd heard great arbitration
skills thought
Lets help out
So invited him
Muhammad agreed travel Yathrib
settle disputes
exchange safe refuge
people
For Muhammads followers
leaving place ancestors
families tribes
ultimate test devotion
In so began
new community new tribe
For time
bound blood
faith
In course
single caravan journey
Islam marks true beginnings
Their journey known Hijrah
622 Christian calendar
marks Muslim Year 1
Muhammads goal
people Yathrib
larger mission
bring unity peace
message
He asked
Solomonic figure
mediate tensions tribes
intractable
As work succeeded
town known
City Prophet
Medina
Muhammads great task Medina
try bring
groups
try forge
community believers
way bring people
sort harmony
To divided clans Medina
Muhammad offered vision solidarity
But spread
word Islam
didnt challenge
beliefs faiths
Islam sees relatlonship
earlier revealed religions
Judaism Christianity
treats people Book
It believes God revealed himself
word mankind times
Moses Jesus
example and
time
people went astray
Throughout Quran
sense humanity Muhammad
humbleness person
extraordinary challenge
mission given
divine revelation
As Muslim community grew
Medina
life simple devotion
ritual developed
A freed Abyssinian slave
named Bilal
believers
prayer Muhammads house
Allahu akbar
It mosque
The prayer
Islamic Pillar
affirmation
Gods unity
La ilaha illa Allah
beautiful phrase
Muslims chant
mind
vocally
constantly remind
unity God
And unity
focus life
Allahu akbar
La ilah illa Allah
Praying good thing
It cements idea belonging
movement religion
organisation community
The result
very powerful watch
non believer
religion
We carry physical
gestures prayer worship
unify body
mind soul
moment bowing
touching head ground
exact centre
What
powerful symbol unity
Its said that Medina
Muhammad received revelation
instructing prayer face
direction Kaaba Mecca
Though filled pagan idols
shrine Abraham
believer
true God
But Muslims
praying Mecca
enemies
rallying force
Their goal
wipe Muslims
Muhammad s people
began gather arms
Though Muslims prepared
best could
outnumbered
outmatched
They mustered force 313
old men boys
weapons
approaching Meccans
heavily armed thousand strong
For years Muhammad tried bring
Islam people Mecca peacefully
Now time fight
Muslims faced tribes
brother fighting brother
son father
Yet came armed
powerful weapon
passionate belief faith
Muhammads troops fought
confidence
Gods guiding them
They fought
very bloody battles
At point entire young Muslim
community edge annihilation
For years Muslim army
held staggering odds
As word fighting spread
Bedouin tribes saw Gods hand
Muhammads victories
One one peoples desert
began join struggle
The Muslim army grew
tide began turn
The Muslim forces advanced
outskirts Mecca
It furious siege
lasted nearly month
Until finally city
fell Muhammad
In 630 AD terrified people
Mecca braced onslaught
Muhammads army returning home
10000 strong
The vanquished knew terrible fate
awaited them
According modes
tribal warfare
Meccans expect
big revenge
The men usually killed
Women children
sold slavery
Theres little pity
loser tribal war
Of course thats standard
world
But Muhammad surprise store
fallen city
When Muhammad came Mecca
carry
bloody revenge
actually embraced Meccans
fought years
attempted annihilate him
shocking
people milieu
So founding
religion
finds episodes
great generosity
extraordinary acts
kindness mercy
But Mecca
escaped Muhammads wrath
Flush victory troops
marched straight Kaaba
Seven times
circled shrine
come seek
protection appealed idols
But pagan people
Muhammad come destroy
It gods
He raised staff
tribal gods ancestors
smashed dust
When Muhammad entered Mecca
entered shrine
destroyed
idols shrine
great cultural
symbolic importance Islam
By breaking idols
breaking apart
tribal
tribe
independent deity
This schocking Bedouin
This saying gods
fathers destroyed
In sense saying
fathers deluded
How tradition
relationships
ones father tribe primary
So act iconoclasm then
seen act
prophetic violence
importance
Islamic tradition
Mosess breaking tablets
saw idolatry Mt Sinai
Jesuss casting money sellers
Temple
The Muslims turned north
They continued west Egypt
quickly North Africa
fortifying coastline
Mediterranean
Only seas stopped them
Its growth explosive
622 Year 1

Within 50 years

Within 200 years
extended Spain China
The Muslims absorbed
Sasanian Empire Iran

Christian Byzantine Empire
By empire larger Rome
It stretched Morocco west
Indus River east
border India today
How happened
small army conquer
area large fast easily
Islams success expanding
central Middle East
North Africa
large
people fed
previous regimes
So idea Muslims going
world saying Convert Die
accurate all
They didnt heavy hand
didnt rule heavy hand
They allowed conquered people
maintain administrative structures
They allowed Christians Jews
maintain religious law
governed them
And so cases
conquered peoples feel
presence new regime
heavily
Certainly individuals felt
exploited downtrodden
oppressive
parasitic priesthood
idea Islam religion
essentially free clergy
attractive
Its times create
movement men
The Roman Empire collapsed
The Byzantine Empire
wasnt strong enough
There need new vision
new way looking life
think happened
time
Muhammads mission filled void

They wanted sort
solidarity lives
The lessons Quran

As conquest swept Syria
Muslims held friday prayers

In 11th year

For days city consumed

Muhammads death set crisis

The Arabic word conquest futuh

Islam sowed seeds faith

The Hajj set humanity motion
For time

Since Muslim enjoined

So net effect
youve got

The challenge greeted
scholars daunting
The great works ancients

Competition jobs developed

And on single

Scholars dispatched

This
important contribution
The scientific process born
They wanted know

Now begin

Countless disciplines

More surprising perhaps
innovations medicine
At time Europeans praying

Muslim physicians developed

Muslim European physicians

You
50 years its Syria
Then years later

Then its North Africa
Then its Sicily
its Spain
And thats Europe
learned paper
They learned
Arabs
We begin people

So words

It
very widespread industry
And acquisition books

With wide use
books paper

And time when

For 200 years Christian holy

protected Muslim rulers
In 1009 Egyptian ruler alHakim
broke tradition
He ordered holiest church
Christendom destroyed
And horror horrors

Holy Sepulchre Jerusalem
Nobody knows it
