 Hello Mr Felsch
 Hello
Mr Felsch I read book It
inspired film Im making
I wondering today Have
entered long winter theory
Because combination
theory reading political
revolt longer exists way
Firstly entirely
different reading culture
You
universities
 You work university
 I do thats right
I teach cultural studies
Humboldt University
I believe people
1968 generation
were
else gifted readers
As noted repeatedly
generation
didnt produce
highlevel theoreticians
 They
 Thats interesting
As cant read write
time
Thats sort
point I wanted make
Lots figures
1968 political scene
read lot got
books texts circulation
Like founders little leftwing
publishing houses Merve
When look
universities today
its actually
virtually reverse
That is
constantly writing something
People write lot
studies
Cyberculture greatly reduced
inhibitions producing writing
Without having fuss
publicity form
Theres probably lot
resistance typewriter
With typewriter
youve written paper
reads it
There lot ways
publicity today
Peertopeer culture encourages
writing Its empowering
You wonder
thats written getting read
Yes mathematically
cant be
So historian
Can research
future well
 Is future relevant historian
 I think thats pretty important point
The long summer theory
reason
long hot
theories
ventured predict future
The blueprint
Marxism
philosophy history
goes roughly Hegel
Theories dont
things
claim know
history develop going forward
project
objective end history
I dont think
grand optimistic
teleological narratives
tell direction
things heading in
direction history moving
its meaning
Yet time I see
outside universities things
like Anthropocene discussion
They theres obviously
desire again
That 20 years
postmodernism
theres desire
return something
develop theory history

sense story on
I think its clear
resurfaced

The Long Journey
Collective Consciousness

We I
 Cumbersome
 Romantic
You swoon past
Nostalgia oozes forth

He basically holds 30 years history
inside keeps silent
 So silent past
 Thats me
I dont want sit later
nothing
Can convey
viewer
Its entertainment
Nola making political film
 And its freedom
 Freedom sounds bit romantic right
 Replenishments
 Finally
Freedom isnt
romantic its existential
Well notice its gone
Where doors

 Yeah thats right
Yes urgently
fitted gilded doorknobs
 The hypothesis is What do
 Thats hypothesis
Sure scream
out What do
Thats done
Its Baader Meinhof sat
table planning abductions
Nonsense First set
department store Frankfurt
Yeah were talking
reenacting past
Not reenacting
processing it
Or inspiration
But question remains
What do
 Hi
 Hi
 Hi
 Hey
Is going
guys
Nothing going on
Work earning living
livelihood
And were ahead
The lowwage sector
primarily occupied women
More so
A growing number women
working lowwage jobs
like caregiving
cleaning
And neoliberal blather
emancipating
woman provide herself
She provide herself
All provide
capitalism cheap labor
And women end
jobs always
I toil independence
Thats contradiction terms
You know what Nola
Id like
like too
Someone helps coat
on holds door open
escorts table
And reads menu you
An older man fumbles
reading glasses out Oh Katja
You know I mean
But know
long tourists come
pay 25
euros head night
happy
everythings dandy
At invented
washing machine
Yeah
complaining about
 I think audio
 Sounds good
Can explain
term state feminism me
Thats title book
its actually meant bit ironically
About years
ago surprise
established politicians
turn feminist
They gave passionate speeches
importance womens independence
Then came series reforms
The parental allowance
introduced
day care expanded
minijobs introduced
Ultimately clear
main aim reform
welleducated women
lots kids
return work
quickly possible childbirth
Once realized
its primarily women
care
small children old people
turned ultimately
intensification double burden
As far know
aim feminist movement
We dont know
anybody wants that
So burden women
actually increased
thanks prevailing ideas
motherhood
Yes
But cant view
independently
laws
changed well
The Hartz IV reforms unemployment
social welfare implemented
minijobs
parttime jobs
And things led
lot women
employment
The labor force
participation rate women
increased 2003 today
70 percent
And 55 percent
Thats
makes wonder
How happen
Why state discovered
feminism sudden

women children working
So its creating
productive society
incentives
society productive
 Thats I it
 And preserve capitalist system
 Actually
 Yes preserve it
 Or to
 To optimize it
Yes optimize it
So that Yes
that What mean society
Welleducated women
supposed be
After having spent 20
years going school studying
theyre supposed
effort raising children
As far states concerned
thats huge waste
capitalist standpoint
well
Basically women
supposed continue
productivity
available market
Nowadays women work Lots
women too
But day age
demands
Women expected
immensely successful careers
time

lofty demands
mothers fathers
You cant raise

A coffee picker Bali

position yourself
To position
But without
Do I think inside

latter
But I fear
outside anymore
The individual greedily
absorbed within
But dream
of mean
outside
That follows
rules laws anymore
And brings
Red Army Faction
No thats baloney
Even I allowed break laws I
dont know laws Id want break
let demolish
I think things
demolish
Yes individualist
But honesty
were totally sedated
stupefied
little gifts rewards
And voluntarily demolishes
little reward
Thats primal instinct
Sure Im far
along Its relevant me
Right I dont
possessions I defend
All right then Ill explain
entry area now
As its prestigious
space gloriously awash light
You room

designer bath sanitary facilities
 Hello Ms Jaeggi
 Hello Nola
How define
term forms life
Ill tell formula
explain it
They akin inert bundles
ensembles social practices
That alludes things
key term forms life
One
social practices
things people
certain behavioral patterns
social
socially shaped defined
When discussing forms life people
argue practices include
Is family family members
longer talk eat dinner together
 Lots fighting
 Interesting
Is city
longer public places
people meet
making date paying
You
contradicts idea city
construe city
form life spots gone
In film dream
away scenarios
So were actually little bit
weary existing form life
existence general
So dream
bourgeois family
jobs didnt
allow time think
jobs lot
structured
But end realize
matter dream away
revert ourselves
What think that
I mean change me
Or form life
me individual
The idea I individual
form life here
like its kind armor
slip into
form life
kind cabin walk
walk
yourself
Yes
notion I
That isnt notion
guides that
I dont assume that
I basically assume you
I assume getting
socially determined behavioral
What I mean
cant escape interpretations

life are
That is cant
step them
When step youre
referring them
 A good way explain be
 There neutral space
 Exactly
 Im form life
I cant step vacuum
form life
step new one
But consciously
plan collective forms life
Artists living precariously
conscious attempt form life
One
form life
takes fluid
transitional
It institutionalizes
transitional phase
We talking lack
bonds actually like
I wanted jump way New Right
interprets means bonds
It sees reviving ties family
homeland way save humanity
So basically lack
bonds plague humanity
How that
Something like crude
notion homeland family
idea youre born
steadfast undying
meant
guidance allegedly missing
I think very
disastrous interpretation
disastrous diagnosis
cover lot things
Its New Right
identitarians
I think its important realize
lack relationships
indifference world
oneself
real problem
But correlated
preexisting
given developed
identities ideas homeland
My assumption
actually opposite
I believe overemphasis
emphasis given
emphasis homeland
traditional family structures

fact
people feel powerless
circumstances live in
 That cant shape them
 Out fear
Yes its a
 A realization impracticability
 Yes
Thats grew up
Politics politicians
we else
Its established
like division labor
If were political
were opposition
Thats true anymore
We opposition
Now Pegida AfD rightwingers
identitarians opposition
So were
opposition opposition
Or we
Or work handinhand
politicians
With government
A cabinet horrors
But want opposition
thats role
Oh guys opposition aside
Dont want something
Make political films
films general
Ive seen political films
political thrillers
They big names
bigtime topics

Nazis seized power
Somehow create

 Hello Mr Hegemann
 Hello
Nice you
We here
What movie didnt create
illusion Would cinema
When making art general
making political art
choice
peek whats faÃ§ade
And matter bad
concern it
That
kind enlightenment
But fully aware
audience
feels
duped then
audiences
cinema illusion
But film employs
mechanisms illusion
present successful revolution
strong socially critical plot
breaking illusion
political
 According Brecht
 Then its manipulative
Yes
Its probably effect
You watch it moved maybe
shed tear thats that
Brecht said people
lulled illusion
longer construe
world alterable
You construe alterable
free illusion
That doesnt exist else
exists stage
That grown person claim
King Denmark similar
And interesting

real life dress up
That great suit youre wearing
borderline
 Its costume
 Yeah
 If walk that
 I stared walking city
As Hamlet Id probably be
If I said I Hamlet
Id psychiatric ward
Or tie
stick moustache
claim man
Wearing glued moustache
theater problem all
People believe it people accept
kind mixing identities
But mixing life theater
stage dangerous
It simply extremely liberating
think
A colleague
age recently told
didnt know
acquaintances
says think
People cant afford
anymore
But kind society
kind life
whats
suitable given moment

person too
Then live
totally illusory world
theater social roles
truly detached people
 And thats its liberating and
 Then were zombies
We stage
exemplary people here
stay objective cool
try lodge tiny objection
people yell thats
theres yelling
Thats people use
voice express authentic thoughts
And truth seriousness
cant act so
It onstage
its forbidden yell
In script says
ride Bobby Cars now
If so it
I doubt its conducive
selfoptimization
 This chic too
 I think makes look old somehow
 The fur you
 Umhm
Yeah Or maybe
twopiece outfit
This rapidly changing city
that flaw lack
tradition sign modernity
That sounds like
now
But written
Robert Walser 1908
Makeshift
existence suits Berlin
where people eager
new quickly pass yesterday
and stays was
Thats true today too
To Robert Walser Berlin body
dream populated Berlins women
He wants all
naive voluptuous violent lady
and good little girl
KurfÃ¼rstendamm
 Button up right
 Yeah
Berlin giant lady
Contemporaries continually stress
analogy Berlin women
Robert Musil Carl Zuckmayer
These quotes
a striking mix incredulous
adulation erotic attraction
and restrained aggression
use city women
This 1920s
The spry firm bigcity girls
with insatiable
open mouths grow annoyed
when eyes settle long
gliding shoulders
and floating cheeks
A certain Franz Hessel
More Berlin woman
The rubble woman
Youthful beauty contrasts
rubble sorts
In mid1980s Helmut Newton shot
boardinghouse photos Berlin
That sounds good
FrÃ¤ulein Petra
Ten years later JÃ¼rgen Teller
Cloudy puddles rusty iron doors
barred windows dismal trees
garbage construction cranes
Tellers Berlin photos
look like hastily opened gift
whose contents disappointed
cast aside
He photographs flawed female
bodies dont fit ideal
thighs adorned red spots
lips ripped open elbows raw
Heroin chic
Me again
He reacts dematerialization
existence vulnerable bodies
that tell stories
In Berlin seeks phenomena
open narratives
The girl sweater
HÃ¶lderlin pocket
as Harold Nicholsen
described 1929
had junkie 1961
Im girl sweater I
HÃ¶lderlin pocket too
The City Its Bodies
The City Women
No film
And faÃ§ade
lurks immense void
 Hello Ms Allmendinger
 Hello Nola
I interviewed students
film stood
answered questions
relation futures
context
society whole
And I wondering
questioning technique
went
individualistic direction
People naturally start
talking themselves
We know that
resort measures
talking
society accord
extrapolate
social circle
think
society world
So course
sitting bar long time
drinking beer
youll
narrative interview
But dont
representative that
We start
criticizing
We want people
focused themselves
notice feel
And begin
alone
And
trying shut cognition
They shouldnt think
And
surfaces This kind mat
This rough glass
corrugated cardboard
 And say
 And works You immediately
 You feel
 We ask How life feel today
 Just tell life feels today
 Yeah
What media tells them
read books immediately gone
Think life feels
You differently
I smell this
How
life smell Like this
Or life smell like this
And voilÃ  You forget
people telling you
We dont want that
We read paper
Were interested opinion
When point
theyve attained inner peace
forgotten else
started
Then ask How important
feeling togetherness you
How important you
And answer
question pure level
Those preliminary questions
real ones
What desire
coming generation
What wish pass
kids Whatd legacy
Weve moved step
focus me focus society
And
step ask
And think
How society actually be
Those steps
utterly different
going right
level does
Youre absolutely right people
stay little lives
If given carte blanche
change society
What income important
and course education
Theres doubt that
But consider
people visions
people life opportunity
shape things
life worth shaping
Increasingly people
true circles friends
And lots friends
place

case me
friends different countries
diverse array backgrounds
People varying ages
sexual orientations
And facilitated
Thats I think
society less
Weve noticed groups
increasingly staying themselves
And I recommend
mandatory social year
That theres kind
mandatory exchange
people countries
We introduce people
young people
dont stay little
spot Germany entire lives
So want open
open wider world
You cant force people
want it
And comes
onetoone contact experience
People broader focus
Pessimistic people say The
feeling togetherness lovely
but its going drain
Those people havent
experienced feeling otherness
 Yes
 Yet create that
You politically
socially incentives
supporting that
To create possibility having
diverse social contacts
Not opposite
urban planning
is keeping people
own schools
Or hand having
schools diverse
theres longer
common thread
Thank much
Were waiting
little screw its done
It looks pretty good already
Nola
 Hows film coming along
 Nearly done
 I need good final scene
 Do resolution
Im deluding myself
My film wont change world
kickstart revolt

 Hello Mr Groys
 Hello
 Nice you
 Im glad youre here
Weve chosen
futuristic location
Do feel

Were prepared
It comes
unexpected
And feeling
constantly adapt
I believe
strategic behavior
increasingly strategy
adapting future
I
selfupdating
In texts
talk film
film contains paradox
vita contemplativa vita activa
That screen heroes
hyperactive
They shoot jump
achieve heroic aims
viewer
automatically passive
sits statically
chair theater seat
How capable
acting face paradox
Or induce
viewer active
By getting viewer
internally identify
movies heroic character
What described
internal movement thought
 Not movement thought
 No
No
Neither hero think
 The hero cant think
 He cant think
The hero act heroically
And act heroically
dont think
And viewer
isnt supposed think either
The thinking viewer
big mistake Brechts
The viewer identify
The viewer
identify movie
The viewer
identify hero
And hero
revolutionary
viewer try adopt
position attitude
But identification
Brecht antiidentification
Yes Id

Ultimately

Mayakovsky said it
The daily grind destroys revolution
misery everyday
 But still
 The boredom
The boredom life
Life fundamentally boring
Fundamentally
And cant kind

Disgust luxury
