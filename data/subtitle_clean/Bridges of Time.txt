As God created man image
I think Bible
verse Genesis says
God created heavens earth
As I understand it
Heaven ideal spiritual
Earth material
And thats all friends
That
documentary cinema
We film Earth remember
Heaven us
We film substance reality
remember
spirituality too
Where little tape recorder
Too bad
And again
Quite complicated
If want angels
struggle
kinds stuff
Never mind soon I will
Documentary filmmaker’s daily life
Not bad all
Men sea again
women waiting again
Our main research object man
feels general
We studied resources
available us
We camera time
To look look closely into
We time
look closely it
A shed here

Anything happen yard
Thus yard sheds
don’t express themselves
I’ll open door

So possible

People created art
contemporaries

I believe its like that
Just like absolute
darkness light
absolute documentary
What hell
There times vanish
This moment stay forever
The time emerged

Even senses
can’t grasp permanence
How values born
A man goes bounds

When age I taken
melamed teacher

beginning God created
heavens earth
earth void on
perception world changed
little then
Afterwards I thought that
film Flashback

feeling grief
I don’t know why
It stayed entire life
But perception world
changed little
And feeling loneliness
world
I’ve childhood
I think films
I since
endowed warmth
sort cosmic feelings
human life
We pass away
like water spilt ground
collected more
Perhaps spilt
maybe dewdrops remain
And quiet sough wind
