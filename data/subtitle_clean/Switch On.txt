Im Scott Tinker
I study energy
I remote Colombia visit family
living modern energy kind
This farm
Arhuaco tribal elder
Im Scott
He lives wife
Their daughters
husbands lots grandkids
Hi
foreign language
Alright
Using farming methods
passed centuries
Arhuacos grow need
foreign language
Beans bananas
And coffee Chuckle
So feeds everybody
What this
For grinding
Alright go
Everything produced manual
labor This press machine
Put it
What make sugar cane
Its good
foreign language
Ill try it
Thats good I wouldnt drink
night its pretty good
Gracias
foreign language
I think hes
before look that
foreign language
Oh wow thats beautiful
Eat it
Thats good Thats good
This like pretty
good life its hard life
Only half Arhuaco children
adulthood
Inside hut
120 degrees filled smoke
energy source fire
Very little windows What
hanging fire
Banana
Bananas smoked bananas
Mais Secar mais
Oh dry corn That makes sense
Muchas gracias Muchas gracias
The Arhuacos
energy burning wood
think
theyre fairly isolated case
But fact billion people
rural Latin America Africa Asia
live like Arhuacos
electricity
modern energy kind
There billion
people urban
limited energy thats
unaffordable dangerous
Nearly people
million
burn wood straw dung
biomass cooking heating
suffer breathing smoke
These plus billion people worldwide
live UN calls energy poverty
Thats nearly planet
access safe affordable reliable energy
In film Switch
looked continuing energy
transition developed world
Well focus
profound transition
people moving energy poverty
beginning receive
benefits energy brings
Well Ethiopia
Kenya Vietnam
large new
gridconnected electricity projects
power urban citizens
Well Colombia Kenya again
meet rural people getting
electricity offgrid solar solutions
And well Nepal meet people
transitioning burning wood
healthier modern cooking fuels
Their stories microcosm whats
happening developing world
people communities Switch On
On mountain
Arhuaco farm village Sabana Crespo
Its trading center
families come hills
week exchange goods friends
A couple years ago rural
community got electricity ever
Because here nonprofit
Solar Electric Light Fund
SELF installed solar microgrid
I met CEO Bob Freling
Scott Tinker How
involved village
Bob Freling Well happened
leader Arhuaco people
came Washington DC requested
support come bring solar power
villages
Sierra Nevada
mountains northern Colombia
That remarkably rapid transformation
indigenous people though right
BF Its true And were mindful
fact everybody world
wants this We
impose solutions
community invited us
For example asked
bring power homes havent
ST So array microgrid powering
community center type things
BF Correct
communitybased needs
This helps power
coffee operations
Its crop
trade outsiders
It powers lights
community store
streets night
health center
SELFs engineer Steve McCarney
showed smaller array
powers refrigerator
freezer vaccines
Steve McCarney This great
project funded
Bill Melinda Gates Foundation
basically prove solar ice making
immunization
actual solar direct drive
batteryfree icemakers right us
Okay fellas vaccine room
And freezer are The
serial number probably 001 002
This frozen solid solar energy
Those outreach
They pack em ice
packs vaccines out
walk threeday trips
immunize outreach
locations far mountains
So extend village
ST Right
BF The catchment area
village approximately 17000 people
ST 17000
BF 17000 people
ST So 125kilowatt microarray
smaller ones around
actually servicing
community 17000
BF Youve seen little bit
energy do right ST Yeah
BF We think watts thousand
watts United States its nothing right
ST Yeah
BF But thousand watts energy
difference world
ST Yeah
Bob Steve spent
careers bringing offgrid electricity
rural communities like one
To understand takes power
people I wanted help it
music
Halfway world
theres different challenge
Nepal sits northern
border India Himalayas
poorest
countries world
Outside capital people
farmers living traditional lifestyle
music
I went environmental
health scientist Dr Amod Pokhrel
whos studying cooking methods
In countryside
hand foot
Along main road small
furniture factory sells scrap wood
Sanu Kanchi mother
nearby village buy some
So dont
wood forest
So government opens community forest
people collect wood
time year
Yeah big
problem deforestation
And that
purchase market
expensive like well see
Scott Yeah market
Amod Pokhrel Yeah market
ST Im curious
weighs
213 kilos 45 50 pounds
How long cooking
foreign language
AP She said goes weeks
ST About weeks So need
25 year
spent 200 5000
So thats lot money How
money year spend
What money make
foreign language
AP So doesnt know exact
But according spends
lot money purchasing
ST Probably maybe half income
more AP Yeah half income
ST Just fuel
AP Just fuel
ST For fire
AP For fire cook
ST Thats tremendous amount
music
Sanu Kanchi
billion people world
cooks wood
dung straw biomass
foreign language
So got corn dried corn
foreign language
Over here mais
ST So people cooking wood
solid fuels hundreds years
AP Yeah thousands years And its good
allowed people boil water
warm food
helpful terms health
But smoke main issue here
And theres vent ventilation
window opening smoke out
Amod team monitor air quality
3000 households area
The outside air pollution levels
50 parts million particulates
ST So times
day were going 900
AP Yeah yeah
ST 15 20 times standard Every day
Well hear kids hear
lungs hear cough
ST And youve cooking
home life like this
foreign language
AP Yeah She biomass stoves
modern fuel
ST I mean smoke completely
darkened rafters loft us
AP Yeah
ST Thats remarkable
kids things exposure
AP Yes
ST Through lives
AP Yeah yeah
Amod I went nearby
Siddhi Memorial Hospital
breathing smoke
affecting local population
Shes beautiful
foreign language
Okay Ill explain
foreign language
How like
day Who respiratory
How little kids
The electricity working
AP This common problem Nepal
In study here
conducted hospital
strong association
pneumonia use biomass fuel
Thank you I hope gets better
foreign language
Sadly children die
frequently pneumonia
World Health Organization studies
diseases indoor smoke inhalation
kill 3 million people year globally
More AIDS malaria combined
Clearly important
challenges facing world today
onethird people
burn wood else
Back Colombia went
SELF Gunchukwa
Arhuaco village
requested electricity
But first
cleansing ritual
music
Osiris McCarney SELFs operation
manager showed its done
My son Derek helped organized trip
We bathe Arhuacos sacred waters
meet village
address spiritual
leaders called Mamos
Thank welcoming village
And appreciate nice
ceremony went morning
Its meaningful want
extend respect you
foreign language
We partnership
SELF Switch
So understand needs
need electricity
way help you
like learn that
But extent want it
And work
bring electricity village
work teach maintain
Now mission
The Arhuacos Gunchukwa asked lights
fans community buildings
street light square
refrigerator store
To power that like Sabana Crespo
need offgrid solar
build it
music
But that I
Africa look ongrid solutions
This expect
Ethiopia look like
But its headed
Ethiopias capital Addis Ababa
rapidly modernizing rapidly growing
desperately needs electricity
To it theyre building huge new
hydropower project called GERD
The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam
There challenges building dam
I talked Rudo Sanyanga watchdog
group important
But major dam like produces
tremendous steady electricity
But youre saying
disproportionally benefits
cities benefit
compared displaced
Interesting
I met Dr Seleshi Bekele Ethiopias
Minister Water Electricity
theyll power city
leaving rural citizens behind
Yes Again electricity
country hands poor
Theres villages
nothing electricity all
Are building power lines now
Or big networks built
To learn more I visit GERD
ST Its nice meet you whats
name Lazarus Nice meet you Lazarus
ST Lazarus Im Scott
From air Addis Ababa
looks like big US city
In fact bigger population
New York
But unique Ethiopia
In countries
Africa cities growing
Across Latin America especially
developing Asia its happening too
150 million people
moved cities year
Almost half people developing
world live urban centers
By 2050 closer 70
The future
developing world urban
Meeting huge energy demands
densely populated
urban centers great challenge
balancing
needs rural citizens
Id theyre
Ethiopias Renaissance Dam
It sits Blue Nile
desert border Sudan
I met general manager
entire project Kifle Horo
ST This called Grand Ethiopian
Renaissance Kifle Horo Renaissance yeah
ST Why Renaissance What mean
KH Ethiopia great centuries ago
Thats called Renaissance
coming greatness
ST Okay
KH The finance project comes
government Ethiopia public
The public stake
it buying bond
ST Theyre putting money
KH Money yes
KH Every year
month salary
bond basis
repaid years
Think commitment
Many Ethiopians putting month
salary year bonds dam
KH The total intended
capacity 63 gigawatts
ST Yes So thats
seven nuclear reactors
KH Exactly
ST This big massive
KH From dam water comes spiral
case guides water turbine
ST The turbine thats unbelievable
KH So huge
ST The scale that
KH You imagine size
ST Wow scale crazy
Its hard appreciate
size project
When complete provide electricity
tens millions Ethiopians
ST What dam
ST How contribute
lifting Ethiopia economically
ST So youll able provide
electricity citizens Ethiopia
ST Yeah Africa
KH Yeah Africa
It dam
way achieving power goals
people displaced
In valley flooded
create dams reservoir
I met journalist Abraham Fisseha
Were sitting
upstream GERD
In years
140 meters water
And people lived
area theyre gonna displaced
fills How live
It primitive way living
Sometimes dependent fishing
But farm activities
So given opportunity
its enough
better be
They school
access clean water
So relocating them
schools open clinic open
So least minimum
access
Are family
So life different now
foreign language
So electricity
come pole
comes new dam
foreign language
Your little boy
able school now
So eventually He
learn write read
foreign language
Not rural people Ethiopia
power dam
react positively it
But here developing regions
big grid electricity projects
drive commerce power cities
help expand grid power villages
music
For developing countries
hydropower choices
large grid electricity projects
I went Vietnam look one
Hang Nguyen energy planner
told Vietnam power
urban centers growing economy
ST Theres lot construction
going here fact theres
big jackhammer
knocking things down
So its hydro its
going coal
Why that hydro
So weve built dams built
part big ones
So
feed economy
To power continued growth
Vietnam plans double entire
generation capacity 10 years
I went
coal
And Id start going coal mine
foreign language
train rumble
Riding tiny train deeper
deeper earth
claustrophobic
ST How far go
Andy Nguyen We
travel kilometers
I surprised
miners there
going mine
24 hours day different shifts
ST Wow
ST Wow thats good gets
Pliable
AN The coal high quality
ST Yes is
AN Its hot
ST Yes is
ST There is
ST Alright Its wet Its slurry
foreign language
In Vietnam working coal
steady highpaying job
How long operating
foreign language
ST Did father work business
Miner Yes
ST Yes did
ST And youre
foreign language
AN My father grandfather also
ST Really
So hes generation
foreign language
AN My grandfather father me
ST Yeah are
Coal leaves Vietnams mines trains
passes network coal towns
train horn
Each town
coal workers
families businesses
support them
Most coal
headed coast
eventually
loaded shipped barges
I went journalist Andy Nguyen
AN This port ships
come transport coal
ST Right You coal
ST So seeing
8 10 ships right here
ST They coast
rivers train
coal plants
electricity
It appears Vietnam mining capacity
trained labor force transportation
support coal growth plans
And 20 years Vietnam plans
build 50 new coal plants like one
ST So now
AN Master control room power plant
ST And guys theyre
basically measuring what Generators
AN Ash
ST Oh its ash
Hes looking ash
ST And guy
different
Water system
ST Oh water system AN
Water system ST The cooling system
ST So everybody different job
ST Coal advantages
challenges air quality
particulates ash
So fix that
AN So do limestone powder
burn coal reduce emissions
ST To sulfur
AN And ash
second challenge ash
AN This conveyor
transport ash
power plant
area store ash
ST Is ash us
foreign language
foreign language
AN Around million cubic meter ash
A lot ash ends yard
lot goes stack
I went talk
people live downwind
coal plant
problem
ST Does everybody here everybody
know electricity
Yes course When I born I
electricity family electricity
So work business
coal business life
business puts pollution
Do conflict
No works railway company
But guys coal
community based coal
makes environment
So change that
foreign language
There ideas here Whats going on
Yeah
It come coal mine
It comes thermal power plant
From plant
Yeah You white dust air
In US coal plants
scrubbers scrub goes up
It makes expensive
makes expensive
foreign language
What
challenges community
So dont want coal away
Coal powers Vietnams
communities businesses
In exchange benefits
willing accept air pollution
Vietnam use coal build economy
thats strong
eventually afford else
like countries will
developing world
Making electricity
half challenge
The getting
people need it
Nairobi capital Kenya
Africas fastrising cities
Here million people live slums
struggling
safe reliable electricity
I went visit Kibera largest slum
Kenya Powers Director
Infrastructure David Mwaniki
Mafuta taa makaa What
say Swahili
ST So charcoal here
kerosene there David Mwaniki Yes
So sort
was is
Kind its going some
And thats future
Thats future
ST So school
DM Yeah Its nice place be
ST Did grow electricity
young Did electricity
Thats perfect
But thats opportunity
kids have
Thats phenomenal
There illegal connections
Yes
Run by
Like cartels
I met Jaelle Mwalo
Kenya Power
worked cartels
install electricity
ST So cartels here Jael
Mwadiloh Yeah ST And step was
To engage cartels
William Opiyo local leaders
Kenya Power identified
help install power lines
ST Were walking brand
new power line here
So Kenya Power poles
brought legal electricity
cartel said No
Well tap drops
William Opiyo Yeah
ST Illegally
Can not
Can point illegal wire
ST Can I tell is
WO Yeah I see ST Which one
Which looking at
ST Right here
WO Yes ST Okay
ST And one
WO Yes
Wow So William homes
I doors side
side
Hello Im Scott
Whats name
Dominic Its nice meet you
Thanks letting come
home today visit
Dominic Yeah My pleasure
ST I use
lot electricity
Whats this Whats
here
ST What it
ST Oh Kenya Powers
ST And its empty
WO Yeah Yeah
ST And illegal
WO Yeah The illegal
ST Is better having
Kenya Power cartel power
ST Its safe
Dominic Yeah
ST Have electrical
accident Like youve got shocked
ST Yes
Dominic That is oh yes

You laughing its scary
ST Oh I see Yes That looks pretty scary
ST I mean tell happens illegal
power like that What concerns
ST Live wires I mean what I mean
thats got killed people
WO Yeah Yeah
ST Children
WO Yeah Yeah
So rains
Everything metal
ST Boom WO Yes ST Wow
So its real safety security issue
And reason thats there Like
doesnt somebody down
Who it
ST You
WO Yes
Around world
billion people living slums
grid expansion projects like
cities developing Africa
Asia Latin America
All bring lighting literacy
communication safety
health care refrigeration
small business industry
And struggle corruption
Its biggest stumbling
block energy development
Hydroelectric dams
particularly African countries
good resources
increase size number
Theyll face challenges financing
environment displacement local people
Coal electricity grow
dramatically Asian countries
While its declined Europe
North America 40 years
Asia coal use power generation
increased 1000
Regional particulate air pollution
CO2 emissions grown it
Its clear developing
countries continue grow
urbanize need energy
Reducing environmental impact
corruption remain great challenges
For billion people
living grid
theyll need offgrid solutions like
solar building Colombia
foreign language
Here people equipment converge
tiny village Pueblo Bayo
pavement ends
road heads jungle
It taken year work
great deal resources
organize trip
Uno Dos Tres Eso
We asked friends REC
SOLAR donate solar panels
The panels manufactured Singapore
shipped Los Angeles
trucked Miami
Lets little
I leg out
laughter
The sun doesnt shine night
Arhuacos need power
That means battery
panels charge
The batteries
China shipped LA
trucked Ohio testing
joined panels Miami
trip Barranquilla Colombia
From there passed
different trucks
finally here
Most important brought dozen
volunteers US Colombia
smart able educated people
Steve teach
install solar microgrid
Well I guess got
challenge
Therell more
music
As drove
hours jungle
I couldnt help wonder
transportation fuel involved
getting solar
install Gunchukwa
background conversation
ST Towards me
You ready Watch step stones
Osi McCarney Basically
message is Welcome welcome back
Thank coming back Thank
bringing gift
Steve McCarney Yes
trend continued perfect
ST Ive traveling year
spoken probably 10 15 countries
I pictures
Gunchukwa So Gunchukwa
OM Is traveling
ST Is going known
well And I hope thats okay
OM He says feels
traveling
ST Yes Yes are
laughter
ST And finally I thank team
volunteers Colombia
United States
students young professionals
volunteered come
week meet
work
bring cultures together
I struck similar
global convergence people technology
electrify hundreds thousands
rural villages world like Gunchukwa
But wed focused one
music
ST Some places
rural arent villages
In Maasai territories Kenya
solar microgrid expensive
Smaller offgrid solutions required
Here I met Isaiah member
Maasai tribe traveling salesman
Thats perfect
good reception here
Isaiah raised community
Isaiah Yes
ST You went school here
Isaiah Yes
Did
electricity school home
So changing lives
ST That fantastic
Utility companies face
challenges developing countries
stringing power lines
scattered homes low priority
makes opportunity
businesses selling solar home systems
Isaiah This TV
ST The TV
ST Then I battery
Isaiah Yeah battery there
ST Right
Okay Just pull little bit way
ST Is good
Isaiah Yeah good
Isaiah The TV
big The TV comes here
ST Ah power line
Its quick Its easy
Hello Hello
Hello So I activate now
Kenya called Silicon Valley
distributed renewable energy solutions
In Nairobi I met Pauline Githugu
MKOPAs Director Marketing
ST This big
Pauline Githugu Yeah theres lot going
here ST How people here
We 200 staff
center ST 200
Yeah And basic activity
support customers
decision buy
product switch on
ST Yeah
PG Yeah
ST Young people
PG Yes
A lot buzz
Yes Id average
age probably 28
ST Really PG Maybe
younger center
PG The payment
mobile money
ST So comes mobile network
Yes comes
mobile network
device SIM card So
operates like mobile phone
ST So it
If dont ability
use phone pay
You dont this
No cant this
ST This heart business
PG Yeah
Is Kenya
MKOPA share export
world key things
Absolutely I think
weve proved work
predicated
existence good mobile network
In Kenya countries
tech startups like allowing rural
families buy offgrid electricity
help
important
On outskirts Nairobi
I met farmer John Kidenda
ST Would grow natural
rainfall use water
Its January now
John Kidenda Were January
laughter
ST So irrigate
I irrigate
How water
plants
ST Two panels
JK Two panels
What like cost
Okay costs covered
month
Comfortably Comfortably
Thats fanastic
Thats deep
ST Fifty feet
JK Yeah feet
So its deep
So got lot water here
Wow
Samir Ibrahim
Kenyanborn American educated
Silicon Valleystyle entrepreneur
started SunCulture built Johns system
Lets look pump
Samir Ibrahim This Rain Maker Two
And plugs right here
Its strongest energy management
offgrid customers Africa
Really
Yeah
So theres SIM card there
Theres SIM card
there WiFi Bluetooth
You talk things
field actually building
Weve built Internet
Things platform bring
precision agriculture services
farmers time here
Right
In Africa 60
worlds unused farmable land
Okay Of worlds
unused farmable land
Of worlds unused farmable land
Were continent
talk water scarcity
Its physical water scarcity
its economic water scarcity
So people cant afford
pull water up
My dream prove way
dozens companies this
Yeah
With hundreds thousands
millions acres irrigation
modular energy management systems
people plug appliances
people
choice do
I mean fortunate
We choose do
When use power
shower watch TV
Right
We wanna people choice
We wanna people freedom
Can imagine affordable
access water
change entire continent Africa
JK Are ready
ST Im ready Lets sprinkle
JK There
JK Wow
ST Whoa
There it
ST Thats spraying
Now youre thinking big
Yes
In developing regions
small electricity businesses
driven local entrepreneurs
new tech solve old problems
In cases
potential scale faster
reach rural customers
faster power lines
music
Back Gunchukwa team volunteers
started weeklong process
building solar microgrid
ST First panel
SM Alright
Its ready us
Its pretty close
That good
I think thats it
Perfect sun
SM Mmm yeah
ST No trees pretty clearing
As long dont
goats tango things
ST First panel
ST It good
SM You spots This
looks like its gonna need loosened
Weve got subarray
Sterling Richard We got 355
Doug Ratcliff Okay Im gonna
pull through Alright
ST Alright
SM Alright We got kilowatts
ST Congratulations
laughter
ST Its awesome
The Arhuacos wanted help
Theyre farmers able knock
trenches conduits matter hours
ST I think left year month
ago moral conflict us
The conflict of Will
improve community not
The challenge I believe theyre
wise know face
beautiful Sierra Nevada
places like encroached upon
And I think know
that
And hope
reach
communicate
bring share
busy crazy
world come
like one
And small voice
balance
I think
little bit difference
SM Were moving
phase work
weve got
trades were ground now
So were gonna set
electrical system
I wanted brief talk
Essentially were were
protecting wiring kids animals
thats
light switch high
Thats kids dont run
everybody busy
turn on
cant reach well
ST If little
glue thenclick
Paula More More Yes
ST Yes Eric yes Paula
DT It pops actually
Sarah Jane Todd Oh
SM So rooms going light
DT Tada
Everyone Yay
SM We spoke lot sustainability
Achilles heel
minigrid systems battery
So times light gets used
time
ceiling fans running
bigger battery be
To wire battery called
professionals Bogota
Every battery offgrid village
technologically complex dangerous
handled correctly
It Achilles
heel minigrid
its makes possible
SM Good work fellas
As battery thats pretty get
Alright
SM Its place
laughing
In 10 years time battery
need replaced
The Arhuacos wanted refrigerator
sell cold
drinks popsicles
raise 10000 15000 buy
new battery time comes
SM A lot electricity
bringing power load
lights
switches
interrupt power
If bad connection
its like switch
It breaks continuity
happens
dont know
connection
Is connection
Is light
electronics feed light
Did somebody wrong there
So error means checking
places
sets group back
especially its Friday night goats
cooking youre trying figure
circuit isnt lighting
is
Wed need everyones help
step install
The Arhuacos turned
tree light post
tropical hardwood
nearly heavy steel
DT I wanted brace
Solar microgrids like
solar home systems
power coal plant dam
run cities businesses
But theyll bring electricity
millions offgrid citizens
allowing steps
modern world
All left
panels charge battery
switch lights
time Gunchukwa
Perhaps biggest energy
challenge developing world
affecting urban rural citizens
wood biomass
fuels produce smoke
In Nepal I ready
theyre making transition
Id start suburb
capital city Kathmandu
plant bottles
Liquefied Petroleum Gas LPG
fuel gas barbecue grills
ST We surrounded canisters
So operation growing then
ST How homes LPG now
think Just rough percentage
Amod Pokhrel In Kathmandu Valley 94
Oh its high
Yeah 94 homes LPG
And 6 households use biomass
ST Thats much though
AP Yeah yeah
ST We talked about its better fuel
What challenges
AP There challenges
For example 100 comes India
Nepal dependent India
hiccups
like blockade 2015
immediately earthquake
supply cut
fivesix months
Because Nepal different
difficult geography
Then prices increasing also
thats challenge
Because depends
international market price also
So challenges
associated this
ST Nothings perfect
AP Nothings perfect
ST Ready us
ST So its interesting
different people live things
These look like pretty
modern buildings here
Heres facility
In lieu pipelines
Nepals LPG distribution network
Gas comes refineries India
smaller modes transportation
reach people use it
AP Well cylinder bicycle
ST On bicycle
AP On bicycle yeah
ST Oh good
AP Yeah bike
carry canisters
ST Okay roads look pretty good
biking How I try it
AP Sure yeah ST Can
I bike AP Yeah sure
AP Well help canister
ST Lets family
AP Just straight
ST Okay
AP And turn left
Ill there
ST This straight
were gonna good run
Wow heels go
Alright were here
ST This house
AP Yeah house
ST This house
AP Yeah everybody needs energy
foreign language
AP Theres blue flame
ST And emissions smoke no
AP No smoke ST Very
clean AP Yes clean
ST Ask enjoys cooking it
foreign language
AP Yeah its easy
ST Its easy
In urban Nepal households
chosen easier cleaner fuel
available
theres transport it
But rural Nepal
roads unpaved
LPG canisters harder come by
Here families need
alternative wood
AP The mountains
ST Yeah thats beautiful And valley
ST A bunch dried corn roof
So kitchen
And youre cooking youre
boiling here I see
foreign language
ST Making tea
AP Tea
What cooking with
foreign language
S Gas
ST Gas
Gobar gas
So Gobar gas
dungbased gas like biogas
Animal dungbased biogas
AP Its cow dung
ST Cow dung Okay
And like it
foreign language
AP Yes dont
buy cylinder its free ST Right
AP So cow
They drink milk use dung
ST So drink milk
use dung cook again
Its perfect circle
ST So were going
biomass look biogas
AP So well use dung
ST Well use dung
AP This cow dung
ST Whats gonna do
AP Shell dung bucket
ST She will
AP Yeah
ST I guess I probably ought help huh
AP Yeah
ST Oh nice Thats nice
ST Biogas
AP Biogas
ST Thats fresh one
AP Yes
laughing
AP So shell water
Do wanna wash hands
ST Oh yeah yeah
Ill wash hands sure
AP Itll serve purposes
ST There go Efficiency
AP Efficiency yeah
ST In step
ST There go
foreign language
ST Oh shes got mix first
AP Yeah mix it It
thoroughly mixed
ST Oh Im glad I washed hands
AP It thoroughly
mixed stir it
ST Now I here
ST Now I pour it
ST Alright Oh yeah thats
nice Thats deep
AP So toilet connected
ST This the
AP Human waste goes there
ST Nobodys there luckily
I opened door
So Amod got concrete
canister bunch stuff it
And theres gas kitchen
Whats process
AP So inlet mix
dung water stir it
And methane
bacteria works manure
And generates biogas
And people biogas
pipe That yellow pipe youll see
And goes house
So 6 cubic meter biogas system
But people building
like 20 cubic meter
ST Well lets
bigger ones AP Yeah lets go
ST So
dung water
AP So there
ST Oh wow
AP So there ST Thats
big room there AP Its big room yeah
ST Theres concrete dome
big chamber AP Yeah
And biogas make
foreign language
So provides gas
hours cook food family members
Wow
ST So wonderful system Where
world
It lot places For
example works Nepal
Theres lots opportunity
upscale South Asia Africa
ST South America AP South
America ST Sure Thats good
AP If its possible Nepal
its possible everywhere
ST Right right
Both gas solutions LPG Biogas
produce tiny fraction
particulates burning wood
And particulate
pollution declined
respiratory disease
plummeted it
LPG use growing rapidly especially
urban areas Asia Africa
refineries produce
gas road systems transport it
There half million
biogas systems Nepal alone
These suited
rural areas world
theres livestock
manure fuels them
temperate climates
freezing drying out
These modern cooking fuels
combined access affordable
ongrid offgrid electricity
help literally billions
people live better healthier lives
For stop Nepal Amod wanted
newest alternative wood
As grid electricity hydropower
available reliable
market electric
cooktops springing up
AP So Scott
store I referring to
entrepreneurs
selling induction stoves
ST Its beautiful
foreign language
AP So want cook rice
ST Right
AP Then press rice button
ST Yeah
AP So want boil
water press water button
foreign language
