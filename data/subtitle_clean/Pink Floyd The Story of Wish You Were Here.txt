Yeah I remember disappointment Top Of The Pops
having hit single whatever
Its worldshaking
changing expect be
So maybe know enormous success
Dark Side sense of
Well hasnt feel enormously different satisfied
Roger I think said thinks
kind finished point

I think watershed then
easily split then
And didnt frightened
great there umbrella
extraordinarily powerful valuable trade  Pink Floyd
It song played like Whoa
like singing Syd Barrett
The band known musicality
werent music justice
Do recall famous review Nick Kent
How I forget
I kind overreacted obviously
I mean I feel I overreacted
time partly deserved it
It bad gig
It was shambolic
I mean wasit lacked enthusiasm lacked sort purpose
sense purpose I dont know why
From perspective now look I felt then
scared I shadow know
mind relationship audiences
real concerns making contact
audience tour England
1974
And didnt We were disconnected
If werent giving 100 couldnt sort not
You know element frustration
having tell that
I think probably knew couldnt sort deal it
That review things 
wed got initial ire  taken board
realised germ truth it
I asked record Floyd called
Empire Pool Wembley Arena
I saw Floyd went on said
Oh favour sit sound engineer
And I said OK
How long youve here Brian
30 years
And anyhow
I went interval said
Well think And I said Its rubbish
Because Id working smaller groups
smaller mixing desks theirs massive
So anyway cut long story short
thing I knew I night Empire Pool
Oh God back
And I ended rest British tour
Somebody better run this
And then I say came Wish You Were Here
There lot days didnt anything
thinking ideas
The reality struggling making followup
Dark Side rushed studio that
You know sort ridiculous pressure
way trying record nothing
It disengagement
It willing apply sufficiently
A lot moments
interested thinking weekend
It case studio running
late or known playing squash
And dartboard air rifle
The concentrated activity diluted
Im sure a
a pushing driving sort person
like Roger frustrating else
considerably frustrating us I suspect
When Im studio Im something
Id else frankly
So Im work
Well know theres legendary argument
I rest about
my thought time better use
tracks working on
I fight David bit acknowledges completely
know
We completely different idea it
athat fight I won
Dave saw record songs Shine On
felt cobbled me
It didnt feel like real
And point process yeah
I came idea of No thematic
thats way I expressed it
This coherent work
its coherent
better throw songs
weve working boom are thats it
Theres song thats Syd rest isnt
Its universal expression feelings
absence
because I felt werent there
absent
I remembered it

The record companies were allpowerful way
Noone worked record deal days

The star thing doesnt make doesnt happy know
That star thing want withdraw society
 Its awfully considerate To think
 And Im obliged For making clear
 That Im here 
Well argue Syd burned music business
actually probably burned us
 And I knew moon

I think wasnt record company putting pressure on
putting pressure on thats way wanted go

At time felt hadnt got it
Come here dear boy cigar
Youre gonna far
Roy definitely great characters lot
early early life really
We lot shows Roy bill
A good guy around
I Studio 2 Studio 3
I think Roy actually rather
lacking momentum himself
I think were
It didnt affect Pink Floyd
You know thats I vision
I guess time out out
He spent lot time studio us
Very expensive recording time spend
control room chattering and
Anyway I digress
Roger struggling it
Dave tried
There lot arguing going
going work
At point Roy room piped said
I said Ill like price
 Ive deep respect I mean sincerely
I mean Roy heart this
I mean I picture now
 Which ones Pink 
putting heart soul it

 Were happy We hardly count 
I mean lyrics
If Id written lyrics Id feel pleased
 And tell The game boy
 We Riding gravy train 
It played millions times world single
That vocals a You know really
kind number selling single
Everybody thought Roger
I bit peed that
I think Id sung it vulnerable
cynical way it
But thats way Roy sings
He went great job thank much
I dont think Roger liked version terribly much
I think version perfect version
He singing sort parody anyway
which I dont like I liked it
The worst Im doing
know Im gig
theres wagll shout Have A Cigar know
I regret it thats
cos Ive got Roy I havent know

There actually nice picture
Nick Mason took sort sums up I look
wideeyed and

Id baked fairy cakes
I thought good idea bring studio
Theres wonderful sequence Roger proving
enjoy cake
I think Nick took pictures
I cant imagine I courage sort of
know them I did
Roger driving seat pictures
far studios concerned position hard
But actually its probably better
person driving seat
Roger actually know kept tight hold helm
thats  thats did
And know cant gainsay that
records know records good
Dark Side sort thing
All pieces fell place
Nick Mason says
The drumming it
So I think hard deal with
What next What it
What different
Well I couldnt draw
fantasy pictures out
I couldnt paint artsy fartsy out
I wasnt graphic designer also I interested
band pictures I bit dull know group
musicians play guitar drums bass keyboards
musicians They anybody
We felt representing music order day
I know sounds radical revolutionary
So order represent music didnt want limited
great palette art life picture geezers
Wed mostly days left Storm come
things desultory minutes
mixing time one maybe one that that
They recording Abbey Road I remember going there
I remember I very
I nervous presentation
He came  this know lyrics
theme absence like good idea
I remember getting little round applause
I gratified I tell you
Storm actually probably argumentative people
meet
Roger Storm intense conversations
fine wines on
Storm Roger great intellects and know
sparks flying brains two
I got preoccupied four number four
There words title members band
elements life  air fire water earth
So thing postcard
The postcard said Wish You Were Here
Po fantastic location called Lake Mono

We thought element Storm loving
expensive distant location world
little jolly days expense
This guy yoga position

That moment time magical evening
amazing light
Did long time set up shot
A fucking long time
This shot pain arse
I came notice Pink Floyd

Americana time
So I drew I think time
like Black Power Playboy magazine Mickey Mouse
Hi guys

goes mouse sort drug crazed mouse
HE SIGHS
Hey man That far out man
Mickeys clean living guy was
on drugs
I thought absolutely brilliant I thought
this really
Itd great work produced
like this
And I took Roger showed Roger Roger loved it
It awkward like relationships beginning
wanted thing me
I wasnt coming goods I felt
When I Roger today says Oh I dont remember that
I remember enormous relief
lot flailing visually
wed Dark Side Of The Moon
I think Sandman particularly great image
You know fact were bits sand blow away
I think its idea I had really
I wanted impermanence life whatever know
It sounds rather pretentious crap really
The beginning record sounds melancholy
melancholy melancholy music
Sort blues
its sort G Minor blues seven minutes
We obviously mood wanted exactly jam to
play within
And afraid leaving long period
time instrumental vocals came in
You see time case lets works
So then hence wine glass tape came out
The wine glasses recorded album
going called Household Objects
loop
Rick built sound
synthesisers organ
They wanted big sound guitar recorded
different studio
click track
He amplifiers speakers studio one
being classical music studio micd distance
I think comes album
You picture played auditorium
This Rick featured end Shine On
came element
You Hammond organ there grand piano
plus synthesised instruments plays
I cant remember exactly synthesiser was
Richardstrademark
Hes great piano player
highlight I think classical training
And I think hed 20 minutes heard
probably like Rick Wright concerto
And end tribute Syd Barrett
I dont remember Rick thinking
spur moment

brilliant lines very accurate know
You wore welcome random precision
certainly him
 Well wore welcome With random precision
 Rode steel breeze
 Come on raver
 You seer visions
 Come on painter piper
 You prisoner shine 
My memory recording Radio One
BBC

And I think Friday
And noone him
So basically waited waited I think
cancel recording tried him
Im sure managers went trying him
And Syd I think Sunday Monday
told us Well somethings happened Syd
And happened him total difference
And I remember right like this looking eyes
like
HE MAKES CLICKING NOISE
somebody turned lights out know
looked blank
He living sort community people
believing acid release and know
truth stuff
andhe took much
And went stage
stood long stretches
hed play guitar bit hed stop
He damage acid thats you
Too acid literally fry brains
 Nobody knows
 How near far
 Shine on crazy diamond 
We unable help Syd probably I wont deliberately
interests heart consequently
probably tried hold far longer done
Syd left band 1968
Syd record tiny piece
It important piece opening piece
Pink Floyd Story Pink Floyd
started carried
happened We know
He real hindrance band ways
Having said that simply wouldnt got got to
There Dark Side Of The Moon Syd

Carlena Venetta Americans soulful

They managed job getting involved band
politics good just
You know furious
having great row
dinner table car way whatever

And sang beautifully
One fondest fondest memories Pink Floyd

So great thing it actually got record
 Shine on crazy diamond 
Welcome To The Machine
They wanted bits adhoc animation bunged
willy nilly And course
I little team animators strictly trained work
track track dont know do
And I tell Roger this
said It doesnt matter track let something
I assume spherical stuff having heard
VCS3 throbbing beginning Welcome To The Machine
Boom boom boom boom All stuff
HE CLICKS AND WHIRS
When came Welcome To The Machine
I think Roger getting synthesisers
So different effects
I mean noises are me futuristic
I loved machine

He adds later real bass
THROBBING AND BASS
The real instruments
Daves acoustics

Gerry similar kind ofbolshie attitude
status quo powers I do
 So welcome
 To machine 
And sea blood comes
crashes steel towers
God knows its about
But I thought kind strong image sea blood
I add piece piece animation Id
sea blood Roger probably said need bit longer
So sea blood turn hands praying
grasping hands
hopeless lost kind hands I suppose
searching god reason all
You Welcome To The Machine
experience music industry
Its not its experience
face monstrous
grinding thing chews spits out
In meetings Storm I had topics
somebody getting burnt business know
expression time Man Ive burned
You know so logical kind of concept like
men shaking hands getting burnt
And went Yeah Maybe outrageous
And days computers
meant setting man fire did
Yeah wasnt difficult Issuing orders bunker
its easy Over top men
Anyway real studio lot Hollywood
What absent studio lot
I believe Warner Brothers lot
I lot
work days
I special suits
stuff
envelop fire partial basically
know pretty safe pretty easy do
And In cases
He team of20 people extinguishers
ready deal emergency
The effects man step
hes got wand long end it
go Were ready action touches
spots like that steps out burning
its picture shakeshaking hands 
it
And I shot about I suppose 15 shots
15 times somebody catch lot
suddenly gust breeze came up
And whipped round face
Theres funny thing  gets face
youre going move thats thing
And blew around I turned fast I could
He fell ground absolutely smothered foam
blankets like that He got said
Thats it more
Luckily I got can
And foot leaving frame
And thats sort surreal image absence itself know
But thats real absence
Out frame sight know
And kept shooting
I kept shooting yeah
I mean I shot right
So know I didnt time concerned singed body
You know want somebody burning theyre going pay me
I dont care artist drawing fire
When developing theme absence
appropriate end
cover absent
Theum Got here
Theum
This end piece end puzzle
Anyway record company especially America
went complete apeshit
You mean wrap Wish You Were Here black opaque shrink wrap
so cant it Are completely fucking mad
But sticker said was
factory wouldnt pack properly
let fans buy it
I hear stories aficionados
who hadwho Wish You Were Here year now
carefully slit opaque vinyl shrink wrap
extracted record
actually havent seen cover 35 years
Brilliant Thats absent
Well thats I remember clearly
That strumming 12 string guitar
Id recently purchased guy I know
coming with know opening riff
Wish You Were Here
And again like
like notes beginning Shine On You Crazy Diamond
people start going Hey
thats good youve got there
And I said him Whats youre playing Thats nice
And played it
And I said Thats good
Maybe I try it
I think Roger I worked writing verses
putting chords the thing Roger
did brilliant words were
 Did trade heroes ghosts
 Hot ashes trees
 Hot air cool breeze
 Cold comfort change
 And exchange
 A walk war
 For lead role cage 
That collaboration David I I think is know
good All bits really good
So Im happy it
 So think tell
 Heaven hell
 Blue skies pain
 Can tell green field
 From cold steel rail
 A smile veil
 Do think tell 
I think songs Ive written
pose similar questions
Can free able experience reality
life goes
you not
Because cant stand square die
And I know sound like bullshit
thats song about
 How I wish How I wish
 Were lost souls Swimming fish bowl
 Year year
 Running old ground
 What found
 The old fears
 Wish here 
All songs encouraging me
I guess I write me
its encourage myself
not accept lead role cage
but demanding
I auditioning
walk war thats I want be
I want trenches
I dont want headquarters I dont want sitting
hotel somewhere
I want be I want engaged
probably I say
way father approve of
Its simple sort country song like
Its still Because resonance
emotional weight carries
best songs
People attach lots internal feelings have
entirely sure its about I
I mean Im telling its me
But theres reason people shouldnt
interpretations it valid
Although Shine On You Crazy Diamond
specifically Syd Wish You Were Here
broader remit
I cant sing thinking Syd
My memory I came studio
guy standing Gabardine raincoat
large large bloke I idea was
And surprisingly noones saying Whos person
Whats wandering gear studio
And thenthen coming control room standing around
remarkable long actually woke up
Finally I think David said Nick recognise him
And I looked I think I shrugged shoulders
point Dave sort misery
said Its Syd
And sort stood there
sat shellshocked basically
And somebody thought him
And unbelievably shocked appearance
I mean I didnt recognise him I didnt know him
But pretty
pretty affecting really
I mean Roger Dave cried
You know slim elegant
if bedraggled dazed person I seen turned
balloon shaped eyebrows hair and
And photograph studio time
looked Syd early 67
Syd then different
It great loss and know
imagining gone is
Speculating that like is
He great
Its actually kind nice standing guys
years
Standing counted rest you
Anyway were whos here
particularly course Syd
HE INTONES
To me its complete album ways
know difficult point
problems had
Its grief anger love
Youve got grief anger possibilities love
APPLAUSE
