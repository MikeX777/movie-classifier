CHILDREN CHATTERING
AND LAUGHING
A boy comes running up asks
what exactly ocean
sea
You hit lot statistics
Latin names
But answer isnt
youll book
To know ocean is
yourself
You hear
taste it
You feel power
To know ocean
live it
The ocean vast

experience small it
One point view
like marine iguana
gliding water
coast Galápagos Islands
Born miraculous mixture
matter energy
ocean ancient place
But place
In real sense ocean alive
In fact brimming life
billions years
ancestors horseshoe crab
crept beach
All manner creatures followed
gazing heavens
prehistoric eyes
Then span lifetime
human race
reached stars
like nature
got whack
ROCKET ENGINES BLASTING
As hard try
long far look
ones spotted ocean
like space
But discovered new galaxies
right expected
ocean
Get deep close
inside drop water
larva sea urchin
like asteroid
crustacean egg
resembles exotic
uncharted planet
In beating newborn heart
world begins
If step back
its easy life began
pulse water
splash sunlight color
A little time
new forms life came rippling
waters world
spreading multiplying
adapting evolving
As far eye see
north south east west
ocean smiles sky
Barely scratch surface
charging herds
breathless chase
near coast South Africa
its over
dolphins birds sharks
whales fill
plenty sardines survive
life on
explorers crossed oceans
search new world
hardly knew wondrous events
taking place
close them
Below hulls
Mobula rays went soaring
currents
bore ships along
As wind rippled
sails overhead
imagine
unseen silk scarves
rippling water below
The exquisite blanket octopus
How imagine beauty
grace oceans bounty
A short centuries ago
huge territories domain
marine animals
The ocean belonged them
BARKING
Sea lions basked sun
pristine beaches
And since
ocean continued feed us
body souI
source greatest stories
legends
Humpback whales sleep peacefully
upside
crystalclear waters
WHALES CALLING
Massive majestic
glide ocean floor
disturbing
single grain sand
One generation follows next
And mother gently nudges baby
surface
helping
way breathe
Merely knowing creatures exist
isnt tell stories
lives
For that youve got little closer
stay little longer
Youve got jump
turn swim
hear breathe move
A sea lions life playing
hunting
A cormorant looking lunch
chasing porcupine puffer fish
fun
Time creeps slowly
lazy afternoon
Sally Lightfoot crab
tiptoes past sea lions
SQUEALING
South African fur seal
way hunt
The great white shark
knows habits well
On beaches South America
select group orcas
developed method
hunting young sea lion
The blue whale
half block long
weighing 120 tons
gobbles healthy helpings
tiny shrimplike creature called krill
On clear night
ocean draws secrets close
moonlight dances waves
filters coral reef
Already crab prowI
Some peep shells
check coast clear
Others hiding place
settle night
Sound actually carries farther
faster underwater
Every crackle click
registered understood
The flap baby sharks fins
The brush sand moray eeI
slides ocean floor
Some scuttling about
Others seek cover
A hermit crab
little weight
needs spacious accommodations
Some dine
Some try blend landscape
Some stake territory
Busy taking trash
mantis shrimp keeps sharp lookout
He doesnt kindly trespassers
So finds one
look out
Meanwhile sea slug
called Spanish dancer
cuts swath Australian waters
like whirI flamenco skirt
For creatures planet
life began sea
Some returned sea
The dugongs ancestors lived land
Now grazes underwater pastures
And plants flowers
grass eats
grew dry land well
The green turtle too
returned sea
Of course while
come air
From sea shores
sea
Sea turtles lay eggs beach
Hatched night baby sea turtles
water problem
But born broad daylight
its different story
One thousand reach sea
species carry on
Baby turtles dont meal
frigatebirds
share entrée
sailfish
There sharing
going ocean
Some species depend another
Immune paralyzing venom
sea anemone
clownfish hide tentacles
Down here its like nature
given try
Every color
way life
shape
Now venomous stonefish
isnt fast agile
But patience disguise
fearsome predator
The lionfish goes silent
hes hungry
Both fast food damselfish
Big fish eat little fish
always everywhere
There fishoperated grooming stations
sea
patient customers
busy cleaners
As tempting be
its good idea
swallow dental hygienist
Some need team
fullbody scrub
Sweetlips needs touchup
The ribbon eeI come unraveled
The cuttlefish master illusion
After magic show
time garden eeI
razorfish ballet
Like soldiers marching battle
spidercrab battalions face
Australias Melbourne Bay
Theres time dance time fight
There season traveI
Humpbacks set
long journey
summer feeding grounds
near polar regions
The blue whale largest animal
history world
well
The ocean sunfish vagabond
doesnt mind horse mackerel
tagging company
The blue sharks passenger
stowaway
Sperm whales gather families
males grow up
leave mothers
traveI own
A cloud shad rides wake
whale shark
roams open ocean
long
stay away mouth
The yellowfin tuna
time
speeding ocean
east west west east
Dolphins acrobatic
They race feed leap play

Hang tight Its gonna ride
As sun sets Costa Rican waters
dolphins living up
All strength energy depend
healthy thriving resilient ocean
One good sign health oceans
mere existence older fish
like Asian sheepshead wrasse
China Sea
To wear mask wisdom
survive unspoiled waters
long time
Of course youve seen
elderly Asian sheepshead wrasse
youve seen all
There unspoiled places
sea wild clean
There places
strange face tells story
unexpected twists
There places
winged dragons exist
The leafy sea dragon lives life
patch water

Try hell die
There places aliens gather
makeup costumes needed
comes practical matters
like tools
sea otter center
They use rocks crack open shells
tender morseI inside
soaking rays
Monterey Bay
The sea provides food
shelter wideopen spaces
So community free swim
far flippers feet

Alaskan feeding grounds
await weary travelers
A orcas live year round
After thousands miles
humpbacks finally arrive
Here fishing good
theres plenty room live large
They bubbles water
form fishing net
everythings ready

its time feast
Human nets bubbles
The great bluefin tuna
Mediterranean
danger extinction
Through overfishing
trawling
staggering numbers
unwanted creatures
caught killed
Bycatch
Throwbacks
Discards
Travelers reach
destination
Though space
human lifetime
countless species
threatened
ocean fights on
And knows sea
tell power
The human race reached stars
paused look
oceans blue waters
outer space
watch time
moves
temperature
And hurts
measure pain
Using satellite imagery
pollution
runs rivers
penetrating like veins deep
spewing poison around
littered ocean
hundreds millions tons trash
human objects
challenge creature
new way
new place survive
Human indifference
surely oceans greatest threat
Yet now
opposite poles Earth
animals thrive icy wild
The leopard seal reigns supreme
Antarctic
Penguins waddle
frosty landscape
searching break ice
They fly gracefully
freezing waters
Though figure skaters
leave desired
This ocean too
flightless birds soar
blanket ice
Here mother seal
coaxes child
water time
Parenting takes lot patience
Near North Pole
seemingly untouched Arctic vista
kinds creatures
depend sea nourishment
If dragons exist
youll narwhal
unicorn sea
WHALES CALLING
Beluga whales vocalize
expressing

The story ocean fierce
natural struggle survival
surely tenderness
rising temperatures
massive sections ice floe
melting away
Arctic waters soon open
commercial navigation

The animals
stand survival
The cries endangered species
remain unheard
Yet protect
strong
More more people globe
slip weightless world
crossing universe
wonder mystery
A magical world
tiniest creatures
shed new light
universe came be
They roam dense forests
flourishing depths
They look listen
searching answers
ageold questions
discovering brandnew mysteries
instead
They marveI world
giants fly
A world greatest fears
prove unfounded
gruesome face
hide smile
presumed enemies
turn harmless neighbors
companions
afternoon swim
Now youve met them
Now know them
mere specimens
concepts lessons
living beings
share fragile planet us
Every breath
drop drink
depends healthy ocean
Now life depends us
So instead asking
what exactly ocean
maybe asking
who exactly we
