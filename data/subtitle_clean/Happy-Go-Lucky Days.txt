The happiness shared returning home
The happiness shared laughing TV shows
This impression isnt close
You fun bad
It close I wondered maybe smallest chance
Even crying I laughing blissfully unaware
It close matter now its awful impression
It wasnt remotely close matter now its awful impression
The unhapiness shared getting mad opinions differed
The happiness shared accepting feelings different
You werent looking I
You torn apart things werent right
But I pretended see I wondered maybe smallest chance
But laughed I laughed blissfully unaware
The fond memories days spent
That happiness day
I feeling exists now Im sure
Youve gotta
It close matter now its awful impression
It wasnt remotely close matter now its awful impression
