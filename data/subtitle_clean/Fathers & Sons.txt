YOU INVESTED IT IN WHAT
YOU DIDNT GO THROUGH ME
SO WHAT
DID YOU INVEST IT IN
WELL I DIDNT NEED YOU
FOR THIS ONE SON
THIS WAS A NOBRAINER
LET ME TELL YOU
WHAT I DID WITH IT
WE HAVE A NEW SPORTS COMPLEX
AT THE COMMUNITY CENTRE
WELL
SON
IT IS SPECTACULAR
ALL THE KIDS
COME THERE NOW
THEY TAKE BUSES
FROM ACROSS TOWN
TO COME TO THIS PLACE
BECAUSE ITS SO NEW
SON THEY GOT

COME ON SON
OH YEAH YEAH
YOU KNOW WHAT
I WOULDNT HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO DO THIS
IF IT HADNT BEEN FOR YOU
YOU THE ONE
THAT GAVE ME THE MONEY
THANK YOU SON
YOU SHOULD BE
VERY PROUD OF YOURSELF
WE HAVE TO ACCEPT
THE PEOPLE WE LOVE
REGARDLESS
UNCONDITIONALLY
OTHERWISE
HOW CAN IT BE LOVE
WE ALL SAY THAT
THATS AN EASY WORD TO SAY
OH I LOVE YOU
UNCONDITIONALLY
I THINK CONDITIONS
CREEP IN
CAR HORN HONKS
I AM NOT GOING TO BE
THE TYPICAL
OVERBEARING OVERLY INVOLVED
EAST INDIAN FATHERINLAW
OR EAST INDIAN FATHER
THOSE DAYS ARE OVER OKAY
I WILL BE COMPLETELY
TOTALLY 100 STANDOFFISH
WE DONT WANT YOU
TO BE STANDOFFISH
WE WANT YOU
IN OUR LIVES
NO BELIEVE ME
YOU DO
BUT PUTTING THAT ASIDE
SINCE YOU DID SAY
I DONT HAVE TO BE
I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE
POINT OUT TWO THINGS
MARRIAGE IS NOT EASY
AND THERE ARE A FEW FACTORS
WHICH CONTRIBUTE
TO THIS UNEASINESS
FOR EXAMPLE
NOTHING IS WORSE FOR A MARRIAGE
THAN FINANCIAL PROBLEMS
I KNOW YOURE DOING VERY WELL
BUT IF YOU EVER NEED MONEY
I HAVE SO MUCH FUCKING MONEY
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WERE TOTALLY FINE
WERE OKAY
I KNOW YOU ARE
I KNOW ITS NOT A PROBLEM
IM SAYING
IFYOU EVER HAVE A PROBLEM
ITS A WONDERFUL
OFFER
THANK YOU
YES THANK YOU
VERY GENEROUS OF YOU
ANOTHER CONTRIBUTING
NEGATIVE FACTOR
TO A YOUNG COUPLE
CAN BE PROBLEMS
OF A SEXUAL NATURE
OH NO NO
NO NO
IF THERES A PROBLEM
YOU KNOW IN THE
IN THE YOU KNOW
JUST LET HIM TALK
PLEASE LET HIM TALK
RATHER THAN ANALYZE IT
YES
THEN THERE IS ALWAYS
WHAT WORKS
ALMOST EVERY SINGLE TIME
IS TO SIMPLY
TRY DIFFERENT POSITIONS
IF THAT DOESNT HELP
AND THIS HAS ALWAYS
WORKED FOR ME
DURING THE ACT OF COPULATION
EAT BRIGHTCOLOURED FRUITS
BUT THEY MUST BE SEEDLESS
YOU DONT WANT TO BE LIKE
GOING PFFT
WHILE YOURE YOU KNOW
WHILE YOURE DOING IT RIGHT
I MEAN SOME WOMEN DONT MIND
THE SWALLOWING THING
I MEAN THATS YOUR BUSINESS
IM NOT GOING TO ASK
YEAH I I I AM A BIT
UM HE EMBARRASSES ME
AND I UH
AM A BIT
I GUESS I
YEAH I DONT THINK
IM THE BEST SON I COULD BE
BECAUSE THERES JUST SOME THINGS
THAT I CANT GET PAST
AND I WISH I COULD
BUT I I I CANT
I CANT IVE TRIED
AND EVERY TIME I SEE HIM
I GO HOME FOR CHRISTMAS
AND I ITS TOO MUCH
AND I CANT
I CANT GET PAST
THESE THINGS
ILL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
OF WHAT WE DO IN MY CULTURE
I THE FATHER OF THE GROOM
WOULD PUT ON A HUGE BIG
BRIGHT COLOURFUL HINDU PARTY
FOR THE COUPLE
AND THEIR FAMILY
ITS SO MUCH FUN
YOU HAVE NO IDEA BUT UM
WELL
THATS NOT REALLY
WHAT WE WANTED DAD
I TOLD YOU THIS
WELL ITS NOT WHAT
WE DISCUSSED BUT
AND THE ONLY REASON
THAT IDEA CAME TO ME

THAT WOULD BE AMAZING
IT WOULD BE YEAH
BUT ITS NOT
GOING TO HAPPEN SO
YOU KNOW I SUPPOSE
THE ROLE OF A FATHER
FOR MOST JEWS

YOUR MOTHER DIDNT WANT

SHE MADE ME
PROMISE BERNIE
SHE MADE ME PROMISE
ON THE BIBLE
AND ON THE GRAVE
OF OUR MOTHER
THAT I WOULD NEVER TELL YOU
ABOUT YOUR FATHER
BUT THEN WHEN IT
