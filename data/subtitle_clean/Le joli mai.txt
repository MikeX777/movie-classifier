 For demands
 Right
Apart demands wages strikes
event May
The major event
apart social issues
temperature
weather May
 It unusual
 Unusual
And apart that
Other events that
shouldnt discussed
Silence better
Isnt worrying
In France politics

Now people say
Better quiet
A big change no
No think alike
I dont think
 I dont think
 You dont think
Its ultimate wisdom
How it
Well know
Like Buddhists
I myself
Confucius said
See hear nothing
 Exactly
 You manage to

old people
11000 francs month
Its absolutely terrific
wild time
old folk
11000 francs month
They ended announcing
victory
sign Frances grandeur
years time

15000 francs month
I simply terrific
For else
rest trivial
victory won elderly
What expect next
We hope improvement
especially labor conditions
But man
struggles who
And strikes
possible
Governing means foreseeing
If avoid that
And discuss
You feel dont look ahead
For people
The future bit like horizon
reach it
It takes 30 years there
30 years more
Its children
Yet amazing happening
future lead us
words were late
We cant up
Our dreams fall short
exists
Facts giving birth
great revolutions
Were dreaming leisure
were dreaming of
I dont know things
Reality overtaken dreams
What worries
world ls unaware
Were unaware
You look surprised
Yes saying
leisure
improvements
future
Thats problem
Thinking terms
means organized leisure
old models
36 consulting engineers
thought rational terms
The old models persist
Theyre imposed
theyre irrelevant
Leisure definition nonwork
Can address nonwork
In terms work
I simply
Gradually machines bring
automation automatization
We wont quibble terms
The 40 hour week
30 25 hour week
workers automatically
free time
 A problem
 Im wrong
Youre example
barrier leisure
Gradually well reach 30 hours
We achieve already
We start
30 hour week tomorrow
The blocks moral
In industries weve won
fight scarcity
characterized
18th 19th centuries
dont work die
Weve surpassed industries
act hadnt
Its vital know
30 hour week
dont
The barrier mentioned
boss refuses
 Not boss
 Absolutely not
The average French person refuses
me
See reticent are
You dont seriously
Im reticent
I want work rest more
Its everyones wish
How achieve it
Could
The conditional tense
 How it
 Im shocked
What do
How come were it
 Right That
 Look
That means dont believe it
 I do I imagine it
 But its real
 Its real
 I imagine it
Look window
At people working
Theyre called people working
Not laborers
What people do
They add subtract
statistics etc
Theyre nonproductive
They trade
Most people metro
arent manual workers
They fiddle data
We machines now
But theyre badly
its like dont exist
Only exist
Now people say
Cant use better
With step forward
structure collapses
obsolete emerges
So I understand rightly
soon
Yes I believe it
Machines cause nonproductive
people lose jobs
No lose prestige
 No prestige job
 A structural problem
Or invent jobs them
But prestige
They believe work
But machines better
cant believe
Gas electricity users
felt cheated
perforated cards
They felt
couldnt check bill
They check it
If machines over
lose plot
understand all
Thats problem
Perhaps future world
split highly
contrasting groups
initiated noninitiated
Its obviously problem
Isnt connected
politics economics
No were structures
povertydriven economy
based scarcity
How break free
I think explode
Theres big obstacle
Third World
Today obviously cant imagine
buying fourth fridge
knowing population
starving death
We know biochemical
means want to
feed planet easily
So its technical problem
Its moral one
Technique free mankind
Why dont want free
I cant answer that
Are freedom independence
Are freedom independence
temptations West
To abandon African values
European values
technical civilization
A lot Europeans teachers so
They claim
contact
Africans Europeans
introduced Africans things
represent happiness
Europeans
So want too
For instance refrigerator

The white man governor

Apart
real white friends
10 May ChampsElysées
Do relationships need disguise
dressing up
No theyre extras add on
like saw earlier coatstand
On contrary
correspond
aspect ourselves
We cant live out
But dressing permits this
It accentuates self
I dont know
I love magical things
So I wear flowing gowns
incredible hats
Its ceremony too
I dont know
Where ceremonial places
When ceremonial moments
For me ceremonial moments
I ready
special
Like going restaurant
I love preparing it
I special restaurant
I know
Ill eat special dish Ill enjoy
I ready first
Its ceremony
Its private thing
A moment locked time
I imagine
beautiful
Sometimes doesnt work out
But its exciting
Getting ready
So preparing
ceremony
I love escaping
takes
reality
everyday reality routine
For instance
I feel routine takes over
Say youre someone
The opposite routine enthusiasm
When enthusiasm fades
start words dead
stifle like ash burying you
So react shake up
You dive
recreate
reinvent everything
To escape dead things
crush you
Its hard
You dont succeed
Sometimes things die anyway
Were capable of
And animals
Animals Id love lots
Animals reconcile
rest world
Im solitary Im scared
peoples cruelty
think
vulgarity things like that
So Im alone
I off
I lose lot too
But Im scared
hurt
Im solitary
Animals act
buffer people
Im reconciled world
sweetness
There

She doesnt complain
She feels proud
She looks like Alcave
Cats amazing
They want to
Theyre stylish nature
This really
This favorite hat her
Its fantastic hat
cheeky feminine
Its role
Shes playing Cocteau
Do feel privileged
 As youre beautiful say
 Im healthy
ugly yes
I didnt 10 children
limits like that
Which
involved
By I mean going way
eliminating others
I dont like that Im curious
everything
 You dont want to
 No all
Whats terrible I refuse
commit anything
Imagine
wont follow direction
ends tramp
I too easily
I dont know
It haunts me
Do accept death
refuse it
I dont accept all
Its awful sometimes
I think moment die
instant hear breath
I start crying days end
its awful
 Are religious
 No very
 Do faith
 Yes I faith
For me
God gives mankind meaning
Our attitude influenced it
We dont right
hate mankind God created it
Thats easy believers
And people
God meaningless
What then
You faith
chose attitude
How express it
I dont
 Doesnt bother you
 Of course does
Thats its difficult
Right
So you
mankind abstract
thinking gives you
I dont know confidence
sort of
For instance
filmed Renault summer
Some workers striking
workshops noisy
Conditions Billancourt
arent Paris
People suffer
Do feel concerned
Concerned useless
Communists atheists
meaning humanity
But believers communists
 Its lukewarm
 A mass
 Some communists faith
 They shouldnt exist
So believers communists
They believe
Who think
getting right now
 For who
 People suffer
Who offers best response
mankinds expectations
The communists
I think communists
active
More committed Christians
The spirit different
Theres spirit revenge
hatred religion
anger
Communism something
You destroy
active
I feel talk Christianity
highest noble form
Whereas communism
lowest form anger
Yes works it
Are angry Christians
noble communists
Among best them yes
 No Catherine
 What sort Christians
 The best ones course
 So
For me communism represents
its hard sum words
My reason live
hope future
I dont hide it
In beginning
opposed communists
I objections first
What tell them
Obviously main objection
1946 1947
sprang lips mind
communism atheist
I believer
Communists proud
atheists
The world wanted build
God
world built men men
When I saw conversations
actions comrades
God
simply strength
ambition
will work efforts
aimed change world
I saw communism
communists
easier
set arguments aside
engage brotherly action
You came communism
unions
Youre militant union member now
How involved unions
A militant came me
I now
canteen exit
He knew hed heard
I priest

This surprised him
He CGT militant
couldnt imagine
priest ulterior motive
come share
working conditions lives
comrades
His feeling
certainly distrust
But offered union card
Do want join CGT
Id thought it
I said yes
So 1946
Ive militant CGT member
But fundamental problem
wasnt simply working like comrades
The problem militants
know
I sharing struggle
Did I union card
ulterior motives
I genuine
Had I accepted
join life theirs
join fight
personal demands

In honesty
Church telling day
Thats enough come
bosom Church now
The experiment over
Thats why 1946
I determined
experiment

Thats core problem
The Church wanted experiment
hoping wed stop short
compromise
deep involvement

transformation took place
I break
To choose
Worker priest
Being unthinkable
engaging struggle
remaining Church
 You choice
 Yes
When Church asked
1953
choose Church
workers struggle
loyalty union card 1946
I preferred remain worker
participate daily
rest life
workers struggle
Did faith include transcendency
In 1946 yes
 Are detached now
 Totally
Is personal ask how
