Provided sermon decent

share large audience
But Father Daens sermon
shocking triviality
I regret say revealing
shameful demagogy
Quite right Mr Woeste
right
But all subject
inspired Rerum Novarum
and paternal preoccupations holiness
Leon XIII condition workers
This encyclical doesnt mention stirring
workers feed them
Now Daens created suspicion
government considers
send investigation committee Aalst
 What triumph enemies
 On contrary Mr Woeste
If say
talking slander
inquest prove
Father Daens wrong
A word suffice
reduce silence
Father Daens careless
Mr Woeste
But brilliant mind
case Im sure
remonstration enough
Monseigneur means
mere remonstration ensure obedience
When priest uses cloth spread
hostilities taken away
Mr Woeste Im afraid ecclesiastic
authorities capable judge this
Of course Monseigneur
But understand me
I came everybodys
avoid matter going
diocese
leading appeal
higher instances
An energetic cure right moment
prevent complications
Dont agree
