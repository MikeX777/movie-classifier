Schlosser Now food coming

Carole Morison The companies dont
want farmers talking
They dont want

The industrial food
began
fast food
In 1930s
new form
restaurant arose
called
drivein
The McDonald brothers
successful drivein
decided
cut costs simplify
So fired
carhops
got rid
things menu
created
revolutionary idea
run
restaurant
They basically brought
factory

restaurant kitchen
They trained worker
thing

again
By having workers
thing
pay
low wage
easy
replace them
It inexpensive food
tasted good
McDonalds
fast food restaurant
huge
huge success
That mentality
uniformity
conformity
cheapness
applied widely
large scale
kinds
unintended consequences
mooing
When McDonalds
largest purchaser
ground beef
United States
want
hamburgers
taste everywhere
exactly same
change
ground beef produced
The McDonalds corporation
largest purchaser
potatoes
largest
purchasers pork
chicken tomatoes
lettuce apples
These big big
fast food chains
want big suppliers
And essentially
handful companies
controlling
food system
In 1970s
beefpackers
controlled
25 market
Today
control 80
market
You thing
happening pork
Even dont eat
fast food restaurant

thats produced
system
You look labels
Farmer this
Farmer that

Morison
When its dark inside houses
chickens lay down
Its resistance

Traditionally its
AfricanAmerican men
Now were seeing
Latino catchers

From point view

theyre
gonna complain
The companies like

It doesnt matter
chickens sick
All chickens
plant
processing
The companies
farmers thumb
debt
farmers have
To build poultry house
280000
300000 house
And
initial investment
companies
constantly come

They
youre threatened
loss contract
This
farmers control
Its
spending money
going bank
borrowing money
The debt
keeps building
To
business
its degrading
Its like
slave company
Pollan The idea
need write book
telling people
food came
sign far removed
weve become
It were entitled
know food
Who owns it
How making it
Can I look
kitchen
When I wanted understand
industrial food system
I set
simple
I wanted trace
source food
When
supermarket
looks like cornucopia
variety choice not
There illusion
diversity
There
companies involved
therere
crops involved
What
surprised
I followed food

I kept ending

So
industrial food
turns clever
rearrangements corn
Corn conquered world
lot ways
It remarkable plant
100 years ago
farmer America
grow maybe 20 bushels corn
acre
Today 200 bushels
problem
Thats astonishing
achievement
breeders
deserve credit
fertilizer
makers deserve credit
pesticide makers
deserve credit
Roush
In United States today
30 land base
planted corn
Thats largely driven
government policy
government policy that
effect
allows produce corn
cost production
The truth matter
were paid overproduce
caused
large
multinational interests
The reason governments
promoting corn
Cargills ADMs
Tyson Smithfield
purchasing corn
cost production
They use
extensive money
lobby Congress kind
farm bills have
Pollan
A farm bill

called food bill
codifies rules
entire food economy
Farm policy focused
commodity crops

store them
We encourage farmers grow
corn grow
big
consolidate
We subsidize farmers
bushel
Roush
We produced lot corn
came
uses it
Larry Johnson
We engineering foods
We know turn
certain traits
like mouth feel flavor
And bring
pieces
engineer new foods
dont stale
refrigerator
dont develop rancidity
Of course biggest advance
recent years
highfructose
corn syrup
You know
I venture guess
look
supermarket shelf
Ill bet 90
contain
corn soybean ingredient
time
contain both
Pollan
Corn great raw material
You big fat
kernel starch
break
reassemble it
You
highfructose corn syrup
You maltodextrin
diglycerides
xanthan gum
ascorbic acid
All obscure ingredients
processed food
its remarkable
corn
Plus feed
animals
Roush Corn main component
feed ingredients
its chicken
hogs cattle it
Pollan Increasingly were feeding
corn fish
were eating tilapia
farmed salmon
Were teaching fish
eat corn
The fact
cheap corn
allowed drive
price meat
I mean average American
eating 200 lbs
meat person
year
That wouldnt
possible
fed
diet cheap grain
Since youre selling corn
price production
feedlot operator
buy corn
fraction
costs grow
animals
sucked

Midwest
There spiderweb

moving corn
its grown
CAFOs
Cows designed

Theyre designed
evolution eat grass
And reason
feed corn

allowed dip
cup water
that
He bit head
them
Youve seen
beg
He begged water

 Buck This way
 Yes
 Were going way
 Mmhmm
Kowalcyk
We faith government
protect us
were
protected
basic level
In 1998 USDA implemented
microbial testing
salmonella
E coli 0157h7
The idea plant
repeatedly failed tests
USDA
shut plant
obviously ongoing
contamination problem
The meat
poultry associations
immediately took
USDA court
The courts
basically said
USDA didnt
authority
shut plants
What meant
pound
meat poultry products
petri dish
salmonella
USDA
cant it
A new law introduced
direct response
law known
Kevins Law
It like clearcut
common sense type thing
 How things going
 Fine fine
Kowalcyk
Weve working years

hasnt passed
I sense

opportunity
enhanced opportunity
signed
law time
I think standpoint
consumer
lot people
support idea
paying little
guaranteed
higher standard
safety
 Kowalcyk Yeah
 But I know

players
 food production chain
 Kowalcyk We know
that tend
worry that
its gonna seen addon
costs
I think
advantage is
Kowalcyk
Sometimes feel like
industry protected
son
Thats motivated
advocate
In past year alone

multitude foodborne
illness outbreaks
resulted
significant losses
Clearly
current approach
food oversight
protection
meeting needs
American families
Its hard
tell Kevins story
But way
Im going able
prevent happening
people

speak it
Yeah
Six elementary school students

All I wanted
company
Were sorry
We produced
defective product
killed child

were going sure
doesnt happen again
Thats wanted
couldnt
that
Pollan The industrial food
looking
greater efficiency
new step efficiency
leads problems
If feedlot cattle

 Weve skewed food
bad calories
its
accident
I mean reasons calories
cheaper
ones
were heavily subsidizing
And directly tied
kind agriculture
were practicing
kind
farm policies have
All

ones come
commodity crops
wheat
corn

By making calories
cheap
thats reasons
biggest predictor

Over course
human history
struggling
sure

Now problem

The industry
blames obesity
crisis personal
responsibility
But youre
engineering foods
pressing
evolutionary buttons
The fact
were hardwired
tastes
salt fat sugar
These things
rare nature
Now sugar
available 247
tremendous quantities
Were eating hundreds pounds

This diet
highfructose corn syrup
refined carbohydrates
leads spikes

Some meatpacking
companies like IBP
borrowed sort
