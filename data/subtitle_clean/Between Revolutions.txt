The river moon
splitting
And night like blood
flowing mouth
We one
I knew cliffs wild
Falling like dream sickles
There moon
And river splitting two
I
We one
We one
Dear Zahra
How you
Did arrive well
Its hard realise wont
classmates final year
Bucharest
different here
After left I stayed there
bright sidewalk
When I turned leave
skin tight
tree
withered scorching sun
Its shadow grown thin
I stayed long
fly me
I know way plane went
It went East
When back
Dear Maria
I arrived safely home Tehran
The thing I felt emptiness
The emptiness you
I wish here
I favourite places
I wish I tell
I return soon I dont know yet
Something important happening here
Something I want of
People afraid anymore
They feel time come change
I work
father writing manifestos
I write ideas
hand people
Each day try use fewer words
write clearer messages
United defeat Shah
United defeat imperialism
My dear
Now memories include you
I brought them
old ones
I feel like voice head
spoken you
I went seaside
days sister Anca
I sat beach
I looked distance
I imagined you
Over sea mountains
In streets Tehran
Among people
Happy confident
changes country
But careful
dont danger
I like come back
this
And seaside you
To jump water
This time I wont afraid jump
I hold hand
Between Revolutions
Down Shah
Glory Islam
Allahu akbar
Workers peasants oppressed
united
exterminate exploitation
The day Khomeini urges holy war
The worlds armies
stand me
The Shah fled
When noise loud
cant hear voice
know voice
When needed there
When street
symbol else
When thousands marching street
them
force nature
From point on people
engulf geography city
feet carve new road
lead further
This gives power
My father confident
He speaks people streets
He tells need
fair solidary society
He happy
were living together
We dont want start
ideological debate
despite scientific arguments
logical reasons
supporting beliefs
Our ideology matter
today yesterday

belong society
It outcome
mans evolutionary process
My dearest Zahra
I happy enthusiasm
I know energy mountains
Ive admired it
Here I
short article newspaper
It said Shah fled
Imam Khomeini returned Iran
I dont know is photo
looked stern frowning me
How mood there
family
Meanwhile I graduated
assigned village clinic
Far away parents Bucharest
unfriendly place
I asked transferred
Bucharest
But didnt approve request
I like
control destiny
The women seeing screen

constantly us
millions women
Romania globe
This year dedicated them
always
birth live happily
work feel intensely
think
suffer hope
These them
I build brick brick
ankle
To waist
breasts
My body
twofold inside wall
My blood flows bricks
palms
Then flows
burning temples
My hair heady smell mortar
My bricks close
like blades grass
I yearn supreme intimacy
when strangely
The wall start burning like me
Last night I thought I saw again
Those men black coats
The ones followed
university
They car
near apartment
As I walking I looked
car eyes met
I froze suddenly
I picked pace
away eyes
I read wrote
I shuddered
I hope safe now
Please careful
Write soon can
People
talking Islamic Republic
scares me
The ones came power
started crackdown
They
intellectuals leftists
people wanted
else like father
They like
men black coats
Last week shut
fathers organisation
They consider illegal
But hope
The fight lost
Zahra dear I sorry
Why good people pushed aside
The ones hope
Those fight
sacrifice others
Remember told
new beginning
The Shah overthrown
Dictatorship over
You dreamed fair society
You told
Mossadeq hope
Isnt revolution dreamed of
Freedom culture
Silence disgrace
I dont think
revolution vain
I saw hope
joy peoples faces
We thought new beginning
Better dignified
I try think worst
remain optimistic
Down conservatives
Down conservatives
Down women wearing hijab
Glory wearing hijab
I voted Islamic Republic
hoping I enjoy
rights Muslim man
I serve country
Meanwhile I work law field
I hope able pursue activities
I havent voted yet
Id love to I idea
Islamic Republic involves
Unlike wife I intend
vote Islamic Republic
In small night fear ruin
Listen hear
howl darkness
I like stranger
look good fortune
Addicted despair
Listen hear
howl darkness
My dear
its years
graduation imagine
I felt captive clinic
I finally transferred
home Bucharest
It wasnt easy getting transfer
Now I work big hospital
But I quickly realised
place isnt better
Everywhere obey rules
To say
I glad near parents
I feel constrained
My father told
Secret Police letters
He forbade
write again
He insists
I married start family
We come
12 oclock lives
clock hands one
women men love
The loveliest newlyweds
young ones
Their purpose earth is
greatest hour
biological destiny
create new life life
new love love
I afraid eyes me
Of suspicious gazes
Im afraid innuendos
Im afraid words
Forgive writing long
My father disappeared month ago
Weve searched
everywhere asked everyone
We told
its best stop searching
I cant stop looking him
Sometimes I street
I run I touch him
turns around
But its him
My father
revolution
The taught hope
The power imagine future
Now I cant imagine
anymore
Zahra
I imagine
going through
Im angry
Im allowed visit you
To close again
I write I can
matter happens
Even words disappear

erases force
I dont care
Ill shield
evil touch you
Let one
lets fight together
Like time
stayed side
When whisper
hear us
Back then followed
When
stay us
But didnt
know everything
Everything write
speak
think
The river moon
splitting two
And night like blood
flowing mouth
We one one
I knew cliffs wild
Back then dear
When I afraid us
When told leave
Not leave you
But I didnt listen you
Even memories grown tangled
father disappeared
Their lines blurry
Time wearing thin
No thought love
thought triumphs
thought anything
Five years passed
start war Iraq
It turned lives upside down
My oldest nephew
joined military
Hes 15
If dies well
family martyr
I mother family
voice heard
I talk
childs sacrifice
But I stop him
To stop war
My sisters
dedicated anyone
Their shoulders bear
staggering weight revolution
After all
messengers Hussain
Messengers blood children
husbands brothers martyrs
And grenades cast forth
fragile hands
grenades
brethren launch
enemy tanks
Indeed strength arms
healing
blood veins
That sent war
They sent avenge

rightfully belongs land
To avenge injustice
turned garden
barren ruinstudded ground
My dear
I stand window
look far away
The sky dark low
like happen
We waiting
We try convince
cold state mind
controllable willpower
But doesnt work anymore
Romania place
know
Its gloomier darker
A lot changed 10 years
Just changed
My joy letters you
I reply
Ive forbidden to
I married Marius
hospital colleague
I couldnt fighting parents
I felt cornered
I it
I think often
Sometimes I wear earrings
gave left
I look mirror imagine
getting closer me
Our reflections one
In Name God
Of God
Him return
The exalted soul leader
muslims freedomloving people
Imam Khomeini
ascended Heaven
My house broken into
My things scattered everywhere
Turned upside down
My beloved books family albums
diary
letters you
I knew burglars
Because I continuing fathers work
Because I believe
believed
I saw life
pulled drawers
I breathed sigh relief
I home happened
Im alive
I try question happened
return Romania
This utmost importance
questioning anything
Believing myself
As I years ago
Down CeauČescu
Friendship
The army stands us
When thousands marching street
them
force nature
I remembered stories Iran
That energy streets
The hope voice heard
Among thousands others
At hospital
wounded
I felt I truly line
Marius wasnt me
stayed home
I felt alone
Things happening fast
I dont time
think them
We supposedly free now
But I know
victories confiscated
Dear Zahra
I hope well
I kept waiting letters
I feeling
bad happened you
But I hope I wrong
We happy
fall regime
We felt free
But its year
money worthless
We cant afford anymore
Weve lost bearings
We fear jobs
My parents constant panic
Theyve retired
They barely manage
At Marius something
He left hospital
opened small business
He sells tobacco sweets
brings Turkey
Ive thinking lately
I hesitated ask you
All time I thought
left revolution
But maybe reasons
Maybe chose safer path
Maybe thought
youd protect leaving
I wish stand face face
Look other
talk other
Tell things
I wish start again
I cant remember voice
I look photos
We close
I easy
cut silhouettes
I want zoom them
fading
When people start
fade away paper
We fading together
When I imagine talking me
Im sure
its voice Im hearing
Sometimes I think its own
head
frightens me
Where now
Please tell well
