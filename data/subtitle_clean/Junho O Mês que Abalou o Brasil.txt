This film produced
public resources
The month June begins with
a lot humidity
in parts country
I declare officially open FIFA
Confederations Cup 2013
As tomorrow bus subway
tickets expensive
In São Paulo bus
subway train tickets
will R 300
to R 320 today
Goal Brazil
The protesters
are walking around
If fares don’t down
Ole ole ola
This coverage winner
of Esso Award 2013
It’s wonderful
It makes want kill yourself
commit suicide
Just jump rails
it’s easier
The buses long time arrive
the people inside
I seat I travel
seated I bus
Depending bus
I think it’s shitty
Excuse word
But it’s chaos
Regarding urban trains
we suffer
Considering it’s year
of World Cup Brazil
we’d think be
some investments
but it’s case
None politicians brave
enough leave cars
and public transportation
and people
in heat sweating
I believe fare
either R320 R300
is expensive
for offered
It’s question
I hope change day
I’ll die dreaming
I don’t know generation be
here change
Haddad asshole
bring bus fare down
It’s expensive
It’s R 020
making businessmen
richer richer
Watch out
Crazymen Party emerge
JUNE
Come streets
Come raise
The MPL Free Pass Movement
is social movement horizontal
autonomous disconnected
to political parties
that fights truly public
transportation model
The movement started
with popular uprisings
happened especially
Salvador Florianópolis
raise bus fares
The rebellions Florianópolis
which known “Fare Wars”
achieved victory
for 2 years roll
The people streets
revoked fare rising
And 2005
at World Social Forum
several cities impelling
fights public transportation
got created
a social movement
represent
fights
It Free Pass Movement
The organizations
Free Pass Movement
aren’t primarily directed
State
They talk society
to society itself
That’s groundbreaking
The MPL declares
anticapitalism
The movement interested
topic urban mobility
For them urban mobility excuse
build revolution that’s curious
I know
students university
It act
very intelligently
Instead presenting general agendas
political discussions
like end capitalism
or topics nature
they aim specific symptom
symptom shows
system’s irrationality
This
is great act
TUESDAY JUNE 11TH
that stop city
It’s São Paulo
that fighting
against fare increase
I started covering
the protests Tuesday
the day
of protests week
And I saw different
groups people
There people connected
political parties
protesting
identified cause
Why protesting
I can’t reason
here actually
It’s amazing
finally coming streets
and protesting rights
which come when
there pressure people
This State’s responsibility
written bus itself
There ways achieve least
free tickets students
then afterwards
total gratuity transportation
I’m surprised society thinks protest
favor public cause strange
Everyone paying increase
including police
I car I’m here
I think everybody here
Because cars generate
lot traffic
car owners wouldn’t use cars
public transportation good
The arrest
demonstration Tuesday
happened right me
He cyclist crossed lane
the police trying clear
for vehicles use exclusively
He thrown grass
by officers
Oh God
Oh God
Many protesters didn’t want violence
and attacked police
But people
led attack officers
The police struck back
and engaged conflict
especially protesters arrived
Terminal Parque Dom Pedro
It’s interesting analyze
police repression Tuesday
Because act peaceful until
we got Terminal Parque Dom Pedro
And entered
the Terminal Parque Dom Pedro
in occasions
over past years
We agreed specific route
movement’s leadership
But didn’t
follow agreement
isn’t
leadership unity
people presenting
leaders movement
The shock troops surrounded
Terminal Parque Dom Pedro
didn’t let inside
A strong repression started
and people got motivated
by fight didn’t want
to simply home
They talked anarchicpunks

knew actually
Black Block
I frankly don’t know associated
MPL
But there
The Black Block tactic
it’s political group
This new tactic puts question
What legitimate
violence people
committed police
or destruction public
and private properties
On day masks
wore black
and knew about
the history Seattle Genova
They knew anarchicpunk strategy
especially anarchist one
which applied day
Our tactic force act
precisely
attacking police
officers Parque Dom Pedro
We negotiated police
Paulista avenue
trying hold repressions
like ones happened
lot people hurt
Everything going well
We got Paulista avenue without
any sort complications
among protesters
But police clearly set ambush
waiting MASP
We supposed close
the act MASP
but started shoot throw
bombs MASP
And happened
everybody saw
Youll throw bombs
all night long
I believe happening
historically know phenomenon
huge singularities
There mismatch
citizens
institutions
represent them
Everyone right reunite
public place
needing
someone’s authorization
Isn’t job
law followed
Yes
Is law followed now
You keeping citizens
coming going
throwing
tear gas bombs people
Is justice
What
son marching here
Would throw bomb him
I don’t know
All I know people
set buses fire
broken vehicles hurt officers
written buses
Did I set buses
I don’t know I don’t know
Must I pay somebody
else’s crimes
But that’s you’re telling me
You justifying actions
Should I pay
crime else
I hit bomb
face coward
There sort guide
Internet
explaining cope
tear gas like that
And viral Internet
best way deal
tear gas use vinegar
Vinegar
Vinegar new Anthrax
Vinegar
Vinegar new Anthrax
He holding substance
claims vinegar
It pass police
inspection confirmation
The vinegar joke
Being arrested
getting protests
holding vinegar
doesn’t sense
Vinegar
You stand right
hands back
What
Am I arrested
Stand right
hands back
Vinegar new Anthrax
It’s easier people
little tear gas
situation like that
everybody saw including Folha
A police officer position
maybe killing someone
because attacked
by bunch people
and carrying
a 40 caliber pistol
which proper weapon
He shouldn’t have
been place
Stop Stop
Go ahead
Lead march ahead
Brazil big movements
most
“Diretas Já”
Direct Elections Now
and impeachment president Collor
both big public manifestations
But country doesn’t tradition
public manifestations
If France example
tradition lasts
If French destroy
subway stations France
they’re cause
If people break subway stations
Paulista avenue
seen lazybones don’t
want work
Maybe French
fancier called activists
This interesting
Let’s look guidelines
protests world
Chile 400 thousand people
on streets asking free
quality public education
Israel TelAviv asked
the State regulate
the costs habitation
Spain Indignants
true democracy
and chance oppose
the economic system
that destroying country
Tunisia Egypt ideas
of democracy dignity
it wellfare State
that doesn’t exist countries
All movements asked for
something clearly
democracy
THURSDAY JUNE 13TH

During entire time Thursday
I saw police hitting people
shooting throwing bombs
people shouting
“No violence”
I surrendered

I surrendered
I surrendered
piece shit
Giu shot
eye man
Who
Giu
We walking Augusta street
ran shock troops
I stood there
I wearing identification
Folha neck
I didn’t cell phone
ran battery
I didn’t
word them
Then shock officer stepped
ahead others
holding shields
pointed gun me
That happened
several times day
so I didn’t think
he’d shoot me
But shot
Did see
him aiming you
I saw it
I saw aiming me
I thought
shoot
Because aimed
evening
shot
I job
And I woman
I imagined
uniformed policeman
shoot face
Our police force wellbuilt
The police force destabilized
lack communication
with group
We surrounded
At certain moment
got Consolação street
I remember looking
shock troop

cavalry troop
looking ahead
bombs coming
The order disrupted
series police interventions
Fucking rich kid
Shut up Shut up
From day one
we protesters arrested
Many protesters were
simply walking streets
taken police station
charged crimes
hadn’t committed
Excuse me Excuse me
What do
He assaulted troops
Excuse me
In Brazil public
totally underprepared
Schools hospitals
The police couldn’t different
Stop right there
Stop
Get back
Get wait
You reaction
they didn’t receive proper training
Their nervous reaction
doesn’t sense
You they’re prepared
Maybe they’re “wellprepared”
when watching
suburbs
can’t they’re doing
What saw thing
happens day
with groups
that aren’t middle class
It’s thing time
middle class filming
These fuckers filming us
If records
of kind behavior
surely doesn’t reflect attitude
officers
marches
Free Pass Movement
The State Government
the shock troop
police clearly
attempted checkmate movement
tried stop people going
streets cost
This movement
organized whom
By tiny little group vandals
actions clearly criminal
Are linked
political party
We investigate
verify what’s origin
Tomorrow more
Tomorrow
lot more
Tomorrow more
Tomorrow
lot more
On week
media played role
important violence
police
terms creating outrage
The press reflected huge indignation
public opinion
developed
minority movements
We’ve gotten minority movements
years
Any 50 people stop Paulista avenue
labeled “social movement”
That’s way making city
hostage organized groups
I think editorials
Folha Estado São Paulo
day
historical
considering repercussions
caused
They demanding repression
saying State weak
affirming Paulista avenue
taken back
Well press demanded things
right way
police translated
terms
The translation
“Now time play”
Then police started play
public opinion revolted

reflected journalism
I think journalism public
opinion walked side
The media accepted situation
way
denying
movement
taking huge proportions
The media
longer it
But supported movement
way wouldn’t hurt interests
That’s exactly
Arnaldo Jabor did
One day said vandalism
abominable
They violent imitation
50’s socialism imitation
ancient
left stands for
This middle class insurgents
aren’t worth R 020
And day says
“It’s great
they’re streets”
At sight movement
like pointless provocation
mistaken
criticize including me
I don’t think press mistaken
opinions
adopted
At moment
press wasn’t asking violence
peaceful protesters
And second moment
media right denounce
absurd violence police
Are going
Datena film
Wasn’t question clear
“Are favor
protests riots”
That better way
question
2839 people said
favor kind protesting
It’s interesting
anchormen normally
addicted public opinion
The viewer calls seeing
calm image
misinterpret question
Ask question like suggested
They don’t
public opinion
If audience wants know
police
they’ll talk police
When Datena started seeing
history
smart to
I tell people angry
ticket fare increase
doesn’t matter it’s bus
subway train
People angry
support kind protest
If media hadn’t changed sides
June 13th
hadn’t convoked entire
country participate
MPL wouldn’t
achieved victory
I noticed people
everyday life
colleagues work
moment
talked
vandalism
I couldn’t tell
I participating marches
I managed way go
I couldn’t tell them
After June 13th I mentioned I gone
march suddenly cool
What vehicle
of Record network fire
You’d tell destruction
of network’s assets
But I differently
I think it’s great sign
Come streets
Come raise
No violence
No violence
There new
which common
It’s power new medias
convoking people
That’s new
and it’s extremely important
In São Paulo turning point
was moment
when criminalization
against movement
The movement peacefully
took streets
journalists protesters
severely hit police
And society got that
it ran social networks
It citizens changed
the way history told
With phones cameras
they documented independently
and spread pieces
that quality importance
The material shot
was largely broadcasted
At moment
empowered country
including importance
citizen journalism
The Media Ninja
is secret organization
it’s proposition
for network collaborative
and independent journalism
An event created Facebook
The entire country
It’s happening Rio
São Paulo
The TV media
distorting everything
The social networks
became crucial
More important
than sharing opinion
channel
opinions spread
It existed differs
ways it
At Bastille
people reunite
Here Rio 15 hours
huge march organized
funeral Edson Luís
student murdered police
The huge march
Internet
radio
telephone
mouth mouth
things like that
At end
differences correspond
means available
time
means
worked
new means
working I hope

SUNDAY JUNE 30TH
The placid shores Ipiranga heard
The blaring shout heroic folk
The sun Liberty shining rays
Shone homelands sky instant
If pledge equality
We conquer strong arm
In thy bosom
O freedom
Our chest defy death itself
O beloved
Idolized homeland
Hail hail

Of love hope descends earth
If thy comely

Giant thine nature
Thou art beautiful thou art strong
An impavid colossus
And thy future mirrors thy greatness
Adored Land
Amongst thousand others
Art thou Brazil
O beloved homeland
Of sons ground
Thou art kind mother
Beloved homeland
Brazil
In democratic game
the winner loser
in 5 minutes
or maybe wins anything
Because conflicts
bigger solutions
But I believe that
peculiar way
it good change started
complaining what’s wrong
Fuck World Cup
40 million people
We lot progress
in 20 years
thanks past governments
the Brazilian society
the democratic constitution
This didn’t magically happen
We’ve taking
more Brazilians
from extreme poverty conditions
Now people want more
There dream society
that goes consumer market
Today have
less social disparities
and reflects
on people´s right consume
However public schools
reproduce social disparities
The health still
reproduces social disparities…
Get there
Get fuck there
We resist
We resist
Youre discrediting
popular wisdom
think people mix victory
sports political needs
Even specific moment victory

premature ejaculation
We there fun
thought
“Is
revolution like
I’ve enough

The month June
brought need

balance things
To believe
It’s time unite believe
Tomorrow greater
