reason
But I believed that
I disrespected
woman I love
I violated oath
protect serve
I couldnt single reason
I deserve second chance
Until now
Lets home
Instrumental music playing
You world
And wrap
Round dance
You perfect rhythm
From start
And I cant slow
The beating heart
That
arrhythmia
Give arrhythmia
You want love
light
Show switch
Ill hit
You want
race
Show start
Ill win
Even Im fading
You picking

You feel
like inner girl
You feel like
America
Baby tonight I feel like
Making love
You world
And wrap round
dance
And I cant slow
beating heart
That arrhythmia
Ballad playing
Over radio
Comes sound I
hope I know
Another officer
But angel
Show way
I heaven
When I opened eyes
When I opened eyes
You
You
You
