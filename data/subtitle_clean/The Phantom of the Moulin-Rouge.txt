Stéphane I known years
We neighbours
One day guy pissed low wall
separated houses
His parents accused me
And accused Stéphane
Thats met
In yelling sets parents
THE MOULIN ROUGE
Yeah go
 Im getting ready fire
 Yeah ahead on
 Hey okay
Wait wait
 No old woman
The old woman on
What there
You clowns mad
Why throwing rocks people
They small apartment
My parents couldnt understand
people live there jammed together
They thought apartment
collapse day
And theyd deserve it
They couldnt stand noise
the—effervescence
There unbelievable
scenes Stéphane’s house
One day little sister nearly jumped
window boyfriend
It woke neighborhood
I enjoyed going Stéphanes
It changed bit
At home—
No passion
My father spent time reading newspapers
And mother listened radio
Sometimes I tried stimulate bit
To talk them react
To little cheeky
Well I quickly stopped
I got slapped
I know Stéphanes uncle said
mother broom arse
I think point
Stéphane I gone school
I remember day Stéphane wasnt
paying attention French lesson
The teacher pointed door
told leave
He took door—And left
It took weeks it
Wed hidden house
The neighbourhood held secrets us
We knew gossip
So use it
When tobacconist wouldnt sell cigarettes
threatened wed tell
affair florist
But didnt work time
Go on run run
Stéphane big fan cabarets
Especially Moulin Rouge
He felt special
Apart dancing girls
I didnt point
But luxury glitter—
It intoxicated him
One evening
Stéphane hed
family eastern France
His father job course
going help him
When told news—
didnt talk much
But I knew coming soon
I act fast
My parents killed
knew I day
I disinherited thats sure
At time I wasnt proud it
But done
It good cause
I managed pay guys
worked Moulin Rouge’s kitchen
To let door
I kept secret right end
To big night
I wondered Stéphane
thinking day
I dont know I happy here
happy him
Anyway expression weird—
It funny
Inside world
We hear music rumbling
ground shaking people applauding
Step aside please
Step aside
We wings backstage
We passed dancers getting ready
amid excitement
Come on Hurry up Two minutes  Two minutes
No paid attention us
We completely
scenery crowd
Then show
People laughing drinking singing
All glitter joy
Stéphane’s eyes sparkling
To honest amazing
He left following day
Some time later I ran away
military service
His superiors furious
Apparently refectory door missing
