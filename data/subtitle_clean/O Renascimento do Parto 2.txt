“Hospitals maternity wards

“You chose deliver way
Now live it”
Small talk delivery room

opposite direction know
Towards afflicting putting danger
women’s health children’s health

For ethical reasons
it’s complicated
I’m doctor that’s
huge conflict me
We ancestral memory
violence country
We’ve 500 years building
violence racist
sexist classist violence
And now obstetric violence
Verbal abuse especially
sexual nature
“You didn’t scream loud

Why screaming now”
Humiliation shame degradation
They’re gonna slice vagina

Performing routine episiotomy women
episiotomy
speed process
Many times women cut
told it
Many times anesthesia
They scream then saying
“I don’t wanna cut” And
doctor cuts anyway
Incontinence won’t able
pleasurable sex life anymore
It’s woman’s right guaranteed law
They want crouch

PATIENT “DOES NOT HELP
WITH NATURAL BIRTH”
OUT OF ROOM IN THE MATERNITY WARD
All world see
An attempt 42 weeks
Because 42 weeks chances
having natural birth reduced
Here Brazil it’s 40
Forty weeks touch exam
“Gee baby’s high
cervix closed won’t fit
It won’t fit anyway
wanna wait”
It’s euphemism
edge word “surgery”
Birth woman gave birth
“Shall schedule delivery”
You don’t schedule delivery
You schedule surgery
However I won’t tell
woman office
we’re scheduling surgery
But crux matter what’s
sold woman safety
Natural birth option
Brazilian women
It’s option anymore
Humanized Csection
controversy courses
humanization based especially
putting woman central role
You Csection
women lose central roles
When “humanized Csection”
reinforce birth industry have
In Csection dimmed lights
music skin contact
I’d it’s respectful Csection
Humanization means
nice
scented oils music playing
dimmed lights First all
humanization means working
current scientific evidence
I doctor 30th week
And joked it said me
“Whales birth legs
So it’s gonna easy you”
They said “In minutes tops
second baby come”
Okay then Tom come on
It took way longer that
At point
I begging Csection
“For God’s sake
I can’t anymore”
“You chose deliver way
Now live it”
Touch exams time
“Sit down then Sit down
we’re gonna anesthesia”
They wouldn’t let sip water
Must I lie down I feel
okay I wanna sit
So I gonna die If I didn’t
Csection I gonna die
…with oxytocin dripping veins
In training hospitals
heard statement woman
told different
people performed touch exams her
And delivery
suffered episiotomies
practice episiotomy suture
Let build intolerance
obstetric violence
It marked women’s bodies
babies’ bodies soul
people involved birth
I schedule meeting right
You talk secretary
It’s funny
they’re like “But why
Why wanna record it
Why wanna record it”
Concerning schedules
that’s technology thing
advances
medicine field
We lot data Brazil
iatrogenic prematurity
it
forced prematurity
People think medication
medicalization thing
they’re not
Medications exist help us
Medicalization social construct
makes natural things
medical perspective
That began specifically
childbirth management
16th century midwives
godmothers healers
removed birth scene
replaced men
considered
recipients scientific knowledge
It appropriation men
science technique technology
During Fifties movement began
cruelty pregnant women
USA
Europe especially England
women gave birth
unconscious
physically restrained They didn’t
recollection delivery

memoryimpairing drugs
They came bruises

Many times scars
falling bed

They showed Pedro took away
There wasn’t skin contact
“If don’t tie tubes
Csection
pregnant again
you’re gonna die”
They performed Csection
I gonna die
tied tubes
And baby daughter born
I wanted hold her
“No no no You can’t…
arm”
Because I oxytocin
I didn’t know either
The marketing department’s number
They ripped afterbirth
simply pulled off
That hurt lot well
In Sixties Hippie
movement feminist movement
strong contestation
authorities general
including medical authorities
Childbirth moment
empowerment woman
it’s moment takes
control body
active attitude
My mom room
I looked mother
I told her
“Mom cut up”
And mom said me
“No girl That’s normal”
I said
“It’s normal I’m pain”
And then Mom
took bathroom
said “Look don’t scared
It’s gonna hurt
Don’t shocked touch it”
I kept looking
saying “Why
Why this”
And couldn’t answer either
Feminism is maybe hardcore
great inspiration
criticism
debating obstetric violence
This knowledge
medical obstetric gynecology
medicine general is
great extent
misogynous one stems
idea women
incapable doctors
There’s biological explanation
women irrational creatures
incapable having
objective scientific thinking
This need
protected men institutions
Feminism struggle
woman’s right decide
herself life
body
For protagonism
voice space
equity different
equality isn’t it
It’s equal men
having rights men
Deserving respect
intrinsic human beings
No earn respect
That’s common mistake
people thinking
feminism
opposite male sexism
It’s institutionalized model
deeply seated
patriarchal logic
power domination women’s bodies
The medical discourse impregnated
all
fear feminine
fear childbirth
Come on Come on
Come on
There’s fantasy
giant phallus baby
goes vagina phallus
partner lost there
So woman ceases sex object
wornout
used loose person
basis
best scientific evidence
Spontaneous childbirth actually
according some
propitiate bettertoned
vagina before
professionals’ view
fact having vaginal birth
threat
woman wouldn’t able
satisfy partner sexually anymore
Jokes… doctors comment
they’re gonna close more

Ben came good time
The world spinning fast
And life running far
Ben I heard wanted talk
Your mom told you’re
And looking pictures I miss
Ben day you’ll grow
You’ll tired toys playing
You’ll come
sadness arm
Because teeth decay
And legs grow long
Ghosts fly
After light dissolves
But that’s mystery
No need
Ben stop listening
records I gave
Never miss nice day beach
Don’t forget come visit me rascal
Ben don’t listen they’ll
And don’t hear advice
Not nonsense I’m telling
That teeth decay
And legs grow long
Ghosts fly
After light dissolves
People scream
People talk
But that’s mystery
No need
Life good
When play
When sing
And don’t look
Just don’t forget
That I’m buddy I know
This pain impossible explain
No matter study
