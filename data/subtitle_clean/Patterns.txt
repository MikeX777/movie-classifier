The stock quotation
yesterday morning

leash Mr Briggs Or I mistaken
You mention likely time
purchase June
The plant
receivership then
Thats says
Thats months improper
maintenance equipment
I doubt it Bill
Ive best men
weeks
We varying voltage problem
taken care of
No maintenancewise I doubt
1000 worth deterioration
How goodwill
 What it
The plant employs 900 men
Half working force village
So
What men Put
drawer resume production
Your concern plant
What good plant men
Chop village payroll half
months plant
As village
Mr Briggs let disregard
moment considerations mention
What rest plan
Id adequate
Adequate
That gentlemen
kiss death Believe me
Ive known Mr Briggs long time
When says thing adequate
means is entirely inadequate
I admit feeling concern 900 men
suddenly deprived livelihood
Mr Briggs goodness 
To look I consider
fairly elementary business principle
By putting 900 men
work temporarily
We ultimately employ twice
number town
By cutting production costs result
We able compete
favorably market
Thus well able sell goods
Were ruining town
Were going it
I think Mr Briggs
thirty years 
Youd able think
tongueclucking stage 
And come
analytical point view
I thought Id given point view
I saw none
Ive perceived amounts
emotional little titbit
That decidedly
charitable corporative
And thought through
I asked objective
view business venture
From I got
constantly getting 
A negative response all
Adequate I believe said
Mr Briggs This save
conservatively half million dollars
Which well able
business
I
liberal view adequacy
I didnt intend
issue this
But I felt important
air meeting
