Well died earlier
I wasnt elementary school
My brother took

SHINOSAKA STATION

A man got quarrel bar
went home shotgun
Then hid waited
husband total stranger him
came along
Now come way
Here
Here
They caught assailant
hes tried
But thats Ive heard
Were surviving victims murder
Can believe it
Can right
On that psychological
assessment done
said
mental abnormalities
He judged innocent
Thats crazy
Why like
shotgun
Who wouldve given permit
Dont think
Come
Im trying carry
husbands business its hard
It sounds rough
Just raising kids
seeing husbands face
day I wanted
There I wanted
I felt enough
But I cant let situation stand
Im claiming damages national
prefectural governments
I didnt want first
No money
bring husband back
It wouldve like bartering
husbands life money
What changed mind
I began think duty
A duty
It like Professor Nakaya said
A victims family natural right
compensation
Those people
demand it
There people
similar fate
grieving
else
We duty people
Who Professor Nakaya
 Dont know
 No
He teaches Doshisha University
Kyoto
Last year set association
compensation crime victims
I didnt know
like that
I suppose family member
victim crime
Actually no
He teaches law department
thats research
Hes studied England
And says victims families
right compensation
Thats right
He says encouraging things
DOSHISHA UNIVERSITY
I certainly surprised
To think
leading way
If Id known
I wouldve sought out
So 150 people
No its 155
I see
Last fall I started group
members
Even now 20 30
I tried recruit more
holed
homes
A lot people told
leave alone
So I appreciate trouble
youve gone through
It mustve hard work
Yes
Indeed
Having taken far
small task
You respect
I see
Now continue 
As I mentioned
protecting rights
freedoms
its unfortunately difficult
prevent crimes
And well likely crimes
world gets complicated
These times know
tragedy befall you
In fact taking group
example
victims
completely blameless
According statistics
year before
case
30 murders
So oneinthree murder victims
killed reason all
As far goes I believe
crimes inherent society
In way
theyre like endemic diseases
Endemic diseases
Diseases eradicate
matter do
I think think way
Thats I think
protected times
insurance pays
circumstances
I think thats way
deal it
Did insurance
Yes
What mean
Not need
policy for
I believe citizens
contract
The premiums form taxes
Of course obstacles
But state ought pay
compensation victims
Thats I it
I wish heard earlier

suffering
It asking help
Not all
Youve splendidly
Youve worked hard long
Youre commended
