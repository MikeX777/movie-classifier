 Absolutely
Dad want come play
I should um

Thank you sir
Civilian
 Yeah
 Yeah Me too
Elliot
Neil
Tough morning huh
I barely lasted minutes
ice bath
Course I suppose
NASAs interested
psychological reaction
Well
I think I pretty clear
I thought cold
Armstrong
 Good luck
 You too
Another egghead
Neil weve chatting
candidates
program
As know decision
forgo direct ascent
favor lunar orbit
rendezvous approach
eventual Moon mission
major impact
Gemini
Do thoughts
decision
Well considering
von Brauns initial criticism
payload saved
parking primary vehicle
orbit
sending smaller ship
lunar surface
worth
resulting challenges
What
challenges
Cislunar navigation one
And rendezvous docking
Why think
space flights important
I few uh
opportunities X15
observe atmosphere
It thin
small Earth
barely all
And youre
crowd
look up it
looks pretty big
dont think
much
But
different vantage point
changes perspective
I dont know
space exploration uncover
I dont think
itll exploration
sake
exploration
I think itll fact
allows things
maybe seen
long time ago
havent able
now
 Does else
 Yeah
Neil I sorry hear
daughter
Im sorry question
Um I
I mean is uh
think
effect
I think
unreasonable assume
wouldnt
effect
All right Neil

Thank you sir
I got it
Its fresh start
Are sure
Yeah
Hey
Itll adventure
Since time Jules Verne
man imagined
traveling Moon
The old idea
Moon
send spacecraft
way back
However NASA engineers
developed modern approach
rocket
contains ships
journey
together
Just Columbus took rowboat
Santa Mar√≠a
shore New World
astronauts
smaller spacecraft
mother ship
lunar surface
When its time return
smaller craft lift
surface
dock mother ship
power crew
Earth
Thus thanks
brilliant minds NASA
ageold dream going
Moon
soon achieved
Sputnik Sputnik 2
Vostok Gagarin
The Soviets beaten
single major
space accomplishment
Our program couldnt compete
So weve chosen focus
job difficult
requiring
technological developments
Russians gonna
start scratch
As we
Hi
 Hi
 Im Pat
Got week
you
welcome neighborhood
Oh thats nice you
 Well its
 Im Janet
 Nice meet you
 Nice meet you
So instead here go

Only master
tasks
Apollo
consider trying land
Moon
 Its nice meet you
 And you Pat
 Bye
 Bye
 Eddie down
 Gus
Eddie Junior dont dare
You got add
Just job

roll coupling axes
kind
encounter space
The challenge
stabilize machine
pass out
First victim Armstrong
White youre up
Yeah I got it
Im okay
Lets again
Oh fuck
Gentlemen welcome
Basic Rocket Physics
Well covering
chapter tonight
When multistage
launch vehicle
its necessary determine
right sizing
stages
 Hi
 Hi
You okay
Yeah
Just thinking
lecture
Its kind neat
Whats neat it
Well
rendezvous Agena
If thrust
itit actually slows down
puts
higher orbit
reduce thrust
drop lower orbit
order catch up
Itsits backwards
teach pilot
work math
ititit follows
Its kind neat
Yeah
Whats funny
No its funny
Its just
Its kind neat
Do remember this
Yeah
Im surprised
remember it
If miss

Uh yeah
Its Naha Rescue One
Naha Search One
Well Id like argue

going home
Im
sure can
Yeah
I thinking
forgot
We everything
far I know
Gemini 8 saw
complex vehicles
launched day
time
We saw flawless rendezvous

All tended
overshadowed
malfunction but uh
I think focus
progress
resulting mission
The board like focus
malfunction
Neil walk
decision
separate Agena
You mentioned
rate revolution
second
How near
unconscious
Did think use Agena
stabilize
combined craft
We did
This was uh successful
As I said initially assumed
anomaly
Agena control system
Cause way know

Half country doesnt think
its worth anymore
Uh well
we learned fly
60 years ago
consider
technological developments
context history
its not
Im considering
context taxpayer dollars
And we Senator
Between us
were final tests
new
command module today
Im sure Mr Gilruth
happy tell it
Let introduce Bob
Come on
Okay
Id like photo sir
