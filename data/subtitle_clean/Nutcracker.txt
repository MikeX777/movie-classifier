Christmas long ago
memory dream
end
But middle dream
I wake
time attend
Christmas Eve party
Mama Papa gave brother Fritz
Mama attracted
interesting guests Papa said
beautiful
fascinating
She was said
wondrous peacock
How
anticipation I was
Dreamers need pretty
godfather Drosselmeier
told long ago
My good and sometimes
bad godfather Drosselmeier
certainly strangest guest longago parties
He genius said
So especially strange behaved like silly little boy
And often frightened me
But often
strangest all
I loved
better anyone
And I loved
presents best all
For genius
famous clockmaker
toymaker
mouse catcher
Dreams like
precious gifts
dear godfather Drosselmeier
When I loved him
kindest creature imagine
He told stories
word I remember
But frightened weird childish ways
I bear
near me
punish me
It occasion
I nearly 13 years old
Christmas Eve
spite
Godfather Drosselmeier gave
wicked dream
I smile think now
nightmare bring
like sweet memory strange joy
It mystery
I solve
But I forgive spiteful godfather slipping dream
bad little brother Fritz
The Christmas parties
long ago
blur mix memory
The real unreal one
How silly
children appeared
Gawking gaping Grand Promenade mamas papas
I forget
envy delight I felt
watching parents
And badly I longed dance beautiful Papa
How head whirled music buzzed bad dream
cold
forget
And Godfather Drosselmeier
wasnt there
The party incomplete wonderful presents
In longago dream
ocean wide mystery
heart beat
joy fear mixed
But odd say
I knew dreamscape
Dreams
strangely familiar places
They are all
land makebelieve
home
lay inside yourself
like inner lining
favorite coat
sweet kernel
inside hardest nut
jaws Nutcracker Prince
reveal me
In language
dream
palace delight
spoke
selves
We dreamtalked
hands feet
quickdanced
mousey Christmas tale
And joined celebration palace sea
And tall Nutcracker cavalier eyes me
For long dream be
