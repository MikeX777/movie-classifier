Two days ago start looking
Michal farm

Yesterday started concerned
Radka
nearly cost life
Perhaps
push Michal off
Wait second
Suppose didnt
money Kramárová
 given him
 For what
For what
Perhaps keeping quiet
And murders
Thats exactly it
It confused similar murders
different motives
First sexual one robbery
finally both
Thats true
Kramárová wasnt robbed leaves
rape Menšíková
And Brychová
Doctor dissecting room said
perpetrator distracted storm
But
distracted him
The boy farm
 Damn
 He around
suppose saw happened
What killer do
He leaves Brychová lying ground
runs boy
Brychová crawls bushes
succumbs injuries
killer returns cant
rain dark
And let boy go
Theres killing theres killing
He killed women
state trance
hed kill Michal
clear head
One doesnt easily courage
that
Wait second
That murder happened Sunday
On Monday Michal gets binoculars
money
That couldve worked
But things kept
quiet long
Then saw coming barn
sure Michal quiet good
Who knew looking Michal
 The Král brothers gamekeeper
 The doctor health centre
It anyone
He hidden hear us
Do think person
time
Looks like it
 And Radka
 I consider case separately
It started
The attack girl
attempt
Of course Im psychiatrist
Thats came advice
The following cases
killers sexual drive stronger
fear exposed
Perhaps hadnt sufficient
opportunities intercourse
And stereotypical way killing
suggests habitual offender
Such cases are unfortunately rare
And conjure
image perpetrator
Perhaps mental one I doubt
use you
Why On contrary
Well
Based way killed
I guess hes man imagination
A primitive
And based killed
I hes older person
person flawed character
He aware victims
reject normal circumstances
He fifties
widower
husband woman aged prematurely
Thats probably I tell you
Thank you doctor
I think its starting look clear
And girl
If victim shes
survived killers attack
Why doesnt talk then
Thats hard say
Its mutism result great shock
Fear men
Its trauma life
Is way it
If easy I
suggested way
But its risky
Doctor murders
follow
Isnt risky
Make people business
dont want drama here
The snow needed
 Listen
 What it
Could tell good do
Do want girl
insane
Leave us Mr Král
Excuse me dragged here
Because fallen balcony
Look doctor things
understanding
forgive that
Thats all comrade major Im taking
people me enough
That depends them
 What anyway
 I dont know want here
Come way please
Dont afraid anything Radka
