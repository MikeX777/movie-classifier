For nomads life depends

At birth wildebeest calf weak

The predators plain many
its young pursue most
Quick size opportunity
leopard plans strategy
He knows wildebeest
fleet foot slowwitted
He turn stupidity

The leopard hunts stealth
moves likelylooking tree
specialty ambush
overhead
A leopard guesses wrong
goes hungry
strange instinct told
herd pass way
And so moment
hes content watch wait
Sure enough
guess good one
And now leopard goes
deadly business
grim deliberation
He knows hell chance
The instant reveals himself
herd stampede
He moves lower closer
The nearer gets
chance miss
And while milling herd

Now drops
When leopard strikes
its like lightning bolt sky
hours afterwards
wildebeest
wild confusion
Sometimes African drama harsh
reality Africa
Life death
cycle endless repetition
And natures way
Some shall live tomorrow

And so tragedy
means survival another
Before dines however
leopard carries prize
tree
This practice typical leopards
way refusing share
scavengers plain
Among great cats Africa
cheetah matchless hunter
surpassing leopard
Records prowess exist
ancient times
Egyptian hieroglyphics
portray cheetah action
The kings Egypt recognized
animals amazing abilities
trained graceful
creatures royal hunting cats
Slim waist
long shoulder
cheetah looks
like greyhound cat
She walks high like hound
added height
gives abnormal stride
An extralarge chest
great lung capacity rangy muscles
mean tremendous endurance
Strangely
undersized
small head jutting
like sort gargoyle
It appears placed
wrong body
And suits natures purpose
cheetah
streamlined superspeed
Here swiftest runner
animal kingdom
Full out
incredible 80 miles hour
And so simply runs prey
ground
The sight cheetah prowl
alerts gazelles
They grow tense
ready instant flight
When catgreyhound slips
groundconsuming stride
herd knows its time scatter
In panic
run directly alongside
But cat ignores them
Shes picked victim
ahead
One doomed
miraculous escape
takes place
And race cheetah
escape
Living do
midst teeming herds
lions
hungry
And yet task making kill
isnt easy looks
It involves strategy skill
sometimes downright luck
Day in day out male lion
little actual hunting
Lazy ever His Majesty sits
sidelines strikes kingly pose
role provider
left ladies
And so its lioness
field
Her problem close prey
Unlike cheetah
shes good short sprint
After that hoofed animals
easily outdistance her
She reach wildebeest
chance
underway
It simple matter
come striking distance
requires stealth
command
After failure
lioness saves energy
At rate hunt long
discouraging
If friendhusband
here things easier
A vain hope however
royal spouse
rests laurels
wonders whats holding lunch
But time worry
lazy males
Theres meal won
pride fed
And ladies join forces work
strategy commonly lions
The leader circles roundabout
course herd
Meanwhile colleagues approach
front
They walk plain sight
purpose
distract herds attention
The trap sprung
But wildebeest detects
presence
But lions lions front
way shall run
Instinctively lioness seizes
jugular vein
The end quick sure
Once kill made shared
rest pride
And clan begins gather
His Majesty last bestirs himself
Hungry lions materialize
everywhere
Uncles aunts cousins
nieces nephews
come double
claim portion feast
Given chance dine
lions gorge themselves
fighting
choicest bits
Against mighty appetites
single kill doesnt long
And African plain
ancient pattern
repeated again
One day its zebra
falls prey pride
The victims vary
outcome same
food lions cubs
On rare occasions
young giraffe casualty
wary
luck eventually run out
There times
king beasts
tries dinner himself
bitter squabbles develop
Its trick keeping carcass
rest pride
But heres lioness whos managed
reserve remnant cubs
And drags
hiding place
If shes lucky youngsters
banquet themselves
But shes forgotten scavengers
Now jackals join parade
ready dart opportunity
Theyre experts petty theft
spend lives following
lions living leavings
These fearless little thieves
face lioness anytime
turned
Now hyenas pop nowhere
anxious join party
And overhead
vultures materialize air
drop free meal
Vulture jackal hyena scavengers all
Yet these nature counts useful
serve purpose keeping
plain free carrion
By time hangerson
taken toll theres left
Finally its battle bare bones
This contest lioness
camp followers ends
momentary standoff
natures way
providing all
The lions kill survive
And course includes
families scavengers
This natures plan
scrap food plain
way hungry mouth
On ground below meanwhile
lion cubs arrive
And its meager meal
waiting
Other members pride
come forward too
mighty slim pickings
work
lions share
And poor Mother usual ends
went hill last
Since little meal
long way
hunt continues
And pride tries different tack
They heavy brush
hope taking prey
surprise
And heres chance
A herd impala
watering place
Now pride problem tactics
This species antelope is perhaps
difficult catch
They decide direct attack
shock sudden appearance
effect
Now lioness own
The trick panic impala
try cut
run by
Heres game speed wits
good portion luck thrown in
Of hardships nature imposes
African creatures
theres severe
annual drought
The dry season affects all
largest smallest
Even native catfish
hardpressed water
diminishing pools
dry one
The drinking places remain
constant use
And trails water
deepgrooved
parched plain
The elephants meet emergency
amazing display memory
They return place
river ran
dig wells
dry riverbeds
They able scent moisture
its underground
Suddenly like great fans
elephants ears stand
catch distant sound
In spite natural caution
moves it
trunk raised test air
Its strange sound
doesnt recognize
its unlike hes heard
He follows source
And
remaining mud hole
comes desperate drama
A rhinoceros trapped
churnedup mud
Completely frustrated
beats head ground
cries help
Another rhino drinks
takes passing
strange dilemma

time dinosaurs
fossil making
This exactly great beasts
past caught
remains preserved
Here water hole
trap awaits comers
But lucky
They tempt fate walk away
In growing panic
trapped rhino
renews frantic exertions
But tons lot
its bogged like this
His wild groans attract baboons
These intelligent creatures least
willing study problem
moment
One fact
tries think helpful
But end
baboons nothing
The elephant too
come drink
And finally finds rhinos agony
upsetting panics
And like lesser creatures
mighty elephant runs away
And rhino face
strange destiny
deserted nature herself
Beneath tropical sun heated air
plain rises spiral columns
And now
whirlwinds called dust devils
dance scorched earth
But prelude
Soon dust storms begin
And now mass migration begins
Now herds leave
parched country
look new water hole
reach
blistering heat
Beset thirst heat hunger
must somehow
outwalk outlast drought
The lions trek too
hunter hunted march together
driven common enemy thirst
Before long ordeal takes
quality nightmare
silent giraffes
stalk land desolation
like ghost figures dream
The fierce African sun casts fiery pall
scene
Desperately elephants search
winds moisture none
Day day
burning disk circles sky
theres relief
Nature seem
mercy
Yet Africa
real ruthless Africa
survival
able endure hardship
For weeks end trek continues
eventually
herds reach new pasture
And yet
grass water isnt enough
plodding on
looking drinking place
doesnt exist
In aimless travels
animals lose
instinctive sense direction
The migration swings great circle
And aware
mistake
marching regiments turn
direction
theyve come
They head
dust storm again
looks like dust cloud
swarm locusts
buzzing mass ravenous insects
come scourge plain
Like stormdriven cattle
wildebeest plan
purpose blinding blizzard
This unchecked tide
numbs senses
Interrupted meal
lioness watches
stupefied uncomprehending
The locust species grasshopper
He eats natural pasture
Individually consumes
single blades grass
descends
living carpet
millions devastate land
Heres threat grazing herds
grass destroyed
future dark
Yet famine
feast another
Now storks descend scene
Still thousand storks
thousand thousand storks
begin control plague
These millions shimmering wings
actually filter light day
Soon ominous glow
settles land
In natures plan however
uncontrolled calamity
unchallenged
Although locusts devour
living blade grass
denude earth
bare rocks
nature restore world
bring new life
This tropical rains
These seasonal showers
fountain life
renewing rebuilding
refreshing
creature countryside alike
Now grazing herds
good water good grass again
But affects affect all
Yet like animals
lions accept
nature brings
And rains fall
ancient land
surely sun
follow storm
And seasons turn cycle
And again
lion surveys great plain
subjects roam far wide
endless reaches
Zebra wildebeest
hartebeest kudu
Sable antelope warthog
ostrich rhino
Hippo elephant giraffe baboon
Impala hyena wild dog jackal
All pay homage
African lion
With story told
TrueLife Adventure

And long silent sentinel
