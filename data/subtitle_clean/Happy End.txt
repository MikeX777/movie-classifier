Now I dont damn
Shoolywoc shoo wa
Dont need Joe Sal Bruce
Lee
Willis
I said Sparkle
And Im
That thats I
In kind way
I shine like star
On street
And way
I said Im getting paid Jack
Now I dont need man
To ahead life
Cause I dont want
Some pencil pushers little wife
Im writing book
And Im turning page
What
A constellation stage
Sparkle
Dont bless kiss
Shoolywoc shoo wa
Just close eyes
And watch live far away
Shoolywoc
Hearts
Shoolywoc
Dressed dream
Shoolywoc
Lose grieve
Shoolywoc
Far apart
Shoolywoc
Still breathe
Shoo wa
‎ ‎I dream I try‎
I feel I
When things wont work
When life lie
Empty promises
I dream
And think
Close eyes
And dream
With
I dream I fly
I touch sky
When I fall
When ones
To pick
I dream
And think
Close eyes
And dream
With
But lifes complete
With share
Though heart
Of hope
