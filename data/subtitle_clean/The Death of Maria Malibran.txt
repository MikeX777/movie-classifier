Every day
lovely daughter Sultan
took walk evening

pale waters play
Daily stood youthful slave

pale waters play
Daily grew pale paler
Then evening came
princess him
speaking rapid words
Tell is
come from clan
And slave spoke

I come Yemen

And clan Asra

The mad woman comes prancing
vaguely remembering
past
The children mock stone
blackbird
She raises stick
threatens pursue
goes way
On way loses shoe
notice
Long spider legs
neck
hair
Her visage
human features
suddenly
bursts laughing
Iike hyena
She mumbles
scraps phrases
sense of
try
Her skirt
holes
jerks scrawny
dirtspattered legs
She goes way
borne away like poplar leaf
She
youth
hopes happiness
looks
mist mind
shattered turmoil
unarmed powers
Her gracefulness gone
beauty
Her gait crude
breath reeks brandy
If people happy earth
astonish us
The mad woman
reproaches one
She proud
complain
die
revealing secret
interested her
But forbidden
address word her
The children pursue stone
blackbird
She dropped roll paper
bosom
A stranger picks up
Iocks night
reads manuscript
runs follows
But
I love
eyes filled
bitter tears
Let


late
Your longing
means me
The apparition vanishes
I seek laws
When embrace
I experience humility
bear pain
esteem me
She dead
Maria
I implore you God Love
arms
A sailor dressed white
walked road
rolling gait
seaman
I looked
knowing why
He younger

handsome fairer
And manliness
evident
I felt
moments pang
Our paths crossed
seen
telltale flicker eyes
cast knowing
inviting glance
Such glance probably cast
carefully madeup
habitués cafés
If glance
lasted second
words surely
spoken
Iike usual thing
Hey baby dont I know you
My face glowed
heart mouth
I hurried
tried stare me
He caught unawares
moment

thought him
letter pocket
Helmut
As I crossed street
I wondered
seen me
I longer young
believe
walk way I held hands
attracted him
No
else
I dared
look eye
For
like looking dazzling sun
Something I dared
look eye
For
like looking dazzling sun
It half past
hoped
home ten
It presumptuous
act sure
knowing future
It presumptuous
act sure
knowing future
Might unforeseen obstacle
bar path
And circumstances
extraordinary
dared interpret
exception
Why consider
abnormal fact
far able
feel free unease
happy
speak
Indeed
right
reach home unharmed

watched followed
future prey
I long much
I long much
This means death me
This means death me
Judgments people
valuable
people themselves
If I allow people
despise

God you

Where bound
For Eisenstadt
Then
company
I think young man

meeting needs
ply needle
To bind tread
firm footwear
noblest task

But belief

Clothing naked senseless
I know tread

For part I shall obtain bread
hamlet
The way short We shall
reach destination dusk
I afraid Hugo
You regret it
If
bright blue eyes
I

I pluck eye
Where we
In place
finally rest
There alder pond
A blue flower grows roots
Whoever makes potion
gives sick man
soon whole
You know things science
greater help many
In capital theyre dying drought
fools
Yet water
But how
 Before east gate stands beech
A white horse browses leaves
Ride horse
thrice market place
sparks fly
And you
All blind

washed eyes
mornings dew
I

If eyes
I dont know you
I before
I singer
You too
Im singer too
Im singer too
Perhaps shall meet again
IN THE YEAR 1814
When foot slides frog
feel disgust
But run finger
lightly human body
skin finger crack
like scales slab mica
shattered hammer
And like heart shark
hour dead
beats
bridge tenaciously
Thus innards writhe
long touched
fibers
So great horror
inspired man
fellow man
So great horror
inspired man
fellow man
The ancient temple Denderah
Iies half hours
left bank Nile
Today
countless multitudes wasps
invaded waters roads
banks
They swarm columns
Iike dense waves
black head hair
The inhabitants
cold aisle
guard
entrance forecourts
inherited right
I compare buzzing
metallic wings
ceaseless grinding
ice floes
clash ice thaw
Arctic seas
But I think
behavior him
providence granted
throne earth
wingtips pain
resound louder buzzing
But dead
Maria
dead
dead dead
dead
