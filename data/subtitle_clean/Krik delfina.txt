The warheads split up

Thats nuclear attack looks like
But dont worry its war
We showed underwater tests

If crew sea time
wont need leper colony
wont disinfect
defenses remain stable
But people suffering
They military people Professor
Monstrous
Where democracy
I request permission seat
Be seated Major

Either island ocean
The leadership humanitarian
principles proposes
consideration following options
One proceed North
