 Darwin One summer
years ago
I observed boy playing
guitar Central Park
Shirtless bare
foot grass
singing songs
doomed hopeless love
I saw moment
I fell completely love
For years body

narratives evolved
life share
love make
I imagined
Seth character

artistic aspirations
selfhating closet
case chases women
far beautiful him
But
draft began circulate
I started
getting feedback
I realized
badly Seths story
needed fit modern times
And way thinking
gay
coming
terribly dated
As I talking
pen rod
culture
changed
difficult
imagine
character world
white middle class
At tender age
43 I felt like relic
A museum piece bygone
era act queer nation
There time when uh
gay mens social calendar
replete
funerals things
My times changed
Clearly I needed
new paradigm
In African American
men I
perfect models geared
precise purpose
The characters
fragments
splinters
young man I
refitted culturally
And American Personae

generations
gay men different
worlds inhabit
tale
young men

Just like that
pages turning
 Darwin These
characters notes
I I
revising script
The portrayal Celia
approached cautiously
It easy
play
onedimensional
manipulative harpy
This young lady
lot bad luck men
In Isaiah sees
lot potential
possibilities
himself
She merely wants bring
best him And on
The conflict
Isaiahs attracted men
dirty little secret
cant admit himself no
The problem desire
ordinary middle class life
Where Celia wants
else
bohemian existence
creative fulfillment
 Celia Heres you
Eric Lead role
Male Early twenties
Selfrighteous sharp
witted intellectual
Skinny hipster music geek
dark side Oh
I like already
This role requires
broad emotional range
characters deeply insecure
prone turns
extreme aggression
Student film
day shoot
plus days
intensive rehearsal
Must New York City based
 Im
student films
 They great
networking opportunity
 Theyre worth
humiliation
cost head shot
Besides Im going
busy semester
 You drive nuts
 What
 You role
audition for
dont seriously
 I seriously
know
I
percent
And right now I
dont think I can
 Let ask question
Where
years
 Celia youre starting
sound like parents
 Its simple question
yourself
 Realistically
I guess teaching
English high school
 And acting
 I suppose Ill
involved theater
department maybe
community theater
 Youre gonna try
acting career
 Celia odds
making
making living
actor pretty slim
 Thats defeatist
 Its defeatist
its fact
They want runway
models big pecs
I mean look me Im
exactly Ashton Kutcher
 Youre gonna try
Isaiah thats point
 Are getting angry me
 No Im frustrated
 I that why
 Because
talent I know
Its easy
dont
seriously
You dont care
 Come on Celia
 It pisses off
 Dont like that I hate
angry me
 Im sorry Three months
in Im nagging
 Oh want
auditions dont you
 I want
ambition
 Uh auditions
Ill auditions
 Three And I
choose them
 Isaiah Dont stop
 So question
remains theater
entertaining
instructive
How divorced
place illusion
transformed
place active experience
Nonmelodramatic theater
kind theater

specific social goals
It forces spectator
place inquiry criticism
perching
theater
magical completely
stripping
called
hypnotic tensions
The actor longer pretends
theres fourth wall
audience
longer swept
away sees stage
I lot
looking
rolling
eyes saying
nut case
Well Im director
thing I
want
director
need want here
This going
challenging
growing experience
us
youre gonna trust me
