RAUL HILBERG
Did
ghetto
Seldom When I
visit Czerniakow
What
conditions like
Awful Yes appalling
Yes
I went
I saw like
Unless I to
In period
I think I went
twice
We Commission
tried
maintain ghetto
labor force
especially prevent
epidemic like typhus
That big danger
Yes
Yes
Can tell
typhus
Im doctor
I know typhus
dangerous
epidemic
wipes people
like plague
cant
confined ghetto
If typhus broken out
I dont think did
fear
might
Poles
Germans
Why typhus
ghetto
I dont know was
danger
famine
People didnt
eat
Thats awful
We Commission
best feed
ghetto
wouldnt
incubator epidemics
Aside humanitarian
factors thats mattered
If typhus broken out
didnt
wouldnt stopped
ghetto
Czerniakow wrote
That reasons
ghetto walled

German fear
Yes absolutely
Fear typhus
He says Germans
associated Jews typhus
Maybe Im sure
grounds it
But imagine mass
people
packed ghetto
There werent
Warsaw Jews
came later
The danger kept
growing
The Germans policy
Warsaw ghetto
What policy
Youre asking
I know
The policy wound
extermination
Final Solution
knew it
Our job
maintain ghetto
try preserve
Jews work force
The Commissions goal
fact
different
later
led extermination
Yes know
people died
ghetto
month 1941
I dont know now
I knew it
But know
There exact figures
I probably knew
Yes 5000 month
5000 month Yes well
Thats lot
Thats lot course
But
far people
ghetto That it
Far many
Far many
My question philosophical
What ghetto mean
opinion
Historys ghettos
going centuries
I know
Persecution Jews
wasnt German invention
didnt start
World War II
The Poles persecuted
too
But ghetto like Warsaws
great capital
heart city
unusual
You wanted
maintain ghetto
Our mission wasnt
annihilate ghetto
alive
maintain it
What alive
mean
That problem
That problem
But people dying
streets
There bodies everywhere
Yes
That paradox
You paradox
Im sure it
Why Can explain
No
Why not
Explain what
But fact is
Jews exterminated
daily ghetto
Czerniakow wrote
To maintain properly
wed needed
substantial rations
crowding
Why werent rations
humane
Why werent they
That German
decision no
There real decision
starve ghetto
The big decision
exterminate came later
Thats right later
In 1942
Precisely
3 years later
Just so Our mission
I recall it
manage ghetto
and naturally
inadequate rations
overcrowding
high excessive
death rate inevitable
Yes
What maintain
ghetto mean condition
food sanitation etc
What Jews
measures
They couldnt anything
The Final Solution Conference
held
BELZEC  Site
extermination camp
Why Czerniakow
commit suicide
Because realized
future
ghetto
He probably saw I
Jews killed
I suppose Jews

excellent
secret services
They informed
better were
Think so
Yes I do
The Jews knew you
Im convinced it
Its hard believe
The German administration
informed
happened
Jews
When
deportation Treblinka
Before Auerswalds suicide
I think
Auerswalds
I mean Czerniakows Sorry
July 22
Those dates
So deportations began
July 22 1942
Yes
To Treblinka
And Czerniakow killed
July 23
Yes is
The day
The day So it
hed realized
idea
It idea I think
working good faith
Germans
Jews best interests
Hed realized idea
dream destroyed
That idea dream
Yes And
dream faded
took logical way out
Did think idea
ghetto good one
A sort selfmanagement
right
Thats right
A miniState
It worked well
But selfmanagement
death no
We know now
But time
Even then
No
Czerniakow wrote
Were puppets
power
Yes
No power
Sure was
You Germans
overlords
Yes
The overlords The masters
Obviously
Czerniakow merely tool
Yes good tool
Jewish selfmanagement
worked well I tell you
It worked 3 years
1941 1942 1943 212
years end
In end
Worked well what
To end
For selfpreservation
No For death
Yes but
Selfmanagement
selfpreservation
Thats easy now
You admitted conditions
inhuman
Atrocious horrible
Yes
So clear then
No Extermination
wasnt clear
Now result
Extermination isnt
simple One step taken
another another
another
Yes
But understand
process must
I repeat Extermination
place
ghetto first
Only evacuations
Evacuations
The evacuations
Treblinka
The ghetto
