 Tell democracy
looks like
This
democracy looks like
 Tell
democracy looks like
This
democracy looks like
 Tell
democracy looks like
This
democracy looks like
 I generally frustrated
way people
sucked theater
actual trial
The trial kind represents
little bit justice
people want
Its
justice
ask for
But biggest deterrent
abuse power know
If officer knows
sent jail
severe
consequences
department
knows that
theyre gonna behave
differently
Unfortunately
people miss point
importance studying
condition people
purpose
folks discovered
learned
condition
step further
Leaders
Beautiful Struggle
LBS short
founded 2010
Many
highschool
college policy debaters
So wanted
form organization
public policy
arm community
 The strength power
organizing work
were
thinking future
passing
young folks
So people like Kwame
Makayla emboldened
achieve
achieve

decided
pass kind knowledge
passion them
And its view
thats need
empower black people
city
pass knowledge
wisdom skills

future
 So were trying
reform whats called
Law Enforcement Officer
Bill Rights
codified
1974
Basically
gives police officers
Maryland protections

constitutional rights
Give couple examples
So lets police officer
alleged
engaged
excessive force
fatally
beat somebody up
Theres trial board
determines
fired not
suspended
That trial board
police officers
Right
So elements
try change

nonpolice officer
trial board
If someones investigating
incident
sworn law enforcement
interrogate
police officer
Our opposition FOP
Fraternal Order Police
union represents
supports police
And FOP
amendments
nonstarters
 How feel
climate
Baltimore right now
 I feel like everybodys
holding breath

trial started
It didnt end cathartic
moment needed
A mistrial dont know

that emotionally
Can I read essay now
Does work
 Yeah read
Im decorating
So question is
Discuss accomplishment
or event formal informal
marked transition
from childhood adulthood
culture
community family
With breaths
Earth
I deluded innocence
and purity
childhood
Even despite mothers
strenuous effort
to protect sisters
from cruelty us
despite strength
resilience
that inherited her
despite beautiful
memories
 Okay wait wait wait
This essay sounds like
were
 Can I the
You didnt listen
rest essay
 Can I finish speaking
 Oh God
 It sounds like were
fighting
life
 Mom
 Makayla sounds like
fighting
life
like born
struggle
didnt
childhood
 Can listen
sentence
 No had
very good childhood
 Mom didnt listen
rest sentence
 You sheltered okay
 Despite success
creating facade safety
us
 Facade safety
Really Facade safety
 Yes Mom
 Well okay

 Can let finish
sentence
 Go ahead
 Oh God
Despite strength
resilience
that inherited her
despite beautiful
memories crafted us
there remain
unflinching reminders
bodies fungibility
 Its written
essay
 But
 It sounds like born
struggle
didnt
good childhood
didnt live
I dont like tone it
doesnt
its not its
reality
And I think
I mean I

good year all
You roll eyes
want
 I didnt roll eyes
 It
good year all
cause I grow increasingly
frustrated
you grow
frustrated me
 I think ways
protest
counterproductive

specific policy items
play
And its important that
thats case
people conscious
time energy
cost
 So were gonna take
I think its
15 neighborhoods
 In opinion
smarter
everybody
in like Inner Harbor
 They lock people
disrupting
white folks
commercial activity
especially New Years Eve
 The police aint gonna
police aint
gonna attack people
New Years Eve
 You dont think police
going attack people
Stop there
 Thats I meant
So positive
 And youre giving
reason
 No
positive people
theyre gonna stand up
 Positive
 Whats positive
Black Lives Matter
isnt positive
Marching fist
isnt positive them
 It positive me
 To them its positive
 But young people
 So Kwame

somethings got done
 Here let this
Were numbered
 This graze wound

 On arm
 On arm
 Well
murders year
Its nightmare
dealing all
So youre basically
sitting here
waiting body drop
 Well second trial
death Freddie Gray
set begin week
Edward Nero
unlike Officer William Porter
charged misdemeanors
 Theres new push
police accountability
Maryland
 Yeah police
accountability making
way chambers
Capitol
 There elements
police
accountability
sides agreed on
theres agreement
civilian
trial board proposal
 When started
work
Law Enforcement
Officers Bill Rights
central parts
felt
important change
civilian participation
trial boards
These boards
determine discipline
police officers accused
wrongdoing
that
exclusively
law enforcement served
boards
I think success
weve able
drive conversation
issue
civilians trial board
central issue
 We today

brothers sisters
Baltimore
rose
insurrectionary mode
challenge
police department there
That uprising finally
got consider
maybe
legislative initiatives
 I got disagree
transparency point
I mean I dont think
giving
law enforcement officer
days
story together
gather information
gather facts transparent
 If committed
committed crime
sit say
Im saying anything
 But officer
right

Fifth Amendment right
says no
say
Hey I want lawyer
like citizen
But difference is
citizen going
walk out
If think
probable cause
hes gonna walk
police station
The officer is
 Yeah well you
 Thats difference
 Now thing is
thats extremely
broad stroke again
youre talking
cases
officer
accused something
 So we Im retired
homicide detective
 Yeah right yeah yeah
 You cant run games
me
 Law Enforcement Officers
Bill Rights state
protects officers
fail protect us
creating barriers gaining
access information
prohibiting interrogation
Even somebodys blood
painted
pavement
officer caught redhanded
demanded
statement

God created heavens
Earth less
 There problem
LEOBR works

different set rules
 We know
cant honestly
community policing
dont
community members
havehave ability

communitypolice relations
Were talking ability
civilians toto work
collaboratively
equal playing field
industry
law enforcement
And citizens right
able
substantive
nature
law enforcements administered
communities
 We dont need that
 Were opposed citizens
