But Death defeated
Oh  hurt deep strife
I know unfamiliar faces come
With charity relief torment
All lie
A lie lament
Today heart
Is
Like dogs prey
The treacherous spirits
Watching loved
Galloped
And hidden luster
Of good glance
The crouching Death
Was marking tempo
In vain I encouraged
Feverishly hope
That pierce raw flesh
With claws pain
And street
In frenzied uproar
The carnival world
Was laughing enjoying
Making fun fate
Which robbed love
All wings
So cruelly burned life
All sinister
Grimace fate
I wanted embrace
But Death defeated
Oh I hurt deep strife
I know unfamiliar faces come
With charity relief torment
All lie
A lie lament
Today heart
Is
May soul Heron rest peace
May Lord release pain
rest
 Rest peace
 Amen
