Dont tread path
If want walk path
learn lonely hungry

Technique merely medium
express inner life
Technique taught
Truth cannot
For that strength
look inwards unflinching honesty
This extremely difficult
It lifelong quest
That Asceticism
And eventually
encounter Truth
takes great courage face it
Because Truth ugly
Unless awareness
seeps music…
