suspenseful music

ominous music

 I think people
fascinated shark movies
reasons
One shark
natural monster
But its fact
its water
ocean
And I think ocean
great psychological effects
 When diving
moment ocean
head
world
underneath you
down
moment dive
kind
going crazy
like what fuck
there world
 The seafloor
8000 feet down
And were thousands miles
anywhere
And water
And look you
its dark everywhere
And mind starts
things
Whats sight
there
And whats gonna you

 Thats appeal
horror movies water
That appeal
The Creature
From Black Lagoon
famous scene
shes swimming
creatures swimming
her
doesnt know it
And touches leg
doesnt know
is
 Its great kind
fears dramatic things
water
grabs you
I mean beginning
Jaws says all
woman gasping
soft music

 I define
sharksploitation
genre film
frankly kind
media portrayal
thats idea
meta shark
constructing
horrific monstrous image
shark
loosely based
actual reality
Its idea
sort stretch truth
merge fact fiction
 The classic
exploitation movies
TA movies gore movies
theres kinds
exploitation
Sharksploitation subgenre
capitalizes
popularity shark mania
 Its rare
world go
We like this
Were interested this
And that
its gotta exploited
 And I think
sharksploitation
exploiting Jaws
And thats died
People
today
matter crazy
premises get
gunshot
 For these like
sharksploitation movies
I title
Im like
fuck gonna be
laughs
You know youre gonna
youve seen
Like Sharktopus
Ive gotta
sharktopus look like
Ive gotta
magical abilities are
Ive gotta
its gonna kill people
 It
sharksploitation movie
screams
Get water
 Get water
Everybody
water
 Get water
right now
 When I think
sharksploitation
I think sharks defy
laws physics
And thing
sharksploitation doing
its exploiting
peoples fear
eaten
cant see
 I think theres
inbuilt fascination
with like
highlyevolved
deadly predator
probably cant beat
fight
We cant outswim it
 Were frail
We dont fins
We cant stay underwater
long
Were fucked chuckles
Were shit luck man
With stuff know
naked water
shark man
were trouble
So theres
reminds
frail are
vulnerable are
And ignites

adrenaline level
makes feel alive
 Come water
 When I saw Jaws
completely blew mind
that oh God wait
water
 I sweet spot age
came
parents
wouldnt let it
So night cousins
snuck saw it
And terrified me
And parents right
 If I went bathtub
I couldnt
bubbles
likely
shark there
And I couldnt bath
night
 I mean theater
I felt like
shark gonna come
theater seat
me
I wanted
feet seat
Thats terrified I was
 That shot
ocean
floating there
immediately feel
camera
watching her
And idea
distance
it
pure thalassophobia
 A lot fear
kind oceanic monster
comes idea
thalassophobia
real phobia
exists
people threatened
scared
large bodies water
So
like shark come in
contributes
fear
woman screaming
 It people
afraid water
And thats I think
reason
Jaws big
Its elemental fear
people
centuries I guess
And movie

central theme movie
kind exploit
fear
Because everybody goes
swimming point
And its taking activity

showing know
potential dark
horrible thing
happen you
 Suddenly society developed
massive fear sharks
And idea
psychology infused
entire generation
persisting
think
scared
were standing
3 feet water shore
its Jaws
What scared of Sharks
And thats
foremost
And exist
degree
prior Jaws
 This year
Ive come beach
And people
upset
And theyre concerned
waters
A lot people
talk them
You say
Well water
And say No
Just water beautiful
looks nice
But know hey
theres sharks there
 I knew child
I dreamed
maniac
attack
cut head
unreasonable thing
couldnt discuss with
couldnt argue with
And I sort thought
people
react sharks way
 In shark craze
gripped America
Peter Benchley began
added to
search objectivity
sharks
pretty discouraging
enterprise
 When compare to like
subgenres movies
like killer dog
like Cujo example
didnt stop people
buying dogs
But Jaws stopped people
getting boats
going water
going pool
going bathtub
People lived Iowa
didnt want
lake
near house
It like
phenomenon
 And movies
changed movies
 We making
lowbudget
sciencefiction pictures

underwater pictures
And Jaws came out
The New York Times wrote
What Jaws
bigbudget
Roger Corman film
He right
half said
It bigbudget
Roger Corman film
But better
It bigger better
And I thoughtand I talked
friends
major studios caught
weve doing
trouble
But I one
There genre

underwater monster films
But
lowbudget films
 Many adventure movies
1920s 1930s
took place sea
A good example
The Sea Bat 1930
giant manta ray
attacks sponge fishers
near West Indies
But reason sharks
considered dangerous
 Back days
way way
start humanity
people thought sharks like
mysterical creature
especially
small island
Pacific Ocean
 Anyone lived
coastal area
saw creatures
real life
wed tell stories
things
So mythology folklore
different places
Caribbean
Pacific
Africa stories
sharks
And oftentimes
sharks
malevolent benevolent
Theyre between
There cases
sharks actually
seen ancestral spirits
actually helpful
And folklore
stories sharks
actually
help people ocean
attack them
 In Greece actually
worshipped sharks
shark god
But then shark
god wasnt evil god
They didnt punish people
Very shark movie
Tabu 1931
shark godlike
It shark
protected area
water
They actually
rubber shark
But also movies like
She Gods Shark Reef
OmooOmoo The Shark God
actually portrayed shark
god
 And belief
power shark god
 You
statue shark
You movies
like Tiger Shark
youd everyday
life fishermen
Youd hard
shark
big lives
villain
animal
deal with
And actually respected
animal
 Now movies
sharks them
theyre
movies sharks
 It mainly
individual scenes sharks
 Cause youre looking
like Im
 There
specific examples today
modern period
 Shark head
This mission cursed
 Its cursed
 Shark head
 With DC Suicide Squad
idea halfhuman
halfshark
popular
But roots
mythology
important
people
Theres really
I think profound
deeply saddening scene
CGI character
hes standing
aquarium
forlornly looking
ocean creatures
And initially youre thinking
course obvious metaphor
right doesnt feel
like human world
He misses
ocean world
And tank breaks

sea creatures
start attacking him
It quick
interesting
metaphor fitting
world
 A king shark
 Bullshit
 What fuck
 Some people claim
Nanaue descendant
ancient shark god
Whatever case
hes strong deadly
 An interesting example
sharks mythology
story Nanaue
comes
Hawaiian Islands
So theres king
sharks
And king shark
shapeshift sees
beautiful woman decides
shapeshift human man
sort pursue her
They affair
And child
boy demigod
And hes born mouth
shark back
And Nanaue eventually
killed threat
poses
people
But Nanaue
important figure
Hawaiian indigenous lore
association
king sharks
And like
interesting story me
I think its fascinating
Europeans
cinematographers
20th 21st century
started thinking
shark monsters
instead going
folklore
looked real shark
again
And James Bond contribute
idea sharks
monstrous
associating
villains
James Bond films
 Gently friend Gently
 I got interested shark
movies I young kid
It actually Jaws
Jaws movie
It Jaws character
The Spy Who Loved Me
You know big guy
steel teeth
 And Jaws kill people
gigantic body
hands gun knife
He
bite neck
And bites shark
end
 In stuff like
Live Let Die
Thunderball
James encountering
know
shark ocean
goes directly him
know
fight off
But commonly I think
interestingly
sharks
form execution
knowledge

occurred
But
pits sharks
villains
cruelly
throwing people
shark pits
And theyre
instantly devoured
And theres plumes blood
everywhere
 The villain Thunderball
kept sharks pool
island compound
 With sharks less
 Both way
dispose enemies
security measure

signifier evil
In
Despicable Me movie
sharks pool too
sort homage that
 Quiet down fish
 And know
Austin Powers
Dr Evil wants sharks
frickin laser beams
heads
 Sharks laser beams
attached heads
 The villain sharks
The Phantom
 Batman
movie 60s
theres famous scene
Batman
struggling shark
Hes hanging
beneath helicopter
shark attacks him
Its obviously
rubber shark
And reason
its moving
Batman
moving leg
And hes reaching
helicopter
And Robins sitting
hes asking
shark repellent bat spray
And starts spraying
shark
its releasing
rubber teeth
And its dropping down
Thats awesome scene
 An exploding shark
pulling leg
 The Joker
 It adds
sinister riddle
Riddleer
Riddler
 Oh thought strikes me
 So sharks associated
kept pets
controlled humans
specifically
controlled villains
So its doubling
idea
sharks
inherently bad
evil theyre
evil way
humans which
course begs question
real monsters
situation
 PreJaws
sharksploitation genre
But
treasurehunting genre
And lot involved
shark
treasure
sunken ship sort
underwater area
needed
retrieve
treasure
 If
interesting
treasure hunt movies
shark movies
movie called Shark
big actor
Burt Reynolds
But interesting story
movie
actually unfortunate
death stuntmen

movie
real sharks
And unfortunately
stuntmen
got close
sharks
actually died
 They shooting
area netted off
shark broke
netting right shot
killed stuntman
right camera
So bad enough
But producers actually
included footage
Joses death film
They immediately started
publicizing stuntman
killed making
film garner publicity
They sold story
Life Magazine
They eventually changed
movie
Caine Shark
Then Jaws came out
rereleased movie
capitalize
changed title
ManEater
And dark
term exploitation
 When think movie
like Blue Water White Death
villainize
lot did
But time
I think like
us time
And lot
real thought
very
dangerous villainous animals
 Were looking animal
I think considered

dangerous predator
living world
great white shark
attacks the
 Blue Water White Death
know
I missed
came out
But aalmost like
Dead Sea Scroll
something
Those knew ocean
knew sharks
saw it went wow
Thats good
 Before film
theres shot
great white underwater
And Ron Taylor taken
And was
I 24 years old
I totally enamored
idea this
And I met Peter Gimbel
Stan Waterman
Jim Lipscomb I knew well
He great friend ours
And
Ron Valerie Taylor
And guys
great delight

afraid sense
unknown
Didnt know
gonna happen
Peter Gimbel invented
cages
And allowed
film underwater
And radical
time
And filmed
night underwater
scariest thing
world
It real real danger
there know
And decided
swim sharks
things
decided
theyd bang sticks
And person filming
person

looking sharks
trying to
goggles
like this
youve got
peripheral vision
Whats happening there
Whats happening there
And sharks come up
And
lot times
ocean tip white tips
come
bang like this
know
luckily instead biting
know
 In filming
Blue Water White Death
filmmakers kill
shark
scared
boom stick
use it
And I mention movie
light
darker parts
people
things
like dominoes
 The 18th century
start
negative illustrations
paintings
sharks attacking people
At first
usually sharks following
alongside slave ships
And 19th century
increase
print culture start
seeing shark attack
encounters
reported well
cabin boy
fell ship
Cuba leg
bitten shark
which course
newspapers latched to
And inspired
American painter
famous painting
called Watson Shark
depicts exaggerated
account that
And Watson Shark
I think
started
negative depictions
continued
history
 In real world

major events
actually transformed
publics view sharks
You event 1916
New Jersey
actually
bull sharks swam river
attacked I guess
water swimming
And time 1916
didnt
television
You radio
newspapers
story
shark attack
traveled slowly steadily
America
And people totally afraid
sharks
You tourists
running away
beaches
saw
stories newspapers
 So start seeing
page newspapers
photos sharks
and like maneater
So maneater
associated shark
time
Thats
world
On globe
Australia getting
surfing
So course people
attacked
bitten sharks
Australia
So circulated
globe
idea maneater
plus real shark attacks
demonization
creation
monster shark
started
prevalent
 And
Second World War
warship
USS Indianapolis
The ship carrying
atomic bomb
went Japan
ending
Second World War
And way back
Japanese submarine
sank big warship
 Here Captain McVay
bringing secret cargo
Intercepted Japanese sub
sunk
So 1200 men water
300 survive
And them
them fact
die shark attacks
 Woody James
survivors
Indianapolis
And I got ask him
I said feel
time saw Jaws
Because
time anybody
heard that
And survivors
And said
stunned
guys
generation
didnt talk
things
No one families
kids
knew
went through
They kept quiet
buried trauma
 Peter ideas
novels
But liked best
came reading
article
giant
great white shark
 In 1964 long
drama happened
I read story
New York Daily News
fisherman
caught
4550pound great white shark
beaches Long Island
And I thought God
happen
things came
resort community
wouldnt away
 Peter wrote Jaws
It fiction based fact
I remember say
So
happened
happen idea
shark
idea it
 At time Peter
research book
lot
research
But theory called
rogue shark theory
And
shark tasted human flesh
hang
wanted human flesh
Peter believe
theory
 Now shark
swims alone
 Rogue
 Whats called
 Rogue rogue
 Yeah
Now guy
keeps swimming
place
feeding good
food supply gone
right
 Its called territoriality
Its theory
I happen agree with
 The rogue shark theory
nonsense
The idea
shark develops
taste human blood
evil
way
save beach
track
specific individual shark
kill it
theory inspired
lot
shark control measures
world
doesnt work

identify specific
individual shark
responsible given bite
certainly
cannot
couldnt it
And efforts it
kill
bunch sharks
youre saying
ones involved
 Stephen went
rogue shark theory
And sure
powerful movie
 The books singular gimmick

sharks point view
was know
first
monster know
character
 This shark
built Jaws 1
And built guy
named Joe Alves
He Universals
resident visual effect
special effects guys
Because difference
Special effects practical
visual effects post
Jaws
visual effects scale

kind shark things
Computers didnt exist
CG
So built shark
Joe Alves crew
physically built shark
And famously
work well
So reason Jaws
powerful film
 Its actually moments
movie
separate
good is
its clever
filmmaking
 Its probably I
grew 70s watching
know movies
limitations
budget maybe
mechanical issues
limited
times
actually creature
And me thats scarier
 Stephen King said

zipper
monsters back
games over
So real
situation
I think more
easier
people
invested it
 Our focus creating
creature
close
shark
We werent thinking
gonna future
 Summer wasnt
blockbusters then
It
escapist fare know
drivein movies
kind stuff
Thats movie
100 million
And everybody wanted
that
 When movie came out
went crazy
Everything totally changed
shark movies

cinema history
 Movies didnt open
theaters
open now
So I remember waiting
line hours
time saw Jaws
wait
showings come
got in
 At time 1975
idea running
trailer
TV commercial
relatively new
And Jaws lot
And meant
everybody seeing it
It wasnt
pointofcontact ads
movie theater
living room
 I saw ads
place
And stoked
enthusiasm it
The book
bookstore went
supermarket
It inescapable
summer
I think TIME magazine
cover
The cool thing was
couldnt movie
tons tons
merchandise
You know
movies
got seriously marketed
lots tiein stuff
So I Jaws game
 Youre out
Jaws
Its
great white shark
other
From Ideal
 Everybody wore
Jaws Tshirts
Everybody Jaws posters
toys
There parody song
released
40 radio
called Mr Jaws
And I just
pardon expression
ate stuff up
To day scene
scares
fishermans boat
gets capsized
theres
overhead shot
And hes hanging boat
kind
shark come
underneath grab him
 And scene
shark time
Jaws
pop water
Sheriff Brody
floating stalled
That
defining moments
shark movies me
 Run chum
shit
 Thats
gets
time I watch it
Its classic moments
work
matter times
youve seen film
 I remember seeing Jaws
thinking cool
phony shark was
laughing
You know
seeing real things
great cast
great film was
And I got worried
lot people
know sharks went uhoh
So
great villains
A
theyre gonna kill them
And B people gonna
scared them so
exactly happened
 We absolutely thrilled
success
book movie
Jaws
But horrified
people
felt
license
kill shark
could
There shark
tournaments started
kill sharks
 Around time
movie Jaws came out

shark landings
really skyrocketed
specifically time
So specifically shark landings
United States
And
effective idea
people had unfortunately
sharks dangerous
safety issue

actually helping
removing large amounts
sharks time
 Some species
havent recovered
summers
exploitation
 One
sharksploitation films
gates
right Jaws
Mako Jaws Death

William Grefé feature
Its interesting film
use real sharks
And actors
film actually
swimming real sharks
 I later that
I think
sharks
teeth removed
kind dubious
And I dont know
I feel that
But
entertaining movie
Im amused fact
its referred

Mako The Jaws Death
Ive seen
print movie
ad poster
saying
Mako The Jaws Death
And sharks arent makos
There mako sharks
film
 Unfortunately
tales coming
Mako Jaws Death
sharks
treated
filming all
Some killed
actually filming
But whats unusual
films
come postJaws
actually
showing compassion sharks
The movie
man
trying
preserve sharks
telepathically
connected them
But time


filming procedures

shots
damn horrific
 Another shark movie
afraid
killing real sharks
Sharks Treasure
1975
men
underwater treasure hunt
kill sharks
order stay alive
 And trailer
sharks getting killed
getting killed
like getting hit
spears bang sticks
And time
Im like
theyre killing sharks
camera movie
Tintorera
I caught
later on
Thats like combining sharks
sexploitation
You know its lots
naked people know
shark attacks
And thats great example
exploitation finest
woman screaming
dramatic music
 I remember Shark Kill
TV movie
I think
kind Jaws knockoff
market
 They played
like Jaws
its guys
hunt shark
As kid wonder
Jaws was
But clearly wasnt
 And I remember
TV spinoffs
Like Sheriff Lobo encountered
shark
Like Universal
TV series
characters
encounter shark
Jaws
 The Hardy Boys
shark episode
The Bionic Woman
shark episode
Theres called
Matt Houston
shark episode
Sharks everywhere
 There Jabberjaw
know
ScoobyDoo ripoff
talking shark
There Misterjaw

The Pink Panther
And Ill remember
episode
Six Million Dollar Man
fights killer shark
 When hes holding
shark shaking it
its nurse shark

dangerous shark
But theyre showing
shark swimming away
thats sand tiger
Now sand tiger
too
I think youd pretty stupid
grab
thing
nurse shark
 And then course
know
infamous example
jump shark episode
Happy Days
It coined idiom
jumping shark
term means

successful theres
inevitable point
success
begins sour
That moment moment
jumps shark
 There goes
 I mean
Fonzie jumping shark
world going
Yeah its infecting
everything
Even Land Shark SNL
know hear the
Dundun dundun
woman screams
laughter
Its like its bit
Its joke
We know whats going on
There wasevery comedy
shark spoof
the
Bumbum bumbum

 Caddyshack
Baby Ruth bar
One Police Academy
movies
One Clerks movies
 Dunnun dunnun
Salsa shark
Were gonna need bigger boat
 And that
rippled into like
movies like Tremors
others
 It changed
actually introduced
like recipe shark movies
disaster animal movies
animal attack movies
 One kind
unassuming
sharksploitation movies didnt
place water
And Grizzly
 Grizzly uses exact
script Jaws
 It uses lot
filming style
its POVs watching
people distance
It similar tone
it
And actually
marketing campaign
well
like
Jaws land
Like literally states
taken Jaws
 Another kind
Jaws land thing
The Car
You know its basically
predator sorts
know terrorizing town
Universal
 And car
starts riding around
picking people off
And car feels
like Jaws
 In Jaws
Jaws kills kid
little Kintner boy
In Tentacles
theyre gonna outdo Jaws
They kill baby
baby carriage
The tentacle pulls baby
underwater kills baby
 Billy
 Two years Jaws
comes out Orca
This Dino De Laurentiis
making ridiculously
elegantly welldone
exploitation film
 Orca
kind omnipresent
The poster I think

single
Marvel comic book
came
summer 77
So its big event film
know
its obviously
ripping Jaws
 So way
Orca set up
interesting thing
puts audience
orca
getgo
start
killer shark
kind going
water
feeling
killer shark
eat somebody
And think okay
its like Jaws
Were gonna looking
killer sharks
 You think sharks scary
Whats bigger faster
A killer whale
Orca shoots like missile
hits shark
shark goes wham
air
And Orca kills shark
wants to
 Jesus that
 I think
Jaws ripoffs
probably
best crafted
suspenseful music
 Roger Corman
eye trends
And knew 70s
good idea
Jaws ripoffs
 Piranha
reaction Jaws
We felt right
theyve gone us
Weve got raise level
little bit
 How aware
making
Jaws ripoff
I mean its Jaws ripoff
I mean obviously
making movie
wasnt fact

big hit movie
took place
underwater monster
And waswe
alert fact
Jaws ripoff
opening titles movie
heroine playing
Jaws video game
say it
Just forget it We know it
We know its ripoff
You know
We know know
So forget
good time
 We shot Piranha
USC swimming pool
And fake blood
thing another
And sort spread
swimming pool
And SC happy

fungus grow
ate away pool
started eat
literally eat
paint pool
And figure
was
We fly scientists
Sacramento
figure
creature created was
And didnt know
They said
kill
cant let
swimming pool
I mean
better story
movie making
 They brought Piranha
level
well
We couldnt
compete Jaws
got little bit
 And basically
led me
Roger said
know
good pictures me
youll work
again
And led offered
aquatic adventures
Orca 2 Barracuda
I cant remember
aquatic movies came
wake Jaws

tremendous need imitate
big blockbuster
 Alligator definitely
sharksploitation
subgenre well its
straight like saying
water
chase people
Well alligators
Basically time
resort owner politician
mayor claiming
close beaches

The idea having moment

 And baby sharks
 Usually
setup
shark begins
hunting
And somebody
gonna like
Theres there
And person
like
Oh no theres totally

And suddenly
pay attention it
 You close beach
 And
heroic male

 Great White
The Last Shark

notorious ripoffs Jaws
 If
sharksploitation films
kind winking
nodding Jaws
gives it
like outright hug
 The issue Variety
threepage spread
Great White
And poster
Im like well
obviously
Jaws ripoff
And its Italy
And then
I knew Italy like
province movie ripoffs
 Italians ripping
then
Mad Max The Exorcist
Rambo Dawn Dead
and course Jaws
 Universal decided
Great White
copy Jaws
Jaws 2
So
similarities
felt
pretty good case
took legal action
And got cease desist
And couldnt
anymore
And theyI think
confiscated prints
So dead water
 And I read
Im like
Im gonna
thing
And little I know
I wouldnt
video
years years years
And
I finally got it
And I like yeah
case
This movie
ridiculously derivative
Its like
away
place
You James Franciscus
Peter Benton
And Vic Morrow guy
like trying
Robert Shaw accent
Im sure
hes there
 Especially hes
taste human flesh
 And scene scene
ripped
Jaws Jaws 2
They went
conceivable angle
 Bruno Mattei like
You know what
Lets
Cruel Jaws
And blatantly rips
entire scenes
fucks given
 Cruel Jaws steals footage
Jaws 1 Jaws 2
Jaws 3D
The Last Shark

And Aatank
Aatank Bollywood
version Jaws
Actors singing nearly
time film

eaten shark
When shark
finally appear
jaws
gigantic Jaws
And definitely
coming real shark

 If youve seen movie
Back Future Part II
scene future
We main character
played Michael J Fox
Hes standing outside cinema
advertisement
Jaws Part 19
I think its called
This time its
personal I think
It stupid tagline
 So people
sequels
types movies
But want sure
audience knows
sequel gonna
different
more
The sequels gotta
step bit
Or else watch
same
And its title
signals viewer
gonna different
more bigger better
 Jaws 2 comes
tries
little bit different
much
Somewhere lines
feels like
got studio note
of well its sequel
need shark
And its effective
want
lot shots
 We didnt luxury
second film
hiding shark
Everybody knew
shark looked like
But wanted
fearsome creature
And opening sequence

shark time
hes chasing
water skier
panicky boater throws
gasoline
explodes sharks
face burned
kind
calculated say
yes think youve
seen shark
But shark
its like Scarface shark
You know
time hes angry
 That course sparked
know
just thought
safe
water
probably
famous tagline
And its been know
parodied
spun since
But its
associated
franchise
And
things people
remember film
 The second Jaws movie
come right
time Piranha
And reason
Universal
concerned annoyed
Roger putting
ripoff Jaws
year
Jaws 2 coming out
And apparently
threatened injunction
And I discovered later
Spielberg stepped
Universal apparently
seen Piranha
said no dont it
This spoof
This isnt ripoff
ripoff
And basically got away
it I guess phrase
And that I
offered Jaws 3 People 0

combination production
The National Lampoon
Universal Pictures
 I Universal
My nextdoor neighbors
Zanuck Brown
Dick Zanuck David Brown
And he thing said
me Dick I
love

I looking for
John Hughes
I said John Tod
writing script
And I handed

direct picture
 The National Lampoon people
wanted Rrated
comedy like Animal House
And conservative
Zanuck Brown team
wanted PG
wide release
family picture
 First all
Bo Derek nude
waist
of
good deal picture
And secondly thats
made Rrated movies
The National Lampoon
PG movies
 I guess
wiser heads prevailed
And I think was know
Sid Sheinberg
maybe Lew Wasserman
certainly Spielberg
They said
want take know
great franchise mock it
 I think project died

couldnt agree movie
making
And cant movie
entities
powerful The Lampoon
time
Zanuck Brown
fighting
constantly
entire movie
Its bad idea
And I think
pulled plug
 So choose
Spielberg
And I suspect
right choice
 They gonna
Jaws 3 People 0
So Verna said
Go talk Landsburg
They came back
I got directing job
And got excited
3D Jaws movie
And it
Then thats
problem started
 Because 3D
awful
awful lot complicated
technical requirements
filming
There wasnt I
write new props
new scenery
new action

storyboarded
carefully 3D
requirements
 Let tell
3D
Heres screen proportion
Were taking 35 millimeter
So
screen proportion
Now snake
slide
right audience
But thing
called dorsal fin
And soon dorsal fin
hits pickup
stops
So damn dorsal fin
kills 3D
I head
little bit
I couldnt
audience
Oh I kids
There things park
I octopus thing goes
things out
And course studio
throw stuff out
Wasnt concept
My concept 3D
depth
But no no no
gotta throw stuff out
 I remember
beginning like
expect its 3D Jaws
theyre gonna open
great
And big 3D effect
fish head floating
face
 For me Jaws 3
Jaws
exploitation movie
Its Jaws literally
jumps shark
Because trying
different
set apart
itself
 I saw Jaws 3 late
Like I wasyou know
Independence Day

great VFX movies
And I think I saw
of like
weird shark floating
glass
like glass like
mysteriously breaks
screen
And I mean fuck
its good actually
think it
 The shark moving
speed
ferocity
Goodyear blimp
And its climax
movie
Its supposed
bang crash
boom collapse broken glass
water flooding in everything
But sharks approach
takes forever
You go One thousand
two thousand
Hes gonna hit screen
minute
And its 3D heshes
shark coming
screen
So climactic shot
movie dog shit
 When people talk
1 2 3 scenes
But mentions 4
 I mean problem
Jaws The Revenge
joke
opened
Because tagline
This time its personal
I dont know
came one
But again film
kind punchline
opened
 Jaws The Revenge
comes 1987
And Im sure adults
critics time
fucking hated movie
I loved Jaws The Revenge
Like knows
its doing
It shark
telepathically
chased family
So functions
straightup slasher

specifically targeting
members family
trying
ways them
Now point
logic say
like well
dont water
Like Jason
kill water
dont water
 And I remember
certain point
I reading script
And
Lorraine Gary
realizes its personal
shark coming
children
And shes infuriated
gets ship
goes
shark
Now I said
thats white people stuff
Now I said plan
Now weve seen
bigass shark
size school bus
know kill
lot people
Why going this
laughing
What doing
Whats plan
Shes gonna poke it
Shes gonna hit her
shes gonna punch
like Rocky
What isdoes
bazooka
Does army
What got
 Its strange
strange sequel
I think TV version
course
I pause
theres fakelooking
shark with like
toy boat stuck
explodes
insanely ridiculous
I remember shark roaring
like Godzilla monster lot
shark roaring
 Everyone blames
end Jaws The Revenge
introduction
shark roar
But happens Jaws 3
Theres scene shark
starting surface
Its giant jawsits lips
curl mouth opens
It belches
deep guttural roar
And its like wait what
Why roaring
 If youre gonna shark
know
coming bite
somebodys head clean
theyre flying
air
growl
There be
shark growling
 I shark roars
movies
sharks
water

I feel like adds lot
It feelswatching
shark sounds
feels wrong I think
laughs But I know
I know sharks dont roar
But maybe do
I dont know
You know knows
 Yeah sharks growl
movies lot
Sharks cant noises
thats happening
real life
Sharks hear pretty well
hear
sort low frequency sounds
They hear
splashing
somethings thrashing
here
But sharks communicate
audibly
So theres aHollywood
rich tradition
substituting
animal noise another
 When
mid90s
shark movies werent
big supply
 I think
Jaws The Revenge tanked
box office
sort killed
sharksploitation genre
while
 People
interested shark
They didnt want nature movie
They want
big blockbuster movie
They wanted scifi movies
If wanted
animal screen
dinosaur
They wanted big
bigger biggest
 And Deep Blue Sea
came in
things exploded
 When Renny Harlin
Deep Blue Sea
aim mind
shark movie
fun again
 That return
true shark form
 I believe came
little bit Anaconda
So cool thing
animals
actual Earth
scary again
And thing
I liked is
like started idea
science
 And cool plot

legitimizing it
It suddenly
Jaws did
feeding
science
movie legit
Wait sharks cant
Alzheimers
Sharks dont cancer
Well thats kind crazy
Cool premise movie
 Sharks cancer
blind
loss
brain activity age
unlike people I know
 Sharks
absolutely cancer
The documented case
shark cancer
1860s
its new thing
Sharks subject
actual biomedical research
Their healing abilities
particular
remarkable
Department Defense
interested
help wounded soldiers
And diseases
shark physiology
immune systems
resistant to
sharks
absolutely cancer
 These killer sharks
manmade
So point

actual sharks act
These like
super killer sharks
 They recognize gun
 Its impossible
Sharks swim backwards
They cant
 So storyline
lot digestible
It kind blame
humans I liked
 It funny

like Bmovie idea
You know genetically enhanced
sharks attacking people
And time
major studio movies

kind Bhorror subjects
They properly scene
Jaws 3D not
shattering
undersea viewing window
Because theres
scene shark throws
Stellan Skarsgard
glass
cracks
And I watching that
Im like

decided
know We wanted
that scene
Jaws 3D right
lets here
 The practical effects
Deep Blue Sea
phenomenal
And CG effects
I love it
I think commentary
Renny like
I challenge
tell difference
Im like Renny
one one
one one one
The CG absolute bullshit
that
You know sorry Renny
 I dont know anybody
big expectation
movies
movie came out
totally exploded again
And actually movie
fun also
Because ending
movie
different
normal American movie

Black guy surviving
white girl dying
So different
normal recipe
Hollywood
And movie
big name
You Samuel L Jackson
And seen
big parts
making
inspirational speech
big speech
talking
theyve got
save day
And middle
scenespoiler alert
shark jumps
eat
right camera
And everybody watched
movie time
just What
Whats happening
 So shocking
surprising
And I think
kicked competition
makers
sharksploitation movies

outlandish deaths
It wasnt timing
It about stupid
crazy deaths be
man yelling
crunching
I mean really
trace
way Jaws 3
Because 3D
I think felt compelled
amplify deaths
crazier
weve seen before
 Theres scene
haunts me know
theres shark hunter
And goes toe
goes
shark gets eaten
But cut inside
shark
getting eaten
You know jaws
opening closing
hes like
fighting life
And sound effects
way
hes fighting life
trying out
disturbing
 Theres great death
movie called
Atomic Shark
kid
beach
buried neck
sand
And shark comes
riding beach
And kid explodes
shark atomic
You lot deaths
like
Nu Image movies
They Shark Zone
Raging Sharks
Sharks Venice
And lets forget
Shark Attack 3 Megalodon
 Nothing prepared
movie
truly
triumph
fucking bonkers
get
 Shark Attack 3
goes completely broke
I think point
point
franchise
its like
We know
builtin audience
Lets crazy
 But
Shark Attack 3 Megalodon
known
greatest line
cinema
Because
Shark Attack 3 Megalodon

setup guy
thinks

there killing people
time
sexy scientist
there
And shes trying to know
primer
sharks
couldnt be
And theyve
professional
relationship
point
 So were end
long shooting day
And camera
crane
weve shot
And itsand
everythings happened
And were getting
ready wrap
And John comes
says
Can one
Id like
funny Jenny
I said Sure

So big crane shot
overlooking harbor
And come

And guy drives off
See tomorrow morning
 Im exhausted
 Yeah too
But know Im wired
What I
home eat pussy
 I fell

I couldnt stop laughing
I stop laughing
And
didnt break character
Just said it
And before
And like so
And cut
It funniest thing
Id seen
And I editor
film
time
I saw film
I fell chair laughing
I thought
fantastic
And I said myself
Im going leave
film
producer tells
out
 I came Syfy

We started
experiment

Try more
All sudden

When started

But slowly started
getting titles
little bit
top
And know
titles
grabbed peoples
attention
And press started
talking movies
And audience realized
Oh guys having
blast
These guys

 These movies
titles
The network just like looks

theyre like
Okay like Sharkacaine
like Mega Shark
And lets
rough outlines
And its
like paragraph
And read it
Theyre like Mm
lets sort

We like treatment
instead this
this
 Ive pictures

basically know
Bring ideas
throw around
And
ten
do like
space aliens
movie
giant crustacean
second movie
idea
And well
its giant crustaceans
space
 And
approve script
So its
backwards process
filmmaking
normally is
theres like script
script
thats story
that
like financed
goes
the know rigmarole
movie normally does
These literally
name
laughs And thats the
thats selling point
Like thats thethats
movie core
 And mix genres
actually come
movies work
You dont stick
exact genre
You want
people love sharks
expand it
 And Asylum rode
trend
 We started
arthouse movies
And there
horror films
We known for
Bhorror film
know slasher movie place
And known
big segment
mockbusters
 Weve sort got
reputation making
New York Post
dubbed mockbusters
movies
similar theme concept
big studio releases
 Its genre
We took that
know monocle we
its
embraced
And weve
enjoying since
We young company

Sharktopus work

I mean logic is
theres logic
 We movies
like Ghost Shark
 That movie special
That like haunted shark

bodies water
And best
that
end movie
bodies water got
more like nuanced
laughing Like
like I think came

Theres like
bikini car wash

theyre taking
shark

else
You movies

Nightmare Elm Street
We shark
peoples dreams
 For shark TV movies
Syfy Channel
theres specific
shark formula
So movies

seven commercial breaks
And youre required have

major gag minor gag
So major gag

And minor gag
like know
shark POV looking
water
go Aah
And then like
blood splashes
laughs
Just kind implying it
 One things
shark movies
certainly
lowbudget ones
try
it know
were underwater
theyre
crazy
flying space
So shark swimming
sand
Its like
well do
The sand shark brown
And I negatived
textures
blue looked icy
And were likegasps
A shark snow
 The sort secret these
like the like
climax moments
action moments
try shark
like different ways
And so like
underwater jumps out
Over water slowmo
And then like right
looking
it like
coming right her
And then like cut wide
its like
giant crazy shark
And shoots
right mouth

original script
That there
That part know
sixheaded shark
Like

like pushing itself
Its hilarious
Im like whats
difference know
 The visual effects
sharks came in
theyre adorable
And theyre
adorable things
youve seen
I like Okay well
its gonna
scariest
shark attacks
 The way works is
dont pitch buyers
really were doing
I mean tell
want
So theyre tune
audience wants
need
And were there
good drug dealer
be
supply drugs
case sharks
 And pitched
movie
calling
Shark Storm
 And said
Well interesting
sent that
We actually
pitch called Sharknado
And sort mix
youre doing
which sharks
tornado that
lets
movie together
But finding director
pass pass pass
 Look Im gonna
movie
its gonna destroy
career
Sharknado
Because Im gonna
flaming sharks
insane movie
can
 We
pieces
Sharknado starts
coming together
And starts developed
 Once got tone right
its
things
asked movie
I mean on
little bit bigger
budget normally have
its film
called Sharknado
And its film floods
know house
And lot
production challenges
film
 Because limitations
theres energy
desperation making
youre
limitations
dont
didnt
problems
And youre going
Okay lets
lets that
And instead
precise
and know animaticed
death
and know
precise

energy moment
 Its know cut
stock shot
actual shot
movie
visual effect
And massaged
time coherent
 The movie just
know
messed crazy wild
And doesnt stop
beginning end
 Sharknado
checks boxes
I think
network requirements
for like genre
but like audience
You know its
delivering you
expect

called Sharknado
 I remember watching
film time
like together
anybody
gonna it
working
And over
like
laughing making fun
stuff
And end I go
This insane movie
I think thats gonna air
Syfy
 We expectations
because frankly
wed Sharknado
dozen times this
 We doing know
movies
month
So know ones

And Twitter thing
kind new time
It wasnt brand new

 Theres Sharknado warning
 At peak
5000 Sharknado
 Sharknado caught
kind wave
Internet
people praising
people
laughing it
And its old statement
publicity good
praise

 We
thousand different ways
outcome
thousand different
know outcomes
The fact that Ive said
plane crashes happened
day
released
little bit
newsworthy
But newsworthy
day
day
day
I mean literally
news story
week local press
national press
It defied logic
expectation certainly
success
received loved
 It great feeling

little tiny film
fans discovered
was
 For Sharknado tons
of like sharky nerd people
like
actually scientists
lowkey data
Sharknado
theyre
like putting
different social media

Sharknado
It got people like
love bad movies

rabbit hole
actual science
Because thatsyou know
like social media

other
 I think
thats beauty it
We got something
They trusted me

I absolutely insane
making insane little film
And gave lot rope
hang with
And ended
movie
spawned
films
And its
little unique universe
 After Sharknado
looked back
You shark movies
popping

stupid movies
lousy CGI
quick movies
fun movies
 The sharksploitation genre
budgetwise
breaks
tiers
You studiolevel
sharksploitation movies
Then second tier
like Syfy Channel
Original movies
But then that
microbudget tier
consists movies
like Sharkula
Sharkenstein
Oh lets forget
Ouija Shark
 Mystic shield
 Youre taking
shark sort milieu
youre adding lot
extravagant things it
ideawisesharks fly
sharks land
You throw
genre trapping
kind expand
shark water
 I watch
bad shark movie joy
If I feel heartbeat
director
doesnt matter
effects poor
extras cant act
light right
CGI crappy
But heart
it I actually like it
 Some shark movies
Ive directed
Sharkenstein
Land Shark
Amityville Island
Shark Encounters
Third Kind
Virus Shark Noahs Shark
Jurassic Shark 2
3
Sharkula Doll Shark
few
 We great mix
everything
We Jawsploitation
Wed scifi films
Wed
between
And
realistic
actually
scuba diving left
youre swimmer whos
stranded reason
 Theres
called The Reef
filmmaker
named Andrew Traucki
Black Water
composited
Instead
digitally created crocodiles
shot real thing
digitally composited
actors
And effective
So obvious step

great white shark
And its
solid little film
 In The Reef
The Reef Stalked
Ive used
possible real sharks
I think pays
spades
terms belief
situation
So thats approach
Its suspense
And know lot
shark film is
fin
Like know
fin its gone
And that me
lot scarier
constantly seeing
shark CGI sharks
sort stuff
 I liked
little
The way played
tension shark

seeing shark
I bought it
You know cause I bought
shark
I bought tension
And
kind affected me
 The Reef based
true story
It happened Australia
80s
boat went down
And version
its friends
whotheyre gonna deliver
boat Indonesia
and unfortunately
hit piece reef
boat sinks
And theyre left
terrible dilemma
theyre gonna
stay sinking boat
swim land
And decide
swim
decides
stay boat
And yeah unfortunately
decided swim
big shark starts
come
picks one
When youre writing something
youre looking
references
drawing things
inspiration
I think great inspiration
this my
entire style
working
Open Water
sense
its real
lowbudget
done
 Open Water probably
best shark movie
come out know
maybe Jaws
You know took
different approach
We kind
Blair Witch era sort of
I hate use term
kind handmade horror films
sounds negative
But its like
people going
with like
camera actors
taking advantage
of know
new opportunities
digital filmmaking
allowed
having big crew
going
making little movie
kind
hostile environment
Instead woods
Blair Witch
characters
open ocean
 Id diver
long time
I love diving sharks
things
And I got newsletters
dive magazines
And story come
couple left sea
Australia
Great Barrier Reef
gone

cattle boats
theres like
100 people
And
reef
goes in
head count
And peoplethey missed
head count
And boat left
middle ocean
To me horrifying
thing happen
What hit emotionally was
happen me
Like like
Like oh my
taunted me
Like up
And like oh God
happen
Just vacation
assume
youre gonna okay
especially
situation like that
This extreme
kind extreme sport
Its tourist level
diving is
So aesthetically
wanted look
like people film
vacations
Because secret film
wasworking mind
point view
It putting
audience right
knowing
experience
limiting


lead characters
do
 The realism movie
terrifying
Because dont start
movie
scared sharks
I mean people
scuba diving
point
You know
sharks there
theyre
anything
And its
people
bobbing
water hours
sharks
start getting curious
theyre bumping them
And
swimming by
And its
realtolife progression
shark
actually explore
decide food
not
 And course fact
sharks real
adds
terror experience
watching film
 In movie
sharks underwater
And theyre not
I scary
underwater
And actually diving them
theyre not
You know its amazing
Of course Im person
chooses that
But dive
surface
whats disconcerting
tail flapping fin
And I wanted
capture that

Id seen before
actually
youd experience
middle
ocean
sharks decided gather
check out
So factors
came together
And said
feels like good
feels like good
combination things
think
kind different
suspenseful music

 Open Water small
feels
like bigger film
shark movies rise

mainstream movies
And eventually
work way things
like 47 Meters Down
The Shallows
films like Crawl
suddenly
nature attack films
kind shifted
theaters
And sharks existing
Amarket
Bmarket
simultaneously
 I sharing apartment
producer
And I told
I wanted shark movie
And I like
I seen
good shark movie ages
You know forever
apart Jaws
You know
pitch sharp
It like know
actually time
pitch people

ocean trying up
And people like
great
And Im like is
know easiest thing
Im gonna write
I wrote it
felt like
know felt like sort
I Know What You Did
Last Summer
ocean
It felt like Oh God
awful
And I sitting
script writing
partner Ernest
And watched
Touching Void
And I like
Holy shit
thats movie
needs be
You know theres moment
Touching Void
guy
crevasse

cant it
So decisionmaking process
was I cant it
Ill is Ill
abyss
And I like
kind fucking mentality
happening
I mean saved life
I imagine
moment life
I leave light
a
into like crevasse
And I obsessed

crazy characters
And
47 sprung from
 It very like
uncharted territory
And motley crew
small
affordable
underwater stage England
big ones
And like
pirates making movie
We learning
went
And Johannes great job
I know its like
day
thered new like
Oh underwater
hours
stuff
didnt expect
didnt know about
 You know Im diver
I wanted look
real tank
So weI think
before
We trucks broccoli
coming day
And interns
mincing broccoli
wed special divers
putting broccoli
filming
light catches
broccoli
And small tank
current
And sediment
sort flow
backwards forwards
And gives
completely different look
unique look
And
milk tank
felt
like I diving
It felt like that
But problem was
hottest summer
England
It like
super hot summer
 And sun beaming

inside tank

like canvas tank
opposed to like
brick cement tank
And were
getting cooked
 Youve got broccoli
Youve got milk
Youve gotwhen
shoot tank
goes loo
So youve got urine
youve got broccoli
youve got milk rotting
incredible heat
I remember clear day
standing
tank
And I remember thinking
I dont know
cage drop
Everything moves
fucking slowly water
Not stuff
happen does
Like cage wasyou know
I wanted that
And its like like that
And basically

fast way
girls other
camera
another
And looks tumbling
I think were world
like I love sharks
47
Like shot
comes end
grabs footI remember
delivered that
I like Holy fuck
This isthis really
theres like
shots
Im like
Wow thatsthats like
I touch that
Thats pretty impressive
 And
The Shallows
similar kind
thing bigger budget
But again its like
survival thing
You know young woman
stuck sea
Its great premise
Shes stuck rock
beach
right there
theres big shark
kind circling
thats gonna
impossible
And
fun one
 Theres
terrifying
idea trapped
buoy go
And tide comes in
know
theres 30foot shark
lurking underneath you
ready tear
pieces
 When watch film
its great movie
But conceptyou gotta
credit filmmakers
actress
Because film starts
literally her
And thatsI mean
carry movie
hold tension
long
pretty impressive
 47 Meters Down
The Shallows
successful
studiolevel pictures
But
studiolevel pictures
pretty modest budget
So natural progression
that

successful
sense
things bigger
And comes The Meg
 A type shark stronger
inside shark movies
way shark
normal shark
prehistoric shark
A big shark like megalodon
 The megalodon
largest shark
existed
It feared nothing
 The wellknown
course
movie called The Meg
Jason Statham
lead role
submarine
going
sea
releasing big shark
Its coming human
actually eating
way
 It goes idea
want believe
supernatural
mysterious
I think that
especially technology
science advances
lose little bit
mystery
think lose
mystery
exists world
And idea

discover
thousandsofyearold
giant megalodon
prehistoric creature
attractive
allows
stake claim
environment
understand
allows
imagination alive
 I knew
thing megalodon
I looked online
And I saw families people
standing inside jaws
These huge
fucking real sharks
day
 What saying
fullygrown men
swallowed
megalodon
I mean thats
pretty giant mouth
laughs
 Is megalodon
sea
You know 80 sea
hasnt explored
And day
new creatures popping up
So someday
megalodon
coming us
 Megalodons went extinct
370 million years ago
And opinion
I cant imagine
way whatsoever theres
existence today
 In 70s Jaws
what like irked everybody

confusing people
sharks
like
And I think nowadays its
megalodon mockumentary
irks scientists
Because its idea
beingof people
tricked thinking
theres
thats

Jurassic Park

alien
Unlike lot
predator creatures
world
sharks largely unseen
Anything youve seen

cooler
What exactly steered
marine biology
specific incident
great white shark
And

action
scary movie
 The time

its domain
Were visitors
Theyve got right
there
Its like theyre
malicious horrible
Thats shark does
If heyou know occasionally

 Peter Benchley

kind demony thing
Sharks demons

And
wild environment
animals
wild environment
youve gotta respect
rules environment
 We absolutely
sharks ocean
We need apex predators
cause balance
ocean
And dont them
balance gets
whack
Its like having Serengeti
Africa
lions
Youve got lions
populations intact
ecosystem healthy
thriving
So apex predators sharks
absolutely essential
And 500 species
Dont forget
