So cant read dictation
you
I see go
My child doesnt school
I live here
Ive come discuss
transferring school
I heard youre making film
homework
I thought Id come
discuss problems you
Please do
Ive lived years
foreign countries
studying working
Ive observed educational
systems countries
In countries America
Canada example
theres thing homework
In countries
homework
emphasis
childrens creativity
For instance England
work drawing handicrafts
geography composition
subjects
They dont say For good handwriting
write write write
The pupils taught rules
good handwriting
are course
rules methods
But learn them
acquire skill
In Japan traditional
hard work effect
rate suicide children
increased
For now theyve revising
system creating new ones
old isnt effective
more
As see
kids great pressure
Teachers know
tackle problem live it
But kids home
deal us home teachers
idea do
We havent trained
deal it
What actually dump
frustrations children
end indignant
surly defensive generation
susceptible possible
mental problem
With pressure unhappiness
imposed kids
well end generation
lacking creativity
No translation
capable copying
We need
20th century
well end nothing
We use resources
it
The Ministry Education
opinion
ought change current system
This belongs
Middle Ages
education authorities
uphold it
Teachers think differently
hard them
Kids
imagination
capacity
I believe parents leave
children home
Its basically wrong parents
force kids homework
kids tend react
pressure
By building natural resistance
education system
We dont know
maths literature
Modern education systems
practice
were overworking kids
unnecessary pressure
I believe children
allowed naughty rebel
develop ways
resisting rules regulations
After all cant expect kids
accept
question
Another point I wanted make
relates special circumstances
kids face
Theres new teaching
maths literature forth
Parents familiar it
Its completely new
The governments established new
teacher training colleges
train teachers new
methods
But parentteacher meetings
parents asked
help children lessons
The child comes home confused
asking questions expecting help
The parents arent familiar
new methods
try teaching child
old way
ends arguments
Part responsibility dumped
older brothers sisters
makes problem worse
For instance Im room I hear
arguing intervene
I ask Whats going on
My elder son says hes trying help
brother homework
The younger boy says its wrong
thats teacher told him
I look boys
teachers method
The point is
Im supposed qualified
teach children home
whats teacher
training college for
If thats case
send
training course
I know do
Are questions
 Yes
I want ask
wife disagreements
concerning children
A lot I believe childs
grade excellent
its little pass
The idea child
subject nonsense
However wife insists
child pupil
reach level subject
My child talent music
art
maths subjects
require memorising like History
In addition subjects
literature
taught religious
perspective
Now apart difficulty
memorisin information
trouble copying
lesson times
His teacher wants copy
complicated word twice
It want
suppress childs imagination
I went school
asked revise method
better ways teach maths
I strongly feel children
develop personality
We
can
The 21st century going
different
Right now
globe
children start working
computers earliest age
They deal emotional
mental problems
What Im getting at
refers proverb Indian
telling British
fish
river
teach
catch it
We shouldnt children
fish
We teach
catch it
We teach
think
But education
children learn everything
I doubt it
certainly wont
learn think
Pinocchio

closed door
But dont think so
 No
Arent scared
 No  Thats good
In respect teachers report
claiming hes working
school lagging behind
mentioning possiblity
bein retarded
concerned
We tried help lessons
success
The problem werent
familiar new methods
and result
got confused
All transfer stress
child
At school course
problem pupils
came home
evening
pressure
improve
But wasnt responsive
mental state
lack
studying
inability explain
lesson proper information
help understand it
Consequently tension
anxiety gradually increased
extent probably came
consider aggressor
Since I didnt want arguments
affect children
I
room close door
That obviously
anxious
Of course I hurt
room
help lessons
repeat sentences
loudly
Yet childs mind elsewhere
He kept expecting door open
come
rescue him
free captivity
Yes desperately needed
friend feel secure
Who protects home Who
gives sense security
His mother
 She protects him
Too much fact
If I try work bit longer
tells stop
hands
sweating hes tired
Well considering way son
behaved film
dont think mothers right
He anxious couldnt
understand said him
This case
undoubtedly
But finally come
conclusion
method didnt work
mothers emotional
protective method didnt work either
Either way
child getting nowhere
He confused
 So solution
Basically I believe solution
school
Time subjects number pupils
organised way
pupils wont need study
school
wont need
teach kids home
Of course homework
home
actual learning
school
Then wont problem
We dont know teach
cant expected it

O thou created Venus
Thou created moon
sun
All mountains hills oceans
The beautiful colourful trees
Beautiful wings butterfly
Nests birds
Happiness games strength
Eyes see
Snow rain heat cold
Were created Thee
O Lord
You granted I wished for
Fill hearts happiness
joy
