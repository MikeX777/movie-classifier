I think
situations
children
lack materials
um administrative
complaints
Theres million things
day pull down
And I think um that
affect
way
look children
A child cant

problem
instead challenge
I think look
kids as child
You cant look at well
cant read
cant Math
write
You look

look
terms
things do
If look gifts
concentrate those
youre going able
help deficits
Weve got start
universities

teachers coming
dont know anymore
teachers
30 40 years ago
were fixing anything
We need
universities start
working programs
They need do
especially special ED
teachers reading teachers
These teachers need
know dyslexia is
I couple friends
went college
said learned
dyslexia
learned
classes
And
special ED certificate
And said maybe
got minutes
dyslexia that
And thats now
I mean I expected
20 years ago now
When work
teachers they
want
information
They email time
come classes

want information
And
big capital letters
explanation
point Why didnt I
learned teacher
training school
So want
information
have
ones going
getting
themselves I applaud them
But its
needs be
Every teacher
required
course
dyslexia order graduate
What is
What warning signs are
How help
What wont help
Because unfortunately dyslexia
follows life long
So Ill tell you
Ive talk lot
junior high teachers
high school teachers
I cant believe
children I coming
freshman high school
reading
grade level
What I supposed
them
How I teach
high school science
cant read book
So its
elementary school teachers
need know this
All teachers public
schools private school
class
dyslexia theyre
allowed hit classroom
So theyll understand
theyre looking
needs
warn parents
parents
action early
I think biggest
challenge raise awareness
educators
dyslexia um
getting states
acknowledge
dyslexia
neurobiological
A lot states dont
all dont recognize it
And thus kids
identified early
screened
preK kindergarten
provided
general education
great supports
arent difficult
And science tells us
work children
Theyll reading
second grade
all
98 them
So states
acknowledge it
Our policymakers
acknowledge it
And
tools teachers
MARYANNE WOLF VOICEOVER When
asks
children
dyslexia thing
I want world
know exists
It a different
organization brain
wonderful brain
brand
long reading occurs
So absolute thing
reconceptualization
dyslexia everyone
The second understanding
available child
parent
peers teachers
school systems
country
world
Literacy affects everyone
Our children
dyslexia
deprived
access literacy
This probably
interesting brains
species
We lost
contribution society
Right now
know dyslexia
comes careful
work many people
years
showing importance
phonological ability
importance
early environment
stimulative language
proper instruction
read
Reading misstaught
We very its easy
create called
curriculum casualties
appreciate reading
built
reinforced
Emphasizing phonological skills
phonics alphabetic principle
vocabulary things
recommended
National Reading Panel
healthy important
Currently brain science
doesnt add that
But offers promise
begin understand
differences
people
subtle
profound
I think day age
with 20 30 years
science proven
one dyslexia
exist thats reading
writing backwards
theres
real methodology
help children learn
time come
Weve got stop cycle
And want need
parents speak out
And then thats
reason came
decoding
dyslexia groups
We looking raise
dyslexia awareness
Were hoping parents
resources supports
timely fashion
quicker
gone ourselves
And want sure
were sharing
story policymakers
people actually
ability
affect change
From point
mission statement
weve developed talking
points policy goals
And unified
definition dyslexia state
education codes
mandate early screening
early intervention
teacher training
