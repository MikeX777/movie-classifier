You know I think its
step stars
Elon Musk
average tech billionaire
Hes
intriguing entrepreneurs
business today
The man PayPal
taking giants
aerospace
motor industries
oil corporations
energy utility
companies winning
Elon Musk
visionary

actually changing
way function
way
look world
Back then
people afraid
buy books online
putting
financial services suite
internet
revolutionary idea
company turned
PayPal
online payment service
Its thing run company
thats worth billion dollars
Elon Musk four
My personal ideology
kind split right
trying helpful
Earth related stuff
sustainable energy
trying
advance space technology
establish
selfsustaining city Mars
From AI disrupting
car industry
SolarCity
I mean
people say
I rocket company
Not many
 In terms space
Elon completely changed
think everything
When look
SpaceX
reusable rockets
seeing science fiction
1950s coming life
Rockets land
meant do
Its trying land
postage stamp there
Astonishingly difficult
So Mars beckon
I convinced
gonna
happen lifetime
 If look
Tesla alone
changed way
automobiles
forever future
He truly broken
wall
impossible break
were
situation
big car companies
switching massively
electric cars
revolution
man
Hes like
real life Iron Man
hes doing
Theres lot
happen
story over
So I think
watch excited
comes next
A lot people think
successful entrepreneurs
happened
right place right time
right product
right service
Thats untrue
Why
content 25 million
sell
company
second company
50 million
company
fail one
Serial entrepreneurs driven
Theyre psychologically driven
its usually
childhood
Elon Reeve Musk
born Pretoria 1971
son Canadian mother
South African father
Elon grew South Africa

unfettered upbringing
He said
raised basically books
occasionally nannies
His mother father
kids
Theyre younger
brother sister
Kimball Tuska
like Elon didnt
lot adult supervision
He said basically
building explosives
learning conduction
little supervision
He passion
engineering
obviously physics
sciences well
Musk attended
Waterkloof Primary School
parents divorced
year old Elon went
live father
Elon stage
childhood
parents divorced
says felt sorry
dad living himself
opted
live dad
That later called
huge mistake
Hes record saying
didnt great
relationship father
Hes notably said really
hard things
dad
It sounds like
awful situation
His father engineer
Elon says lot
engineering nous
came father
father
issues according Elon

incisive
engineering background
As disturbing
Elons relationship
dad be
Elons relationship
mother appears good
went
strength strength
I think mother probably
ultimate optimist
Shes lovely
Shes something
Open New York Times
theres Maye its great

50 years ha
So

available surprised
suddenly

see
Despite fact Elon
says tried repeatedly

try repair
relationship father
stage hes
given up
doesnt believe
dad capable change
Hes talked openly
child
spent lot time alone
He says remember
sound house
footsteps far
distance

wanted again
My view
stellar entrepreneurs
life experiences
particularly childhood
determinant
success later on
If look early
childhood experiences
number
adverse events
Substantial adverse events
like school bullying
rejected
These events drive you
need prove something
You wanna gain control
world again
didnt control
younger
moving job
entrepreneur
CEO gives power
gives strength
gives control
thing
younger
I think thats driving
force entrepreneurs
Elon Musk attended
Bryanston High
School Pretoria
thrived academically
He tough upbringing
There reports
bullying well
You know child
shows sort intellect
come
glare bullies
He hospitalized
particular fight
He nerd
He bullied school
There point
knocked unconscious
You know wasnt obvious
marketing
genius point
Elon took wrestling classes
bit judo
attempt compensate
bit added physicality
grew
little bit
got growth spurt
got bit taller
took
bullies head on
After spending
years Bryanston High
Elon attended Pretoria
High School boys
Elon attended Boys High
1986 1988
year
matriculated
He excelled science
excelled
studies
He fact got
distinction science
studies 1988
As I recall grades
cause I
mark book
definitely
science class
Ive taught
boys years
Elon stick mind
You know I cant tell
boy sat
I remember Elon
sitting
classroom
getting work
He wasnt boys
wanted attention
time
We lot
pride boys
personal
point view
having taught Elon science
Id like think
I small input
formative years
Ive read
like Mars
Im hoping hell
lot sooner
Star Trek style
invite there
Elon Musk
different
His entrepreneurial
ventures started early
In 1984 science fiction
inspired tech success
gave hint future
sold
commercial software
He started working
computers age 10
working hard
clever
developing programs
He develops video
game called Blastar
He famously sold
PC magazine 500
Elon asked
sets apart
people
said
things
obvious growing
people
didnt understand
conduction works
light wires
light switch on
things
immediately clear obvious
people
didnt automatically
especially theyre like 14
understand going on
He played lot chess
result
sort thinking ahead
In chess play
think moves ahead
So younger
looking ideas
good
business short term

grand plan on
After graduating
high school
Musk briefly attended
University Pretoria
deciding
leave South Africa
The story Elon Musks
wealth rise
tied
American dream
It ingrained
South Africa wasnt
going achieve
ambitions had
He wanted America
He wanted
scene
Initially couldnt
directly America
He actually
Canada
Elon spent
years studying
Queens University
Ontario
He funded degrees
Canada US
getting scholarships
working time
didnt huge
money him
He famous university
paper talks
wanting conquer different
areas world
included
internet space exploration
solar energy
artificial intelligence
brain learning
interfaces well
Elon Musk married
childhood sweetheart
They met university
Her Justine
absolutely beautiful
date
supposed
ice cream
She actually said yes
basically ditched him
went
studying instead
He didnt answer
He pursued her
He continued pursue her
Elon left
university
attended Justine
moved Horton
Business School
sent
roses regularly
When Elon Musk
interested you
I think comes
like steam train
electric
steam train perhaps
Elon Musk unstoppable
He sees wants

needs it
Hes like business
hes like love
Having
completed degrees
business physics
1995 Musk abandoned
PhD Stanford
headed Silicon Valley
He famously dropped
degree
Stanford University
California days
And launched company
brother
Kimball called Zip2
effectively
form online Yellow Pages
sold
newspapers time
And struck lucky
company bought
They actually ended
selling Compaq
307 million
27 years old
He 22
million then
wonderful
awful lot money
typical Elon style
recycled half
venture
eventually
ended PayPal
Having disrupted
traditional paper
advertising industry Zip2
Musks venture took
global financial market
So worked setup company
called Xcom
precursor
PayPal
Xcom supposed
services financial
services business
So sounds sort
archaic now
time
putting
financial services
suite internet
revolutionary idea
He internet
win belt
So
especially challenging
bring new engineers
new business people
wanted work
exciting

won once
So big
feather cap
It was I think
challenging
persuade outside investors
good idea
cause
swayed win
It buy public
opinion Silicon Valley
The jury sort
genius
crazy big ego

gonna play out
invested
10 12 million
money Xcom
didnt need lot
money right bat
He sort took
care that
Musk
revolutionary
strategy Xcom
gifting new customers
cash rewards
creating peertopeer
payment systems
My initial impressions

focused passionate
do
It clear early
Elon playing
standard book life
business else
So I gonna
ride
At beginning Elon
wasnt easy read all

idea
going
react anything
I experience
thought way did
talked way did
confidence
doing
did
It foreign
grew Iowa
maybe its
foreign everyone
I dont know
PayPal voted
10 worst
business ideas 1999
Elon Musk instrumental
companys focus
global payment system
change
course internet
People probably know
PayPal
Thats
came public consciousness
PayPal
going turn finances
online transaction
How gonna easy
How gonna
efficient
It sounds sort obvious now
people
afraid buy books online
asking
financial data place
solid proposition
The goal company
building
trying

positive humanity
thinking
space solar panels
way then
So knew
sort steppingstone
way grander dreams
PayPal soon
online payment
choice
thousand users
multiplying
million months
The person person
payment things
took quickly
gaining traction like crazy
online auction
market took hold it
blew
huge thing
We adding tens thousands
new accounts day
time
fairly unprecedented
Elon handson
aspects company
It money
playing with
So I think its
money table have
its best interests
involved
details
Everyday new
sort fire right
Everyday
burning
needed addressed
We customer
service nightmare
soon
launching service
thousands thousands
emails queue
people
didnt understand
again early
days internet
didnt understand
money out
And so
freak out in
email like 12
different times
So million
emails cue
10
customer service people
dedicated dealing that
And so idea
going do
Customer service enormously
expensive California
And so I said know
gonna sound crazy
I huge extended
family Midwest
I train
customer service home
Elon laughed first
couple hours later
came said
right plane
So I went taught
10 family members
customer
service home
sister
ended hiring
12 stay home parents
small town Nebraska
started
working home
And good
ended building
customer service center
Omaha Nebraska
employs 1800 people
turned fantastic
We went zero
people weeks
Omaha
probably
challenging thing
little
short options so
Led
passion perfectionism
determination
heroic work ethic
Musk succeeded markets
previously considered
impossible conquer
Hes higher
expectations
people
pushed
very hard
Theres lot pressure

lot expectations
lot responsibility
shareholders
capital sourced
staff colleagues
theres lot demands
So cant
know what
This good great
Im gonna
months off
Why Ive got 20
billion its okay
No doesnt work like that
As stakes higher
people
involved
theres pressure
front
I think looks
it turns away
What drives Elon
pushes him I dont it
hes making
changes world
doesnt
stop rest
He keeps going
Elon Musk famous
work ethic nonstop
I think modes
theres stop go
He works clock
expects
same
Elon hours
night working
He send emails
midnight 100 200 am

focused problem
trying solve
If hear stories
SpaceX early days
people struggling
pace him
thats works
cant
pace youre door
I thought good boss
Its sort infamous
runs
PR people quickly
time I thought
I gonna like
normal PR person
And so Elon wasnt
gonna that
He expected lot people
expected
lot other
thats done
In culture startups
expectation
everybody
working time
You 900
1000 morning
leave
900 1000
maybe night
And Elon definitely working
midnight night
That
did exciting
Rarely complain
kind thing
cause felt like
changing world
By year 2000
Musk married Justine Wilson
He
pining Justine

Canada point
And so lovely
came down
The couple suffer
tragedy early on
Their baby boy
10 weeks old Nevada
died suddenly SIDS
It difficult
cope with
Justine immediately sought
IVF fertility help
went boys
set triplets
set twin boys
So quickly went
having children
having five
Justine written
extensively
caused strain
marriage
do do
tragic event
losing infant son
unfortunately didnt
draw couple closer

beginning perhaps
ultimately
pull apart
As PayPal flourished
boardroom troubles dogged Musk
An internal disagreement
Board
resulted Elon
ousted company
There time
Peter Theil
Elon coCEOs PayPal
certain
differences opinion
technology
branding company
led vote
confidence oust Elon
And Elon unfortunately
South Africa
I spoken
phone day
hes like bad it
Im like oh its bad
And night I went
home I laying bed
I started realizing
started putting
pieces I
seen office
happening
1030 night
I sat straight bed
Im sure I said
swear word ceiling
I got up I went
office
sure
everybody there

it
They talking
Board phone
ousting him I
tried Elon
plane
I couldnt him
I couldnt
morning

late done
Im sure
bit unhappiness early on
handled
marvelously
Musk left PayPal
largest shareholder
remained advisory role
His windfall
arrived 2002
eBay bought PayPal
leaving wealthy
belief
That Elon
started
money
He cashed
165 million wonderful
What amazing
plowed
new
business ventures
He didnt
aside himself
didnt think sort
personal gain
short term least
A lot wouldve
retired
He money PayPal
couldve stopped
know bought place
south France
said Im retiring
Im 28 done
ended starting
billion
dollar companies
 He took 100 million
SpaceX
70 million ended
going Tesla
10 million
going SolarCity
Most people
165 million
Im set life
Thats it wheres beach
Lets go
Not Elon I
lot respect that
Ladies gentleman
welcome Elon Musk
In 2001
Elon established
Musk Foundation
delivering solar energy
systems areas world
struck natural disasters
He pledged away
half
wealth philanthropy
A lot people think
entrepreneurs
driven money
thats theyre
serial entrepreneurs
They wanna more
Really
50 million
need money
Not really thats
good driver
They driven
money all
Hes aware doubt
If youve got 20
billion floating around
Im sure wouldve noticed
I dont think thats
main driver him
I dont
I think hes got
bigger vision
little
thing called money
money helps
execute dream
necessary thing
Its certainly pursuit
money point
I think realized were here
its
interesting spend time

meaningful heart
thats hes doing
Its like drug
When youve
successful thing
wanna one
wanna come new
vision learning
Its way being
He bored beach
It
big world changing goal

morning
Thats way hes wired
So I dont expect stop
I think actually
gonna
difference world
transition
sustainable transport
sooner later
Were
thought like
way rich anything
Like I said I thought maybe
10 percent chance
success beginning
I thought I lose
money I did
So its like was
I came close
losing everything
Falcon 9
cleared tower
Having
conquered cyber space
Musks mission
focus outer space
In 2002 launched
revolutionary
businesses time
focused shaking
space industry
The pivotal breakthrough
thats necessary
life multiplanetary
fully rapidly
reusable orbitclass rocket
This
difficult thing do
live planet

barely possible
In 12 months so
Ive come conclusion
solved
I think SpaceX
going try it
We fail
Im saying
certain success here
going
try it
He
talking energy
transportation space
I like space
Hes like space cool
Alright
No thought
hes
set
achieve goals
I mean random South African
coming 2000s
saying wants
build rocket
land
ground
things orbit
10 times cheaper
else
He laughed
room places
They kind
ignored
kind
money
mouth literally
He famously went Russia
try buy
rocket engines them
got laughed
country basically
engineers
came US
built rocket
We
NASA space equals NASA
Elon Musk
started experiment
new rockets
realized
Elon Musk SpaceX
space player
Everything
looking good
beginning
todays space walking tasks
The
SpaceX launches failed
sparked skepticism
investors
The
vehicle course track
And appear
launch vehicle failure
Space flight
tricky business
I mean
definitely difficult
I think forget
sometimes
We launches
landings routine
Its huge energy
dangerous substances
work hard
Look today
The critics silenced
Just year
founding SpaceX
Musk invested Tesla Motors
electric car manufacturer
aiming produce
powerpacked zero polluting car
Over years
Tesla
lead niche market
Our goal
try create
best car world
order
electric car
best car world
Because lot people
perception
electric cars compromised
issues
electric cars
buy electric
its
sort electric fetish
What I think
incredibly important
break perception

electric car
better gasoline car
Cars big deal
He F1 McLaren
early Xcom days
Jaguar
soon that
liked much
rare
expensive cool
If look revolution
thats
electric cars
Tesla first
 Theres
attempts
bring electric
cars failed
big car giants
didnt want succeed
Elon knew
electric cars
started out
recognized
problem
needed solved
bulldozed
way it
Im excited
fact weve got
zero emission sports car
headtohead
Ferrari
Porsche win
This whats truly disruptive
tech guy coming
car space
Elon doesnt look
car
Its piece software
little bit
hardware attached it
The driving
experience Tesla
everybody raving it
It awesome
unbelievable
acceleration
world
It like roller coaster
I felt like I
gonna fly something
Its quick its silent
Teslas
its technology
fact
update themselves
I Tesla
Ill come morning
Software update
phone
stuff car
didnt
previous night
You actually
Tesla parking spot
smartphone
So its incredible
For somebody whos
car fan tech fan
Tesla
tick lot boxes
The future electric
In future wont
filling petrol
Elon understood
decade
Already youre seeing
countries Europe
France UK
saying theyre gonna
ban sale petrol cars
10 20 years
thats pretty
thanks Tesla
In face massively
declining oil prices
I think actually
urgent
auto manufactures
transition electric
huge effort
electric
vehicle programs
Whats amazing
rest auto industry
sort following
They lithiumion
cell technology
companies
couldnt match
 There isnt car
company world
isnt looking
electric vehicle
Theres probably
car company world
hasnt taken Tesla apart
whats going
underneath
At Tesla weve open
sourced patents
were trying
helpful possible
advent
electric vehicles
weve said
super charge network
were happy
car makers use network
Were

accelerate advent
sustainable cars
I mean know
GM Land Rover said
theyre gonna start
electric cars
near future
electric cars
Theres things
Tesla first
got
car maker planet
looking thinking yeah
weve got like
havent we
The fundamental problem
rules today
incent people create carbon
madness
incent happen
We need send clear message
negotiating teams
politicians
time
needs
significant change
An essential
Elon Musks tale triumph
close came
complete disaster
By admission 2008
worst year life
His companies battered
economic meltdown
Three failed launches left
SpaceX hanging balance
Tesla
verge bankruptcy
Elon widely
assumed finished
He certainly
ups downs
believe
lots lots ups downs
He
media
permanently

price success
In early years
came knife edge

SpaceX going

going bankrupt
He having allocate
resources money
Tesla SpaceX
order going
came
having borrow money
friends family
bear mind
man millions
software sale earlier
Elon Musk
plenty failures
failed rocket launches

learning curve
With early
rockets
didnt
understand
chances
going blow up

greatest failure
greatest
steps forward
He keeps going
keeps pushing boat out
It
insatiable appetite
going
happens
Yes yes
maybe yes
delayed yes
There million
places way

stopped derailed
decided buy
island sit it
didnt
Theyre risk takers
love it
They live
knife edge
Failure expected
Entrepreneurs dont
expect necessarily
succeed time
characteristic
makes successful
fail
entrepreneurs
risks
brush off
They phenomenal
bounce factor
Unlike people
absorbed failure
stymied
cant
while
cope failure
And able bounce back

venture blinking eye
its about
With companies
brink collapse
doom averted
minute
Tesla saved investors
SpaceX awarded
16 billion NASA contract
The SpaceX team incredible
They
pushing boundaries
terms were going
forward exploration
I think humans
naturally driven this

beginning I think
human beings leaving
low Earth orbit
I certainly plan
that
In 2010 Elon launched
Dragon spacecraft
International
Space Station
SpaceX company
dock private
spacecraft ISS
time amazing
This Mission
Control Houston
official hatch opening time
SpaceX
Dragon Spacecraft
Every bit adrenaline
body released point
Its extremely
intense moment
Anything gone wrong
went
right fortunately
I felt I feel lucky
Don Pettit giving
thumbs there
rest crew
Elon Musk developing
track record
delivering
says will
So
developed reusable rockets
He supplying
space station
The stage
versions
Dragon Spacecraft
human rated
So hes actually
delivering promise
After
marriage Justine
unraveled divorce
Musk began dating British
actress Talulah Riley
According Justine
divorce finalized
weeks
later
Elon married
else
It extremely
quick courting
He met her courted her
asked marry
They went
wonderful

tempestuous relationship
They married
divorced remarried
announced divorce
called divorce

divorce on
Its difficult
track
Elon Talulahs
ups downs
They ended
amicable fashion
Talulah says
never never
They end
again
Over
years
Tesla lead
electric car market
Under Elons leadership
company heralded
great American
auto industry
success story century
This kind crazy
I learned
I told that
total number
orders Model 3
past 24 hours
passed 150000
His concerns climate
change sustainability
whats
push electric car
fancy Tesla
midrange car
35000
everybody drive
When Model 3 launched
like
400000 people
money down
Thats unheard
car industry
You
waiting list
wait long
relatively affordable car

havent seen before
You line
building
got here
so its like ending
line tourists
actually came
asked was
And I said Tesla
knew it
Tesla famously
doesnt advertise
I dont think needs to
Theres buzz
brand
Things
track able
meet Model 3
production timing
middle year
excited
whats happening
Teslas value
lot people
scratching heads
fact its company
thats making money
a huge value
If look
revenues market cap
car maker Honda
value revenue Tesla
Honda trading
05 times
Tesla trading
74 times today
So Tesla obviously
valued lot
given little revenue
produces
Why
Because theres lot
goodwill stock
thats
Elon fan club
investment community
And access
capital good will
brand like
wonderful Elon
allow
things
The Boring Company
AI ambitions
crazy
frontier driven ideas
comes next
The reputation Tesla
product
guy thats
running company
Frankly cars
werent good
people wouldnt buy them
good
technology leaders
thats
gets following
The fact theres
guy like Elon
running company
icing cake
The general public
appreciate
sort candid approach
hes running
companies
What keeps
intrigued Musk
look closely
signature
products makes
So example Tesla
sound goes 11
Its reference Spinal Tap
The Ludicrous Mode
warp speed
screen
unlock Easter
egg extra performance
Its little details
car companies
dont normally
Tesla
bit fun them
Its like Knight Rider
car doesnt
talk you
You cant
conversation it
comes
autonomous technology
Tesla certainly
leaders there
If people want
electric cars fine

electric cars comes what
Driverless cars
Now
things
happened
driverless cars
computers
wrong know
Im sure I want
driverless car
People keyed

autonomous vehicle thing
I think maybe people
like image like
robot cars run amok
Its
like that
All apply to
software goes
extreme levels validation
customer sees it
So theres
sorts nonsense
people
human guinea pigs
You know its basically
advanced drivers
assistance point
fact use
Autopilot
thats thats
whats aircraft
presumption aircraft
pilot must
know pay
attention alert
ready
time
pilot
go sleep
know walk away
cockpit
Musk confronting
worlds
biggest challenges head on
Through Tesla intends
reduce use fossil fuels
simultaneously
attempting revolutionize
energy industry
A key aim
change
energy consumption
energy production
Elon Chairman
SolarCity
largest producers
solar power systems
United States
People remote village
island
solar panels combine
Tesla Powerwall
worry
having electricity lines
Electricity lines
pretty
thing world
So able
solution
works are
The fact its
wall mounted vital
means dont
need battery room
It means normal
household mount
garage
outside wall house
doesnt room
You actually
want completely grid
You solar panels
charge battery packs
thats use
cost 3500
Oh wow grid
its actually zero
This entire night
powered batteries
With The SolarCity Company
Tesla
Elon trying
solar panels
attractive
mass market
They launched new
solar roof technology
old days
solar panels
big black bulky squares
youd
roof garden
Now people going
solar panels
embedded roof
Teslas
lithiumion battery
installed South Australia
led massive
drop cost
backing
regions power supply
The powered
wind turbines
reduced price power
outages 90 percent
They taking
surplus electricity
thats produced
Australia
storing putting
grid
I think latest
estimate suggests
theyre making
million dollars day
electricity
theyre storing
pretty impressive
That came bet
Twitter
So
Australian businessman
discussing
feasibility
making city
run solar power
And bet
issued Musk

time
went Ill bet
He batteries place
running
time scale
billionaires bet
thats came it
We reached agreement
Tesla Motor Company
subject legislative
review approval
enable Tesla
build worlds largest
advanced
battery factory
right Silver State
Why
Gigafactory
Its because its
actually gonna be
its gonna
biggest lithiumion
battery factory world
actually
bigger sum
lithiumion
factories world
So its difficult
words
its heck
big factory
Since
Dragon launch
Elon Musk continued
history SpaceX
When Falcon Heavy rocket
launched February 2018
heralded start
new space race
This big deal
This kind Super
Bowl rocket launches
Elon Musk
team proved
Falcon Heavy works
puts
completely different realm
deep space
send Mars
Lifting
launch pad
sent crew
Apollo 11 moon
mission
represented new era
progress space flight
The launch
SpaceX Falcon Heavy
significant
reasons scientifically
I mean its powerful
rocket weve seen launched
Saturn V
took humans moon
Its
small step man
giant leap mankind
We entering new
era space exploration
extremely exciting
Sort continuance
dream Apollo
I Space
Coast launch
I havent seen
busy 2011
space shuttle launched
landed final time
It started
capture peoples imaginations
space exploration
It great achievement
private company
create
successfully launch
biggest lifting
rockets history
Its largest
rocket launched
We Apollo Saturn V
course
shuttle
The Falcon Heavy
order magnitude
It seriously big rocket
The Falcon Heavy
carry 64 tons
Thats lot I
mean its truck
Its equivalent
737 jetliner
filled passengers
filled baggage
filled fuel
lifting
sending space
sending
space
sending
low Earth orbit
sending moon
sending Mars
This launch
political implications
view
American
government preparing
budgeting
NASAs rockets
fact Elon
SpaceX proven
successfully
launch Falcon Heavy
probably
cost 100 million
thats 10 
NASA rockets
budgeting
billion dollars launch
Thats significant
cost saving

private enterprise
right
person helm
chance
execute vision
In order
open access space
weve got achieve
rapid reusability
able
primary rocket booster
gonna huge
impact cost
Now
years smooth
efficient
its I think its
proven work
Of
Musks innovations
developing reusable rockets
radical
We thought
likely
mission work
probably know
chance failure
The Holy Grail space
totally
reusable launch system
So actually
SpaceX Falcon rockets
launching
spacecraft orbit
coming
performing
pinpoint accurate landing
floating platform sea
pretty astonishing
Its tiny target
Its trying land
postage stamp there
Just way
airplane
fly somewhere
wouldnt dream
throwing airplane away

space rockets
Thats SpaceX trying
theyre succeeding
Theyre leading
way moment
Elon getting
people question
NASA building
rockets all
They think SpaceX it
need buy
comparable rocket
We buy
them
Inside Falcon Heavy
rocket plaque
6000 names
SpaceX employees
worked project
shows
hes willing
value people
work him
Elon Musks aspiration
eventually
efforts
developing
far larger rockets
launch
payloads Earth orbit
capable
taking human rated spacecraft
deep space ie Mars
You like 10
20 year horizon
want Mars
 I wanna enable
 SpaceX
I wanna enable large
numbers people
cargo Mars
So its sort
personally
want
journey Mars
I mean
nice personal level
I think important
species
civilization
path
true space ranked civilization
multi planet species
Musk aims launch
mission Mars 2022
Elon Musks ultimate
goal humans
permanently living
working Mars
Martian colony say
Mars special
It sky
landscape
large amounts frozen
water seasons
lot
similarities Earth
The atmosphere thinner
Earths atmosphere
youve got carbon
youve got oxygen
potentially use
whats Marss
atmosphere resources
Its terrestrial
environment
It appears home
home it
It possible lifetime
send rocket
Mars manned
I think thats possible
Do wanna it
Do wanna pay it
Thats different question
Theres lot questions
theres lot hurdles
long
Elon doesnt break
fundamental laws
physics it
Mars reachable Im
sure devise means
live there

questions challenges
achieved
So let Musk
hes gonna it
probably will
If maintains
momentum I reason
shouldnt landing
spacecrafts Mars
Elon Musks
evolvement design
engineering critical
technical decisions
unique peers
Believe me Elon
smart engineering
money side
Even earlier
days Tesla SpaceX
easily said
let
cash there
well
clever technical people
Ill run it
Ill manager
Ill CEO
whatever uhnuhn
To actually able
involved
engineering
side thats amazing
thats did
deep
engineer
I approaches
engineering business
fashion
its puzzle dissected
pieces
way
At heart
man engineer
I think thats
love is
Hell walking SpaceX
talk employees
quiz
things like thrust vectors
aero dynamical design
typical CEO behavior
I think engineering
came naturally
engineering
rational approach
He sort struggled early
CEO role
early companies
certainly weve seen
learned
grew that
I think know
hes sort
package point
I dont think
people argue that
Some entrepreneurs
socially skilled others
theyre necessarily
socially skilled
theyre focused
You see youre
socially skilled human being
youre sensitive
everybody you
prevent
actually getting
achieve objective

objectives mind

ruthless sense
trying achieve
objective
Not ruthless way
treat people necessarily
making sure
theyre timeline
achieve objective
I
enormous PR mistake
landed
page New York post
bad like
mortifyingly bad
I went
tell Elon it
know very
angry me
things said
thing said
stuck was
Julie perception
reality
It time
really
angry
I remember
And fact
didnt me
I think points
nice guy
One things I
fascinating Elon
midst
acumen business sense
interviews
tears cries
talking
wants one
Its easy Elon
It sounds amazing
sounds glamorous
doubt
lot fun
Hes having ball executing
engineering dreams
The flip comes
personal side
aint easy
Elon started dating
famous celebrity
actress time
war
exhusband Johnny Depp
Like I dont know
Amber
men fall
love Amber
fall hard Amber
So
curious showbiz world
Amber
end next
saw
billionaire
kind baby face
lot
finding more
The breakup
Elon Amber
painful Elon

characteristically I suppose
open
people journalists
hurting
At stage
high profile interview
Rolling Stone
actually asked journalist
story
know anybody
set with
Is anybody
know I date
For billionaire guy
like lets honest
decently good looking
talking
wants
nice girlfriend
its dont
come often
Hes fairly open book
So
spending time
journalist earned
trust capacity
wouldnt surprise all
I mean definitely wears
heart sleeve
I hes
big softie underneath
I mean Elon
honest vulnerable
I think thats
people
incredibly endearing
There lot
technological dreams
Elon Musk

decades
I think
wants that
I think Elon Musk
like happily love
Musk continues
invest future
In 2013 outlined
potential world changing plan
transportation
reshape
way humanity travels
Elon Musk came idea
He published white paper
vacuum transport
let go
He said Im
gonna myself
What Im gonna open
party companies
want develop
themselves
The Hyperloop project
huge
terms world
transportation
idea going San
Francisco Los Angeles
time
drive
San Francisco
edge San Francisco
fantastic
Its vacuum tube
air
sucked
tube send pod
containing passengers
tube
Theres friction
theres air resistance
pods
levitating magnets
 The technology sound
We travel faster
vacuum theres friction
They want speeds
500 700 miles hour
Elons idea tubes
connect major cities
travel
passenger pods
travel from say
LA New York
matter half hour
When talking
time
thought oh
time have
lost
little bit
its little bit
ambitious crazy
but
Elons ideas watch space
know it
actually ahead schedule
thing actually
reality
The speed
tunnels dramatic
fast happen
So I think lot
world connected
Well moving cargo 2019
We think passengers
safely transported
Hyperloop 2021
Elon Musk
leading voice
potential
AI apocalypse
He declared
digital super intelligence
threat
survival
human race
To offset this
launched Neuralink
aimed developing safe
beneficial
artificial intelligence
The dangers AI
end human
mind know it
Youre dealing
fundamentally going
smarter you
Its gonna learn own
stay ahead it
Thats Musk
paying close attention to
His main concern that
AI smart
important
need humans
We kind obsolete
The worst nightmare
Hollywood horror
movie come
compared
were heading
heading fast
When AI
ability think
come conclusions
judgments et cetera
like human mind
think
slightest chance
alone AI
planet over
If selfaware
gonna control them
Whos gonna control
controllers
Its scary prospect
What potential
everything
You know potential
is
100 percent its
end humanity
When software rises
powerful
gonna look to
Were gonna look
titans industry
provide counterweight
Elon ideally placed
sort counterpoint
software early vision
I mean its interesting
hes looking
AI
open AI Neuralink
When I hear Elon Musk
talking fact
AI revolution
humanity summoning demon
absolutely is
founding opening
company called Neuralink
connect AI
human brain
I mean contradiction
extraordinary
I dont know
thought processes
going there
Neuralink direct response
Elons concerns
AI place
The fact thinks
AI surpass humans
terms
mental capabilities
makes sense
try develop technology
computers
tandem biology
I think Elon
Musk wants use AI
tool
augmenting self
tool
replacing self
I think hes saying
cant beat them
superhuman
beat them
Brain interfaces
help people
different ways
So way
restore capabilities
people disabilities
application
limitation
And so example
think
controlling
thoughts
moving muscle
thats core
function BCI
braincomputer interface
There lot
different scenarios

apply technology
We talking critical
decision making military
warfare scenario
health sector
So talk
hybrid humans
human
machine cyborgs
talking
thing I think
technology
augment capabilities
thats it
Musks skepticism
potential
risks AI technology
led public clash
Mark Zuckerberg
I optimistic
future AI
I think AI
going unlock
huge
positive things
thats helping
identify cure diseases
help cars drive safely
help
communities safe
going
issues way
Of course are
No technology comes
fully formed
need pioneers
able work

state want
I think its healthy

technology giants
fighting publicly
form
opinion it
Its spectator sport
rest us
Mark Zuckerberg sees
Elon naysayer
whos trying
stop development AI
I sides
argument
Id probably slide slightly
Mark Zuckerberg
sense I think
able control AI
humanity safe
I wouldnt bet Elon
You know Elon thinks
AI gonna
eventually decide
irrational
humans unnecessary
I trust him
You know hasnt
wrong lot
The debate its
good thing it
Its bad thing
way
We stop
immediately
line crossed
humanity more
We need policies
We need start thinking
good application
BCI not
We need
control
able push button
disable
AI moment
Artificial intelligence
generate
successful content
however
replacing humans
Id prefer
working together
We bring unique skills
talents table
Theres gonna difference
whats doable
whats acceptable

Elon gonna decide

Mark Zuckerberg
gonna decide
This I
everybody else
hopefully
translated
eventually legislation
Elon Musks assertion
were likely
living simulated reality
popularized theory
debated philosophers
gaining supporters
Silicon Valley
Elon Musk said
were living kind
computer 3D simulation
I dont know
means were The Matrix
kind matrix
And know bizarre
crazy sounds
Elon saying
bizarre crazy things
turned
true long time now
so I um maybe
Well know you
Well disprove it
cant disprove it
We
lower intelligence

species
far far far
intelligent
theyre
playing God us
It sounds ridiculous
like that
dont know much
Weve barely left
planet
I felt like
saying was
base reality
And so I agree
front
You labeled crazy
youre pushing
boundaries
people expect
Hes coming
scientific perspective
idea theres
true reality
isnt it
actually underpinnings
ancient
religions world
All point exactly
thing hes saying
Im him
Ive saying books
lot longer Elon Musk
live equivalent
massively advanced
virtual reality
game end
And look
evidence overwhelming
certainly immensely compelling

Elon Musk
scientists
coming saying
actually look like that
Ultimately
bit
inproveable theory
I mean going prove
were living
simulation I dont know
Dont discount wacko ideas
suddenly pop
shape another
Im sure
one heh
I think need
meat bone one
I think its interesting
Musk able
like

consider
bit ridiculous thought
worried
ridiculed for
hes actually giving
thought to
I think Musk
looking
foster discussion
Inspired
frustrations
sitting traffic jam
Musks solution
The Boring Company
In 2018 company
selected build high speed
underground transportation
Chicago
I like thank
Mayor Mayors Office
city Chicago
having faith
bet The Boring Company
We think were gonna
good boring
You
Elon Midas touch
started
The Boring Company

boring Earth
opposed dull
actually started selling
baseball caps online
else
literally
million dollars
You know guy
touches
turns gold
Hes kept interested
hes
started tweeting
offers hats
flamethrowers
We interested
gonna happen it
This difficult
thing were doing
Its hard thing
Its new thing
And you know Id hope
youd cheer this
know succeed
its gonna great
thing city
fail well
I guess
lose bunch money
Elon Musk great
engineering minds time
He
greatest business leaders
entrepreneurs time
great
visionaries time
Elon remembered
guys
unafraid
say else
I think greatest achievement
inspiring humanity
think bigger
dream bigger
In world theres
problems
isnt nice
positive story occasionally
Were sort
sitting watching
whats gonna come next
