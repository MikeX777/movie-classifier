In 1942when Germany violated
agreements
I wanted them
The Gestapo arrested me
Fresnesa transfer Drancy That
counts something
You know I escaped Drancy
I hid Castille
He introduced network He
shielded me
Would question vigilance
If Castille trusted him
You suspect me

We drew correlation between
the theft betrayal
A hypothesis
Castille told Le Gueven wasnt
thiefright
Yes
He going unmask thiefright
Yes
He said thief present
 Yes
