Cornelius developed
brilliant hypothesis
But Im probably wrong
That ape evolved
lower order primate
possibly man
In trip forbidden zone

 The evidence meager
 You didnt think then
That Dr Zaius half
Academy said idea heresy
How scientific truth heresy

dating 1300 years roughly
It level I discovered
cutting tools arrowheads quartz
fossilized bones
carnivorous gorillas
But artifacts
Lying
level
date back 700 years earlier
Thats paradox
For ancient culture
advanced
Now admittedly
objects unidentified
But clearly fashioned
beings knowledge metallurgy
Indeed fact tools
unknown
suggests culture
certain ways equals own
Some evidence uncontestable
Dont speak absolutes
The evidence contestable
I apologize sir
To begin with methods dating
past crude least
There geologists staff
whod laugh speculations
But theres doll sir
