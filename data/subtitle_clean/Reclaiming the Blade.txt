The Medieval

Before invention

To think pummel

ways theyre different
old techniques
With sword blades Ill start
bar spring steel
Usually Ill cut grind

swords clashing
The point choreography
play movie

If
successful
Its designed
actually real fight
its designed
exciting swords
Theres undeniable
romanticism attached all
And theres
grittier films I think
tend steer clear
mechanics
sword
human body
And look
good screen
I think know I honestly
believe real fight
short sharp
Its
piece art

appreciated way
Its

Few subjects received
unfortunate neglect

We lots records

Yet today
historians fully understand
Yet today
historians fully understand
significant role

And large extent
history lost us
The sobering death toll

In time proper decorum

By 19th century fighting

As pursued

Today people hear
term martial arts
immediately bring mind
fighting arts East
karate taekwondo
Theres esoteric concept
kill efficiently

killing that
opinion absent
Westem swording styles
opposed Eastem
In respects
West attitude
Japanese
handled differently
So theres
different things
We tendency
forget West
tradition
martial arts well
European fighting skills
tend sort relegated

sort crude basic
wasnt
Whats funny
dont remember
human bodys
world over
And depends
body moves
thats govemed
body mechanics
Its somewhat amusing
dEbute oriental
martial arts glancing
European manual on
wrestling
handtohand combat say
Oh wow
like Japanese
Things Asia Japan
viewed sort
pinnacle fighting skills
skillful were
skillful here
But
forgot them
As youre comparing two
look quickly West
seized firearm
great use it
Whereas Japan
brief period time
Tokugawa Shogunate
established banned
destroy
social culture
When peasant blast
samurai 50 yards away
unthinkable
Martial arts East
hierarchical
orally transmitted
person next
Pretty much
heredity thing

born samurai
So essentially father
son master disciple
When course big
difference schools
oriental schools
continued flourish
How far theyre teaching
exactly sorts things

anybodys guess
You remember game

Eastem martial arts long
continuous history
West martial arts
sword particular
died lot
Renaissance
As gun improved
sword relegated

important
People stopped training
teaching old arts
There necessity need
learn things anymore
So essentially break
history sword
Western world
What sword
used
Before practical
swordplay developed
gentlemens ritual
single dueling
masters defense
flourished Europe
Many surviving
manuscripts detailing
combative systems remained
largely obscure centuries
now
Today historical fencing
studies rise
unprecedented revival
extinct combative systems

Historical fencing students

So theres strong

Many old
fighting manuals treaties

15th 16th centuries
recently rediscovered
studied worldwide
We focus mainly
German manuals
ltalian manuals
15th century 16th century
My personal favorite
Talhoffer
For
ltalian books
German books Spanish
books fighting arts
forgotten
hidden old libraries
monasteries old
archives universities
Unfortunately little
research them
For part
looked
hundreds years
Today old texts
systematically
studied ancient fighting
skills reborn
In text old masters
actually request
students study
source literature
instance ask
add text
bringing ideas
expanding it
These arts existed
forms evolved
hand hand
societies created them
Theres equivalent
worlds
traditional martial arts
They dont volumes
technical literature
have
This westem tradition
A lot people leam martial

This source literature
This whats going tell


today
When looks books
arms armor
incredible
diversity design
weaponry apparent
Therefore stands reason

equally sophisticated manner
weapons
I inspired works
gentleman named
Ewart Oakeshott
Oakeshott considered
worlds leading authority
European swords
medieval swords particular
Most academics look
quaint curiosities
real concept
sword
used
Ewart
was
These weapons
young men
kill young men
real weapon
real people
The typology sword
Ewart Oakeshott devised
included classification
historical blades
Oakshotts classifications
unlocked mythical doors
obscured true history
European martial combat
I think look
Anglo Saxon blades example
Viking blades ordinary
warriors long knife
spear shield
dont sword
There swords
comparison number
axes spears
Spearheads axes
blacksmith make
You swordsmith
technology
able
sword
I feel real connection
ancient smiths
I like
tools had
fuel had
clay water
hand hammer
charcoal
I modern shop too
Ive got air hammers
gas forgers electric kilns
I experimentation
making sure
I think happening
ancient way
actually happening
modern tests
What affects
chemistry
Say Well
stuff
iron sand
dirt basically
Its kind magic
The I learned
I realized
theres different ways
different cultures

I try that
I dont like
reading
putting book
shelf
I want l
right causes
lot sleepless
nights lot work
lot
trial error
I feel collector
like
utility attempting
rediscover sword
I provide swordsmith
Paul opportunity
careful
measurements
original swords
survived
rediscovering way

great performance
materials techniques
primitive todays
technological standards
Well
debate going
Is Japanese sword better
Or Chinese sword
Or Chinese taught
Japanese techniques
basically its
refined Chinese sword
Well European
swords better
whoots
lndiantype blades better
Ive working lot
traditions Im finding
similarities
solved problems
I finding differences
But different
ways them
different ways stack them
Some twists
didnt use
twisted steel
But solved problems
similar fashion
And intrigued me
I figured things
wrong books
things werent
written books
things I feel
right actually
trying testing
swords breaking swords
analyzing things
I enjoyed getting
primary knowledge
Definitely people smelt
steel test
blades
things
Where I feel connection

It looks like corroded lump

awe inspiring sight
The xrays revealed
extraordinarily
sophisticated piece

It proved
incredibly important weapon
One
important weapons
I think its fair say
Britain
Its actually composed
central core strands
iron worked
twisted welded together
On edge added

like technique
called Patton welding
An iron core
forgewelded steel edge

Youd sword

Because broken sword
hand battle
youre done
I wouldnt want smith
customer came

sword hand going
Hey

short indeed
Theres handful

Experts weve talked
British Museum

are

technological sophistication
staggeringly rare
If actually looked
home medieval
warrior warrior
culture century 2 ago
sword wouldve really
know represented
technologically
advanced item house
It represents epitome
technology weapons technology
age
It is I suppose
modern analogy
like
stealth fighter
The thing I
certainty its very
difficult
these
You wouldnt let smith
knew secrets making
sword like
wander about
They kept
closely guarded king
The information

incredibly
jealously guarded secret
The process
long arduous
requires incredible
level skill
He
mastery metals
He known exactly
fire
bits forge hard
hit it hit it
importantly
hit it
One single blow shatter
blade like easily
its
wrong temperature
Literally tens thousands
hammer blows right
When manufacture blade
like dont
it live it
dream
think
single moment
It reflect
best craftsmanship
best applied
art culture
I generally try
pieces
Patton welding
complicated process
That translated
3D reconstruction

together
There cleanliness
line economy weight
efficient durable
light possible
Im continually impressed
end beautiful
objects are
Highend warriors kings
want
precious metals
precious stones
The idea dont need
sword
precious
I think speaks volumes
There lot
thought
regular soldier actually
preserve blade damage
Simply employ person
caliber individual

cost fortune
cost
absolute fortune
If look old swords
tell ones
parry
bone break
You tell
bone breaks too
Its actually notched
chipped sides
suggest
repeatedly battle
A sword quality
owned
incredibly important
It probably owned
kings Northumbria
possibly
suggest
200 300 years use
So
heirloom

Movie combat curious
undertaking its
realistic generally
It doesnt portray
historical weaponry

makes sense
Swords dont noise

Its life fantasy
It doesnt reflect way
human beings actually behave
violent
personal armed combat
Mainly
movies nowadays
focus
techniques
moves displaying
medieval Europe
They focus Asian
techniques et cetera
thats way

Westem martial arts

theyre mixing elements
Asian martial arts
place there
want
realistic
So little bit
kung fu little bit of
know little
bit everything
Most time lot
movies good
The problem I
lot people
audience think
way use sword
Its purely entertainment
true
But certainly
makes job harder
We teach people No
swords going cut
guy plate armor
cant cut through
cut Z somebodys chest
But
things theyre
interesting
theyre real
Many study classical fencing
European martial arts
believe
audience realism combined
credible performances
enjoy embrace it
I think theres
generation moviegoers
readers ready that
theyre asking that
Classical fences historical
European martial artists
scholars shown
wonderful craft
lost

exist again
There have recently
movies
focusing little bit
European martial arts
Good examples films
feature combat based specific
historical swordsmanship include
Rob Roy Gladiator
Troy Kingdom Heaven
Alatriste
In cases people
tune better job
researching true
style period
As I said
Bob well
For example
Alatriste
theyre Bob
swordslapping scenes know
His goal
credibility naturalism
fights way
reason people
careful going theyre
commit commit
fully
small wound times
infection
die that
Youre going kill
its quickly
They violent know
