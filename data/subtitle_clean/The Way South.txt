restructuring
The architect calculated
cost materials
He expected
work ourselves
We touch people

I helped friends conversion
group
We involved
soon possible help
But apply
political pressure
friends
local politics

FOR PEACE AND SECURITY
Down riot squad
4 May Remembrance Day
World War II dead
I joined personal reasons
Not result
histórical analysis
Its because
housing situation terrible
you
Its lots people
And talking people
reading it
know
people squat
step
active movement
works lot people
Its time solution
housing problem
If city policies
sluggish
wait forever
initiative ourselves
But youve got
problem
democracy bypass
is
But existing
distribution housing
inadequate
You wait eternity
quietly
live normally
join group large group
people prepared
things
hands
If housing
thered squatters
But authorities arent
addressing problem
were forced to
The authorities lost power
it
Or thats saying
We think something
Theres vacant office space
These buildings arent
people live there
Exactly But authorities
pretend powerless
grant planning
permit offices
Its opposite powerlessness
Its choice people
needing accommodation
Thats way look it
They promised
temporary apartments here
And mysterious way
year later
theres office block
Where were sitting now
 Where now
But feel taking action
behalf people too
For ordinary people
 We ordinary people
Well described
group students
I think its ridiculous
try label us
Its right There sorts
people here All young though
But
working young people I think
This mixed bunch
But I think happen
does squats arise
people
different position
its difficult step
You women
refuge homes
They dont feel capable
organising squat themselves
join existing group
squat along
You happening
families foreign immigrants
thats good thing
You deliberately
commune setup
What imply
That deliberately opt
living
group people
lots things communally
And that
 Why choose live like that
I think that far weve
individualistic lives
encouraged
society having career
And discover
ways living
family home
fence garden
That its possible live
lots people
Loneliness reason
people live married
And notice
split up
thrown
resources
its big step take
One reason I wanted
live group was
I share fear
others
wouldnt emotionally
dependent person
And person
isnt emotionally dependent me
But I like having people
share things with
Id like
subject violence
The squatters movement decided
hit back
Youre going
beaten here
It wasnt decision
movement whole
fact dont
accept beating
The way can
fulfil justified wishes
sure
dont beaten up
Thats people
squatters getting militant
As squatters armed
helmets iron bars etcetera
But its reaction
threat
attacked police
gang hired thugs
thrown street
Thats were barricaded
The way feel safe here
turning
kind fort

outside world
I think its awful
try
peacefully meet violence
Its disappointment
I think We idealists
stupid
Are bitter it
 I am really
Im afraid whats going happen
future
If seeing uniforms
everywhere
feel arrested
moment
Were heading police state
I imagine
theres threat war
feeling
The constant threat
continual fear
You feel threatened
 Terribly
You too
Certainly yes
 Yes
How express itself
Its permanent feeling It takes
day week
The constant possibility
hired thugs arriving
And interpretation press
provoked them
Its roundtheclock thing
I lie worrying night too
Do sleep well
 Usually I do Im tired
Tired sleep well
