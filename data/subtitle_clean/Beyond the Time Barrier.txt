Whats got it
Everything
Major 2024
 Its what
 2024
Sixtyfour years
future you Major
The plague talking
about hadnt happened
world 1960
It began 1971
An atomic war
No no
The feared nuclear war
occurred
When man set foot moon
nations started
work
push space
By 1970 colonies
established Mars
Venus
Then wasnt nuclear
war cause it
A bombardment
cosmic radiation
outer space
Bombardment outer space
Oh now wait minute
You wait
Now listen me Allison
The people world
concerned
nuclear fallout
Well heh danger
extreme
The tons radioactive dust
mushroomed
ionosphere

Abomb test
That dust remained there
its slowly destroying
protective screen
filtered deadly
cosmic rays space
time began
Do understand Major
Yes
And nuclear explosions
taken place
Earth
contributed this
Yes
And human left
mutant
Or sterile
Or combination both
If true
Colonel Martin

caught it
Whats happened them
How I out
There isnt way
Lets hope
lucky ones
evacuate
Evacuate
Yes
In 1973 mass
evacuation began
planet colonies
Only uninfected ones
permitted go
The ones left
moved underground
fast possible
started building
networks tunnels
Like one
More half population
world wiped
year
I see
When I landed air base
completely destroyed
demolished
Deserted
You landed You didnt crash
The captain
When you
destroyed ship
No no I left air base
They captured afterwards
Then plane
operating condition
sitting
air base
Well I suppose so
Unless mutants
it

Kruse you
He plan
I dont know Id better
seeing not
We able

time
How I possibly
time
I dont know I got here
You dont Kruse
Bourman do
Look me
Why Kruse Bourman
Or Even you Markova
Thered gained
returning time
Its different you
Youre plague
You able to
I able prevent it
mean
Of course
Youve got chance
If
people prevent plague
happen
Lets talk
Kruse Bourman
Come on
Yes I agree
I
time 1960
Oh
good chance Major
reverse phenomenon
brought here
What phenomenon
bring here
It know
relativity paradox
Its dimension
fifth dimension
Fifth dimension
Professor Bourmans principle
gravitation propulsion
brought about
By 1970
standard
travel planets
speed light
The speed light
I thought 10000 miles hour
fast
Yes
pitfall
system
At speeds approaching
light
possible break
time lock
The um barrier
holds things
normal time relationship
other
Thats
happened us
We slipped
time sphere
another
Captain Markova
broke 1973
flight
She transporting supply
Central Europe
Venus planet
The captains men
destroyed ship
It happened Kruse I
years later
We returned earth
observation flight
1994
Our ship crashed
1994
But speed I approached
X80
near
speed light
That be
But
create certain
mathematical conditions
Let you
Here symbols
represent earth
sun ship
Now consider known facts
The earth rotating
1000 miles hour
But revolving
orbit sun
66000 miles hour
Time know
relative movements
But entire solar system
systems
galaxy
moving space
million miles hour
Theoretically
velocity
approaching speed light
left ground
Yes moving
speed together
unit
The air earth
according law gravity
Time affected
laws gravity
This happened you
At point
highspeed flight
approached escape velocity
Twentyfive thousand
miles hour
It time
altered flight angle
If hadnt probably
gone orbit
It angle
specific altitude velocity
broke time barrier
For fraction second
suspended space
longer interlocked
time spheres
sun earth
Now split second
galaxy moved onward time
amounted 65 years
An instant later
rejoined solar system
rest know
Yes
Then I repeat
altitude angle flight
speed directly
opposite direction
I time
65 years
Precisely
Dr Bourman working
formula
The factors exact
Then locate
escape citadel
 I ship
 Right
We obtain early map
citadel
tunnel work
Your air base surely
included
They began construction
early 1972
The maps file
Supremes chamber
There way
them Major
You mean Trirene
 Thats way
 No
No I wont turn
people
You it
Its you Major
You havent time
decide
Very well
Ill it
You stay here
Ill way back

What I you
Trirene
Tell know
Im right thing
Ive got try back
You understand that
dont you
There wont
citadel
You people live
surface earth
fear
cosmic plague
Theyre waiting
I tracing
original map
Then Trirene returned
archives
Here let you
Now Heres citadel
I remember wooded area
hill
The solar antenna
atop hill
They hit
paralyzing ray here
This outlet
Perimeter 22B
Heres highway
If I that
I follow directly
air base
We need gun hidden
 And flight suit
 Yes
What
time lock formula
Im working now
Im finished
If goes wrong Allison
way
hours
It great problem
Trirene lead
guards
Good
No
equipment Master
Its
devices
prevent
watching them
Theyre planning escape
I know it
Ill stop scheme
Just word
They try again
Trirene helping them
I fear future done
Captain
We returned cave
men lived earth
We returned
birthplace die
Through Allison Trirene
hope Master
Perhaps great hope
There truth
say
Some chance young man
return time
plague
No its trick
We
let major escape
Do forget Master
observers
sighted mutant scouts
yesterday
This time
great caution
I speak him
Perhaps I persuade
accept way
Yes Supreme
Let bring you
Whats meaning this
Dont ask questions
The Supreme I trusted you
Were aware scheme
I explain forever
Youd understand
I warned stay away
three

Supreme
Then dont
believe its possible
return time
Kruse Bourman think
plague prevented
I
inform people
I truly wish I
believe reasoning
But
purpose
Theyll bring others
Theyll destroy citadel
But dont understand
Im time
happened
I back
Such things exist
Kruse created
illusions mind
Look As far
Im concerned its 1960
You people believe its
2024 time please
None real
Its illusion me
No son
Youre wrong
Here touch hand
Is real flesh
And walls
