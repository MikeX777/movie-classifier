Im thinking new project
This record Im planning making movie
Companies providing new terminals imaging now
Its New Wave Media
Izawa war bringing new situation
And information attack 
Itll change operations information fighting information well use weapon

But upper class losing sensitivity passion cinema
So I want entrust younger generation

Well certainly unusual kind conversation

The couple world walking worlds end
The continued cold wind
They finally arrived worlds end
It mountain God lives
They climbed mountain pepper lips prayed world end
Everything disappeared
Mountains Men Women Colors Even light
Then God appeared blessed couple
Then God remade world again
Eternally new
nostalgic
Attention Todays studio inspection cancelled
An accident occurred
Ochiais head directly struck lighting targeted
Everyone establishment brought
colleague Yoshida suddenly chosen new director
No imagined hed singled director
It proceeded movie scenario
Once days boredom returned

The man staring us replied
No 
They chilling eyes
Determined eyes
They eyes awaiting death
This time men asked us
Is father
I scared couldnt anything
So I ran
I ran turned around
I couldnt man anymore
Because group men surrounded man wouldnt stop beating him
My mother pulled hand ran ran
But matter went Hell
But burned eyes

That look
The eyes determined man
The look man challenging death
The eyes
This ridiculous
Determined people people scoff things All humans worthless
Its stupid
Its hilarious I laugh it
