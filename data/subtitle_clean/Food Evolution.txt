The survival species

food agriculture
There 73 billion
people planet
The worlds population expected
9 billion 2050
Climate change gonna
scramble
How gonna feed
world debate
This companies
controlling future
So
conflict confusion

informed decisions
feed ourselves
We pivotal time
history island
I council
restrict use GMOs
The point
opportunity act
To something We
history island
Lets island model
rest world
Thank you
I concerned
health issues
related GMOs
number different levels
My approach was Hey
Were gonna close door island
You dont come

information safe
Theres lot going
island
This ground zero entire world
terms experimentation
GMOs seed production
This rare opportunity
shots people spraying
We society
stupid things
I feel like GMO
thoughtless invasive species
brought here
If theyre safe
great Bring jobs
You know merrier
If youre helping island
youre feeding people
youre
welcome Theyre farmers
Theyre mad scientists
No GMO
With conflict
genetically modified organisms
Hawaii
ground zero battle
feed
world sustainably
A long day testimony
proposed laws prohibiting
genetically modified
organisms Hawaii Island
Before voting
Hawaii county council
tried answers
safety concerns
related GMOs
Okay Im calling
meeting order
Aloha Mr Smith
 Or Dr Smith
 Aloha
No Jefferys fine
Have heard rainbow papaya
Oh yes I aware
eating papaya thats
genetically engineered
cause colds
susceptibility
hepatitis HIV
And again
completely backed
peerreviewed
published studies
Weve actually
population risk
Here Hilo
Most testimony emotional
Everybody saying GMOs
dangerous theyre not
Theres single credible study
Its caused people
intentionally
making people scared
For people
living growing GMOs
know Hawaiian
everybody giving
probably bend backwards
help burn papayas
grow decent
The face issue
papaya You know
The face issue
huge multinational companies
Thats guys dealing with
One criticisms
I receive Okay Margaret
this is youre antiprogress
You antiscience
What I is
know whos unscientific
A study French molecular
biologist GillesEric SÃ©ralini
provides solid evidence
showing rats fed GMOs
sprayed glyphosate
toxic Roundup herbicide
developed tumors
took bodies
The biggest risk associated todays
genetically engineered crops
socalled
Roundup Ready crops
significant
increase pesticide use
Theres remarkable
correlations use
glyphosate GMOs
rates autism America
Also obesity
diabetes Alzheimers
All things correlate
very strongly
So I think eventually
solution thats
actually going work
long run organic
Thank you
How scientists
audience
Please raise hand
With degrees
I want facts
True facts Without fear
Without else
Facts And best decision
facts
I yield
Im Dennis Gonsalves
actually proudly
developed rainbow papaya
If dont want use GMOs
dont believe
manipulating plants
way process does
I respect belief
But now say
GMOs safe
I say Now data
Theres absolutely
proof health hazard
Absolutely proof
Talk cheap
research
And I stand it
 Thank you Were
 Boo
I biology major
I expertise area
There middle ground
Youre gonna GMO allowing
GMO youre gonna organic
allow GMO
They coexist
Thank much Then Madame Clerk
motion approve Bill 113
Draft 3 second final reading
 Aye
 No
 Aye
 Aye
 Aye
 No
 Aye
 Aye
You ayes
 Thank you
 Bill 113 adopted
Motion adjourn
You know I said
Youre gonna away
I help it
And stopped it
Hawaiis ban genetically
modified organisms
frightening evidence
presented testimony
headlines world
It hailed rallying
global leaders
movement GMOs
I think island
truth speaking world
GMOs extension pesticides
substitute alternative it
So dont tell Monsanto cant beaten
Theyve beat
again
And again
Organic isnt ceiling
Organics floor
And that build
new house food
This actually movement
spreading country
Speaking
way Moscow Margaret
Why ban
We want protect
future generations
contamination
Do want GMO
species island Period
You kids sick
But if trying
right thing
council got wrong
Its frustrating
people dont know
breeding method making choices
avoid based information
thats supported
scientific literature
You think
terrifying letters
English language GMO
So I wondered people
know are
What GMO stand for
G GM I dont know
Aw man
It its genetically modif modi
I dont know What it
I know its bad but
completely honest
you I idea
A GMO undefined term
Its genetically
modified organism
I argue
Chihuahua Great Dane
genetically modified relative
ancestor wolf
A GMO organism thats
genetic makeup altered
insertion DNA
thats outside
normal genetic makeup
So mean
At basic
genetic engineering
or say GE
modern form breeding
farmers
thousands years select
desirable
traits provide food
growing population
In fact its hard
food natural
Conventional
organic crops
genetically modified
selective breeding
The goal genetic engineering
add useful traits food
Traits currently
help weed insect
disease control staple crops
billions
meals consumed day
In fact genetic engineering
lives
longer aware
Probably
familiar insulin
Genetically engineered insulin
Its important patients
suffering diabetes
Biotechnology kind
cheesemaking now
So youre eating cheese
youre eating product biotechnology
Scientists working
genetically engineer seeds
aid humanitarian causes
vitaminenrichment
crops like golden rice
Golden rice rice engineered
high levels
beta carotene
gets turned vitamin A
And its proposed years ago
solution vitamin A deficiency
developing world
In addition helping
millions children
stave potentially
fatal vitamin deficiencies
scientists developing crops
tolerance drought
rice corn wheat
prove essential
face climate change
And disease resistance
save crops like
Hawaiian papaya
completely wiped out
In fact farmers
grow rainbow papaya
convinced Hawaii council
amend ban GMOs
Papaya industry farmers
flooded council chamber
To insinuate GMO
unhealthy true
I need help
Those live
Big Island
aware
agricultural biotechnology
saved papaya
industry island
Its reported
Councilwoman Wille
plans amend further
And approach way Ive it
Which is basically grandfather in
number one papaya industry
Its impractical
point
If horrible
health issues related GMOs
exempt rainbow papaya
Why try island
Like well
thought that
Okay I did
lot criticism
final bill
We body pass this
shows think
GMOs wrong
Except this this this this this
Are worried rainbow papaya
cause somebody have
I dont know You know I idea
This exempts everyone
However think its wrong
Whats number one like problem
You know what You focusing papaya
I exempted know
I exempted it So its
like youre home free
So I dont
At time I wanted
passed
Its done
While evidence presented
council strong
scary ban GMOs
exempted rainbow papaya
genetically engineered fix
helped cherished crop
come dead
short time ago
Twenty years ago
Big Island papaya
industry thriving
Growers shipping 60 million
pounds papayas year
But insects began spreading
devastating virus called ringspot
nearly papaya
tree island
In years
trees dead
industry literally wiped out
Nothing stopped spread
Not physical barriers
Not pesticides
No methods conventional
organic halt virus
As scientist
working
think
alternative solutions
And I idea
The idea vaccinating plant
genetic engineering
What is
took hypothesis
We isolated gene
pathogen
We cloned gene
recombinant DNA technology
We gene gun
introduce clone genes
cells papaya
And doesnt work
times
repeat
experiments
And took seven
years research
We continue were satisfied
correct sequence
Now scientific method
verify results
A years later
results dramatic
The nongenetically engineered
papaya growing
genetically engineered
papaya growing
So concluded
genetically engineered papaya
resistant
We released seeds growers free
Essentially saved papaya industry
Thats it
Today industry thriving
exporting rainbow papaya
countries world
But people
enjoyed genetically
engineered fruit
vocal movement began rise

process saved it
Here come Genetically
engineered tomatoes
Were creating new species
thats existed Earth before
So say
Youve created monster
A Frankenfood
These foods create new allergies
They nontoxic food toxic
They lower immune response
They lower nutrition
The gap
public science
safety GMOs
largest gap
politicized scientific topic
I careful say
This dangerous food
And I dont believe
fear mongering helped
Okay good So thats good control
I think its important
concept scientific consensus
So trust
scientist opinion
You look consensus experts
field 20 30 years
After 30 years
testing GMO product
currently market
based results
nearly 2000 experiments
foremost scientific institutions
United States
world concluded
All criticisms
GMOs largely rejected
strictly scientific criteria
I dont think
genetically modified organisms
dangerous consume
We dont evidence
products
market
caused particular harm
No adverse health effects
attributed genetic engineering
documented
human population
I looked closely health
I went environmental effects
And I kind ran
things to worry about
The science clear
crop improvement modern
molecular techniques
biotechnology safe
While new product
continue assessed
casebycase
basis
scientific consensus tells
current GMOs
market safe eat
safe environment
Theres absolutely
proof health hazard
We research
I stand it
 Boo
 Were g
We ought congratulate Margaret really
We absolutely outmaneuvered
Snookered
Because time
given Jeffery Smith
ranted raved
Eating papaya thats
genetically engineered
cause colds
more susceptibility
hepatitis HIV
What Jeffery Smith said
convincing true
 Yeah
 But hes lying
scare people
Jeffery Smith
innocentlooking person
things
wild crazy things
astounding hear
straight face
We know GMOs
consumed human beings
switch
shut genes
Its theoretical possibility
evaluated
Things like that So thats Jeffery Smith
And I know
wide audience
Do consider scientist
Im scientist
Do you doctor
Im doctor
 Aloha Mr Smith
 Aloha
 Is Dr Smith
 No Jefferys fine
People refer doctor time
I wrong
I dont call I dont
doctor
I dont scientist
And I use nonscientist
its advantage
I ask
lot dumb questions
hear
peoples assumptions
And I record them
They smart
clever
misinforming people
Theres remarkable correlations
use GMO
rates autism America
She showed slide that
past years
something incidents
autism United States
went up
up up up up up up
And superimposed
use Roundup
And statement
the
exactly perfect match
said loud
I seen better correlation
Remarkable I
seen good correlation
coefficient
things
So I think
solution organic
And look
consumption organic food
better match
So theres autism prevalence
United States
organic food sales
So organic foods then cause autism
Must cause autism
It clear
that Brenda Ford
Margaret Wille
interested gathering facts
 Yeah
 Theyre interested getting
fellow county council people scared
Bill 113 adopted
The general nature people
probably vote Democrat like me
Theyre kind leftleaning like me
They probably think
global warming problem
care of like me
They probably agree things
And reason
battle GMOs
complicated confusing
Both sides fighting
same worthwhile goals
safe abundant
nutritious food all
Three generations GMOs
 Excellent
 Thank you
Fewer toxic chemicals
world
sustainable food system
These victors
In years
look say
How save planet
There go
But
realworld consequences
acting
scientific consensus
felt far
shores Hawaii
Now Hawaiian island
passed law banning companies
produce
genetically modified food
operating territory
Marin County California
A GMO ban
ballot passed
Im expert
right
Americans know
whats food
Vermont passed mandating
genetically modified
foods labeled
We dont want GMOs
Scotland ban
genetically modified crops
I come conclusion
justifiable
reason believe
genetically
modified maize presents
danger environment
Growing genetically modified food
banned EU
Today 150000 farmers India
committed suicide areas
buy
seed Monsanto
A devastating drought
hit southern Africa
The American government
sent shipment food aid
containing GM corn
Zambia refused it
Available data shows
GMO foods cause harm
Making reference
SÃ©ralini report
The government decided
GMO food imports
completely banned
Uganda doesnt need GMOs
The fears decisions
GMOs Hawaii reach
way Uganda
east Africa
bananas similar
Hawaiian papaya
threatened wiped
terrible disease
Most bananas
region faced
worst bacterial
disease far
known Banana Xanthomonas Wilt
The disease
devastating impact
banana cultivation
forcing farmers
abandon crop
Currently nearly half
banana plants Uganda
wiped banana wilt
threatening food security
14 million Ugandans
population
Mmhmm
Famine
My Emma Naluyima Mugerwa
I practice integrated
organic farming
I teach farmers
same
Right now banana wilt
affecting me
affected people
Banana bacteria spread
farm time
Thats I teach farmers
My idea guard it
Dont let people come garden
Dont share tools
Like tool rack
All tools garden
We use else
If must
disinfect
All preventive measure
Theyre curative measures
She food
family
shes devastated
Once hit
cut down burn
wait maybe
months year
garden
I
Ebola banana
It comes wipes away
plantation
To fight devastation
banana wilt
scientists Uganda
Kenya working
genetically
engineered fix similar

Hawaii papaya
Except work
locked gate
currently prohibited
released public
Hi Im Leena Tripathi
Im leading transgenic
research IITA
focus disease
pest resistance
So
resistant genes sweet pepper
These genes
transfer resistance
sweet pepper banana
This message brought
Action Aid Uganda
Did know genetically
modified organisms
pose health risks cancer
infertility et
cetera The national
I read rats getting
cancer GMOs
Definitely scare me
Even Africa fewer
GMOs fueled
discredited study
tumor prone rats
Heres picture
rats
So Jeffery why know

information ignored
Theyve got bad science
science
How people seen
pictures rats
Thats enough Youve
got tumors
A study GillesEric SÃ©ralini
showing rats fed GMOs
This enormous effects people
This image responsible
GM import ban Kenya
Making reference SÃ©ralini report
The SÃ©ralini infamous SÃ©ralini study
So study scientist says
I rats cancer
Yeah press
conference demanded
scientists
question results
If look closely
study SÃ©ralini
strain rats
prone develop tumors
matter eat
The conclusions drawn
warranted
data obtained
From Ive read
issues
SÃ©ralini study
Ive talked people I respect
look science say
Statistically this
actually doesnt hold up
And paper retracted
Every scientist world
looked said
data inadequate
Even SÃ©ralinis
paper retracted
effect publishing
original paper lingers
lingers lingers
And its gonna
long time away
Its easier sell
fear science
And I think need
talk science
discuss
things open
 Hi
 Hi Im Allison
Im professor University
California Davis
 Oh
 Oh good
Dont think putting
chemicals food
animals isnt dangerous
Well I think that I mean
if particular sign
I think referring
SÃ©ralini rat study
Im guessing
And its retracted
scientific literature
This topic GMOs bit
like playing WhackaMole
And theres
different issues pop up
That 250000 Indian farmers
years
so committed suicides
And issues
pops lot
farmer suicides India
So the farmer suicides
I mean I know Ive looked
scientific literature that
And are reports

increase farmer suicides
When actually look
data that
rate suicide
introduction GM crops
hasnt changed
Its matter debt
its actually associated
use GM technology
Its confusing
causation correlation
Well I just I wondering
theres application GMOs
supportive of
So example if
developing country
developed insectresistant
or diseaseresistant
cassava example
Developed
researchers country
associated
Monsanto company
gave people use
you
supportive that conceptually
I definitely I definitely
look that
I appreciate your
feedback this
Well and Im happy talk you
And I guess frustrates is
I think technology potential
gets kind mixed
lot concerns
multinational control
Maybe its andor
I agree Can agree that
All right Okay Heres card
It nice talking ladies
Thank much I appreciate it
 Okay
 Thanks Allison
 Byebye
 Byebye
I wish
discussion

concerns people
trying scare
bejesus people
The protests spreading
I hate British government
I hate American government
This money
This power
 Corporate greed
 Corruption Money politics
All create
money themselves
From oil companies
denying climate change
tobacco scientists saying
cigarettes safe
pharmaceutical industry
overcharging
drugs dont need
corporate greed bias
broken publics trust
People wont
scientists trust
governments trust
We think theres
kind corporate influence
Monsantos ones
running show
And theres good reasons
people dont trust
corporations run things
Monsanto devil
Pretends hes scientist
Monsantos devil
The past need
predator
Evolution kiss
Monsanto devil
And devil slain
Devil Monsanto listen
Yeah hey
Monsanto
hated companies world
How happen
In early history
chemical company
manufactured products
turned
unintended health
environmental consequences
To combat malariatransmitting
mosquitoes World War II
Monsanto
companies manufactured DDT
helped save millions lives
But environmental
author Rachel Carson
pointed landmark
book Silent Spring
hidden
dangers toxicity
overuse DDT
chemicals
Monsanto
companies
commissioned US Military
Agent Orange
help clear away jungle
Vietnam War
But contaminated soil water
linked
variety birth defects
With public rightly questioning
overuse toxic
chemicals farming
Monsanto looked
new technology
genetic engineering
help farmers
timeless struggle
weeds insects
And help recoup
billions dollars
spent developing technology
Monsanto focused commodity crops
patenting seeds
corn soy cotton
While helped
invent technology
didnt invent patents
Almost agricultural advance
conventional
organic farming
patent it
The GMO Monsanto
introduced
help farmers protect
crops insects
naturally occurring
insecticide known Bt
Bt Bacillus thuringiensis
bacterial disease caterpillars
Organic farmers use that
We use that
By Monsanto engineering
Bt seed
need spraying
greatly reduced
Bt crops reduced
insecticide use
tenfold United States
huge impact
developing countries
The GMO Monsanto introduced
helped farmers control weeds
providing seeds tolerant
herbicide glyphosate
known Roundup
These seeds known
Roundup Ready seeds
They sprayed Roundup
kill weeds
harm crops
Let tell overjoyed
Roundup Ready seeds available
It gift God
I mean big deal
Both Bt Roundup Ready
GMOs huge successes
currently
90 corn soy
cotton farmers
United States
world
And success Monsanto
continues make
billions dollars
They came trick
spray
herbicide
want them
Good company sell seeds
sell herbicide
These war criminals
poison criminals
GMO criminals
This brings
major questions debate
Have GMO technologies like Bt
Roundup Ready
increased decreased
use harmful pesticides
Agricultural economist
Charles Benbrook
authored landmark study
subject GMO crops
pesticide use
This technology led farmers path
requires pesticides
far 1996
technology adopted
Theres lot discussion
herbicides
pesticides increased
advent GM crops
Some people Dr Benbrook
example say
Well pesticide use gone up
And gives
statistics use Roundup
The pesticides
sort point
The question is Are
harmful
Are dangerous
They point
glyphosate
course very
low toxicity
Lower caffeine salt
Ironically
harmful herbicides
glyphosate replaced
pounds doesnt equal toxicity up
I tell people
people fierce attacking GE
I say You know won
succeed banning technology
lets you got dream
Where be
Well 1996
This golden age
American agriculture
The weeds gonna grow
So youve got
weeds
Wed probably
toxic ones
prior
introduction
Roundup Ready crops
And look details
past page Benbrooks study
acknowledges
benefits dangers
technologies
In light generally
favorable environmental
toxicological properties
especially compared
herbicides
displaced glyphosate
dramatic increase
glyphosate use
likely markedly
increased human health risks
So data considered
GMO technologies like
Bt Roundup Ready
decreased use
harmful pesticides
Simply put net impact
better environment
Its difficult
pay Monsanto compliment
Its like praising witchcraft
People cant imagine
company
benefit environment
thats whats happened
A Dr Oz Alert
The new GMO pesticide arms race
doctors warning against
Im concerned that
Im beginning
catastrophe
So safety sacrificed
order maximize profits
But public
expecting hate
coming Monsanto
championed Benbrooks study
peerreviewed
scientific evidence
GMOs cause harm
And perceived
umbilical connection
the GMO
chemical pesticide
which I think
stuck peoples heads
Hell no GMO
While
bundled concerns
Monsanto company
concerned safety
GMOs misinformed
Yes Lets ahead sit
good seats
The world live
youre young
environmental activist
black white world
You know theres
bad guys there
bad guys
corporations
Theyre police
Theyre state
And compromise
You didnt talk corporations
You stood ground
battled them
Biotechnology gonna
continue important
I tell you
as as guy
helped start the GMOs
biotechnology
its important tool
Its tool key
And launched
technologies
farmers world
excited benefits
products provided
Clearly know looking
back
transparent
enriching public
And know that
know I look back
I I wish
earlier
And know
mistake
And meantime I think
void information
got filled by folks
who dont
understand technology
different message
Good You question here Yes
Well I wonder Monsantos
Roundup
linked birth defects
fatal kidney disease epidemics
nonHodgkins lymphoma brain cancer
How trying
remedy toxic landscape
youve created Thank you
Okay Thank question
None studies
quoted accurate
Theyre pseudoscience Id happy
later
explain policies
the misinformation
They recognized
governing body agency
valid studies
And importance
conversation this
Everybody entitled opinions
emotions
end
grounded real science
Otherwise be
aimless decision making
And thats true
were talking vaccines
were talking climate change
were talking GMOs
So I urge to think
to real science
Do family eat
crops grown company
 Absolutely
 Good Okay
 Yep
 All right Thanks
All right Thanks
I think trashing crops
effective sense
sends huge
message everybody
Angry farmers destroyed
experimental rice paddy
Philippines
Greenpeace objects
genetically modified plants
Some people vandalism
We decontamination
stopping
genetic pollution
spreading countryside
Our intentions honorable
What trying build
sustainable farming system
We trying eliminate
chemicals food supply
We trying protect
future planet
health children
As activist tend
things
point faith
begs question
How know
GMOs enemy
What got wrong
What eliminating GMOs
way achieve ends
Now lords
ladies gentlemen
Here front I want apologize
having spent
years ripping GM crops
And I assisted demonizing
important technological option

benefit environment
As environmentalist
I chosen
counterproductive path
I regret completely
So happened 1995
change mind
actually come stand
today admit it
Well answer fairly simple
I discovered science process
I hope I
better environmentalist
Before I changed mind
GMOs I spent years
developing career science writer
issue climate change
Every book article
I wrote
I wanted peerreviewed
scientific references
So I knew based
best scientific data available
Whereas GMO issue
I taking opposite perspective
I arguing scientists
scientific data
He says hes junked ideology
favor hard science
Is simple that
You know intellect
presumably hasnt changed much
wrong incompetent
shallow past
would believe
youre different now
Well reason
change mind response
changing facts I saw it
Science
changing conclusion
basis objective evidence
understanding tough
You know thats
humans wired think
You know were wired
minds thats it
weve decision
And thats gonna be
largely emotionally based
But thinking like a learning
think like scientist
learning positions
amenable change
difficult thing do
environmentalist
When comes complex issues
affect food farming
struggles
right decisions
For some decisions come
scientific assessment
risks benefits
I wanted organic
farmer because number one
produce profitable
number two its
sustainable
Im proud organic farmer
Instead
chemical pesticides
organic agriculture uses
integrated controls
Organic farming
developed world
reasons
curb use
synthetic chemicals
help soil fertility
and ideally improve
overall sustainability
food production
Although organic
agriculture good model
aspects prevent
sustainable agriculture
The challenging organic
provide food
large scale
Its difficult do
Organic farming taught

last recent decades
organic
planet were going towards

rainforests destroyed
Wed double triple
land area
cultivated
feed current population
let population 9 12 billion
So ecological disaster
And need use
kind technology
strategy related
agriculture can
And genetically engineered crops
achieved goals
So papaya ringspot
virus Hawaii
Organic practices
werent gonna control that
Whether its small farmers Africa
its large farmers US
need strategies
solve problems
Zen Honeycutt Moms Across America
I met CEO Monsanto I said
We science
products harm children
And consider youre wrong
the repercussions
company enormous
repercussions
world huge
And said Well youre wrong
youre scaring awful lot people
And I said If I wrong
Im not repercussion
people
theyre eating organic
And
wrong organic food
It perfect way is
Yeah
Zen Honeycutt scares moms believing
theyre harming children
feeding GMOs
Were gonna
little
conversation Zen
We think maybe itd good idea
talk person
You know let know were human
let know
know shes human too
And know maybe
improve dialogue
Okay
Its not its harmful
Zero
A concerned mom named Zen Honeycutt
started Moms Across America
So
concerned kids
affected pesticides
Well Dr Oz long time
I didnt know pesticides
affecting children
In fact rashes
severe allergies years
So tests doctors identify
pesticides
involved process
Well doctors told
test glyphosate
reason to
But finally
private lab would
shockingly unacceptable results
With scientific oversight
run mail order lab
random urine
breast milk samples
sent website followers
Moms Across America
posted results
Not peerreviewed
scientific journal
website
A biologist trained analyzing
breast milk attacked online
tried point
studys failings
Im human milk
lactation nutritionist
I looking milk composition
What I think dont realize
is I
dog fight
The worst ones me mom
ones suggest
I bought
Im killing babies
You know And
I sleep night
And I blood hands
Youre kidding
I think
lot families
want good information
its that I now
theres propaganda
its hard know
whats whats
real isnt
What think
drives Zen Honeycutt
Or whats motivation
I honestly I think
motivation ours
I I think
honestly thinks
shes
gonna save children
based reality
its not know
anything I think
shes lot harm
So happens lot
particular discussion
Groups opposed
technology kind suggest
this GMOs cause cancer
And mother
broke heart
That parent now
wondering wrong
You know parent
know wants blame
tragic
happens child
And I think I speak that
I actually myself
stillborn child daughter
When youre faced
kind tragedy
its its easy
want blame causing it
You look at know ate
did
what But I
stopped tragedy happening
But know as
time gone through
Ive realized that know was
unfortunate
tragedy cause
There reason stillborn
And Im passionate
trying ensure that know
dont parents blaming themselves
feeling guilty
theyre know
feeding kids GMOs
It infuriates
groups use tragedy
advance cause absence
scientific evidence
Im aware I
talk GMOs
moms kids
diseases disorders
putting

actually hurt child
based ate
Cancer diabetes obesity
heart disease Et Cetera
So I carry huge responsibility
knowing truth
GMOs generate fear
anger sadness
There lots
people society
prey people
And appeal fears worries

answers absolute answers
where like things
like things life
absolute answers
I think mother
big catalysts
messaging thats coming
GMOs equal pesticides
And people pesticides kill things
And mothers and
consumers understand
theyre like Whoa
Theres good
reason eat organic
Do think
organic natural foods
industries use fear sell products
Well know
Again the organic industry is
got lot different players it
And yeah I think some
particularly activists
Jeffery Smith example
number antiGMO activists
entrepreneurial
Store Books
I wrote em I em
The movie Genetic Roulette
fastest conversion
tool weve
convert
nonGMO diet
You know I think people like
Jeffery Smith use use fear
and science
You cant trust chemicals
foodlike substances
pumped food
theres
benefit them
Its us
So trust
You trust Mother Nature
Okay Food Babe
Thanks stopping Food Babe shop
Below food items
I enjoy daily basis
Organic raw almond butter
This shop contains
affiliate links products
Food Babe approved
researched herself
Hmm And Food Babe
automatically receive
small referral fee
Frankly I trust social
media like blogs like
know Vani Haris
moms post
I trust
medical doctors
CDC
FDA USDA
EPA Thats real
I dont need scientific study that
I dont need doctor tell that
Okay I buy Restore gut health
Restore tested
and shown support resilience cells
to widely herbicide
in world glyphosate
To simply Restore works
Im deeply troubled
sort erosion of
integrity science
debate
genetically engineered food
the point counterpoint
said said that thats going on
I dont think science supports
wide array opinions
People say Oh shouldnt trust
read Facebook
whatever motivation
person have
When patient come
theyd theyd say
Well think
I problem Doc
I wouldnt tell I believe
Id tell know
shown helpful
shown harmful
When look science
know its important
eat foods
To eat lots fruits
vegetables grains
We dont know youre
going healthier
products organic
So buy fruits
vegetables grains
dont worry theyre
organically produced
organically produced
Its like the issue
vaccinations really
You try public
information campaigns
its easier scare people
reassure them
And misinformation
originates rich world
its damaging
interests poor world
We similar
farmer does
No fertilizer
No pesticide No insecticide
See control plant disease
control plant completely wilted
But transgenic plant
has disease
So actually
genetically modified plants
100 resistance
It amazing
Leenas GMO plants
resistant
banana bacterial disease
You touch it
Even fruits touch them
I want know actually
GMOs bad like say
Even better
So well
I dont know dont consider
Maybe to like
change perception
that know
The government
forced law place
When I saw Frances face
believe

answer problem
And like Can
plants yesterday
But sad
She GMO plants
That wait
two three
years
research approved
This close
scientist Ill get
All time
effort lifes
work basically
plant people
having big debates about
How frustrating that you
What I far
come know
Its like have
solution farmers
So know That good
motivate more
convince people
negative technology
Give scientific facts
And I feel like
convince them
I convinced
convince them
One things
difficult me
understanding
human beings decisions
We dont decisions based facts
We decisions based gut
And theres know
Its combination intuition
emotion affiliation
I need ask you
time
changed mind
Think it
In year
changed mind
issue substance
And havent Africa
The lame shall walk
The blind shall see
The hungry shall fed
Technology doesnt
moral valence know
Its its technology used
Is hammer to pound nails
build house poor
bash
head neighbor
We struggling
conventional
producing food
Climate change reality
You know I awaiting
GM seed drought tolerance
Im waiting impatiently
losing here
This days drought
month recovery
Our engineered lines recovered
see better
background control
line recover
They died
Wow Theyre incredible
If reproduce field
huge
huge effect farmers
Genetic engineered rice Been stopped
No commercialization
Its gone
Then stopped genetically
engineered alfalfa
We sued em beat em
Those gone Not gonna happen
Not gonna happen
Americans beware
Please informed
GM technology
suppressing Africa
South Africa rest continent
left behind
With global divide GMOs
getting contentious day
respected debate
series Intelligence Squared
invited experts sides
civil discourse
live audience
Okay were letting
everybody settled in
We debaters teams two
arguing motion
Genetically Modified Food
And good thing
genetic engineering
Is safe thing Is necessary
Well questions sound
like makings debate
So lets it
Yes statement
genetically modify food
Chuck Washington State
You known research
pesticide use particular
Youve debated before actually
You proponent organic food
won overwhelmingly
So feeling lucky tonight
I am John
Weve were wellprepared Marty I
facts
science side
I think well fine
Part reticent it
because I thought bit
nowin scenario
middle New York City
And also sitting
alongside Robb Fraley
who obviously Monsanto
just baggage comes
particular company
Here argue motion
welcome Robert Fraley
He executive vice president
chief technology officer Monsanto
Ladies gentlemen Robert Fraley
Im hearing hissing
I appreciate
audience silence hisser
I absolutely think
trust central issue
comes Americans
relationship food
First all GMOs holy grail
What important tool
Theyve enabled farmers use safer
environmentally
friendly chemicals
GMOs perfect
Absolutely not
They need regulated
They need managed wisely
like like technology
I early days
Monsanto came products
And compared
vision early vision
its big disappointment
GMO technology gets conflated
Monsanto Big Ag
But its actually breeding tool
purposes
All GM applications
focus controlling disease genetics
chemicals
objective I argue
compatible
agroecology sustainability
feeding people better
environmental impact
Robb Allison if
said true
I
table
going with
poor Marty herself
Rest assured consensus
safety GE foods
At point know
consensus doesnt mean everybody agrees
It doesnt mean theres
complete 100 alignment
like isnt global warming
But science speaks here
and science
reached consensus this
We live age
information
The individual sees
article thing
article thing
individual
weight way
creates dissonance
That creates lot confusion
And dissonance
confusion create distrust
John asked to
open discussion
environmental impacts
When spray herbicide
weeds
theyre going develop resistance
Okay Im I want
Robb Fraley
Youve heard antibiotic resistance
Its problem right Youre aware it
So drug companies do
Should develop new antibiotics
theres
resistance to
antibiotic
Absolutely not
Roundup controls hundreds weeds
In country 12
resistant
It controls hundreds weeds
It needs effectively
And Chuck
ones point
actually use
combinations herbicides
thats growers today
thats
benefits smarter
stewarding products better
Yes That thats true I mean
The challenge feeding
worlds hungry people
met
production kind
I mean want feed
hungry people world
I list things do
You build roads You
raise incomes
You change role women
You help people
decisions
want
grow help grow it
I I absolutely agree
Its complicated question
tools have
 Robb
 So I couldnt agree more
One of
I think Margarets argument
focus
genetically engineered crops
sort sucks oxygen room
I I think debate
GMO crops sucks
air room
The GMO debate
GMOs all point
GMOs metaphor relationship
food food system
And closing statement
motion Chuck Benbrook
Its turned kind
arms race weeds
herbicides sole hammer
The 2014 USDA data shows pretty clearly
its 230 million pounds
glyphosate applied
Even its generally regarded
relatively safe pesticide
theres reason worry here
Sometimes risks concern people
risks kill
people entirely different
For long debate merits
genetically modified food
focused unrealized
hypothetical risks
conflated
use pesticides
It addressed GM help
real risks
faced hungry malnourished
There costs associated
excessive precaution
Vote yes GM food
This obviously very
passionate debate
If motion
team push number one
Against motion
team push number two
Confirmation bias
peoples tendency
assimilate
information confirms
believe
And everybody it
I mean confirmation bias
right wingers watch Fox News
left wingers read
The Guardian online
It feels comfortable
read information
tells youre right
You know confirmation bias
a function
terms mental health
Keeping feeling sane
like know know
how understand world works
But confirmation bias
dangerous
means
dont listen evidence
challenges beliefs
Lets look vote
In vote motion
Genetically Modified Food
32 agreed 30 against
38 undecided
Those results
Remember again team
numbers change
second
declared winner
Lets look second vote
The team arguing motion
second vote 60
They went 32 60
They picked 28 percentage points
That number beat
But lets look
team motion
Their vote 30
Second vote 31 Only 1 move
That means team arguing motion
Genetically Modified Food
carried debate
Our congratulations
them thank me
John Donvan Intelligence Squared US
Well time
Yeah its selffulfilling And money
Money
thing Monsanto
And Syngenta Dow DuPont
These all all
I dont know Hes just
hes charismatic
He good
Well good
You convinced husband I
Good job Well thank coming
What think it
Its time Ive
seen science win debate
And I struck
weak arguments antis
There remotely persuasive
The thing weve trying stop
15 years hasnt worked yet
Now kind argument that
Theres food thats 100 safe
turkey dinner
Thanksgiving
risk associated it
And kind
manage risk And so
Im wondering I didnt
position
Are herbicide tolerant crops
Would support them Do
think debate
against
apps
You know Humboldt County banned
 genetically modified crops
 Yes
So I talking farmer
grows Roundup Ready corn
And I said him What
going do
its banned
And said well Ill
obey the ban
Ill grow conventional corn
And Ill
toxic herbicide
That consequence ban
For good applications
Im debating this
There good ones fine
But app bad app
Support good apps
say You know guys
This application use
 Hi
 Hi
They havent
Africa
The lame shall walk
The blind shall see
The hungry shall fed
When Andrew Kimbrell acknowledged
good apps GMOs
slip tongue
incredibly
meaningful admission
Because Ive heard
stature
antiGMO movement
admit technology
beneficial purpose
Well let ask this
Is true false
technology
increased use pesticides
It decreased use pesticides
Thats the thats
guys dont agree
Thats science says
So thats I want look into
So right there
I investigate that
And papaya doesnt use anything
The papaya pretty impressive
So everybody recording
Im gonna look into
Does increase decrease
use pesticides
Dont forget look
lens yourself
Thanks Bill I appreciate it
 Yes yes yes
 Pleasure meet you
 Yes
 Selfie Science Guy
So excited
My kids love him so
well cause were kind
science nerds right
So thats gonna amplify
status home I think
maybe understand
I here so
Thanks support dude
Really appreciate it
Im excited
getting heavily meat
Because Ive kind captured
GMO stuff like forever
Well were happy throw
new work on
Yep Yep
While Benbrooks
lost GMO debate
influence
story didnt end there
Im deeply troubled
sort erosion of
integrity science
debate
genetically engineered food
One study coauthored
Washington State University
researcher Charles Benbrook
Over years Benbrook
goto scientist
antiGMO movement
The paper
downloaded 224000 times
His work quoted shared
retweeted world
Bill 113 adopted
To help support
arguments actions
technology
Our major finding
milk healthy
organic milk healthier
While favoring organic
perfect alternative
Vermont lawmakers
passed mandating
genetically modified
foods labeled
Oh yeah
Through public records request
The New York Times discovered
Benbrooks studies

independent portrayed
What Ive seen
willing actually
funding provide
particular outcomes
And thats antithesis
scientist
prepared do
Scientists usually
theyre funded industry
its its unrestricted grant
Theres outcomes expected
Theres certainly
predetermined conclusions
study going say
Thats thats science works
data informs opinion
funded you
Some important
funders Whole Foods
Annies
Organic Valley Stonyfield
Do think organic
natural foods industry
work
help sell fear GMOs
I think I mean certainly extent
work
I utilized
But way I feel is
shouldnt organic industry
right Monsanto
Syngenta ADM Kraft Foods
Dont think company
sides debate
use science
think supports public posture
messaging
Of course theyre gonna use it
But
companies trying convince
organic food kids cancer
No Im saying that
Thats Im saying
Many scientists
science journalists
spoke biased
misleading information
Benbrooks work
The profit motive
doubleedged sword
It lead innovation
temptation
When look
people
pushing GMOs
pushing GMOs
real
marketers sides
And whats interesting
past people
You know scientists who
incentive impartial
weigh evidence
figure real solutions
push agenda
No GMOs No GMOs No GMOs
After years March
Against Monsanto
pushing false fears GMOs
group young scientists
launched counterprotest
March Against Myths
Three five seven nine
GMOs fine
Science completely
counter activist
I mean activist
want megaphone
want say
These people doing
you know theyre damaging planet
Theyre cutting trees Theyre
You dont want stand
megaphone say
This subtle issue
theres lots complications
need objective evidence
When hear What want
We want peerreviewed data
objectively defines
nature problem
When want it When want it
Well years hence
people
time examine data
Heck GMO
Heck GMO Heck GMO
 What want
 Safe technology
 When want it
 We it
Theres myths
promoted
March Against Monsanto
it
They good people
They want best themselves
They want best children
They want best world
They good intentions
dont facts
If turn protest gear
buy beer
Boo
Im fighting GMOs
Im fighting ability
use science
best decisions can
If throw science out
then theres nothing
Theres kind amorphous blob
competing worldviews
Emma husband Washington
expanding
role educators
building school
teach food
farming agriculture
We visited farmer farm dying
banana wilt
actually dying it
They gene resistant
matoke
And matoke matoke
With banana wilt
With banana wilt
Does sense thing wither

end
day dont food
What food us
If dont food
going steal
You going kill someone
A lot crime
Or incorporate science
So ask tell relatives
dads aunties
maybe brothers
sisters parliament
Lets grow food feed
Africa feed world
In view findings
task force recommended
ban GM foods lifted
casebycase
basis
Personally I believe biotechnology
way forward
country globe
terms food security
issues dealing climate change
Thank you
Both Kenya Uganda
close allowing
genetically engineered crops
like wiltresistant banana
casebycase
basis
But
people organizations
successfully spreading fear
misinformation
technology
The Hawaii County Councils
ban growing GMOs
overturned state
but led Andrew Kimbrells
Center Food Safety

contested courts
You know core
science investigative journey
matter ends up
Theres chapter
Im gonna revise
I spent time it
Im very excited
 Wait chapter this
 Well stay tuned
But its
genetically modified food
 Oh
 I went Monsanto
I spent lot time
scientists there
And I revised outlook
Im excited
telling world
When youre love
want tell world
Change mind data shows you
Bill thank
coming show
Lets change world Lets it
GMOs development
world include
peanuts allergyfree
safe children eat
oranges resist
invasive citrus
greening disease
wiped
half orange trees
United States
mosquitoes help
stop spread malaria
Dengue fever
Zika virus
I dont think people understand
science involved
making good food available
So
crisis trust
come
evolutionary fork road
decide way go
What kind future
turn backs
credible evidence
sound science
repeatable studies
What impact
ourselves
planet
future
A quote The New Yorker said
Dont listen Jeffrey Smith
Hes ballroom dance teacher
Actually Im swing dancer thank you
Well wife tells
Im incredibly unpersuasive
Im
punching people face
wrong and know
facts right facts on
And keeps saying I
I anti
argument well
said Youre
thing now
Youre telling theyre wrong
and shouting peoples faces
You changed mind completely
Why expect believe that
And shes probably got point
More 100 Nobel laureates

genetically
modified organisms
Richard Roberts

1993 Nobel Prize recipient
told Washington Post
environmental groups
stance GMOs
damaging antiscience
 Uh
 You know good thing
science its true
believe it
You see thats Im saying
Right now were
replaced social interaction
Virtual reality
subreality
People money
good life
virtual game
I saw tweet
wanted know
Monsanto paid
changing mind
Yes well I confess
They things
I ate cafeteria
free I understand it
Yup
And guys gave
ride airport
 Thats true
 All right
So that
So myth us
Yes I paid way
Oppression

All people world
right party
39 US presidents

finally makes office
itll matter
A year later revolution happens
war hunger
poverty ends
Some people believe
organic farmer
geneticist
represent polar opposites
agricultural spectrum
But thats true
goal
ecologically based agriculture
We met farm
Eventually
going married
Oh man future
People create drugs
trick body thinking
its getting nutrients
needs survive
food longer necessary
Oh man future
On Capitol Hill Tuesday
Dr Oz hot seat
I actually personally believe
items I
talk show
I passionately study them
I recognize
oftentimes dont

But thats point
Youre presenting doctor

tells people believes
its based
good science
I dont understand
