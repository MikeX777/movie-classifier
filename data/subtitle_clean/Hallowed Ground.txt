That wash clean
Well searched
sanctuary
Past trailer parks
power lines
But beauty stained
danger
In woods
time left
Still history

A belief sublime
Of place dead
living intertwine
When cicadas
sing dusky hymn
And night falls
black long
We steel
dark
We need
strong
When blood
rain
Well hold

Cause love
like shotgun
In world gone wrong
Cause love
like shotgun
In world gone wrong
Walkin wolves
howl place
A warning battle
There souls
harbored place
Where good
die
But
fighting song
Hold
night
In morning
sun beat
Through magnum sky
Well packed
bags hit road
Back trail
redeemed
Knowing blistered feet
hardened hearts
Are harder heal

Theres poverty
forgiveness
In world thats
cruel mean
But theres somethin
water
That wash clean
Well packed
bags hit road
Back trail
redeemed
With calloused feet
altered hearts
Not near hard
