“Papi I’m sorry I’m going farther​
I’m getting plane​
And I gonna change world someday”

He stood there staring me
useless
Today daughter’s home I am…
useless

And baby amazed
things learned day

She stay escape
While kids play
And I stand I’d say
“I’m proud father
‘Cuz work harder
And smarter
Than I age”
But I knew fly away
And gonna change world
someday

That family can’t succeed

Ay Mamá
The summer’s hottest day
Paciencia y fe Paciencia y fe

Ay carajo it’s hot
But that’s okay
Mamá say Paciencia y fe
It hotter home La Vibora
The Washington Heights Havana
A crowded city faces mine
Back child La Vibora
I chased birds plaza
Praying Mamá work
Combing stars sky sort sign
Ay Mamá stars Cuba…
En Nueva York can’t streetlights…
To reach roof gotta bribe supa
Ain’t Cassiopeia Washington Heights…
But ain’t food La Vibora…
I remember nights anger streets
hunger windows
Women folding clothes playing friends summer rain…
Mamá needs job Mamá says we’re poor
day say Vamos Nueva York
And Nueva York far
But Nueva York work came…
And now I’m wide awake
A million years late
I talk you imagining you’d
Remembering went through
Nueva York Ay Mamá
It wasn’t like today you’d
Paciencia y fe
NEW YORKERS
Paciencia y fe
ABUELA CLAUDIA
Paciencia y fe
Fresh boat America
Freezing early December

ABUELA CLAUDIA
Sharing double beds
trying catch break struggling English
Listening friends finally got job working maid
So cleaned homes polishing pride
Scrubbing Upper East Side
The days weeks weeks years
I stayed
NEW YORKERS
Paciencia y fe…
Paciencia y fe…
ABUELA CLAUDIA
And I feed birds
My hands begin shake
And I words
My heart’s break
And ay Mamá
What
dreams come true
I’ve spent life
Inheriting dreams you
And I winning ticket
What I pray
I buy loaf bread
Continue day
And head
Imagining you’d
The birds fly away
Do fly La Vibora

Let everybody know
Abuela Claudia passed away
At noon today
SOUL BREAKING SILENCE
USNAVI
She pronounced… scene
She lying bed
The paramedics said
That heart gave out…
I mean that’s basically said
They said
A combination stress heat…
Why took medicine
I’ll understand
I’d like think went peace
With pieces bread crumbs hand

Abuela Claudia simple pleasures
She sang praises things ignore
Glass Coke bottles bread crumbs sky stars
She cherished things she’d say “Alabanza”
Alabanza means raise
Thing God’s face
And sing literally “Praise this”
When here path clear
And here
here…

On sevenfortyseven boardin’ JFK…

Cool breezes blow…

When job’s done evening winds
Down crawl son I ease mind
When we’re done When we’ve resigned
In long run leave behind
