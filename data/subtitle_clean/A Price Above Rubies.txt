Bless you
For what
Is Rebbe
And God picked
humble little mountain
present
His greatest gift
The gift His Torah
But question remained
To He going gift
So God set journey

nations earth
worthy receiving His Torah
God went Goyim Canaan
asked them
Look I you
Is Torah
 Do want Torah
 No
No course not
No no this
Maybe lighter like
sweet floral pattern here
nice blue chiffon look
Personally Id recommend
light airy
complement charming atmosphere
home
Charming means small right
I assume youll hanging
curtains living room
kitchen
opens
range choices
For instance decide
atmosphere integration
unify space
single theme
separate
rooms visually
Different looks different atmospheres
different states mind
America
Yes God came America
And asked American Goyim
Do want Torah
And asked
Tell first
Honor thy father thy mother
Nah Respect parents
I dont think so
Get thing What it
Torah Get here
So God came
Israel
Israel He asked us
Jews want Torah
And answer
Naaseh ve nishmah
Quiet down Youre wrecking
auns new apartment
shes moved it
In case
apartment whole unified
In other living room
living room kitchen kitchen
Youre cooking day
Youre exhausted
You walk kitchen presto
is like youre world
One completely insane
I think is you

I listen
word meshugas
 Aunt Sonia I think babys hungry
 Come here sweetheart
Shh shh
Shh shh
Shh shh

Mendel
Didnt pray already
I wasnt praying
I learning little Mishnah
 Anything good
 Yes is good
 Cant leave on Just while
 Sonia
Enough Sonia
Enough
Sonia enough
 Enough what
 Just enough
 Is indecent
 Making love wife indecent
Making love wife
like is
Were alone Sonia
Were eyes God
The Talmud teaches man love
wife I try God knows I try
But man is supposed
different Is supposed
mitzvah holy act
And Im supposed think exalted
thoughts order sanctify it
And Im supposed enjoy this
Im supposed enjoy knowing
youre thinking Abraham
Isaac Rebbe while
God forbid God forbid talk
way Rebbe
Sonia Im sorry
Im sorry I raised voice you
Im sorry
Can I play little
Of course
A littles okay
Amen
You dont eat it Just
mouth chew little
 Hes hungry
 Are mother No
So know
hes hungry
So God spared Moabites
The reason being
 Mendel
 That Ruths family
living them
Wait Hes giving dvar Torah
Is nice Please listen
 Is story
 Is dvar Torah
Why didnt God allow Ruths
family survive attack
He coulïve that
The answer question
course God coulïve it
But young girl needs mother
And mother needs husband
 And family needs house
 What else
Maybe VCR video recorder
And need
clothes
Why dont shush
son finish
 Hes man He heard
 But nobodys listening
 He wont eat
 Who tell do
 Hes gonna eat
 Obviously youre
better mother I am
It shows family
important evil
Moabites spared God
needed
order bring Ruth
 Yasher
 Yasher coach
Yasher coach
Keep youll great scholar
like Uncle Mendel
Please Im great yet
Modesty
is false
All I hear yeshiva days
Mendel said this Mendel said that
Like Rambam came
learn them
While were subject
yeshiva
day young boy
students
asked question
I couldnt answer
His father says is okay steal
long steal Goyim
His teacher tells
stealing sin
So agrees teacher
hes disrespecting father
But agrees father
hes honoring thief
danger
himself
 Is tough question
Only youre scholar
If is opinion boy
disagrees it thas right
You respect
disagree with
But father
thief
boy
nose business
