From angels bending
Near earth
To touch harps gold
Peace earth
Good men
From heavens allgracious King
The world
In solemn stillness lay
To hear angels sing
Yet woes
Of sin strife
The world
Has suffered long
Beneath
The angelstrain rolled
Two thousand years wrong
And man war man
Hears
The love song
Which bring
O hush noise
Ye men strife
And hear angels sing
And ye
Beneath lifes crushing load
Whose forms bending low
Who toil
The climbing way
With painful steps
And slow
Look
For glad golden hours
Come swiftly
On wing
O rest
The weary road
And hear angels sing
O rest
The weary road
And hear angels sing
