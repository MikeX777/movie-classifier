A sleeper painting
thats offered
entirely auction
Which clearly better artist
auction house recognized
A sleeper hunter
looks mistakes
And thats I do Thats I do
So I painting
thats cataloged Leonardo
Its copy lost salvator mundi
savior world
know Leonardo did
Jesus easy sell
But reason
This picture attracts attention
And I Robert Simon
We purchased paintings together
Weve them
He enjoys hunt
Alex called said
Have seen picture
New Orleans auction
He said yeah lsawit too
What shall do
And decided buy it
Were gonna buy it
We agreed price
Alex arranges shipment
I think sent ups
truck New York
And were rolling
 Rolling
 Yeah
 Rolling
 Good
Im gonna open broad question
Why think salvator mundi
caused fuss
First let this
This improbable story
has I think
happened art market
Everybody wanted Leonardo
And everybody took
optimistic view
Leonardo
And Leonardo
Its good painting
I believe picture power
power experienced truly
youre standing it
This simply matter economics
boil it
And greed Basic human uh foibles
Money
The picture came cardboard box
kind youd expect
sort money spent
And I took out
And things immediately apparent
And I mean seconds
One theres clearly
great deal overpaint
Restoration face Christ
Theres clearly large swath
painting
That untouched UNrestored
And absolutely period
By that I mean circa 1500
Im thinking
this extraordinary object
But is I dont know
But out
Its work year 1500
probably artists
close master
deserved really
have um best possible care
Im Evan beard
I uh run art services group
bank america
We re largest lender art
We manage 100 museum endowments
country
This picture
tells art historical story
tells history
financial markets
tells history rise
social cultural capital
So bring picture probably
art conservation professional
entire field
dianne modesthi
He comes
carrying painting in um
A black plastic garbage bag
And I painting bag
easel
There lovely passages
passages
damaged overpainted
I didnt know
I brought Mario bedroom
Mario modestini celebrated
painting conservator time
He vetted ginevra de benci
national gallery
The Leonardo
western hemisphere
This man whos seen
lot Leonardo
interested
seeing picture
At time 98 years old
housebound
I said Mario look picture
What think it
And suddenly
kind paid attention it
And said
this great artist
And said I dont know is
its generation Leonardo
I took solvents cabinet
acetone mineral spirits
I rolled cotton wool stick
Then I began slowly remove
varnish retouching
And things
immediately appears
position thumb
This called pentiment
Its artists idea
The thumb subsequently moved
different position
And dont usually copy
its proof
its definitely original
Uh wasnt proof me
As I remove retouching
thumb appears immediately
does um
A um lot damage head
I notice theres
wide white fill
recent covering crack
This crack runs panel
actually knot
thats low center
Next day dianne calls me
Bob Ive cleaned picture
And come it
Im faced things
One picture I
severely damaged
amateurish
brownish reddish paint
attempt create beard gone
So I knew
needed conservation treatment
highest level
Mario dies January
And I began work salvator mundi
studio
Alone
I would
Carry conversation
Mario entire time
I didnt talk loud
Except maybe twice
But I
dialogue head
I hear say
he looks like toothache
And I again
Or say nose crooked
Marios face
salvator mundis face know
kind shift forth
mind
One evening I wrestling
tenth time
retouching small loss
lip right here
And transition area
lip upper lip
um imperceptible
There line there
edge lip
exactly present
area Mona Lisa
My hands shaking
No Leonardo
painted picture
I leave building
Robert say
the painting Leonardo
I think point
What do
What picture
There only
peoples count
15 leonardos known
And say
I picture like this
is circles akin saying
I spaceship lawn night
I saw unicorns
Its farfetched
Dont try convince
its right
youre gonna
look like fool
The famous artist
high renaissance
Those paintings heavily documented
And sudden one
It disappears hundreds years
And turns america
In New Orleans
Oh I see
Heres lost Leonardo somebody
mentioned book
When old masters
provenance important
line ownership
tells story
Where object come from
context
land moment
its right now
So know Robert spent
lot time going archives
starting piece
provenance
picture doesnt
provenance theres doubt
Theres reasons people
believe is
I able trace
paintings whereabouts year 1900
sold London auction
attributed luini
But trail went cold
I looked old British inventories
17th century
I possible citations
collection Charles I
And colleague Margaret dalivalle
collection Charles ii
Our painting
royal brand reverse
panel
thinned rebacked
It possible provable
painting
But today dont know exactly
be
Particularly old masters space
opinions matter
facts time
And start

willing
potentially listen

hand master
When youre museum curator
sent images
email
transparencies be
pictures people hope
lost forgotten masterpieces
And I part
are politely
somewhat disappointing
So I sent transparency
salvator mundi
I was have say somewhat skeptical
see
And I looked I thought
gosh feels powerful
And I felt needed
seen flesh
So suggested invite
leading scholars Leonardo
painting
kind neutral territory
painting conservation lab
national gallery
What I hoping gathering
scholars national gallery
look carefully picture
spoke group people
Im Martin kemp
emeritus professor history art
University Oxford
The salvator mundi came blue
literally surprise
theres authentic
Leonardo painting 100 years
So dont sit waiting
come along
We knew Leonardo involved
subject salvator mundi
We drawings windsor
beautiful red chalk drawings
draperies
chest
gathered drapery
arm sleeve
So know involved
planning that
There lot copies
I think were plus 20
But I thought Leonardo
painted original
chance turning
small
A Leonardo
different things
Theres works fully accepted
hand master
labeled Leonardo
But workshop Leonardo
He guiding
student work
theres firm agreement
entire work
hand author
You circle Leonardo s
followers work
style manner
And finally
follower Leonardo
picture
artists style
If picture follower
follower Da Vinci
worth
Mr Simon paid it 1100
If student of
working Da Vinci
time like boltraffio was
exponentially
valuable that
And hand master
be exponentially
exponentially
exponentially valuable
Uh curve absurd
We begun
plan Leonardo exhibition
major loans
agreed
The issue
picture London
It unframed
special box built it
small
handcarried
Xray machine
The day
I national gallery
awaits arrival
invited scholars
Youre dealing ego
dreams academics
Every academic wants discovery
Im trying Im going London
set expectations
Expectations dangerous
end
seeing want see
I decided play cool I could
looked it
clearly its got presence
Leonardos strange presence
They assertive
time ambiguous
And Leonardo that
Other people cant
Im Maria Teresa fiorio
I worked museums
city Milano
I magnifying glass me
pretentious
actually serves
circumstances
It means I shut
looking something
having ramble it
So theres amazing moment
I didnt answer
I didnt direct answer them
They were I knew insist
So talk
scholars
ask directly
is Leonardo
I think its better
hear opinions over
The course conversation
So certainly
moment voted
I question
people directly
It kind sense
response was
To least response
room felt positive
It felt thered been
That discovery confirmed way
group scholars um
excited I been
Nobody asked
formal opinion painting
It just I shouldnt chat
like that
So scholars brought
afternoon look it
Brought in yes
They looked said
looks good me
Well open
fact Da Vinci
They named scholars said
these people authenticated painting
 Yes
 Oh god
There suspicious aspect it
provenance
painting murky
Its ghostlike came from
So theres question there
Maybe week
week half later
national gallery called
tell basically
agreed
picture Leonardo
This moment say
other ourselves
this real This real
This Da Vinci
were currently owners it
How long queue
exhibition
These Da Vinci fans
stood cold hours
Its like watching child
world
hoping dont fall down
scrape knee
hurts feelings
This Leonardos
rediscovered salvator mundi
astonishingly turned
United States America
It sort seduces soul
Its calming near it
Finding Leonardo
day
So presented Leonardo
As Leonardo Yes
Okay decision
 Yes
 Okay so
We Leonardo
exhibition
Before exhibition
national gallery makes press release
its described sort test
exhibition opens
painting labeled
fullautographed Leonardo
Why difference
So putting attributed to
ascribed to
possibly by  phrases
would I think
distort view
and um really
way confuse issue
lost picture
Leonardo salvator mundi
I felt national gallery
good place
picture view
I say I felt
differently point

different decision
My frank zdllner
Im working renaissance art
Leonardo da Vinci Michelangelo
I saw salvator
exhibition London
impression basically said
okay interesting painting
uh theres strange
For example curls
sort schematic
blessing hand flesh tones
looks like pupil me
And overall aura
overall light
Its very good
But exactly
restored
So paradoxical situation
You old parts
painting original
These pupils
And new painting
look like Leonardo
restorer
In part its masterpiece
dianne modestini
But thats ridiculous
I cant paint like Leonardo
I mean its flattering
its absurd
I think great job
painter
But ask
maybe overdone bit
I think its leonardesque
Leonardo it
Well me work Leonardo
I dont recognize technique
What struck hand
Because lifted fingers
absolutely wrong
because notably one
rotate itself
which course impossible
He studied human anatomy extensively
Imagining that
Such work led
paint wrong hands
Cant thought about Its unthinkable
We need little distance
judge painting
Attribution issues decided
years
They decided ten
20 30 years
And turn
50 years time people say
okay idiots
early 21st century
Leonardo painting
Theres lot noise on
How
that
Fine
What feel stake
you personally case
 Nothing
 No
Youre gonna anywhere Sorry
Okay
You Im maximalist
Theres wall space left
theres else
I havent ceiling yet
Everyone country now
I guess world
talks fake news
lies politics
hypocrisy see
But thing is scares people
most business truth
Whats reason national museum
painting
Simple Unfortunately
its boost visitors
They right exhibit painting
hasnt 150 scrutinized
and uh vefled
purports be
And case

near stage authentication
warranted
exhibited
tremendously reputable
influential museum
Its right

The bouvier affair bit
elephant room

Cleaned up
Yves bouvier trying
convince Mike sazonov
What omits
bought it
That
negotiation fake
Bouvier
extraordinary markup
475 million transaction
took days
Its extraordinary frankly
pretty unheard art world
New free port
Yves bouvier inherited shipping business
father
But yves bouvier realized
increasing demand
places store highvalue goods
So expanded business
creating armored warehouses
generally perimeter
airport
free ports
The Geneva freeport supposed hold
literally billions
dollars worth art
My Doug patteson
A clandestine service officer
CIA
The history salvator mundi
its grown value
opening eyes money
moving different ways
free port system
A free port taxfree haven
Where wealthy people
items secret tax authorities
So objects bought
sold free port
taxes apply objects
considered transit
One things
weve observed recently
paintings increasingly
collateral loans bank loans
A infrastructure
sprung
allows you collector
whove millions dollars
art
art
free port facility
capital invested
art redeploy
Its art love
Its money
Its transferring funds
Theres thing remove
human beings
greed
If sit valuable goods
dont trust country
because know
fiscal guys back
Why store free port
store socalled safe
That gorilla big smoker
Interesting guy
If taxes reasonable
people play game
You know saying
drugs prostitution
art market
unregulated market world
A opaque world
dont know owns something
its worth
whos buying whos selling it
Most transactions
very dark
Its Avenue store money
Its vestiges
wild wild west
Russia 19903 wild west
And time
businessmen opportunity
exorbitantly wealthy
taking ownership
transitioning bureaus
businesses
So comes
Mr Dmitry rybolovlev
man billionaire
literally overnight
floats potash company
London stock exchange
What
needed money Russia

quiet discreet
felt
trust life
The Russian run
quiet Swiss man
forge alliance
acquisition art
Yves bouvier built network

And priceless order
conduct business
He king
possession information

He billion dollars profit
Thats good dealer
Yeah its good business
Its safer buy painting

seize jump it
A painting buried
free port world
Nobody knows is
Look salvator mundi
Right now I dont know is
I anxious
finally home
people experience
extraordinary power painting
Art me truth really
And its way living life
communicate people
Art doesnt exist vacuum
If its existing great
warehouses free ports
kind financial asset
It shame its

It effect people
The world trying to
Is discussing
where hell painting
Nobody knows is
The buyer doesnt tell
puts painting
They want
money
Who cares
Only press bad press
people curious
caring
doesnt concern them
2014 beginning end
bouvier rybolovlev
An article published indicated
price final sale
which course different
rybolovlev paid
So Mr R Found out
pretty pissed off
And sparked actions
taken bouvier
moved quickly that
Mr R Couldnt look
art collection same
Every time looked painting
greatest
masterpiece painted
saw fact
abused taken advantage
Mr Bouvier
worlds richest free port owner
His markup 100
Thats crime its greedy
What trying screw bouvier
destroy reputation
sue courthouse
entertain suit
He angry
like Russian bear
somebody stuck into
He furious
What wanted
dump art
great fantastic pieces
radically overpaid them
So fully expecting
lose money
People think auction houses
sort passive repository objects
sell behalf collectors
decide its time sell
Most actual
highend objects sell
dont actually come market way
Sold
They actually there
Their specialists
living room collectors
telling its right time
sell work
Seventyone 72
Its hot market work
theyre trying actually
pull objects
Thank you you
million six To you sir
If theyve got best art sale
theyll buyers
So competition level
getting consignments
You it Whats number
The guy auctioneer
European vague accent
Do I 2 million
Oh John I saw bid 3 million before
Oh wait I say
We 5 million
Sold
Thank indeed
So rybolovlev
start selling
sells christies
And course
salvator mundi ends up
Nothing wrong art
Da Vinci
All pieces collection
fantastic pieces
This black swan
collection questions it
But massive
billiondollar collection
potential future business
auction house
So christies
client happy
They went allin picture
The term male Mona Lisa
object
The Mona Lisa insured
800 million
So I think calling male Mona Lisa
makes sense marketer
On financial front
helps explain value
The Mona Lisa early 20th century
secondary importance
Until 1961 John F Kennedy
makes way Vienna summit
makes stop Paris
And culture minister Andre malraux
completely entranced Jacqueline
Jackie whispers ear
evening events
that Id love
Mona Lisa United States
population
cultural masterpiece
Mr Minister
United States
grateful loan
From leading artistic power
world France
And lines block
Most people
coming
coming painting
They coming seen picture
saw celebrity
Christies understood
accomplish thing
male Mona Lisa
need convince potential buyer
youre buying global celebrity
play power
prestige acquisition
Their primary marketing video
brilliant way
actually
showed object
What instead
series people
going object
having emotional reaction it
They Leonardo DiCaprio
They realized needed
collector bought thing
mass following
people
buying celebrity
Christies released ton marketing
generated traffic generated hype
It brought salvator mundi
minds eye
people quickly
This kind homage
artist viral artist

real image maker whos
You know images
world
recognized anyone
Christies business selling
Its business
authenticating
And great job
amazing
marketing campaign
everybody
hesitation gives plaudits
sort cynical marketing exercise
Any questions
authenticity
None really Uh
It was I said
completely overpainted
But removed
rediscovery
quality evident
and really hasnt
real question
Why called male Mona Lisa
Well its painted
time Mona Lisa
Its painted 1500
And painting
Mona Lisa probably overlap
The salvator mundi global tour
took life own
London Hong Kong
clusters potential buyers
I opposed that
It reckless
Uh send
world way But they
I couldnt stop it
Christies mercenaries
Thats business
You expect behavior them
youre client christies
want
ruthlessly possible
greatest price asset
In time Ive this
I remember picture

Not sale anywhere
I asked librarian

produced louvre
occasion exhibition
And
new technical examination
picture
The book recapitulates
history painting
goes attribute
securely Leonardo
This time
independent body really
thorough analysis picture
But its difficult know
believe
youve got lost painting
lost book
access scientific
examinations themselves
Let
institutional knowledge authority
Its real foolproof
clean immaculate
As think

Power neutral
You know people louvre
What rumors
So mbs pull work

level Mona Lisa
placing
lesser da vincis

Thats gonna happen
At moment Da Vinci

mystery legend speculation
I lots art supplies here
It surprising
experts suddenly said
oh yes absolutely Leonardo
And documents
It proven know
factually doubt

But salvator mundi
Im allowed forget
The mystery sort solved

And this again new
sort rabbit hole hall mirrors
The painting hasnt seen

Once described

mystery surrounding
salvator mundi continues today
