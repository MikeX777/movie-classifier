Katrina
As older mature

Well mentor mother

journey
There parents
wasnt
encouraging child trying
children
dropped out
And fun
able share mom
Never cross word
encouraging positive
her
I that
Hamer
He able criticize
supporting tearing
young players selfconfidence
Because outer game suffers
inner game plagued noise
The noise case
excessive selfdoubt
negative inner dialogue
excessive selfcriticism
And theres subtlety that
theres inner peace
letting things
cant control
drive push
be
She inspired fun
do
thats things
sort got
career
Hamer Brain scientists
known long time
kind noise
activates amygdala
fear center brain
Just wanted best I be
And knew I love tennis
sure I do
I opportunity there
Hamer And amygdala
sending fear signals
interrupts learning decisionmaking
sabotages flow play
My dad important I think
psychologically
believed much
Because world
thats way is
I understood that
he dad Bill believed me
Im naturally
insecure person
But confident tennis
didnt push me
like
Yeah OK youre good this
Do makes feel right

Mary The dynamic

Hamer So good mentor
helping young player
calm inner noise
psychological
its physiological
Theres magic formula

So trust key word

In life meet people

Biggest day probably life

Navratilova So its essential

I think beginning
young champions arent aware
taken themselves
Caroline Well I think grow

trying tour

Nine years old tournament

So I fun part
Now its time hard work
Navratilova When I left country
I years
I didnt coach anybody
I thought I pretty well
So I started training physically

I believed hard work
That pays off
Hamer It said requires
10000 hours practice
expert something

I train certain way
I gym hours
I practice hours day
Well want play
want able reach balls

gotta work physically man
Youve got work physically
Hamer
But its physical practice

Your talent
hard worker
like unbelievable

end journey

The hardest tennis
preparation
spend hours court

Hamer The painful

This difficult work

Even I practicing

I sit chair like yeah
Wake early school

Thats days were
It like army

Dinara It gives like power

Justine You build physically
emotionally mentally
If things
thats pretty promising
It starts world you
laughs
Theres world 
its tennis world
Rivalry must
order students
reach levels
Part process
getting comfortable
uncomfortable
The rival doesnt suddenly
middle career 
rival
time play
stays along
My mom
family I beat
To beat grandmother
big thing me
Cliff Its nature tennis
minute pick racket
For me its
initial walk crowd
its opponent
everyones
play
Dinara
At start everyones rival
When 15 dont know anyone
You dont understand point
rivals 
youre entering
trying best can
I dont know lot
opponents
rise
gets know them
thats probably I know
little bit more
Otherwise I look net
I dont face
Im just know trying
ball court hopefully
Definitely youre starting
rung
youre trying win matches
stronger
Hamer Her brain begins gather
set statistics 
learning read opponent
And learning read opponent
literally step
reading ball
I body surveillance
Um need feel uncomfortable
bad beatings
court
Rivals improve game
You know important
component improving
developing
better tennis player
having Evonne Goolagongs
Billie Jean Kings
Martina Navratilovas
Bethanie Your opponents
help bring best game
Thats everybody improves
Its motivates
stimulates
better way 
mentally physically emotionally
You push limits
playing best tennis
pushing you
Hamer Modern neuroscience
cells brain
body surveillance
They called mirror neurons
So mirror neurons
help read anothers intentions
predict do
This means
predict shot
shot
So thats 
good mind
good logic
Which reasons I say
high level athletes
chose medicine
high level career
do
perfectly capable it
functioning
high level
dont realize it
They think its sport
No its lot sport
Hamer
The tennis players able observe
smallest gesture opponent
critical areas
telegraph
whats happen
And thus its likely
championship players
championship mirror neurons
I big rivalry I guess
hero growing
beginning
Margaret Court
Mary
Chris Evert Martina Navratilova

like weekend
Someone
locker room crying
Perhaps won titles
there

good tennis player
there
That rivalry surpassed
I mean played
80 times 20 years
She big rival
pushed other
My kind rivalry
definitely lasted
career
Justine Henin
Of course Kim special
country
attention big
Tracy Austin
nemesis rival
played junior tournaments
played professional
Justine
I wouldnt I wanted like her
I admired was
Mary Of course
great clash styles
contrast personality
looks background
Kim Now I think it
kind created

grow amazing
Nick Want beat heck
other
respected other
Kim From young age
good one
It healthy
helped better
I like
professional career
maturity
needed change
then thank goodness
actually

Weve close
We emotional females
therefore sensitive
sympathy empathy
comes it
On court were opponents
trying
think friendship 
trying play best
win other
And maybe quality people
rivalry big
quality people
allows friends
Thats time
I thought that
My important moment

If start losing

matter hard try
its lonely
This oneonone sport
Its lonely sport man
It attracts people good
taking
taking journey
Ouellette
When mission like that
its lonely
They times feel like
nobody gets this
You feel like youre island
youre court
youre
teams distance
But person including myself
great team thats really
know hoisted
given confidence
helped
valleys
celebrated
mountain well
King You succeed alone
So anybody thinks
themselves doesnt happen
The trick called pyramid 
team means family
coach student
Because individual sport is
need team you
Not everybody team
I think overdoing bit
early age
Your team normally starts
mom dad coach
and point starts grow
The structure
healthy
order nurture person 
tennis development
person
Its guidance

inside bubble
These people count
know tell
good bad times
stays group
For sure entourage
around
its important them
But also its important
time
leave team
hotel home
If living breathing
thinking tennis 24 hours day
champions
I guarantee that
Its important balance
professional way
life
But end day
athlete leader
Its athlete
lifts everybodys spirits
Its 
its athlete shows way
Alastair Again goes fact
its individual sport
So
court playing match
Its mom dad
coach
You court
need figure way win
Navratilova You win credit
You lose blame
I mean its you
You cant blame anybody else
Mary There substitutions
youre allowed
coach time
The clock doesnt run out

Older younger I dont care chuckles
Its its winning

You hooked right away
Hamer It addictive
All athletes tell you

positive feelings
The nucleus accumbens

Hamer
Being champion mental game

selfawareness emotional resilience

positive outlook
Selfawareness
absolutely vital great

Always practice strengths
What I like athletes

Hamer The players

You dont weeks

You learn lose

When lose its sort like
Whoa I better work volley

losing thinking
Wait got way

dramatic music playing

Nobody actually dies war

crowd murmur excitedly
crowd cheering
commentator Oh goodness
Being competitive

And its like putdown
women

Well goes saying
Guys supposed competitive
women much
King As girl days
I knew things different
girl boy
I knew people listened boys
boys opportunity
then
So I knew road different
probably
difficult I boy
upbeat music playing
King So ideally I wanted men
women everything
OK Own everything
All tournaments
The men rejected us women
kept rejecting
I kept going back
These friends

Billie getting
men women together
Mary She trying say
This world be

Plan B was OK

So Billie called woman
Gladys Heldman
Gladys publisher
Tennis Magazine
Would tournament us
Can try think do
Gladys sponsor
held
professional event womens only
outside establishment
5000 Houston
We look
look history
1970
original Gladys Heldman
started tour
And women
courage
stand establishment
sign 1 contract play
That moment
signed 1 contract
birth
womens professional tennis
Peachy Title IX approved 1972
King It says sex discrimination
So means federal money
men women given
money equally time
So I think that sort of
opened door time
women begin scholarships
country
sports tennis
Nineteen seventythree
pivotal year
womens sports women
happened year
Billie Jean founded WTA
It Wimbledon 1973
They Gloucester Hotel
63 women
Billie said leaving room
agree going
