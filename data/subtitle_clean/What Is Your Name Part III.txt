came
long way
But Im glad
youre alive
If died
I supposed do
Haruki I wont die
Ill always
Machiko
This time Ill
let go
What
suffering about
Machiko rest arms
And healthy
built
happy life together
I cant believe were
together
It like dream
Im happy
Look dawn breaking
Dont worry
sleep
Haruki
Oblivion completely
forget
THE END
