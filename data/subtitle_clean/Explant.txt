getting feedback
Oh God life changed
Im longer bedridden
unable anything
Now Im old self

completely different person
 Right
 Dr Chun And thats
old self coming back
 Why doctors
believe
breast implant illness
real think
 Well I mean I think
biggest thing is know
doctors were trained
like scientists
were supposed use data
formulate opinions
Then points
core clinical studies
done
And told
years
studies shown
referring studies
connection
implants
symptoms
So thats story gets
told over
And everyones mindset is
okay well cant
sick implants
Ive told
study showed
happen
dramatic music
 In Medicine Tonight
1992 FDA banned
silicone gel breast implants
all limited number
women
known risks
possible risks
Now years later
asking real
silicone scare
 Reporter Recent
studies theres link
silicone gel implants

 What happened Dow
Corning something
They gonna lose lot
money
Number one

So Dow Corning took money
marketing budget
research budget
marketing budget
started hiring academic
researchers studies

implants safe
 Reporter Some believed
Harvard
Mayo Clinic studies
seriously flawed
concerned research
researchers

funded breast implant
makers
studies didnt follow
women long enough
And focused
wrong thing
 You ability
little bit information
pretend
answers questions
When it number one cant
possibly answer questions
And number two
designed answer questions
people paying
studies
sure questions
asked way
product
look good
 At end day
studies
sell silicone implants again
I mean I think
discount individual experiences

group healthy women
breast implants
in
sudden dont
feel well
 Right
 And
implants taken out
feel better
 Michelle Right
 So I dont think
discount that
Is good large control
study
No certainly I think
raise flags say
hey somethings definitely
going here
 At point
happening plastic
surgeons
saying
dozens studies
showing safe breast implants

So surgery consists
removing implants
surrounding scar
tissue
known capsule
They dont want foreign
material
foreign body left behind
want taken out
The reason
plastic surgeons
performing procedure
I think done
remove entire capsule
belief
implants
cause health problems
So Ive freed
entire implant
Her implant inside sac
I think its intact
I cant tell
obviously havent opened it
You know women seeing

 It exists I
experience maybe
7000 implant patients

thousands patients mine

 So mean

 Michelle Well true

 Absolutely
 So somebody Dr
Rose I respect said
Michelle theres small
percentage
chance
neurological
autoimmune disorder
And said theres
black box warning this
I go uh
 But its difficult
I think its difficult
situation
cant
exactly percentage
adverse reaction
 All I want transparency
women
getting implanted
cause Im telling you
I know Ive
struggled long
advocate
cause will
So Im armed
information
And
happens I go

 Good
 I think its dreadful its
horrible
I mean whats particularly
dreadful
I harm patient

estimation
 I think plastic surgeons
