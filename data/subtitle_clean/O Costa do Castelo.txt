O COSTA DO CASTELO
The Costa Castelo
Based play
original
Production
The moon fades day breaks
And street comes life
sound reveille
Throughout blue sky
A flock larks fly
Happily singing good morning
Smoke drifts rooftops
The markets opening
To calls fish sellers
The town shouts bubbles throbs
On seven hills
And beautiful dream
Idle smiling
From Castle Madragoa
Sweet beautiful window
Lisbon awakes smiling
Mermaids echoes
Cross air
And beehives
All flight
The morning sun sings splendour
An anthem peace love
A fighting cock sings perch
Challenging rivals
Horns heard
Newsagents walk
 Weighed newspapers
 Milk
And beautiful dream
Idle smiling
From Castle Madragoa
Sweet beautiful window
Lisbon awakes smiling
