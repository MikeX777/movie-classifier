THE BEAUTY OF BEING
A FILM BY JAAN TOOTSEN
Im researcher scientist
Rather Im observer
And Ive focused relationships
constituents whole
This beauty
captivated me
And sharing beauty
experiences it
suits best
I sought intimate contact
world education
I studied biology
Recording sounds nature
nature photography
means perception
And theyve enriching
It broadens world
I discovered new world
I started living
ears Its surprising
I cant tell photography
enriched perception
colour form And light
My comprehension light
What light live in
Such mundane thing
But delve
gains importance work
new layers begin
reveal themselves
Awareness important
All need us
And things given
For example were given
course follow
This course alone
The course important
As destination
It sound odd
Im people
doesnt goals life
Nor principles
Not Im depraved
wholly unambitious
I trust course
And trust it
hold true course
follow chime inner
sound youre compelled hear
youll surely reach
destination
And Ive experienced
unseen unknown destination nears
clearer
shows itself
And youre finally there
youll exclaim surprise
Ah thats I headed
Ive reached goal
When I speak silence
shaper person
Im thinking profound effect
silence relations
nature
people
music
visual arts
poetry
Because silence inherent
realms others
Either directly
indirectly
Thus I think silence
natural resource
Being companion
accepting yourself
learning live
easy feat
Thats why Ive noticed
people afraid silence
Silence
measure
Make mistake Im saying
silence ultimate bliss
That fine
long its silent
No silence measure
And its different people
One bear it
needs it
It depends
ones nature I guess
You
glade cowslips
Or marshmarigolds growing
riverbank springtime
Or underbrush
covered liverleafs
later aglow
thimbleweeds
But finding whats truly
glory takes time
Thats
relationship grows
These bonds main asset
youre company
Some theyre
theyre out
In forest seaside
meadow marsh
But really
Im alone
Theres talk
hard work success
Grow business
Grow yourself
So end
time yourself
You
time yourself
You cant let organise
weekends evenings mornings
else
You need time
idling
Weve taught
work hard
Now ought taught
slack off
That is rest
Sometimes
sinfully slothful yourself
In April 1983
I recorded nocturnal bird
I recorded songs silence
dwelling pauses them
It sounds I church
sang nightly song
forest tall pine trees
Like pillars supporting arches
That is treetops
merging overhead
I managed send copy
recording USSR England
I great contacts
BBC Natural History Unit
Surprisingly I received letter
gratitude urging send
silence
coniferous forest
That encounter
silence commodity
I like listening water
Its peculiar pleasure
I
spots it
You sit river start
catching different tones flow
It runs fast places
rocks Lazily others
Over fallen tree say
There higher lower sounds
Its fascinating
listen to
The cosmos
surrounds us
aweinspiring
admired us
secret mystical
Its actually continuum
It continues All has
I – myself
Like droplet water
snowmelt rain
Its hanging branch
closer look
landscape it
upturned forest flower fields
Whatever you
tiny is
Everythings it
And I too droplet
Im churchgoer
Though I like visiting them
home abroad
sit awhile
listen look in
But church
forest
And religiosity
I that

forest trees
I unfathomable
people dont appreciate
love living trees
Ive understood it
Come summer I like
gaze clouds passing by
For northerners summer
time recharge rest settle
Cicadas grasshoppers chirping
adds lot experience
A blowfly bumblebee
pass through
And are
gazing clouds
Fully immersed
nothing
Just idling
literally
But its like
purification
Looking clouds
sky
I enter realm
notions
In it theres good bad
big small
No thoughts even
Ive noticed occasions
Im thinking all
Its state mind its
realm concepts
Gandhi said world
everyones need

everyones greed
That sustain
My time
up
And Ive thought
Im glad way
I dont witness
GDP raised
Traversing boglands
easy
Viktor Masing said
fact cant hurry bog
reason
visit one
This
oldest landscape teach us
It quiet
moonlit night
A lone dog
barking far off
You reach
peculiar
state mind
complete silence
Away
clamour world
wandering
forest
That moonlight contains
moonlit nights conscious life
Suddenly
spring life
And
stand there look
Not moon much
landscape
How changes forest
river valley
Or grass fence pickets
chimney roof shingles
I remember early childhood
I terribly ill
And times
I vision
It years later
I met wise old woman
And talks
different topics
Ive discussed
else
I described vision her
Though its hard convey visually
She looked I asked
knew I experienced
I do said
That death
It neared
But didnt you
Though I recall feeling dread
vision child
I didnt know
fear death
And I havent given heed
grand ideas afterlife
that
I know birth
world like
I came about
Similarly I know
leaving world
Ive point
reference even
So I havent bothered think
I comes next
Juhan Liiv said
poetry like wind
wind
earth stink
At times I spend hours
listening wind
Especially pine forest
When flaking bark
vibrates wind
It makes music
You hear symphony it
Wind makes sound itself
But hear enters
old windmill chimney flue
rattles stove door
youre making fire
And wind sea
familiar Estonian
Wind sign danger
great companion
A calming companion
Like sounds sea
wind sounds
calming
There time
I went hear birdsong
And finally I reached
age period life
I
hear living silence
Its great pleasure
A lot said level
culture land people
highly regards
cares natural resources
How wellstudied known are
resources broadest sense
wellpreserved are
Its purely matter culture
I spent Christmas
forest
Ive
wife died
And I little desire
visit usual
To someones guest
sit table and
well
play celebrating Christmas
insolent sound
But I felt things
turn way
I couldnt spend Christmas
– campfire
By smell smoke
I need it
Just need oxygen live
I need smell
Its
favourite aromas
Its innate need
stems ones nature
And youre able follow
nature do
Though person
doesnt easy
theyve
recognised nature
It means remain
true situations
Which isnt
possible
But possible
try follow nature
