work critic easy

selves judgment
We thrive negative criticism

But bitter truth critics face
grand scheme things
average piece junk
probably meaningful
criticism designating so
But times
critic truly risks
discovery
defense new
The world unkind
new talent new creations
The new needs friends
Last night
I experienced new
extraordinary meal
singularly unexpected source
To meal

In past I secret
disdain
