And
legendary
Shane Dorian
couple years later
vicious wipeout

I think theres
potential there
Now see know
human beings like us
going
pushing hardest to
know overcome fears
When
super passionate
letting fear

going it
know head down
I think Its uh
its motivating thing
Despite going dreams
big left slab barrel
ocean way
determining things
Torrey ends side

backyard
Really scariest thing
riding big wave
as life is
know its fear
unknown
In order overcome fear
able face
it
theres just really
way it
But facing is oftentimes
scary
thinking it
leading it
Fear is I think
emotion gets
worst rap
But time
its powerful
emotion
Its actually helps
survive overcome
Cause its conscious
way
Its
subconscious thing
its honing
fear
channeling
right direction
You let eat up
let
highest places
When youre wave
goes quiet
Youre at probably
moment
loudest place earth
Waves exploding
People screaming
cliff
All sudden
its pure quiet
its blissfulness
While Kai slips
sessions diaper duty
Matt Torrey
its flight
This time Oahu
new swell
promises bring

dangerous wave
Earth life
Pipeline
One thing sure
vibe
welcoming community
Mavericks
nearly empty
windblown lineup Jaws
Torrey enjoys
heavy local status
help waves
cutthroat
competitive arena
Matt gonna
play politics
his
If
wrong wave there
drop
wrong person
looking wrong
wave beaten up
You sent in
Pipeline
break biggest
measure waves
increments fear
its chain
having claimed lives
shallow lava reef
I feel like wave like
Jaws prepare
holddown
Youre deep water
When wave crashes
you its pushing
depths
peoples
worst nightmare
But youre prepared
holddown
youre gonna survive it
whereas wave
like Pipeline
sure its like
lot smaller
its breaking
extremely shallow
uh shallow lava rock
And
control safe
try catch
right wave
wave slamming
reef youre
wrong place
Theres energy
thats converging
small area
The reef uneven
making wave walk
refract
change
different directions
Its extremely unpredictable
And fall
wrong place
wave driving
hard reef
So preparation
help
safer there
If wrong wave
pushes
reef
youre gonna
trouble
If youre going head first
knocked
unconscious
like very easily
Pipeline definitely
dangerous wave
world
And I feel fear
Pipeline I
surfing wave like Jaws
For Matt
uniquely
challenging spot
dealing combination
danger hunting
wave
locals
It little bit
uphill battle
again crowd
The waves good
struggle
waves
When surf wave
thats intense
time slows down
All senses come alive
Everything intensified
youre paddling

youre looking edge
its past vertical
water
sucking reef
wave
drops away the
curls over
making huge room
youre inside of
Only have like
seconds
