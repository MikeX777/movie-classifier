This way I planned
Not intention
I got brave drink hand
Lost discretion
Its what Im
Just wanna try
Im curious
Caught attention
I kissed girl I liked
The taste cherry chap stick
I kissed girl try
I hope boyfriend dont mind
It felt wrong
It felt right
Dont mean Im love tonight
I kissed girl I liked
I liked
No I dont know
It doesnt matter
Youre experimental game
Just human nature
Its what good girls
Not behave
My head gets confused
Hard obey
I kissed girl I liked
The taste cherry chap stick
I kissed girl try
I hope boyfriend dont mind
It felt wrong
It felt right
Dont mean Im love tonight
I kissed girl I liked
I liked
Us girls magical
Soft skin red lips kissable
Hard resist touchable
Too good deny
Aint big deal its innocent
I kissed girl I liked
The taste cherry chap stick
I kissed girl try
I hope boyfriend dont mind
It felt wrong
It felt right
Dont mean Im love tonight
I kissed girl I liked
I liked
