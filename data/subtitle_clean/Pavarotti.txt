Somebody record company
said Luciano

It pisses

Because wellknown songs
What bring them
The thing bring
entire life
A life thats lived
mistakes youve made
hopes desires

comes crashing performance
I conducting Tosca
I forget
Luciano singing noble character
At end opera
Cavaradossi

Bravo

Nessun dorma
Nessun dorma
Tu pure o Principessa
Nella tua fredda stanza
Guardi le stelle
Che tremano damore
E di speranza
Ma il mio mistero è chiuso
Il nome mio nessun saprà
No
Sulla tua bocca
Lo dirò
Quando la luce
Splenderà
Ed il mio bacio scioglierà
Il silenzio
Che ti fa mia
Dilegua o notte
Tramontate stelle
Tramontate
Stelle
Allalba vincerò
Vincerò
Vincerò
