As society fragmenting
life increasingly
lost plot

finding surreal way
reflecting new reality
We breaking ground
Shocking people
We play called
Harry Noon Night
That insane
And Dustin Hoffman transvestite
 A mysterious creepy
 insane character
And I remembering the
You hold sound Im sorry
 We helicopter possibly
A good one
 Ronald Ribman sent play

called Harry Noon Night
It unlike
seen
That Wynn
looking for I think
Plays audience say
What this
You know Something new
presented here
I remember lot talk
time church
Well think appropriate
play church
Not doubt mind
No no perfectly fine
Nothing stopped Wynn Handman
wanted do
 They came theater
shock new
Im generation came age
turbulent experimentation
Wynn use phrase
Let plays happen you
And triggered remembering
know from
junior high school
A poem mean be
Which useful phrase artist
Dont try mean something
Try something
You know I remember seeing
La Turista caused bit stir
Sam insisted chicken
decapitated stage
One sequences
bring sort ritualistic doctor in
What them
A medicine man
This doctor going use
fresh chicken blood hes going kill
chicken stage
 And squeeze
 the chicken blood
drip blood chicken
 Sam
 Waterston
It occurred that
probably going farther
go
kill chicken stage
Some guys suits came in
They lawyers said
Its illegal kill animal
on stage entertainment
As soon heard illegal
property guys came
wonderful way it
A fake chicken
syringe backside
And illusion
kill chicken
And solved problem
So audience
believed I got lot hate mail
Yeah
It disaster Wynn I think
know
But I mean Im glad it
Many voiced discontent
lost subscribers
A lot subscribers
American Place Theatre
box office
This probably
theater world
couldnt buy ticket
The American Place Theatre
subscription audience
willing
things
critics said yea nay
With subscriptiononly were
guaranteed audience
worrying reviews
If worry reviews
youre worried wrong thing
Artistic director
The American Place Theatre
Wynn Handman
playwright Ronald Milner
Ron Milner change plays
suit
audience American Place
And Wynn loved that
Wynn actually looking
AfricanAmerican plays
I many
I trove them
Now Woody King brought play
called Whos Got His Own
Whos Got His Own
family play
Set eve funeral
father family
A family father
tyrant beat son up
Whose father worker
automobile plant Detroit
And then son
went plant
white workers there
They said Youre shithouse Tims boy
He said What
Yeah youre shithouse Tim
Thats does
thats him
Yeah And laughed
said
He cleans them
hes scared come them
Now I didnt understand that Mama
I mean didnt sit right me
It didnt
thunder power
That
That him
So carried
eve fathers funeral
For story told
amazing know
I couldnt believe
particular piece work
There white Savior
Whos Got His Own
There
caucasian audience
root for
My impression critics
taught playwrights
school
There reference point
And so therefore
hard write them
These inyourface plays
brought audience
didnt let
experienced
people ignored
And werent places that
especially time
To speak mind
subversive definition
unsettling definition
thoughtprovoking definition
Well look
I reason
come funeral today
dig
All life
father cant talk me
white faces
choked tongue out
Mama
cemetery aint over
Its here Aching burning
I saw white middleaged people
kind watch operation
unfold them
painful experience them
But I feel
knew better
result having seen play
In main audience reacted
critics
I thought come
level human beings
As I told I
underestimated white audience
overestimated white critics
Most people
write drama criticism
writing reviews
Why want review
attract customers
So thats function business
advertising
Each time I play
I said author
We critics
Because all I subscribers
I wasnt catering box office
Why evaluated outside
people who
all arent writers
I mean theyre journalists okay
Im saying journalism isnt writing
I didnt feel like
doing
necessary assessed like that
That wasnt for
Wynn business
What Wynn
developing theater culture
tower
try sustain it
Whos Got His Own
turned significant
Wynn opened world me
I play
work actor
producer
Thats I learned produce
Thats I able bring
plays Wynn writers
 I taken Wynn
Five Black Hand Side
Wynn that
I taken Ed Bullins
Wynn produced short oneacts
 It group short plays
 What title that
The title The Electronic

 And Others
 Ed Bullins
 Ed favorite writer
He cultural minister
Black Panthers
There tension
subscribers
But Wynn glorying that
He loved that man
And I think thats bad artist
following mass drive
He attack sides side
Hes outsider anyway
 The outsider
I outsider
I accepted outsider
I did
The creative act
know its going lead
Youre thinking
whos picking it
You act act itself
