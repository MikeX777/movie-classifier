 So lets hear it
 Well all
substance brought
slightly radioactive
Now dangerously so
register high
 That eternal stimulus
talking about
 Now listen this
About 20 years ago
nuclear reactor
experimental test facility
Lake Sherwin
Wisconsin discovered
leaking
infinitesimal
radioactive
byproduct lake
This instillation
way forerunner
modern day
nuclear power plant
like miles
coast here
 What got
mud I found
 Well stay me
This background
phase twostory
Along report
nuclear litter
report damn near
hidden virtually ignored
It told effects
spill
certain stagnant
lagoon adjoining Sherwin
It
silt lagoon
picked bit
radioactivity

extremely absorptive
The bacteria algae

advanced
primitive life forms
living lagoon
 I totally
lost point
 Well wont be
According scientists
discovered silt
literally involved
lack better word
form
protoplasm took
characteristics
absorbed
mutated
totally different
Scientists named
organic mud Slithis
 Why
 For reason
parents named Jeff
Who knows
At rate shouldve
discovery
century went
virtually unnoticed
Locked tighter
drum AECs fear
notoriety
Slithis cause
uproar nuclear leak
undoubtedly have
 Thats story John
 But aint heard
best yet
 Theres more
 One scientists
originally discovered
Slithis working
Crest Oil Company
Apparently idea
radiation
create new life
stuck him
 Theres bit
Frankenstein us
 Exactly
So convinced
big shots Crest
fund experiments
He maintained
creating instant life
creating
ingredients necessary
formation
natural petroleum
 Oh sure combining
organic matter
little bit bacteria
substituting
pressure million years
environmental change
dose radioactivity
 To point
appears substance
brought

similar Slithis
A freak combination
natural radioactivity
elements science
able duplicate
 Whos scientist
thats working Crest
 Oh right Erin
Burrick name
I believe lives
Malibu hills
sources correct
 Didnt
scientist
 Unfortunately overdosed
radiation years ago

Wanna go
 Yes Ill go
 Near marina
mediumsized nuclear
energy facility
mile
coast
Now inconceivable
facility
leaked
radioactive material
Of course radioactivity
catalytic ingredient
causes abiogenesis
If youre familiar
work
youll know
Ive success
creating Slithis
laboratory conditions
 I thought
What Slithis evolved
point
initial discovery
What evolved
creature complex
sought nutrition
necessary alive
 Evolved
simple life form
discovered
complex
I certainly wouldnt
wasnt possible
 But
cause change
 Why
radioactivity dear
It
astounding affect
living organisms
We Slithis
incorporation
characteristics
absorbed
Now given proper nutrients
growth potential
endless
I idea shape
form growth
eventually take
 In words form
suited need survive
 The job
imagination
fertile own
 Doctor prove this
 You
source radioactivity
Now
nuclear energy facility
securitys tight
theyll admit nothing
Through analysis soil
shore plant
however
accurately determine
basic elements
investigation nature
 Howdy Captain

possibility Slithis
organic
mud exist
Although borders
abiogenesis
disproven Louis
Pasteur 1800
thats
there
What I cant accept
idea thing
living coast
time ones noticed it
 Risling
The point moot
I finished chatting
plant manager
Imperial
Nuclear Energy station
assures
facility
radioactive
leak kind
plant
constructed 1965
 Of course
I told would
Did expect
admit like that
 Unless Risling feels

conversation
productive nature
I believe
close subject
Risling
Very well
Mr Connors I
going thank
display
public spirit
