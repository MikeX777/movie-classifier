Act 1 scene 5
Act 1 scene 5

favor study emotions
expense action
I want examples
Lets Act 2
Well straight scene 5
Ill need Lisette
Arlequin Silvia
Get marks
Were middle scene
You follow
Remember situation
Lisette told
start Act 2 scene 1
Arlequin fancies her
Do fancy days
May I hope
Take there
May I hope feel likewise
Were Perette Margot
I spied you
whip hand cellar stairs
youd princess yet
Can feelings endure
To strengthen mutually
let swear undying love despite
spelling mistakes
committed person
I prize sweet vow
willingly
I stoop
dazzling kindness
Stop I bear
humbled
Its absurd
Stand up
Someone coming
What Lisette
A word madame
Enough dear girl
Come minutes
Maids land

Monsieur
Excuse me I wanted ask
Im poor girl this
 Im maid acting rich
 Exactly
Right
So shes rich acting poor
But comes in
acting like shes rich
Ive started
Finish scene well see
Who says
I wont act poor later
Thats good question
Do why
That question
leads heart play
Marivaux rich acting poor
poor acting rich
manage it
It shows were prisoners
social condition
If youre rich 20 years
poor 20 years
dress rags
youre rich
fancy dresses
youre poor
language conversation
stay same
The way express
shows come from
This
The Game Love Chance
shows theres chance
Who rich fall for
The rich
And poor fall for
The poor
They recognize
despite disguises
They fall love
social class
No chance love
Love usual sense
pure love is
Usually fall love
inner being
whats it
Marivaux says that
were conditioned
original milieu
We stick together Even disguised
escape origins
So play
rich people poor people
playing roles
manage times
origins
fail
 Reflexes return
 We imitate that
Yes imitating
imitating
Do understand that
These recognize other
Their love purest feeling
influenced origins
