Thou seest unhappy
This wide universal
theater presents 
More woeful pageants scene 
Wherein play in
All worlds stage
And men women
Merely players
They exits
entrances
And man
time plays parts
His acts 
Seven ages
At  infant
Mewling puking nurses arms
Then whining schoolboy
satchel shining morning face
Creeping like snail
unwillingly school
And lover
Sighing like furnace
With woeful ballad
mistress eyebrow
Then soldier
Full strange oaths
bearded like pard
Jealous honor
Sudden quick quarrel
Seeking bubble reputation
Even cannons mouth
And then
In fair round belly
With good capon lined
With eyes severe
beard formal cut
Full wise saws modern instances
And plays part
The sixth age
Shifts lean
slippered pantaloon
With spectacles nose
pouch side
His youthful hose saved
A world wide shrunk shank
And big manly voice
Turning childish treble
Pipes whistles sound
Last scene all
That ends strange eventful history
Is second childishness
And mere
Oblivion
Sans teeth
Sans eyes
Sans taste
Sans
Everything
If
good Sir Rowlands son
As whispered
faithfully were
Be truly welcome hither
Good old man
Thou art right welcome thy master is

Till thou quit thee thy brothers

Well push doors
And let officers nature

Do expediently turn going
Hang verse

Survey thy chaste eye

Thy huntress

O Rosalind
These trees shall books
And barks

That eye forest looks
thy virtue witnessed everywhere
Run
Run Orlando
Carve tree

The unexpressive she
From east western Ind
No jewel like Rosalind
Her worth mounted wind
Through world bears Rosalind
All pictures fairest lined

Let face kept mind
But fair Rosalind
Ill rhyme years together
Dinners suppers
sleeping hours excepted
Out fool
 For taste
If hart lack hind
Let seek Rosalind
Stop
If cat kind

Wintered garments lined
So slender Rosalind
Sweetest nut hath sourest rind

Peace dull fool
This false gallop verses
Why infect them

Truly tree yields bad fruit
 Peace
Helens cheek heart
Cleopatras majesty
Atalantas better part
Sad Lucretias modesty
Thus Rosalind parts
By heavenly synod devised
Of faces eyes hearts
To touches dearest prized

Head ground catlike watch
When sleeping man stir
This seen
Orlando approach man
And brother
His elder brother
