Animals The Tollkeeper
It years
Since I heard
story tollkeeper
At first tale
unimaginable true
But I heard rumours
contemporary phenomenon
myth
source great intrigue
Finding exact location man
required true detective work
But months trekking
deserts Southern Utah
We quarry

An unexpected snag
Our subject appears apprehensive
