A particular favourite
housewives
women stay home
company
dishwasher
vacuum cleaner

It’s there it’s available
use it
And wanna maintain
impregnability costs
Keep movements
minimal

And people were
oh Mo B Dick Mo B Dick
And Mo Fisher’s getting lost
I felt inner man
overtook inner woman
As result I lost sight female self
singing Are boy girl
What I was it’s difficult explain
it’s like I said
male side

That’s interesting because
left
overdeveloped
female chest
right breast
didn’t develop all
These photographs Mo
I took New York
When Mo wearing fabulous
half man half woman costume
water dripping
I think gender performance
I think gender
performance
I think people
subconsciously perform
gender role
they’ve assigned
people subvert that
Generally people conform
generally men don’t
wearing dresses
generally women
don’t around
scratching balls
We don’t individuals
reinvent meaning gender
Each person individually
person time
We come genders

constructed us
political economic
social cultural contexts
So we’re gender
perform socially
constructed script
A medically accepted clitoris
0 1 cm
medically acceptable penis
25 45 cm
If fall
1 25
usually cut
deem
bad man
penis small
woman
clitoris large
So generally whack
thought
sexual pleasure child
adult
They that
Yeah that
In everyday life
I’m probably perceived man
Its fine people
