Two great mysteries dominate lives love money
What love question endlessly explored stories
songs books movies television
But NOT said question What money
Its surprising monetary theory hasnt inspired blockbuster movies
But mentioned schools attended
For us question Where money come from
brings mind picture mint printing bills stamping coins
Money believe created government
It s true
point
Those metal paper symbols
value usually think money
are indeed produced agency
federal government called Mint
But vast majority money
created Mint
It created huge amounts day
private corporations known banks
Most believe banks lend money
entrusted depositors
Easy picture
But truth
In fact banks create money loan
banks earnings
money deposited
directly borrowers promise repay
The borrowers signature loan papers
obligation pay bank
loan plus interest
or lose house car
asset pledged collateral
Thats big commitment borrower
What signature require bank
The bank gets conjure existence
loan
write borrowers account
Sound farfetched
Surely cant true
But is
To demonstrate miracle modern banking
came about consider simple story
The Goldsmiths Tale
Once times
pretty money
It portable
people faith
later exchanged things real value
like food clothing shelter
Shells cocoa beans pretty stones
feathers money
Gold silver attractive
soft easy work with
cultures expert metals
Goldsmiths trade easier casting coins
standardized units metals
weight purity certified
To protect gold goldsmith needed vault
And soon fellow townsmen
knocking door
wanting rent space safeguard
coins valuables
Before long goldsmith renting shelf
vault earning small income vault rental business
Years went goldsmith astute observation
Depositors rarely came remove actual
physical gold came once
That claim checks goldsmith
written receipts gold
traded marketplace
gold itself
This paper money far convenient heavy coins
amounts simply written
instead laboriously counted transaction
Meanwhile goldsmith business
He lent gold charging interest
Well convenient claim check money came acceptance
borrowers began asking loans form
claim checks instead actual metal
As industry expanded
people asked goldsmith loans
This gave goldsmith better idea
He knew depositors
removed actual gold
So goldsmith figured easily away
lending claim checks depositors gold
addition own
As long loans repaid
depositors wiser worse off
And goldsmith banker artisan
far greater profit
lending gold
For years goldsmith secretly enjoyed good income
earned everybody elses deposits
Now prominent lender grew steadily richer
fellow townsmen flaunted it
Suspicions grew spending depositors money
His depositors got threatened withdrawal gold
goldsmith didnt come clean newfound wealth
Contrary expected
turn disaster goldsmith
Despite duplicity inherent scheme
idea work
The depositors lost anything
Their gold safe goldsmiths vault
Rather taking gold
depositors demanded goldsmith banker
cut paying share interest
And beginning banking
The banker paid low rate deposits
peoples money loaned higher interest
The difference covered banks cost operation
profit
The logic simple
And like reasonable way
satisfy demand credit
However NOT way banking works today
Our goldsmithbanker content income remaining
sharing earnings depositors
And demand credit growing fast
Europeans spread world
But loans limited
gold depositors vault
Thats got bolder idea
Since knew
actually vaults
lend claim checks gold
wasnt there
As long claim check holders didnt come vault
time demand real gold out
This new scheme worked well
banker enormously wealthy
paid gold exist
The idea banker create money
outrageous believe
so long time
thought occur people
But power invent money went bankers head
imagine
In time magnitude bankers loans ostentatious wealth
trigger suspicions again
Some borrowers started demand real gold
instead paper representations Rumors spread
Suddenly wealthy depositors showed remove gold
The game up
A sea claim check holders flooded street
outside closed doors bank
Alas banker gold  silver
redeem paper hands
This called run bank
banker dreads
This phenomenon run bank
ruined individual banks and surprisingly
damaged public confidence bankers
It straightforward outlaw
practice creating money nothing
But large volumes credit bankers offering
essential success European commercial expansion
So instead practice legalized regulated
Bankers agreed abide limits
fictional loan money lent out
The limit number larger
actual value gold silver vault
Quite ratio 9 fictional dollars
1 actual dollar gold
These regulations enforced surprise inspections
It arranged that
event run
central banks support local banks
emergency infusions gold
Only runs lot banks simultaneously
bankers credit bubble burst
come crashing down
The Money System Today
Over years fractional reserve
integrated network banks backed central bank
dominant money world
At time fraction gold backing debt money
steadily shrunk nothing
The basic nature money changed
In past paper dollar actually receipt
redeemed fixed weight gold silver
In present paper digital dollar redeemed
paper digital dollar
In past privately created bank credit existed
form private banknotes people choice refuse
choice refuse
someones private cheque today
In present privately created bank credit
legally convertible government issued fiat currency
dollars loonies pounds habitually think money
Fiat currency money created government fiat
decree legal tender laws declare citizens accept fiat money
payment debt courts enforce obligation
So question
governments banks create money
money exists
In past total money existence
limited actual physical quantities
commodity use money
For example order new gold silver money created
gold silver dug ground
In present money literally created debt
New money created takes loan bank
As result total money created
real limit  total level debt
Governments place additional statutory limit
creation new money
enforcing rules known
fractional reserve requirements
Essentially arbitrary fractional reserve requirements
vary country country time time
In past common require banks
dollars worth real gold vault
10 dollars worth debt money created
Today reserve requirement ratios longer apply
ratio new money gold deposit
merely ratio new debt money
existing debt money deposit bank
Today banks reserves consist things
governmentissued cash equivalent
bank deposited central bank
plus existing debt money
bank deposit
To illustrate simple way

let imagine new bank started
depositors yet
However banks investors reserve deposit
thousand dollars cents
existing cash money central bank
required reserve ratio 91
Step 1 The doors open new bank
welcomes loan customer
He needs 10000 buy good car
At 91 reserve ratio new banks reserve central bank
known highpowered money
allows legally conjure existence 9 times amount
10000 basis borrowers pledge debt
This 10000 taken anywhere
It brand new money simply typed borrowers account bank credit
The borrower writes check bank credit
buy car
Step 2 The seller deposits newly
created 10000 bank
Unlike highpowered government money deposited central bank
newly created credit money multiplied reserve ratio
Instead divided reserve ratio
At ratio 91 new loan 9000 created
basis 10000 deposit
Step 3 If 9000 deposited party
bank created it different one
legal basis issue bank credit
time 8100
Like Russian dolls layer contains
slightly smaller doll inside new deposit contains potential
slightly smaller loan infinitely decreasing series
Now loan money created deposited bank
process stops
That unpredictable
money creation mechanism
But likely step new money
deposited bank reserve ratio process
repeat 100000
brand new money created banking system
All new money created entirely debt
process legally authorized initial reserve deposit
thousand dollars cents
sitting untouched central bank
Whats more ingenious system
books bank chain
bank 10 deposit loan
This gives banks real incentive seek deposits
order able loans supporting general
misleading impression loans come deposits
Now successive loans
deposited bank
said bank got multiply
initial high powered money reserve 90 times
issuing bank credit nothing
However banking closed loop bank credit
created bank deposit another vice versa
In theoretical world perfectly equal exchanges
ultimate effect exactly
process took place bank
That is banks initial central bank reserve
little dollars
allows ultimately collect
100000 bank had
If sounds ridiculous try this
In recent decades result steady lobbying banks
requirements reserve deposit
nations central bank disappeared countries
actual reserve ratios higher 91
For types accounts
thirty ratios common
And recently loan fees raise required reserve
borrower
banks way circumvent
reserve requirement limitations entirely
So
rules complex
common sense reality actually simple
Banks create money borrow
Everyone subconsciously knows
banks lend money
When draw savings account
bank doesnt tell cant
hast lent money somebody else
Mark Mansfield economist author
Despite endlessly presented mint footage governmentcreated money
typically accounts 5 money circulation
More 95 money existence today created
signing pledge indebtedness bank
Whats more bank credit money created destroyed
huge amounts day
new loans old ones repaid
I afraid ordinary citizen like
told banks create money
And control credit nation
direct policy Governments
hold hollow hand destiny people
Reginald McKenna past Chairman Board Midlans Bank England
Banks practice money
active cooperation government
First governments pass legal tender laws
use national fiat currency
Secondly governments allow private bank credit
paid government currency
Thrirdly government courts enforce debts
And lastly governments pass regulations
protect money systems functionality credibility public
inform public
money comes from
The Simple Truth
The simple truth
sign dotted line
socalled loan mortgage
signed pledge payment
backed assets pledge forfeit fail pay
thing real value
involved transaction
To believes honour pledge
loan agreement mortgage portable
exchangeable
saleable piece paper
It IOU
It represents value
form money
This money borrower exchanges
banks socalled loan
Now A loan natural world means lender
lend
If need hammer loaning promise provide hammer
I dont wont help
But artificial world money
banks promise pay money doesnt have
allowed passed money
accept such
Thus national circulating medium
mercy loan transactions banks
lend money promises supply money possess
Irving Fisher economist author
Once borrower signs pledge debt
bank balances transaction creating
keystrokes computer
matching debt bank borrower
From borrowers point view
loan money account
government allows
debt bank borrower
converted government fiat currency
accept money
Again basic truth simple
Without document borrower signed
banker lend
Have wondered everyone
governments corporations small businesses families
debt time
astronomical amounts
Have questioned
money lend
Now know
There isnt
Banks lend money
They simply create debt
And debt potentially unlimited
supply money
And turns
NO DEBT NO MONEY
opposite situation true
Isnt astounding despite
incredible wealth resources
innovation productivity surrounds us
us
governments companies individuals
heavily debt bankers
If people stop think  How be
How people actually produce
real wealth world
debt merely lend
money represents wealth
Even amazing realize
money DEBT
realize debt
money
That money is
If debts money system
wouldnt money
Marriner S Eccles Chairman Governor Federal Reserve Board
If news you
alone
Most people imagine debts paid off
state economy improve
Its certainly true individual level
Just money spend
loan payments finished
think debt
money spend general
But truth exact opposite
There money
There is We totally dependent continually
renewed bank credit money existence
No loans money  happened
Great Depression
money supply shrank drastically
supply loans dried up
This staggering thought
We completely dependent Commercial Banks
Someone borrow dollar
circulation cash credit
If Banks create ample synthetic money
prosperous not starve
We are absolutely
permanent money system
When gets complete grasp picture
tragic absurdity hopeless position
incredible is
Robert H Hemphill Credit Manager Federal Reserve Bank

PERPETUAL DEBT
Thats all Banks create
Principal
They create money
pay Interest
Where supposed come from
The place borrowers obtain
money pay Interest
general economys
overall money supply
But overall money supply
created exactly way
as bank credit paid
created
So everywhere
borrowers situation
frantically trying obtain money need
pay Principal Interest
total money pool
contains Principal
 It clearly impossible pay
Principal plus Interest
money exist
This expressed simple mathematical formula
The big problem
long term loans mortgages government debt
total Interest far exceeds Principal
So lot extra money
created pay Interest
means high proportion foreclosures
nonfunctioning economy
To maintain functional society
rate foreclosure needs low
And so accomplish this
new debt money
created
satisfy todays demands money
service previous debt
But course makes total debt
bigger
And means
ultimately paid
resulting everescalating
inescapable spiral mounting indebtedness
It time lag
moneys creation
new loans repayment
keeps overall shortage money catching
bankrupting entire system
However bankers insatiable credit monster
gets bigger bigger
need create debt money
feed increasingly urgent
Why rates low
Why unsolicited credit cards
mail
Why US government spending
faster ever
Could stave collapse
entire monetary system
The rational person ask
Can forever
Isnt collapse inevitable
One thing realize fractional reserve banking
that like childs game musical chairs
long music playing losers
Andrew Gause Monetary Historian
Money facilitates production trade
As money supply increases
money increasingly worthless
volume production trade
real world grows
Add realization hear
economy growing 3 year
sounds like constant rate
But not
This years 3 represents real goods services
years 3 3 new total
Instead straight line naturally

madman economist
Kenneth Boulding economist
What
downright scary situation
For thing
need different concept money
Its time people ask
governments simple questions
Around world governments borrow money
private banks
Government debt major component total debt
servicing debt takes big chunk taxes
Now know banks
simply create money lend
governments
given permission this
So question
governments choose borrow money
private banks
government create
free money needs itself
And second big question is
Why create money debt all
Why create money circulates permanently
doesnt perpetually reborrowed
order exist
The question
How money function
perpetually accelerating growth
build sustainable economy
Isnt logical perpetually accelerating growth
sustainability incompatible
And finally
What current
makes totally dependent perpetual growth
What needs changed
allow creation sustainable economy
Usury
At time charging loan
called usury
subject severe penalties
including death
Every major religion forbade usury
Most arguments practice
moral
It held moneys legitimate purpose
facilitate exchange real goods services
Any form making money simply having money
regarded act parasite
thief
However credit needs commerce increased
moral arguments eventually gave way argument
lending involves risk
loss opportunity lender
attempting
profit lending justified
Today notions quaint
Today idea making money money
held ideal strive for
Why work money
work you
However trying
envision sustainable future
clear charging
moral practical problem
Imagine society economy
endure centuries because
instead plundering capital stores energy
restricts present day income
No wood harvested
grows period
All energy renewable solar gravitational geothermal
magnetic discover
This society lives limits nonrenewable resources
reusing recycling everything
And population replaces itself
Such society function money
utterly dependent perpetually accelerating growth
A stable economy need money supply
capable remaining stable collapsing
Lets total volume stable money supply
represented big circle
Let imagine moneylenders
actually existing money lend
If people money supply
begin systematically lending money interest
share money supply grow
If continually reloan
money gets paid inevitable result
Whether gold fiat
debt money doesnt matter
The moneylenders end ALL money
And foreclosures bankruptcies filed
real property too
Only proceeds lending
evenly distributed population
central problem solved
Heavy taxation bank profits
accomplish goal
But banks
want business
If able free
current situation
imagine banking run
nonprofit service society
disbursing earnings
universal citizen dividend
lending charging all
I could
use logic reason
justify Federal Government
borrowing use money
I believe time come
people demand changed
I believe time come country
actually blame

CHANGING THE SYSTEM
If fundamental nature

Many monetary critics clamour return goldbased money
claiming gold long history reliability
They ignore scams played gold
shaving coins debasing metal

Some advocate silver abundant gold

Many question need
bring precious metals all
No wants carrying
heavy sacks coins shopping
It certainty paper digital

real medium trade potential
creating unlimited debt money now
Beyond that gold sole legal basis money
gold suddenly money
Other monetary reform advocates concluded
greed dishonesty main problems
better ways create
honest equitable money returning silver gold
Inventive minds proposed
variety alternative ways create money
Many private barter systems create money
debt banks do
openly charging interest
An example barter
debt expressed pledges hours work
work valued equally dollar figure
allows hours equated

This kind money set
