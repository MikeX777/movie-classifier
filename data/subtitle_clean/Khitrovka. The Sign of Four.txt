However
Raja Norris managed away it
Their guilt proven
Soon however
offense
Norris exiled penal servitude Andaman Islands
Raja
took advantage moment ran away

Thanks Chekhov know time passing by
Andaman Islands Russian steamship Petersburg sailed by
Thats Raja traveled Russia
Subsequently settling
Khitrovka
However Norris
managed escape hard labor
immediately began searching companion
Somehow met Testov

Of course knew existence Spark East
likely
met Rajoy then
It Testov
prompted Norris
