NO NO NO NO A
FLUNKING STUDENT
NO NO A FLUNKING STUDENT
SHOULDNT RECEIVE SUCH
ACCOLADES AS FABULOUS
FABULOUS NOW
THATS ALL IM SAYING
SURE THEYRE FLUNKING
I COULD SEE MAYBE A C STUDENT
HAVE A FABULOUS HERE
BUT A FLUNKING
STUDENT FABULOUS
Man WHY DONT YOU
PUT IT IN REVERSE
WHY DONT YOU SAY WHY
DONT YOU SAY THAT
A STUDENT WHO CAN WRITE FABULOUS
PAPERS SHOULDNT FLUNK
SHOULDNT DO THINGS WHICH
WOULD CAUSE HER TO FLUNK
YOU SEE
NO IT DEPENDS
ON THE LANGUAGE
YOU KNOW ITS STRANGE
IVE ALWAYS FOUND THAT A MAN
WHO USES THE WORD SYMPATHY
IS NEVER SYMPATHETIC
HAVE YOU EVER FOUND THAT DR
BOODISH
TELL THE TRUTH
 WOMAN GIGGLING 
AND I HAVE NO REDRESS
ALL RIGHT NOTHING
NO REDRESS
NO REDRESS NONE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
NO ALL I WANT YOU TO SAY
THAT AT LEAST IM RIGHT
ABOUT THESE FEW
PAPERS THATS ALL
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU
THAT YOU ARE RIGHT
ABOUT THESE PAPERS
I WANT YOU TO SAY THAT A
GIRL WHO RECEIVES FABULOUS
AND ALL THESE MARKS
SHOULDNT FLUNK
I CAN ONLY SAY THIS
THAT THE TEACHER IN
READING THESE PAPERS
THOUGHT THEY WERE FABULOUS
BUT THE TOTAL MARK INVOLVES
MORE THAN JUST THOSE PAPERS
THATS ALL I CAN TELL YOU
BUT I THINK THIS IS A
RATHER UNIQUE SITUATION
WOULDNT YOU SAY SO
RATHER UNIQUE
WELL WOULD YOU BE HAPPY
IF I SAY ITS UNIQUE
ID BE HAPPY
ALL RIGHT I WOULD SAY
ITS SOMEWHAT UNIQUE
IS IT COMPASSIONATE FOR A
TEACHER TO WRITE FABULOUS
LET ME GET BACK TO THIS AGAIN
AND THE GIRL FIGURES
SHE IS DOING WELL
VERY GOOD RHONA
AND ESPECIALLY THIS FABULOUS
AND THEN FINALLY SHE
GETS HER REPORT CARD
AND THE GIRL IS STUNNED
ITS ANOTHER E
IS IT ALSO FAIR FOR A GIRL
AND I THINK MR
SCHUSTER WILL CONCUR
DOES THIS GIRL CAUSE ANY
TROUBLE HER DEPORTMENT
IS SHE WILD TALK A LOT
WELL SHE DID GET A SATISFACTORY
MARK IN COOPERATION
WHY DID SHE GET AN
E THE FIRST TIME
ITS COMPLETELY AGAINST
HER CHARACTER
IN BEHAVIOR
IN BEHAVIOR
WHY DID SHE GET AN
E THE FIRST TIME
COMPLETELY AGAINST
HER CHARACTER
AN E
YES IN BEHAVIOR IN BEHAVIOR
WHAT DID SHE GET IN THERE
AN E
E IS A GRADE ITS
NOT A BEHAVIOR MARK
DID SHE TELL WHAT DID SHE SAY
UH 4 3 THE LOWEST YOU
CAN GET I IMAGINE
WE CANNOT JUDGE RHONAS MARK
BASED PURELY ON THIS TEACHERS
REMARKS OF THESE PAPERS
THIS IS ALL IM SAYING
RHONA LIMITED IN MANY WAYS
KNEW WORLD EVENTS AND
THE WORLD AROUND HER
SHE KNEW THE DIFFERENT
FORMS OF GOVERNMENT
THE DIFFERENT STRUCTURES
OF TYPES OF GOVERNMENT
HERE RHONA FAILED
BECAUSE SHE FAILED
IN ALL THESE TESTS
WE CAN ONLY JUDGE ON THE
BASIS OF PERFORMANCE
YOU MAY HAVE HIDDEN
TALENT IN YOU SIR
BUT IF YOU DONT PERFORM
IT WE DONT KNOW
THATS TRUE TRUE
AND THE WORLD WILL RECOGNIZE
YOU ONLY BY YOUR PERFORMANCE
THATS TRUE THATS TRUE
BUT IF YOU WANT YOUR DAUGHTER
TO BE BASICALLY A
WELLADJUSTED
ULTIMATELY ILL USE
THE WORD HAPPINESS
IN A VERY BROAD SENSE AND
I KNOW THAT HAPPINESS
IS NOT THE ULTIMATE THING IN
LIFE BUT ITS IMPORTANT
YOU CANNOT IMPOSE
PRECONCEIVED VALUES AND DREAMS
ON AN INDIVIDUAL
INCLUDING A CHILD
YOU CANNOT DO THAT
BUT AGAIN I WANT
YOU TO UNDERSTAND
THAT PART OF YOUR JOB
IS TO DEAL WITH RHONA
AS A SYMPATHETIC AND
UNDERSTANDING FATHER
BUT RECOGNIZING HER LIMITATIONS
AND THE FACT THAT SHE IS A
PERSON IN HER OWN RIGHT
AND THAT IF YOU IMPOSE TOO
MUCH YOUR DESIRES ON HER
EVEN WITHOUT PUSHING
THEM OR FORCING HER
SHE MAY REACT IN A WAY WHICH
MAY BE DAMAGING TO HER TOO
MICHAEL THIS HAS TO
DO WITH YOUR CUTTING
WHAT IS IT PHYSICAL SCIENCE
NO SIR I NEVER CUT IT
MRS GANIN WAS YELLING
AT ME AFTER CLASS
AND SHE STARTS GOING OFF
AND YOU SEE SOMEHOW I WAS
MAKING NOISE IN THE LUNCH LINE
AND THE TRUTH IS MR ALLEN
I WAS BEHAVING IN THE
BACK OF THE ROOM
I DIDNT OPEN MY MOUTH BECAUSE
SEE THE OTHER KIDS WERE
AND I DIDNT FEEL
LIKE GOOFING OFF
AND SHE THOUGHT IT WAS ME
AND SHE CALLS ME UP AND
SHE STARTS YELLING AT ME
AND I SAY IT WASNT ME
AND SHE STARTS YELLING YELLING
SO I FIGURE MR ALLEN
COULD YOU STAND THERE AND
LISTEN TO A LADY YELL
SO I FIGURE ID GO OUT
AND TALK TO HER LATER
WHEN SHE IS CALMED DOWN
AND SHE WAS PRETTY WORKED UP
AND I WENT TO WALK OUT AND
SHE GOES YOU DONT LEAVE
AND I GO ILL SPEAK TO YOU
LATER AT A BETTER TIME
AND I WALKED OUT BECAUSE
FIRST OF ALL MICHAEL YOU
SHOWED POOR JUDGMENT
WHEN YOU ARE BEING ADDRESSED
BY SOMEONE OLDER THAN YOU
OR IN A SEAT OF AUTHORITY
ITS YOUR JOB TO
RESPECT AND LISTEN
SHE DIDNT ASK YOU
TO JUMP FROM THE EMPIRE
STATE BUILDING
SHES NOT ASKING YOU
FOR YOUR BLOOD
SHES ASKING FOR A
LITTLE BIT OF TIME
TO HELP YOU OUT
NOW HERES THE THING
WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE
IS SHOWED SOME
CHARACTER BY SAYING
OKAY I WILL GO
TO YOUR DETENTION
BUT MAY I SPEAK WITH YOU
AND GET THIS MATTER CORRECTED
SHE DIDNT ASSIGN ME DETENTION
WELL ACCORDING TO THIS
GIVEN THE CHOICE OF A
DETENTION AT 730 OR AT 145
AND YOU REFUSED TO TAKE EITHER
NOW WHAT IS THAT
THEY SENT ME DOWN TO MR WALSH
AND I TRIED TO EXPLAIN IT TO HIM
AND HE STARTED
YELLING AT ME TOO
WELL NO ONE IS GOING
TO YELL AT YOU AND
WELL I DONT FEEL
I HAVE TO TAKE
ANYBODY SCREAMING
AT ME FOR NOTHING
NO NO THERES A POINT TO THAT
BUT IN THE MEANTIME
ITS TIME YOU SHOWED A LITTLE
CHARACTER ON YOUR OWN RIGHT
YES SIR
I WOULD TAKE THE DETENTION
AND THEN YOU CAN
COME BACK AND SAY
NOW I TOOK THE DETENTION
MAY I SPEAK WITH YOU
I CANT SPEAK TO THAT MAN
WELL YOU CAN TRY
DO YOU KNOW
ANOTHER TIME IN THAT CLASS
THIS IS ANOTHER REASON WHY
SIT DOWN
THIS IS ANOTHER REASON
WHY I WONT TAKE IT
WHY
I WAS GIVEN A THESE
KIDS TOOK A BOOK
AND THEY WERE GOING TO
THROW IT AT ME RIGHT
AND THE TEACHER CAUGHT HIM
WITH THE BOOK IN HIS HAND
AND HE TOOK IT OFF THE
OTHER KIDS BOOK
AND THE OTHER KID
STOOD UP AND SAID
GIVE ME MY DAMN BOOK BACK
SO MRS GANIN SAYS
YOU TWO GET OUT
YOU KNOW I DONT WANT
LANGUAGE AROUND HERE
AND NO USE TO GET UP FOR IT
DO YOU KNOW THEY BROUGHT ME
INTO THE DETENTION ROOM
THEY BROUGHT ME INTO MR
WALSHS ROOM
AND THEY GOT ME DRAGGED
IN FOR NOTHING
AND I TRIED TO EXPLAIN
IT TO HIM AND HE SAID
WILL YOU TAKE THE DETENTION
WHICH WAS UTTERLY RIDICULOUS
SEE WERE OUT TO ESTABLISH
SOMETHING ARENT WE
YES
WERE OUT TO ESTABLISH
THAT YOU CAN BE A MAN
AND YOU CAN TAKE ORDERS
WE WANT TO PROVE TO THEM THAT
YOU CAN TAKE THE ORDERS
BUT MR ALLEN SEE ITS
ALL AGAINST MY PRINCIPLES
YOU HAVE TO STAND FOR SOMETHING
YES BUT I THINK YOUR PRINCIPLES
ARENT INVOLVED HERE
I THINK ITS A QUESTION NOW
OF PROVING YOURSELF TO BE A MAN
ITS A QUESTION HERE OF HOW
HOW DO WE FOLLOW RULES
AND REGULATIONS
IF THERES A MISTAKE MADE
THERES AN APPROACH TO IT
I THINK YOU DONT
FIGHT WITH A TEACHER
I THINK YOU ASK
PERMISSION TO TALK
AND ASK THEM TO LISTEN TO YOU
NOW THIS ISNT
WHAT YOU DIDNT DO
NOW IF YOU HAD TAKEN
YOUR DETENTION
AND AFTER ALL THEY DIDNT
REQUIRE MUCH FROM YOU
THE TEACHER FELT YOU
WERE OUT OF ORDER
AND IN HER JUDGMENT YOU
DESERVED A DETENTION
I DONT SEE ANYTHING WRONG
WITH ASSIGNING YOU A DETENTION
AND I THINK YOU SHOULD
PROVE YOURSELF
YOU SHOULD SHOW
THAT YOU CAN TAKE
THE DETENTION WHEN GIVEN IT
I SHOULD PROVE THAT I AM A MAN
AND THATS WHAT I INTEND TO
DO BY DOING WHAT I FEEL
IN MY OPINION IS WHAT I
IS DOING WHAT IS RIGHT
ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE YOUR
DETENTION OR ARENT YOU
I FEEL THAT YOU SHOULD
ILL TAKE IT BUT UNDER PROTEST
ALL RIGHT THEN YOU
TAKE IT UNDER PROTEST
THATS GOOD
YES ID LIKE YOU
TO TAKE IT TODAY
WILL TODAY AFTER SCHOOL BE OKAY
ALL RIGHT WHAT ROOM ROOM 120
118

AND WHEN THE DUST HAD LIFTED
THE MEN SAW WHAT HAD OCCURRED
THERE WAS JIMMY SAFE AT SECOND
AND FLYNN AHUGGING THIRD
AND FROM 5000 THROATS AND MORE
THERE ROSE THERE A LUSTY YELL
IT RUMBLED THROUGH THE VALLEY
IT RATTLED IN THE DELL
IT POUNDED ON THE MOUNTAIN
AND RECOILED UPON THE FLAT
FOR CASEY MIGHTY CASEY
WAS ADVANCING TO THE BAT
THERE WAS EASE IN CASEYS MANNER
AS HE STEPPED INTO HIS PLACE
THERE WAS PRIDE
IN CASEYS BEARING AND A
SMILE ON CASEYS FACE
AND WHEN RESPONDING
TO THE CHEERS
HE LIGHTLY DOFFED HIS HAT
NO STRANGER IN THE
CROWD COULD DOUBT
TWAS CASEY AT THE BAT
10000 EYES WERE ON HIM
AS HE RUBBED HIS
HANDS WITH DIRT
5000 TONGUES APPLAUDED
WHEN HE WIPED THEM ON HIS SHIRT
THEN WHILE THE WRITHING PITCHER
GROUND THE BALL INTO HIS HIP
DEFIANCE FLASHED IN CASEYS EYE
A SNEER CURLED CASEYS LIP
AND NOW THE
LEATHERCOVERED SPHERE
CAME HURTLING THROUGH THE AIR
AND CASEY STOOD AWATCHING IT
IN HAUGHTY GRANDEUR THERE
CLOSE BY THE STURDY BATSMAN
THE BALL UNHEEDED SPED
THAT AINT MY
STYLE SAID CASEY
STRIKE ONE THE UMPIRE SAID
FROM THE BENCHES
BLACK WITH PEOPLE
THERE WENT UP A MUFFLED ROAR
LIKE THE BEATING
OF THE STORM WAVES
ON A STERN AND DISTANT SHORE
KILL HIM KILL THE UMPIRE
SHOUTED SOMEONE ON THE STAND
AND ITS LIKELY THEYD
HAVE KILLED HIM
HAD NOT CASEY RAISED HIS HAND
WITH A SMILE OF
CHRISTIAN CHARITY
GREAT CASEYS VISAGE SHONE
HE STILLED THE RISING TUMULT
HE BADE THE GAME GO ON
HE SIGNALED TO THE
PITCHER AND ONCE MORE
THE DUN SPHERE FLEW BUT
CASEY STILL IGNORED IT
AND THE UMPIRE SAID
STRIKE TWO
FRAUD CRIED THE
MADDENED THOUSANDS
AN ECHO ANSWERED FRAUD
BUT ONE SCORNFUL LOOK FROM CASEY
AND THE AUDIENCE WAS AWED
THEY SAW HIS FACE
GROW STERN AND COLD
THEY SAW HIS MUSCLES STRAIN
AND THEY KNEW THAT CASEY
WOULDNT LET THAT
BALL GO BY AGAIN
THE SNEER HAS FLED
FROM CASEYS LIP
HIS TEETH ARE CLENCHED IN HATE
HE POUNDS WITH CRUEL VIOLENCE
HIS BAT UPON THE PLATE
AND NOW THE PITCHER
HOLDS THE BALL
AND NOW HE LETS IT GO
AND NOW THE AIR IS SHATTERED
BY THE FORCE OF CASEYS BLOW
OH SOMEWHERE IN
THIS LAND OF OURS
THE SUN IS SHINING BRIGHT
THE BAND IS PLAYING SOMEWHERE
AND SOMEWHERE HEARTS ARE LIGHT
AND SOMEWHERE MEN ARE LAUGHING
AND LITTLE CHILDREN SHOUT
BUT THERE IS NO JOY
IN MUDVILLE
GREAT CASEY HAS STRUCK OUT
Teacher WHATS THE PROBLEM

ALL RIGHT AND LETS

AND I THINK THAT THIS YOUNG
LADY HAS DONE A LOVELY JOB
OF REALLY PUTTING SOME STYLE
INTO THIS PARTICULAR GARMENT
LETS SEE HOW SHE LOOKS
SHES DONE A NICE JOB
AND THIS IS A SAMPLE
GIRLS OF WHAT YOU CAN DO
THIS GAL SHES GOT
A WEIGHT PROBLEM
SHE KNOWS IT
SHES DONE EVERYTHING
SHE CAN TO CUT IT DOWN
I MEAN SHE DESIGNED THIS
GARMENT HERSELF WITH THE IDEA
OF MAKING IT GRACIOUS
AND GRACEFUL
AND SHE HANDLES IT WELL
SHE HANDLES HERSELF
BEAUTIFULLY YOU SEE THIS
OKAY AND THATS WHAT YOU CAN
DO WITH FASHION AND DESIGN
BUT THESE ARE THE
IMPORTANT THINGS GIRLS
TO WALK WITH YOUR
SHOULDERS HIGH AND PROUD
AND THIS IS ALL THE TIME
AROUND NORTHEAST HIGH SCHOOL
THIS IS THE FAVORITE WALK
AND YOUVE JUST GOT TO DO
SOMETHING TO CONQUER IT
YOU REALLY MUST
HANDLE YOURSELF BEAUTIFULLY
WHEN YOU STOP FOR APPLAUSE
AS HERE FOR A TURN

WAY THEY GO HERE
YOU COME ALONG SEE
NOW YOURE NOT HERE TO
SHOW YOUR DERRIERE
THEREFORE IF YOU ARE
SHOWING YOUR BACKSIDE
ON THE STAGE AT ALL
ITS MERELY A QUICK TURN
IN THIS FASHION AND MISS FISHER
DID IT A KIND OF SWING TURN
ALL RIGHT AND WATCH THESE FEET
DONT EVER END UP WITH
YOUR FEET LIKE THIS
IF YOU WANT TO TEST THIS GIRLS
IF YOU WANT TO TEST THIS
LOOK DOWN A LONG CORRIDOR
RIGHT ACROSS HERE SOMETIMES
FROM ONE END TO ANOTHER
AND WATCH THE KIDS
COME UP THE HALL
AND THIS IS THE WAY THEY
COME ALL YOU GIRLS
YOU SEE
WHEREAS IF YOU GET YOUR
FEET YOU GET YOUR WEIGHT
RIGHT STRAIGHT OVER
YOUR FEET AND WALK
ONE ALMOST IN FRONT
OF THE OTHER
YOURE DOING SOMETHING
FOR YOURSELF OKAY
COURSE I STILL LOOK
LIKE A FAT LADY
BUT THE POINT IS THAT YOU
LOOK MUCH MORE GRACEFUL
MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL
IF YOU DONT DO THIS
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS
ANY QUESTIONS
EVERYONE READY
ANYONE NOT READY
BEGIN
 STUDENTS TYPING 
STOP TYPING PLEASE
ALL RIGHT AS I READ THE
PARAGRAPH FROM THE BOOK
LETS FOLLOW ON
WHAT WEVE TYPED
THE TWO MEN WENT DOWN WITH ME
DOWN THE LONG ROAD
COMMA SPACE
AND IN NO TIME AT ALL
WE HAD REACHED THE LAKE
AND FOUND THAT PATH
UP TO THE SPRING
PERIOD DOUBLE SPACE
CAPITAL W WE
HAD MADE THE HIKE
IN LESS THAN TWO HOURS
SEMICOLON SPACE
THE DAY WAS FINE FOR
IT COMMA SPACE
MILD AND COOL COMMA SPACE
AND THE THREE OF US FELT FINE
PERIOD NEW PARAGRAPH
INDENT FIVE
CAPITAL W
WE HAD A SNACK AT THE SPRING
AND THEN PICKED UP OUR GUNS
AND WENT ON DOWN THE PATH
PERIOD DOUBLE SPACE CAPITAL W
WE LOOKED HIGH AND LOW
FOR SIGNS OF GAME
COMMA SPACE
BUT THE BIRDS HAD SEEN
US AND SCREAMED AT US
ALL THE WHILE COMMA SPACE
SO THAT WHAT GAME THERE MIGHT
HAVE BEEN NEAR THE LAKE
HID FROM US OR TOOK
TO ITS HEELS
PERIOD DOUBLE SPACE
WE CALLED IT A DAY AND
TURNED BACK HOME
PERIOD DOUBLE SPACE CAPITAL W
WE HAD NOT FIRED ONE SHOT
NOW THERE ARE VARIOUS
TYPES OF FAMILIES
WE HAVE THE FAMILY
FOR INSTANCE
IN WHICH THE DOMINANT
INDIVIDUAL IS THE MOTHER
NOW THIS IS A NATURAL
SORT OF THING
YOU CAN SEE IN MANY
OF THE NATURAL UH
HABITS OF LETS SAY
THE LOWER ANIMALS
THE MOTHER IS DESIGNED
WITH AN EYE FIRST OF ALL OF
TAKING CARE OF THE YOUNGSTER
BEFORE ITS ABLE TO
FUNCTION ON THE OUTSIDE
AND AFTER THE CHILD OR
THE OFFSPRING IS BORN
SHE TAKES CARE OF IT
NOW IN SOME CASES BIRDS
SOME OF THE ANIMALS
MATE FOR LIFE
BUT FREQUENTLY ITS A
SORT OF SEASONAL THING
THE FATHER IS FINISHED
HIS OBLIGATIONS
MAYBE AFTER HE
PROTECTS THE FEMALE
AND THEY MAY NEVER
SEE EACH OTHER
THEY DONT TALK MUCH ABOUT
WOMEN IN THE BIBLE
IN THE OLD TESTAMENT
MOSES WAS THE BIG SHOT
AND THE VARIOUS OTHER PEOPLE
THAT IM NOT TOO WELL
ACQUAINTED WITH
ONCE IN A WHILE A WOMAN
GETS IN JUST BY ACCIDENT
NOW THATS NOT TRUE IN
THE MODERN JEWISH FAMILY
YOU KNOW WHO RUNS YOUR
HOUSEHOLD PRETTY WELL
YOUR MOTHER COLLECTS THE MONEY
SHE TAKES CARE OF THE BILLS
PAYS THEM SHE
DOES THE SHOPPING
SHE HANDLES ALL THE SORT OF
ECONOMICAL SORT OF THINGS
ONCE IN A WHILE SHES
NICE AND ASKS YOUR FATHER
IF HE WOULD LIKE TO LOOK AT A
NEW CAR THEYRE GOING TO BUY
OR IF SHES IN
DIFFICULTY WITH YOU
SHELL HAVE YOUR
FATHER SPEAK TO YOU
BUT ORDINARILY IT
TENDS TO BE THAT WAY
IN A GREAT MANY OF OUR FAMILIES
SO THAT WE GO BACK TO
THAT MATRIARCHAL SYSTEM
SHE SAYS WHY IF A MAN
AND A WOMAN LIVE TOGETHER
DOES SOCIETY THEN SAY
YOURE MARRIED
I THINK THATS GREAT BECAUSE
SOCIETY DOES HAVE A WAY
TO TAKE CARE OF REGULAR
RESPONSIBLE STABLE UNIONS
I THINK PROMISCUITY
IS WHAT ANY SOCIETY
CANNOT TOLERATE
THATS A GOOD POINT
WHY DO YOU HAVE YOUR
MENSTRUATION PERIOD
YOU KNOW THERES NOT AN
AWFULLY GOOD REASON FOR IT
ONE OF THE INVENTORS OF
THE BIRTH CONTROL PILL
UP IN BOSTON A VERY
EMINENT GYNECOLOGIST
HAS SAID THAT HE DOESNT
HE CANT THINK OF ANY
GOOD REASON WHY WOMEN
HAVE TO CONTINUE TO MENSTRUATE
IF THEY DONT WANT TO
THAT WITH THE USE OF THE PILL
WHICH REALLY REGULATES
YOUR CYCLE
THIS IS WHAT THE PILL DOES
YOU TAKE IT FOR SAY 20 DAYS
AND THEN YOU DONT TAKE
IT FOR A FEW DAYS
YOU TAKE IT YOU SEE
ACCORDING TO DOCTORS ORDERS
YOU DONT JUST POP THESE
THINGS IN YOUR MOUTH
AN HOUR BEFORE A DATE
ITS A MEDICINE
 LAUGHTER 
ITS A MEDICINE THAT YOU TAKE
ACCORDING TO A PRESCRIPTION YOU
MUST OBTAIN FROM A DOCTOR
AND YOU TAKE THEM JUST AS
YOU DO ANY OTHER MEDICINE
REGULARLY AND CONTINUOUSLY
YOU HAVE HAD PRACTICE
IN CONTROLLING YOUR
FEELINGS AND IMPULSES
EVER SINCE YOUVE BEEN A BABY
BY THE TIME YOU GET TO
BE A HIGHSCHOOL SENIOR
YOU DONT EAT ALL THE
CHOCOLATE CAKE YOU WANT TO
BECAUSE YOU DONT
WANT TO GET FAT
YOU DO YOUR HOMEWORK WHETHER
YOU WANT TO OR NOT
YOU TAKE YOUR COLLEGE BOARDS
EVEN IF YOU DONT FEEL
LIKE IT THAT DAY
YOU DONT WALK INTO STRAWBRIDGES
AND STEAL DRESSES OFF THE RACK
 LAUGHTER 
THERE IS NO BETTER ANSWER
YOU HAVE LEARNED BY NOW
AS PART OF BEING HUMAN
THAT YOU CANT HAVE WHAT
YOU WANT WHEN YOU WANT IT
THE GIRLS WHO HAVENT LEARNED
THAT AND THE BOYS
ARE IMPULSIVE AND
THEY NEVER CONNECT
WHAT THEY ARE DOING TODAY
WITH WHAT HAPPENS TOMORROW
NOW IF THIS BECOMES STYLE
FIVE YEARS FROM NOW
THATS SOMETHING ELSE
BUT RIGHT NOW FOR FORMAL
WEAR IT IS NOT STYLE
ITS STYLE FOR A VERY SMALL
PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE
AND WERE GOING TO DO IN THIS
SCHOOL WHAT THE MAJORITY WANTS
UNTIL THIS KIND OF RULE CHANGES
THIS IS WHAT WERE GOING TO DO
THE MAJORITY WANTS
A FORMAL AFFAIR
WHICH MEANS A LONG GOWN OR
A COCKTAILLENGTH GOWN
Boy THE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS
THATS RIGHT
Girl EXCUSE ME WHATS
THE COCKTAIL LENGTH
Counselor KNEE LENGTH
Girl HERE
Woman THE KNEE IS
NOT ABOVE THE KNEE
Girl THIS IS MY KNEE
Woman NO IT ISNT
IF YOU FELL ON THAT
PART OF YOUR ANATOMY
YOU WOULD NOT INJURE
YOUR UPPER THIGH
Counselor WOULDNT
TEAR THE DRESS ANYWAY
 WOMAN LAUGHS 
Counselor NO I THINK THAT ITS
NICE TO BE INDIVIDUALISTIC
BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN PLACES
TO BE INDIVIDUALISTIC
Girl I DIDNT MEAN TO
BE INDIVIDUALISTIC
Counselor NO IM
NOT CRITICIZING
I SAY ITS NICE TO BE THAT WAY
BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN
TIMES TO BE THAT WAY
UH I THINK YOU CAN BE
INDIVIDUALISTIC IN YOUR DRESS
BUT IT DOESNT HAVE TO BE
Girl I HAPPEN TO
ENJOY A SHORT GOWN
I DIDNT KNOW IT WOULDNT
BE ACCEPTED TO THE PROM
I DIDNT DO IT PURPOSELY
THIS IS WHAT I ENJOY
Counselor WHAT
DOES FORMAL MEAN
Girl WELL FORMAL MEANS DRESSY
I DIDNT THINK OF IT AS A GOWN
Counselor OH
Woman FORMAL MEANS
MORE THAN DRESSY
Counselor WHEN YOU
GET AN INVITATION
TO A FORMAL AFFAIR
IT SAYS WHITE TIE
OR BLACK TIE
IT DOESNT SAY THAT THE
GIRLS OR WOMEN WEAR
ANY LENGTH THEY WANT
IT MEANS A FLOORLENGTH GOWN
YOU GET AN INVITATION
TO A COCKTAIL PARTY
IT DOESNT MEAN A
FLOORLENGTH GOWN
IT MEANS A KNEELENGTH
GOWN OR A FLOORLENGTH
BUT FORMAL MEANS A LONG
GOWN FOR A YOUNG LADY
A MIDDLEAGED LADY
ELDERLY LADY
SEE WHAT I MEAN AND FOR
A MAN IT MEANS A TUX
AND ITS DETERMINED
BY THE TIME OF DAY
WHETHER ITS WHITE
TIE OR BLACK TIE
THERE ARE NO QUESTIONS
I DIDNT KNOW ANY OTHER
REALLY WHOLE STORY
I DIDNT KNOW THAT THEY
WERENT PERMITTED
THIS IS WHAT I
FELT LIKE WEARING
Counselor IT DOESNT MATTER
IF ITS NOT PERMITTED
ITS A MATTER
OF WHAT YOURE GOING TO DO
IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS
THIS IS OFFENSIVE
TO THE WHOLE CLASS
Girl I DIDNT REALLY
MEAN IT TO BE
Counselor I KNOW YOU PROBABLY
DIDNT MEAN IT TO BE THIS
BUT THIS IS WHAT IT IS
Woman WE BOUGHT AN ATMOSPHERE
BY RENTING THE SHERATON
BALLROOM WHICH IS VERY FORMAL
Counselor WE COULD HAVE
HAD THE DANCE IN THE GYM
Woman WE COULD HAVE
HAD THAT IN THE GYM
AND THEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT
Counselor MAYBE A COUPLE OF
GOGO GIRLS UP ON THE STAGE
WITH A 50 ORCHESTRA
AND WE WOULD HAVE
HAD A NICE DANCE
BUT THIS IS NOT JUST A DANCE
THIS IS THE SENIOR PROM
THIS IS FORMAL
ITS THE ONE TIME IN YOUR LIFE
THAT YOUR CLASS
LOOKS SO DIFFERENT
YOU DONT RECOGNIZE ANYBODY
ITS THE FIRST CHANCE YOU HAVE
TO BE YOUNG LADIES
AND YOUNG GENTLEMEN
Woman I HAD A BOY ASK AND I
HAD A GIRL COME UP AND SAY
CAN MY BOYFRIEND WEAR
A DARK SUIT BECAUSE
HE CANNOT AFFORD THE MONEY
FOR THE RENTAL OF A TUX
I SAID NO HE CANT
BECAUSE THEN MY HUSBAND
HAS A RIGHT TO WEAR
THE BEAUTIFUL SUIT
HE JUST BOUGHT
BUT WE HAVE TO PAY WHAT IS
IT 10 OR 15 TO RENT A TUX
NOW MY HUSBAND HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE SCHOOL
BUT HES HONORING THE YOUNGSTERS
BY COMING DRESSED PROPERLY
Counselor AND I WOULDNT THINK
OF COMING WITHOUT WEARING A TUX
I RENT ONE EVERY YEAR
Woman I HAVE TO WEAR A
LONG GOWN ID LOVE TO
AND I CANT WALK IN IT
I CANT GET INTO THE
CAR COMFORTABLY
Woman 5 6 7 8 9

THE DARK FELLOW
HERE IS PAUL SIMON
AND THE BLOND IS ART GARFUNKEL
THE POET IS SIMON
AND IF YOU DOUBT THAT
HES A POET NOW
WAIT UNTIL YOU HEAR
SOME OF HIS POETRY
AND YOULL NOTICE ON THE
BOARD I HAVE SOME THINGS
THAT YOURE FAMILIAR
WITH IMAGES SETTING
FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE
THEMATIC WORDS
AND WELL BE FINDING HOW
HE SAYS WHAT HE DOES SAY
WHAT DO THEY WANT TO SAY
ABOUT OUR LIVES AND HOW
AND I THINK THE BEST WAY
TO START IS BY LOOKING
AT ONE OF THE BEST OF THE POEMS
THE DANGLING CONVERSATION
THATS THE FIRST
ONE ON YOUR SHEET
THE PROCESS WELL USE
FIRST WELL READ THE POEM
THEN LISTEN TO IT THEN
WELL TALK ABOUT IT
AND SEE HOW ALL THE
VARIOUS POETIC DEVICES
REINFORCE THE THEME AND SEE
WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT IT
AND THEN WELL LISTEN
TO IT ONCE AGAIN
AND ILL BET IT MEANS SOMETHING
A LITTLE BIT MORE TO YOU
ITS A STILLLIFE WATERCOLOR
OF THE NOWLATE AFTERNOON
AS THE SUN SHINES
THROUGH THE CURTAIN LACE
AND SHADOWS WASH THE ROOM
AND WE SIT AND
DRINK OUR COFFEE
COUCHED IN OUR INDIFFERENCE
LIKE SHELLS UPON THE SHORE
YOU CAN HEAR THE OCEAN ROAR
IN THE DANGLING CONVERSATION
AND THE SUPERFICIAL SIGHS
THE BORDERS OF OUR LIVES
AND YOU READ YOUR
EMILY DICKINSON
AND I MY ROBERT FROST
AND WE NOTE OUR PLACE
WITH BOOKMARKERS
AND MEASURE WHAT WE LOST
LIKE A POEM POORLY WRITTEN
WE ARE VERSES OUT OF RHYTHM
COUPLETS OUT OF RHYME
IN SYNCOPATED TIME
AND THE DANGLING CONVERSATION
AND THE SUPERFICIAL SIGHS
ARE THE BORDERS OF OUR LIVES
YES WE SPEAK THE
THINGS THAT MATTER
WITH WORDS THAT MUST BE SAID
CAN ANALYSIS BE WORTHWHILE
IS THE THEATER REALLY DEAD
AND HOW THE ROOM
IS SOFTLY FADED
AS I ONLY KISS YOUR SHADOW
I CANNOT FEEL YOUR HAND
YOURE A STRANGER
NOW UNTO ME LOST
IN THE DANGLING CONVERSATION
AND THE SUPERFICIAL SIGHS
THE BORDERS OF OUR LIVES
LETS LISTEN TO IT
AND NOTICE HOW NOT
ONLY THE DEVICES
REINFORCE THE THEME
BUT ALSO THE VERY
RHYTHMS THE MELODIES
AND HOW THEY USED THEIR TIMING
NOW WHEN I TAPED THESE
THEY WERE FROM A MONAURAL
AND STEREO RECORDS
THE TAPE IS A LITTLE FAST
ITS THE DRAMA CLUB
TAPE RECORDER
SO YOULL HAVE TO BE A LITTLE
PATIENT AT THE VERY BEGINNING
 SONG BEGINS 
ITS A STILLLIFE WATERCOLOR
OF A NOWLATE AFTERNOON
AS THE SUN SHINES THROUGH
THE CURTAIN LACE
AND SHADOWS WASH THE ROOM
AND WE SIT AND
DRINK OUR COFFEE
COUCHED IN OUR INDIFFERENCE
LIKE SHELLS UPON THE SHORE
YOU CAN HEAR THE OCEAN ROAR
IN THE DANGLING CONVERSATION
AND THE SUPERFICIAL SIGHS
THE BORDERS OF OUR LIVES
AND YOU READ YOUR
EMILY DICKINSON
AND I MY ROBERT FROST
AND WE NOTE OUR PLACE
WITH BOOKMARKERS
THAT MEASURE WHAT WEVE LOST
LIKE A POEM POORLY WRITTEN
WE ARE VERSES OUT OF RHYTHM
COUPLETS OUT OF RHYME
IN SYNCOPATED TIME
AND THE DANGLING
CONVERSATION
AND THE SUPERFICIAL SIGHS
ARE THE BORDERS OF OUR LIVES
YES WE SPEAK OF
THINGS THAT MATTER
WITH WORDS THAT MUST BE SAID
CAN ANALYSIS BE WORTHWHILE
IS THE THEATER REALLY DEAD
AND HOW THE ROOM IS
SOFTLY FADED

SINCERENESS BEHIND IT
Female dean AND HOW ABOUT
THE POOR POOR TEACHER
WHOEVER IT WAS
I DONT KNOW
Girl I DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT
SHE SAID THAT WE DID BUT
Dean ITS A MATTER OF
BEING INHUMAN TO
ANOTHER HUMAN BEING
THATS WHAT IT AMOUNTS TO
Girl BUT ALL I KNOW
IS THAT SHE GOT SUE
IN A LOT OF TROUBLE AND
Dean SUE WHO
Girl THE OTHER GIRL
AND SUE DIDNT I DONT
THINK SUE HAD ANY
SHE TOLD SHE SAID THAT WE
LOCKED HER IN THE CLOSET
Dean YOU MEAN SUE AND YOU
Girl I MEAN THE CLASS
NOBODY LOCKED HER IN THE
CLOSET AS FAR AS I KNOW
LOOK IF SHE WOULDVE BEEN
LOCKED IN THE CLOSET
I SURE WOULD HAVE HEARD THAT
AND TURNED AROUND AND LOOKED
Dean SHE MAY HAVE HAD A
LITTLE MORE CONTROL THAN THAT
THAT MUCH NOISE ITS A
LITTLE EMBARRASSING TO HER
SHE WASNT GOING TO CALL
EVERYBODYS ATTENTION TO IT
Girl IT WASNT FAIR
SUE WAS JUST MESSING AROUND
JUST AS MUCH AS US
THE REST OF THE CLASS
AND NOW SUES IN
SO MUCH TROUBLE
JUST BECAUSE OF
THAT ONE TEACHER
AND BECAUSE SUE GOT IN TROUBLE
I BLAME IT A LOT ON THE TEACHER
CAUSE
Dean WELL LETS KEEP LOOKING
AT THAT BECAUSE AGAIN
THIS IS MY CONCERN EILEEN
SUE GOT IN TROUBLE
BECAUSE OF THE TEACHER
SUE DID NOTHING TO HELP
WHOEVER SUE IS I DONT KNOW
IM GLAD YOU DIDNT ANSWER
WHEN I ASKED YOU HER NAME
BECAUSE ITS EASIER TO TALK
Eileen SHE JUST MESSED
AROUND LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE
Woman LOOK CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT MESSING AROUND MEANS
THIS IS WHAT IVE BEEN TRYING
TO FIND OUT FOR MONTHS
EVERY TIME YOU WOULD
SAY MESSING AROUND
WHAT DOES IT
ACTUALLY CONSIST OF
Eileen I DONT KNOW WE
WERE TALKING LAUGHING
WELL JUST PLAIN TALKING AND
LAUGHING ISNT OFFENSIVE
Eileen WELL WE WERE
CATCHING A BOOK OR SOMETHING
OH YOU THREW A BOOK AROUND
Eileen NOT JUST ME
BUT WHOEVER WAS INVOLVED
Eileen I KNOW I DID A LOT
LIKE I DID A LOT I
TALKED BACK A LOT
DID YOU TALK BACK
TO THE TEACHER
Eileen YEAH
AND THIS IS WHAT YOU
CALL MESSING AROUND
Eileen NO WELL
ISNT THAT MORE DISRESPECT
Eileen WHAT I DID WAS
DISRESPECT BUT WHAT THE REST
WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE DID
WAS MESSING AROUND
I DONT I DONT KNOW
Dean YOU SEE WHAT
MOTHER IS SAYING
AT LEAST WHAT IM SAYING I
THINK WHAT MOTHER IS SAYING
IS THAT WE HOPE EILEEN
THAT YOU DONT SET
YOUR STANDARDS BY
THE SOCALLED EVERYBODY ELSE
THAT YOU SET YOUR STANDARDS
ON WHAT YOU KNOW IS
THE THING TO DO
I REPEAT THERES NO DOUBT
THE TEACHER WAS NOT
HOLDING THE CLASS
WAS NOT DOING THE JOB YOU
THINK SHE SHOULD HAVE DONE
FROM WHAT YOU SAY
ILL ACCEPT THAT
BUT WHO BREAKS THE CIRCLE
WHEN THINGS GO AROUND
AND AROUND AND AROUND
SOMEONE HAS TO BE MATURE ENOUGH
TO MOVE OUT OF THE CIRCLE AND
INTO THE STRAIGHT RIGHT
SOMEBODY HAS GOT TO
BREAK AWAY FROM IT
YOURE INTELLIGENT
YOURE MATURE
YOU HAVE THE BACKGROUND
YOU CAN BE THE ONE
THAT CAN DO IT
WHY DONT YOU OFFER THE POSITIVE
KIND OF LEADERSHIP THAT YOU CAN
THAT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE AND
THAT I KNOW YOU HAVE
THAT MOTHER KNOWS YOU HAVE
YOU CAN BE A REAL FORCE
IN ANY GROUP EILEEN
CANT YOU
THE KIDS RALLY AROUND YOU A BIT
Eileen WELL NOT REALLY
IVE SEEN YOU IN THE LUNCHROOM
WEVE GOT US A POTENTIAL LEADER
Mother EILEEN CAN
Dean IT SHOWS WHEREVER SHE IS
IVE SEEN HER ONCE IN
A WHILE IN A GROUP
YOU CAN SEE WHO THE LEADER IS
IN A GROUP AND SHE HAS IT
EILEEN HAS A VERY SET MIND
AND IF SHE DECIDES THAT
SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE
THIS IS WHAT SHE PURSUES
THIS I KNOW ABOUT HER
Dean I THINK THATS GOOD
I THINK ITS EXCELLENT
IN MANY WAYS
BUT IVE OFTEN SAID TO HER
EILEEN USE YOUR
DETERMINATION FOR RIGHT
AND AS LONG AS YOU DO
YOULL BE ALL RIGHT
AND ONE THING THIS IS THE ONE
THING THAT BOTHERS ME SO MUCH
THE MAIN THING IN OUR
HOME HAS ALWAYS BEEN
RESPECT FOR AN ADULT
I WAS BROUGHT UP THAT
WAY MY HUSBAND WAS
AND WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO TEACH
OUR CHILDREN THE SAME THING
TO ME I THINK ONE
OF THE WORST OFFENSES
IS BEING DISRESPECTFUL
TO AN OLDER PERSON
IRREGARDLESS OF WHAT
THE CONDITION MAY BE
YOU CAN SAY THE SAME THING
IN A PLEASANT MANNER
THAT YOU CAN IN
AN OFFENSIVE WAY
AND THIS IS ONE THING
THATS DISTURBED ME
RECENTLY ABOUT EILEEN
THAT EVEN AT HOME NOW SHE
I DONT SAY THE LANGUAGE
THAT SHE USES IS WRONG
BUT ITS THE MANNER
THAT THE SAME
THAT A SENTENCE
IS BROUGHT FORTH
AND I TOLD HER
EVENTUALLY EILEEN
THIS IS GOING TO
HURT YOU OUTSIDE
AND FINALLY IT HAS
AND I THINK YOU WOULD KIND
OF HAVE TO DECIDE ARLEEN
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT WHERE YOU
STOOD IN YOUR COLLEGE CLASS
WHETHER YOU WOULD RATHER
BE IN AN EASIER SCHOOL
AND TOWARD THE TOP OF THE CLASS
OR IN A HARDER SCHOOL
AND TOWARD THE
BOTTOM OF THE CLASS
I THINK I WOULD GAIN
MORE BY BEING LIKE
IN THE MIDDLE OR THE TOP THAN
BEING AT THE VERY BOTTOM
NOT BEING ABLE TO KEEP
UP WITH EVERYBODY ELSE
Counselor DO YOU WANT A
COLLEGE COURSE THEN DEAR
WHERE AT THE END OF FOUR
YEARS YOU WOULD BE FINISHED
WITH YOUR EDUCATION AND ABLE
TO GO OUT AND MAKE A LIVING
OR DO YOU WANT THE KIND OF
COURSE WHERE AT THE END
OF FOUR YEARS IT IS
LIKELY THAT YOU WOULD BE
GOING ON WITH YOUR EDUCATION
Arleen IM NOT SURE RIGHT NOW
I THINK I WANT TO GO TO
FOUR YEARS OF COLLEGE
AND MAYBE IF I
BECOME A TEACHER
STOP AND THEN I CAN
ALWAYS TAKE COURSES AGAIN
GO HIGHER GET A HIGHER DEGREE
OR I THINK UH A SOCIAL WORKER
OR PSYCHOLOGIST HAS
TO GO FIVE YEARS
Counselor OR SIX
YEARS OR SEVEN YEARS
IT WOULD DEPEND ON WHAT
YOU CHOSE AFTER THAT
I DONT THINK I WANT
TO GO MORE THAN
MAYBE FIVE OR SIX YEARS
OR MORE THAN FIVE
WELL I THINK YOUVE GIVEN ME
A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE IDEA
OF WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR
AND THEN I WOULD HAVE
TO ASK YOU SIR
THE HARD HARD
QUESTION OF HOW MUCH
COULD YOU CONTRIBUTE TO
YOUR DAUGHTERS EDUCATION
Father WELL UH
THATS A HARD QUESTION
TO SAY BECAUSE UH IF SHE
LIVES AWAY FROM HOME
THEN ITS A DIFFERENT
STORY ALTOGETHER
AND IF SHE IS AT HOME
ITS ANOTHER STORY
BUT THE WAY SHES TALKING SHE
DOESNT WANT TO STAY HOME
SO I WOULD SAY ABOUT 1000
1500 IS ABOUT THE BEST
I COULD GIVE HER A YEAR
TO GO AWAY TO COLLEGE
MMHMM
THEN IT WOULD SEEM
TO ME THAT ARLEEN
THAT THE MOST REALISTIC
WAY TO PLAN IT WOULD BE
TO THINK ABOUT
WHERE YOU COULD GO
IF YOUR FATHER COULD GIVE
YOU 1000 TO 1500
AND THEN TO TRY FOR SCHOLARSHIP
IN SOME OTHER PLACES
THAT MIGHT BE SOMEWHAT
MORE EXPENSIVE
BUT I THINK YOU
KIND OF HAVE TO PLAN
FOR WHERE YOU WOULD GO
IF YOU DIDNT GET ANY
FINANCIAL AID FROM SOMEONE
I MEAN YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO
YOU LOOK AT THE BRIGHTER SIDE
ABOUT WHERE YOU
WOULD LIKE TO GO
YOU CAN HAVE ALL
YOUR DREAM SCHOOLS
BUT AT THE BOTTOM
YOU OUGHT TO HAVE SOME
COLLEGE OF LAST RESORT
WHERE YOU COULD BE SURE
THAT YOU WOULD GO
IF NONE OF YOUR
DREAMS CAME TRUE
RHONA IS THE RECIPIENT OF A
10000 HERO SCHOLARSHIP
TO ANY COLLEGE ANYWHERE IN
THE COUNTRY SHE WANTS TO GO
Father IM NOT SAYING
SHE IS COLLEGE MATERIAL
BUT AT LEAST SHE CAN HAVE SOME
TYPE OF EDUCATION FOLLOWING
SHE CAN GO TO ANY COLLEGE
AND DO WHATEVER SHE WANTED
TELL ME AGAIN
DO YOU THINK YOU WANT
TO GO TO COLLEGE
YES
Father PLEASE NOW
YOURE LYING TO THE MAN
YOU DONT WANT TO GO TO COLLEGE
WELL I DO BUT NOT
THE KIND OF COLLEGE
THAT YOU WANT ME TO
WHAT KIND OF COLLEGE
DO YOU WANT TO GO TO
I WANT TO BE A COSMETICIAN
COSMETICIAN BUT THATS
NOT A COLLEGE IS IT
WELL ITS A BEAUTY
CULTURE SCHOOL
ITS A BEAUTY CULTURE
SCHOOL ITS NOT A COLLEGE
THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THAT ARE
DIFFERENT THAN FOR COLLEGE
YES
YOU DONT HAVE ANY
FOREIGN LANGUAGE NO
YOU DONT HAVE ANY ALGEBRA
YOU DONT HAVE GEOMETRY
SO THAT ACTUALLY AS FAR
AS GOING TO COLLEGE
YOURE NOT EVEN
PREPARED FOR A COLLEGE
DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU ARE
DISAPPOINTING YOUR PARENTS
BY NOT GOING TO COLLEGE
NOW TELL ME THE TRUTH
YES
YOU FEEL YOUR PARENTS
ARE DISAPPOINTED
MY FATHER
YOUR FATHER IS
TELL ME WOULD YOU FEEL BETTER
IF YOU KNEW YOUR FATHER
REALLY ACCEPTED THE FACT THAT
YOU DIDNT GO TO COLLEGE
YOU FEEL A BIT GUILTY FOR
NOT GOING TO COLLEGE
YES WHAT DO YOU SAY
WELL
THAT YOU ARE DISAPPOINTING
YOUR PARENTS
IM DISAPPOINTING MY FATHER
BUT I DONT THINK ID FEEL
GUILTY ABOUT NOT GOING
YOU DONT FEEL GUILTY AT ALL
NOT GUILTY ITS MY LIFE
ITS YOUR LIFE
I FEEL THAT WHAT I WANT TO BE
IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN
WHAT HE DESIRES ME TO BE
I SEE
BUT YOU KNOW YOUR PARENTS
ARE DISAPPOINTED
YOUR FATHER IN PARTICULAR YES
YOU CANT UNDO THE PAST
EVEN IF SOMEBODY
HAS MADE A MISTAKE
AND BEEN WRONG AND UNFAIR
YOU CANT UNDO THE PAST
THE ONLY THING YOU CAN
DO IS TRY TO DO BETTER
IN THE PRESENT SO THAT THE
FUTURE WILL BE BETTER
SO WHAT IM SUGGESTING TO
YOU WORK AS HARD AS YOU CAN
DO THE BEST YOU CAN
AND CONFER WITH MR
SCHUSTER ABOUT ABOUT THIS
AND LETS SEE WHAT HAPPENS AT
THE END OF THE SEMESTER OKAY
YOU GO BACK TO CLASS
NOW OR ARE YOU THROUGH
NO IM THROUGH
Father THANKS AGAIN DR
BOODISH

I LIKED IT
YOU LIKED IT GOOD OKAY
Man Intercom THERE IS A CAR
IN THE STUDENTS DRIVEWAY
BLOCKING THE EXIT
OF TWO OTHER CARS
BUT I DONT BELIEVE IN GIVING
GIVE THEM JOBS
BUT I DONT BELIEVE IN GIVING
LET THEM EARN IT
THERES TOO MUCH RELIEF
GOING ON THATS ALL
WE ARE TOO MUCH TO A POINT
WHERE THEY ARE
GIVING ALL THE TIME
YOURE ALL HUNG UP ON
THE PROTESTANT ETHIC
THERE ARE SO MANY
FACETS TO THIS
I DONT BELIEVE IN
WHAT BILL SAYS
I DONT BELIEVE 100
IN WHAT BILL SAYS ABOUT
GIVING THINGS AWAY
I NEVER THINK THAT ANYBODY
APPRECIATES ANYTHING
LOOK AT YOUR OWN CHILDREN
WHEN YOU GIVE THEM DO
THEY REALLY APPRECIATE IT
SOMETIMES IF THEY WORK FOR
IT A LITTLE BIT BILL
THEY APPRECIATE
THESE THINGS MORE
Man LOOK AT THIS MONEY
WE ARE GIVING AWAY TO
THE WORLD FOREIGN AID
THEYRE LAUGHING AT US
THEYRE CRAMMING IT
RIGHT DOWN YOUR THROAT
ACTUALLY THIS FOREIGN
AID BUSINESS
WERE REALLY GIVING
MONEY TO THE GUYS
WHO ARE BUYING FROM
THE RICH PEOPLE
AND FROM THE
MANUFACTURERS OVER HERE
THATS WHERE THE MONEYS GOING
ITS NOT JUST BEING
GIVEN TO THEM
BUT THE THING IS THERE IS
SO MUCH MONEY BEING WASTED
Girl WH SILVERS
Teacher YES WH SILVERS
NOW WHAT WAS HE TRYING TO
DO WHAT WAS HIS PURPOSE
YES AIDELE
Aidele HE WAS
TRYING TO ESTABLISH
AN EIGHTHOUR WORKING
DAY FOR LABORERS
Teacher YEAH WELL HE
WANTED HIGHER WAGES
HE WANTED AN EIGHTHOUR WORKDAY
BUT HE TRIED TO UNITE
THIS IS THE IMPORTANT
THING ABOUT THIS
HE TRIED TO UNITE ALL LABOR
UNIONS OF THE COUNTRY
INTO A FEDERATION MEMBERSHIP
WHAT ON THE HORIZON
OR WHAT EXISTED
THAT FORCED LABOR TO TURN
TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING
WHAT WAS THERE A LACK OF
Girl COMMUNICATIONS
Teacher YES COMMUNICATIONS
LACK OF SECURITY
CONCERN FOR THE JOB
THE IMPORTANT THING IS THIS
LETS GET TO THE BEGINNINGS
FIRST OF ALL THERE WAS
THE LACK OF SECURITY
SECOND OF ALL THERE WAS A
LACK OF COMMUNICATION
THE ATTITUDE OF THE EMPLOYEES
OR OF THE EMPLOYERS
TOWARDS THE EMPLOYEES
WITH REGARD TO
WORKING CONDITIONS
WITH REGARD TO
LIVING CONDITIONS
WITH REGARD TO WAGES
VERY LITTLE COMMUNICATION
Teacher ALL RIGHT
WE HAVE EVIDENTLY
A GREAT IMBALANCE IN
AMERICAN SOCIETY
WE HAVE ON THE ONE HAND WE
HAVE AN AFFLUENT SOCIETY
AND THATS ONE AMERICA
AND ON THE OTHER HAND
WE HAVE ANOTHER AMERICA
AND BY THE WAY
THATS THE NAME OF A GOOD
BOOK BY MICHAEL HARRINGTON
CALLED THE OTHER AMERICA
AND WHAT IS THIS OTHER AMERICA
ANOTHER AMERICA THAT IS NOT
AMERICA OF POVERTY AMERICA
THAT IS NOT SHARING
IN THE AFFLUENCE OF
AMERICAN SOCIETY
AND KING WAS THERE TO TRY TO
UPLIFT THIS OTHER AMERICA
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE
DEPARTMENT OF LABOR
SAYS SHOULD BE THE COMFORT
LEVEL OF A FAMILY OF FOUR
A MAN A WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN
WHAT THEY SHOULD EARN
TO BE COMFORTABLE
NOT MODERATELY
COMFORTABLE NOT AFFLUENT
BUT JUST MODERATELY
COMFORTABLE IN OUR SOCIETY
KNOW WHAT THE FIGURE IS ANY
IDEA WHAT THE FIGURE IS
CHRISTINE HOW MUCH
Christine 9000
YES A LITTLE OVER 9000
SO YOU CAN IMAGINE
DO YOU KNOW WHAT PERCENT
OF THE AMERICAN POPULATION
EARNS OVER 9000
ITS NOT THE MAJORITY
LETS DETERMINE SOME OF THE
ATTITUDES IN THIS CLASS
AND SEE HOW WE COME OUT
ALL RIGHT HOW MANY OF YOU
WOULD BE A MEMBER OF A CLUB
WHERE MINORITY MEMBERS
OF THE CLUB WERE NEGRO
HOW MANY WOULD ACCEPT
THAT SITUATION
YOU WOULD BE A
MEMBER OF THE CLUB

MEMBERS WERE NEGRO
ALL RIGHT
OKAY FINE PUT YOUR HANDS DOWN
HOW MANY WOULD NOT BE
A MEMBER OF THE CLUB
ALL RIGHT HOW MANY WOULD
BE A MEMBER OF A CLUB
WHERE HALF THE MEMBERS
WERE NEGRO MEMBERS AND THE
OTHER HALF WERE WHITE
ALL RIGHT PUT
YOUR HANDS DOWN
HOW MANY WOULD NOT BE A
MEMBER OF THAT CLUB

RIGHT OR WRONG ANSWER

Boy BECAUSE NORTHEAST
IS SUCH A CLOISTERED
SECLUDED PLACE
IT IS
THE POLICY OF NORTHEAST
IS TO AVOID CONTROVERSY
COMPLETELY
Woman MISERABLE ATTITUDE
THERE ARE GOOD POINTS MARK
CANT YOU FIND ANYTHING
GOOD ABOUT THIS SCHOOL
 STUDENTS ALL TALKING AT ONCE 
ITS GOT LOTS OF ROOM
EXCEPT NOT FOR AS MANY
KIDS AS ARE IN IT
ITS VERY NICE WELLVENTILATED
 STUDENTS LAUGHING 
I CANT SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT THE PEOPLE
WHO GO TO IT THOUGH REALLY
WITH VERY FEW EXCEPTIONS
AND MOST OF THE PEOPLE I COULD
MAKE THOSE EXCEPTIONS ABOUT
ARE RIGHT IN THIS ROOM
WITH MAYBE FIVE OR
SIX EXCEPTIONS
AND THE REST OF THE SCHOOL
STINKS IN MY ESTIMATION
YOU KNOW IM NOT QUALIFIED
TO MAKE YOU KNOW
GIGANTIC JUDGMENTS
ABOUT THE SCHOOL
BUT I THINK IN ITS
ATTITUDE TOWARDS EDUCATION
AND ITS RELATIONS
WITH THE WORLD TODAY
THIS SCHOOL IS MISERABLE
ITS CLOISTERED ITS SECLUDED
ITS COMPLETELY SHELTERED
FROM EVERYTHING THATS
GOING ON IN THE WORLD
AND I THINK ITS WRONG
IT HAS TO BE CHANGED
AND I THINK THATS
OUR PURPOSE HERE
AND NOT TO TALK ABOUT FILMS
Woman A LOT OF YOU
ARE SO NEGATIVE
THAT I CAN SEE SOMEDAY SOMEBODY
COMING OUT AND SAYING
YOU KNOW YOU KIDS
JUST DONT BELONG
YOU SPOIL NORTHEAST
NORTHEAST HIGH WOULD
BE A NICE
Mark THATS JUST WHAT HAPPENED
MR SIMON PULLED ME TO
HIS OFFICE AND SAID
YOU DONT LOOK LIKE
A NORTHEASTER SON
YOU DONT LOOK LIKE
A NORTHEASTER
Man I THINK ONE THING THAT
HAS TO BE CHANGED AROUND
IS THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE THESE
SEE LIKE YOU HAVE THESE
VARIABLES EXISTING
WITHIN THE SCHOOL
SYSTEM IN NORTHEAST
AND THE THING ABOUT IT
THAT MAKES IT SO ALIEN
OR FEEL TOWARDS US
IS THE FACT THAT UM
YOU HAVE TO LIKE
CONFORM TO THESE IDEAS
WHICH PEOPLE LIKE MR
SIMON DR ALLEN
Woman WHY DO YOU PICK ON HIM
ALL RIGHT HES GOT PROBLEMS
BUT I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO
SAY THAT THE SCHOOL
I LIKE TO THINK THAT
HE IS IN A POSITION
WHERE MAYBE YOULL FIND SOME
OTHERS OF THE SAME OPINION
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS HE
HAS A JOB AS VICE PRINCIPAL
THAT IS IN CONTACT
WITH THE STUDENTS
HE HANDLES THE
STUDENT ACTIVITIES
NOW IM NOT SAYING THAT MR
SIMON IS THE ONLY ONE
THAT SAYS THESE THINGS
THE RULE IS FAIRLY I
THINK YOULL AGREE
CONSISTENT AMONG MANY
MEMBERS OF THE FACULTY
AND DONT JUST PINPOINT POOR MR
SIMON
HE MAY BE RIGHT
HE MAY BE WRONG
BUT HES THE ONE VOICING
IT ALL THE TIME
BUT HES VOICING IT AS A
QUITE COMMON FEELING
WELL ILL SAY SOMETHING
GOOD ABOUT THE SCHOOL
ILL SAY THAT SCIENTIFICALLY
AND TECHNOLOGICALLY
NORTHEAST IS AN ADVANCED SCHOOL
APART FROM OTHER HIGH
SCHOOLS IN THE COUNTRY
A COMPLIMENT IM
GOING TO FAINT
APART FROM OTHER HIGH
SCHOOLS IN THE COUNTRY
POSSIBLY IN THE WORLD ALSO
THIS SCHOOL IN THAT
PARTICULAR FIELD
IS THE LEADER
AS MARK HAS SAID
MORALLY SOCIALLY
THIS SCHOOL IS A GARBAGE
CAN LETS FACE THE FACTS
Woman MORALLY COMPLETELY
YES
WELL I VENTURE TO SAY
THAT THE MORAL PROBLEMS
YOU HAVE HERE IN GENERAL
ARE IN EXISTENCE
IN MOST SCHOOLS
I DONT THINK ITS THAT BAD
NOW BOYS AND GIRLS UH
WE HAVE A VERY NEW PLAQUE
OUT IN THE HALL
IF YOUVE NOTICED
OUTSIDE THE MAIN OFFICE
FRAMED WHICH HAS A SPECIAL
THOUGHT FOR THE DAY
WRITTEN TO ATTRACT
YOUR ATTENTION
AND I THINK ITS VERY FINE
BUT AS ALWAYS WE
HAVE ON OUR BULLETIN
ANOTHER THOUGHT FOR THE DAY
AND THIS ONE ESPECIALLY IN
MY FIELD IS VERY IMPORTANT
BUT IN ANY KIND OF RESEARCH
TO HAVE THE RIGHT WORD
FOR WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY
IN THESE DAYS TO EXPRESS THINGS
SO THAT PEOPLE DO NOT
MISUNDERSTAND YOU
THE DICTIONARY
IS THE ONLY PLACE
WHERE SUCCESS COMES
BEFORE WORK
FOR THE TENTH AND
ELEVENTHGRADE BOYS
WHO SIGNED UP FOR FOODS
EXPERIENCES FOR BOYS
YOU MUST GO TO
ROOM 130 THIS WEEK
TO VERIFY YOUR REGISTRATION
THE SPECTATOR CLUB WILL DISCUSS
MARTIN LUTHER KINGS
ASSASSINATION
TODAY AT 315 IN ROOM 228
 WHISTLE BLOWS 
 BAND PLAYS 
 MUSIC STOPS 
NORTHEAST MAMBO
OLE OLE
NORTHEAST MAMBO
OLE OLE
NORTHEAST MAMBO
OLE OLE
AND IN GENERAL
THE MORE A FELLOW GETS INTO BED
WITH MORE DIFFERENT GIRLS
THE MORE INSECURE HE IS
AND THIS SHOWS UP
ACTUALLY LATER
IN ALL THE DIVORCE STATISTICS
AND IN THE MARITAL STATISTICS
THE MORE INTERCOURSE
EITHER A BOY OR A GIRL
HAS HAD PRIOR TO MARRIAGE
THE LESS LIKELY THEY ARE TO MAKE
SUCCESSFUL MARRIAGE PARTNERS
HUSBANDS WIVES
AND THE GREATER
IN OTHER WORDS YOU CAN
GRAPH IT RIGHT ON A GRAPH
THE MORE GIRLS A FELLOW
HAS GOTTEN INTO BED WITH
OR VICE VERSA THE
HIGHER THE DIVORCE RATE
THE GREATER THE
SEXUAL INADEQUACY
AND THE FAILURE
OF COMPATIBILITY
AS WITH ANYTHING ELSE THE
REAL PROS IN THE FIELD
KEEP IT TO THEMSELVES
AND ARENT PROFLIGATE
IS IT POSSIBLE TO
IMPREGNATE THE GIRL
BY RUBBING THE SURFACE
OF THE VAGINA
WITH WHAT YOUR NOSE
 LAUGHTER 
I MIGHT ADD
THIS BRINGS UP ONE
OTHER GOOD POINT NOW
THIS BRINGS UP ANOTHER
DARN GOOD POINT
VIRGINITY IS A STATE OF MIND
BY THAT I HAVE
SEEN SEVERAL GIRLS
WHO HAVE BEEN PHYSIOLOGICALLY
OR BY PHYSICAL
EXAMINATION VIRGINS
THE HYMEN THE MUCOUS
MEMBRANE COVERING
THE SOCALLED CHERRY
ITS CALLED THE CHERRY
BECAUSE IT PRODUCES RED
FLUID WHEN ITS BUSTED
 LAUGHTER 
IS INTACT
I HAVE SEEN GIRLS WHOSE
HYMENS WERE SO SMALL
THAT I COULDNT PASS A
FINGER THROUGH THEM
IN FACT I ONCE SAW A GIRL
I HAPPEN TO BE A GYNECOLOGIST
AND GET PAID TO DO IT
 LAUGHTER 
 WHISTLING 
I ONCE SAW A GIRL
WHO HAD RICKETS WHEN
SHE WAS A BABY
WHOSE BONY STRUCTURE
WAS SO DEFORMED
THAT I COULD GET MY
FINGER IN THIS WAY
BUT NOT BROADWAYS
WHO HAS SUCCEEDED IN
BECOMING PREGNANT
SPERM HAPPEN TO BE
VERY ACTIVELY MOTILE
THEY HAVE A GOOD ABILITY
TO MOVE ON THEIR OWN
AND MANY A GIRL HAS BECOME
PREGNANT THROUGH SPRAY
IF YOU ARE NOT PREPARED
TO HANDLE THE RESPONSIBILITY
OF THAT GIRLS BECOMING PREGNANT
AND HAVING A BABY
YOUVE GOT TWO CHOICES
ONE MAKE SURE THAT THERES
ADEQUATE PROTECTION
TO PREVENT HAVING A BABY
TWO IF THERE ISNT DONT
BECAUSE YOU ARE JUST
AS MUCH RESPONSIBLE
IF NOT A LITTLE BIT
MORE THAN THE GIRL
IF A PREGNANCY ENSUES
NATURE SETS US UP
THAT THE MALE IS THE AGGRESSOR
AND THE FEMALE IS THE PASSIVE
IN THIS SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES
IT TAKES A GIRL LONGER
TO GET SEXUALLY AROUSED
THAN IT DOES A BOY
THIS IS THE NATURE OF THE BEAST
Narrator WE CAN GET A BETTER
IDEA OF THE RELATIONSHIP
OF THE FALLOPIAN
TUBES AND OVARIES
IF WE VIEW THEM FROM THE FRONT
UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS
AN OVUM MATURES
IN THE OVARY
THEN PASSES DOWN
THE FALLOPIAN TUBE
ON ITS WAY TO THE UTERUS
WHEN GONORRHEA SPREADS UPWARD
THE INFECTION CAN CAUSE DAMAGE
WHICH BLOCKS THE
FALLOPIAN TUBES
SOMETIMES CAUSING
SEVERE COMPLICATIONS
AS IN A BOY
UNTREATED GONORRHEA CAN
MAKE A GIRL STERILE
UNABLE TO BECOME A MOTHER
HOWEVER A GIRL WITH GONORRHEA
CAN BECOME A MOTHER
BUT THIS CREATES
ANOTHER PROBLEM
WHEN THE BABY IS
READY TO BE BORN
THERE IS DANGER
THAT SHE MAY TRANSMIT THE
DISEASE TO THE CHILD
WHEN IT PASSES OUT OF HER BODY
YOU DIDNT GET HIT HUH
GOOD GLAD TO SEE YOU
YOU HAVE TO GO BACK
WHEN DO YOU GET OUT
I GET OUT SEPTEMBER 69
THATS TERRIFIC SEPTEMBER
SEPTEMBER 60
69 I GET OUT WITH HALSIE
IS HALSIE BACK
YEAH HE CAME BACK
HE WAS WOUNDED
I HEARD THAT I DIDNT SEE HIM
I HEARD DAVE WAS WOUNDED ALSO
SO ARE A LOT OF GUYS
