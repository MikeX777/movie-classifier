I AM NOT AFRAID OF THE DOGS
THAT GREET ME AT THE BACK OF NIGHT
LIKE CHILDREN HUNGRY FOR THE MOON
BECAUSE MY DAYS HAVE RISEN
AGAINST A CITY BEJEWELED WITH BEGGARS
WHERE CERTAIN NUDES MADE OF CANTERA STONE
REVOLT WITH THEIR VIRTUE
OF THIGHS AND BREASTS
AT THE CENTER OF THE PUBLIC SQUARE
BUT WITH THE GRIMACE
OF AN ASTONISHED MEDUSA
ALREADY TURNED TO STONE
BY THE GLEAM IN THE MIRROR
AND LULLED BY TERROR AS TRANSPARENT
AS THE CITIZENS BREATH
WHEN A SPIRIT DRINK RUNS
AND SPLITS THE BLOOD
OF OTHER NYMPHS WITH DUSKED WAISTS
THERE WHERE THE HORIZON STARTS TO OPEN UP
A GHOST TRAIN WHISTLES
ITS WHEELS SPARKING
AS IF SETTING A TIME OF PROFANE CATHEDRALS
ON FIRE
I AM NOT AFRAID OF THE DOGS
THAT GREET ME AT THE BACK OF NIGHT
SAMUEL NOYOLA THE WANDERING POET IS DEAD
I read article want

Now muse reality itself
Ive left alone
My life strange
I wonder Im Martian

MY BLOOD BURST INTO MY WRITING
AN ARTIST AMONG MIRRORS AT A BAR
AN ALCHEMIST OF ALGEBRA AND SOUL
WHEN THEY PUSHED ME TO THE TEN
TO THE TEN
THE ZERO
I BARELY MANAGED TO SEE THE ZERO
THE GONG OF EMPTINESS
I JUMPED
I JUMPED
MY FLAME BURNED ON A LASCIVIOUS SUMMER
I GOT DRUNK
WITH THE WINE OF A SICK AUTUMN
WINTER CAME DRUNK WITH MISERY
He wanted leave
He asked die
ZEROS MERRYGOROUND SPINS
AND THE SEA KEEPS SOUNDING
I NEVER FEEL ALONE
AMONG THE WAVES OF WRITING
MY FLAME WANTS TO SWIM TO THE OTHER SHORE
But I see…
wanted
But seeing again No
For record
gratitude
is…
And…
I want remember lot
and…
laugh me
