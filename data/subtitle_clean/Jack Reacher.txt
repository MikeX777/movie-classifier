James Barr sniper Not
best worst
But trained nonstop
years
What training like do
What training do
Skills reflex Muscle
memory You thinking
It makes people arent
necessarily smart smart
beating tactical
awareness them
Now 99 evidence
father Barr
didnt exist Baghdad
Barr smart
trained
See garage
shooter sun eyes
Targets moving
left right Its
difficult conditions
sniper
But Baghdad said Barr
parking garage then
Because Baghdad
suns him
Targets coming straight
ahead single file
Ideal conditions
average shooter
exact conditions
wouldve
highway bridge
Up there
van
No parking metre
No camera
No trace evidence left behind
And escape assured
Now Im saying
couldnt killed
people river
wouldnt have
Not way
 So youre saying hes crazy
 No
Well exactly saying
Any single piece evidence
Id buy But it
Fibres fingerprints
stray brass I mean
And hell pays parking
Sane crazy
doesnt sense
Okay So Barr
wanted caught
wanted catch him
That explain Barr
average shooter firing
poor conditions missed
He miss
He did
A pristine bullet
conveniently trapped
liquid backstop
The bullet tied
Barrs gun killings
And arguably
prosecutions single
important piece evidence
If Barr wanted
caught didnt miss
Either way doesnt sense
If wanted away
it likely
wanted caught
Barr incapable
perfection
Or maybe got lucky
shots six
Thats I
willing accept
