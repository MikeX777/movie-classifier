Attention
Last year December 12th
several participants bombing
Clark Field Philippines namely
Flight Sergeant 1stClass Kawata
officers shot down
Though listed dead
January 2nd
after 14th Army Units invasion Manila
rescued US prison camp
At time Japan
prejudice prisoners
war current imagining
Do live endure shame
prisoner war
To POW meant ostracism
oneself ones entire family
Coupled Japanese mentality
created military force
that die
surrender
Hence focus discussion was
needless say issue why
Flight Sergeant 1stClass Kawata
officers commit suicide
Can think way
live instead ways kill them
I understand feel
All officers publicly
listed casualties war
Hence situation difficult
Chief
lose planes
more
But pilots day
Indeed going ship exploding
ones plane beautiful ideals
However Air Corps
fight like that
We implore
way lenient
But conclusion incident
Onishi hoped for
We shouldve killed ourselves
Were disgrace Navy
Were traitors
We shouldve killed ourselves
Im going die
Im going die
Thats enough
Calm down
Enough
Stupid jackass Whats little
death going accomplish
Whats going accomplish
I die
I die
One month later shortly Chief
Staff Onishi transferred inland
the officers ordered launch
singleplane attack Port Moresby
Singleplane attack
planes escort
The command tantamount
suicide
Thank much
Its Kawata plane
Whats matter
Is all
Yes sir
Note This official war
declaration document
We Emperor
ruler divine providence
Empire Great Japan
hereby clearly valorously
declare war
against United States
Great Britain
Mere months
start Pacific War
the western Pacific Southeast Asia
complete Japanese control
But sixmonth war
attrition Guadalcanal
Japans strategic position
began deteriorate
Even Air Force thought
invincible had mid1944
lost elite pilots
participated attack Pearl Harbor
Furthermore US war industrial output
times greater Japans
and manufacturing new types
heavilyarmed fighter planes
that established US air superiority
By summer 1944
having lost Saipan critical
defensive bastion defending homeland
Japans prospects
dire indeed
Allied forces attack
Japaneseheld territory
from multiple staging
points Pacific
What move
While Japanese military intelligence
anxiously tried answer question
a fierce debate raged
Allied commanders
Admiral King emphasized importance
immediately invading Taiwan
while General MacArthur argued
liberation Philippines
The Joint Chiefs Staff decided
capture Philippines
The Philippines focal
point entire war
For Japan losing Philippines meant
losing crucial Southern Pacific resources
In fell swoop enemy gain access
Taiwan Okinawa homeland
The strategy defending Philippines
codenamed SHO1
At stage war battle
absolutely afford lose
Meanwhile Onishi
promoted Vice Admiral
and Vice Director Department
Air Weapons Naval General Staff
However star Naval Air Corps
headed battlefront again
The Emperor presided appointment
Commander First Air Fleet
We longer win
war ordinary tactics
We use special attack tactics
destroy enemy way
I petitioning Naval General Staff
organize  special attack units
Therefore I come you Vice Admiral
Onishi letter supporting plan
Please recommendation
To turn tide favor
willing die necessary die
My firm belief
selfsacrificing attacks
Well pack 1800 kilograms explosives
nose fly target
From height 6000 meters
enter dive
and plunge enemy
high speed
Im it We cant turn
pilots ammunition
We cruel
pilots
I agree
disgusting tactics
Look this Accidents happen
everyday base
We forced send pilots
battle 200 hours flight time
To expect skilled piloting
dream past
They off fly target
locations Thats all
we ask current
cadre pilots
This absolutely unacceptable
No matter bad things are use
brains better solution
Please support suicideattack plan
Vice Director Onishi
silent
The demand suicide attacks
getting insistent
I believe Navy
firm decision proceed
Please opinion
My opinion
Well itd easy order suicide attack
plane damaged return base
But deliberately launch
suicide attacks
There precedent
long history warfare world
I come debate tactics
I come inquire Navys
decision SHO1 operation
Are going implement
suicide attacks
Im aware situation
Im aware it But
Lets implement
strategy
If failure effect military
morale catastrophic
We need Combined Fleets
opinion yes
We cant decide hear
Combined Fleets opinion
The question
maintain discipline
if tactic employed
Am I correct assume then
Combined Fleet
is implementation
suicide attacks
I saying I it
Only needs study
We research based
earlier skipbombing training
I believe familiar
results presented report
Undeniably suicide attack
tactic palatable
But going bring calm
current maelstrom
then someone some
brave must
belt cat We need courage
before
Chief I implore you
Please decide favor
I finished assignment ceremony

Did come Saipan
An enemy B29 spotted

Most likely
This war turned
predicted
Like Yamamoto opposed

You took aggressive stance
beginning war
You opposed big battleships instead
championed use aircraft
You advocated changing Navy
emblem anchor propeller
Knowing this cruel send
Philippines unceremoniously
But need this

There thing I want
understand
Its special attack tactic
currently debated Navy
I want leave decision

Originally Special Attack Forces
Rear Admiral Onishis
lastditch tactic
dire emergency
But learning effective was
Imperial HQ changed position

Even coffin buried

Back work
In May 1945 First Air Fleet
Taiwan disbanded
Vice Admiral Onishi appointed Vice
Director Naval General Staff
and ordered home
Welcome home
It burned nicely
Im sorry I couldnt
rescue things
Wheres mother
She evacuated Shimonida Gunma
Were living yourself
No relatives Chiiras
letting stay night
I spend days here
to sure
house return
Ive wandered there
truly Ive lost
Its short notice Vice Director
present Imperial Court
so prepare
dress uniform
Oh no Its burnt Had I thought it
I wouldve run house wearing it
I see
Ill I borrow
somewhere
Alright do
Yes sir
Good job
Ill tea
Yeah
Oh Onishi
Thank efforts
Everyone apologies all
Your homes years ashes
its fault soldiers
I sincerely apologize Please
way forgive me
I little share but
Rock candy
Here go
Thank you
Here
Here
Thank much
Thank much
Here Missus
Thank much
Heres present you
I cant flatters me
I cant let ladies like this
But its Emperor cares
You look like youve lost weight
My countenance ugly
This outfit makes look like Kiratsune
Vice Admiral
Where official
residence be
Nanpeidai Shibuya
Would alright
stay there
You stay want
But there were war
There people parents children
struggling survive
The suicide warriors went deaths
knowing familylife
How I enjoy married life
Yes
I shook hands them hands
sent suicide missions
Six fourteen young men
Six fourteen them
Meanwhile war Europe
drawing end
In September previous year Italy
ally Japan conquered Allies
and fascist dictator Mussolini
executed partisans
In May year Germany fell
onslaught Russian Army
and Nazi Fuhrer Hitler
committed suicide
In way Japan catastrophically
isolated entire world enemy
The Army believes
2000 special attack planes
we devastate enemy
invasion force sea
But solid
data confirm this
Yes sir
We results experiments Takeyama
Air Base based Vice Directors idea
If look data photos
speak themselves
Using model No 25 No 50 bombs
we tested effects armor
enemy aircraft carriers battleships
We rammed explosives targets
appropriate speed results show
that transport ships sunk
The heavier ships survive hits
Vice Admiral point view
Yes
Though cant sink them
its possible crush morale
continuous suicide attacks
The US military calculates estimated
losses operation
When losses exceed estimate
scrap mission
Thats pattern now
We dont know estimate
losses mainland invasion be
but unrelentingly employ special
attacks convince cancel it
But respond increasing
control airspace
Our planes destroyed soon
arrive airfields
before depart
special attack missions
Strategies based suicide
tactics unrealistic
I admit
realm possibility
Hence belief
wait enemy move
We regain control airspace
bold aggressive attacks
Regarding issue I
Divisional Director Terai explain plan
Yes sir
We propose ground special attack
enemy air bases Saipan Tinian
aimed destroying enemy
planes B29s
On moonlit night land airborne troops
enemys runways
They use mines
destroy target planes
We begun combat training
mission Matsushima Air Base
We factories
working perfecting mines
When launch attack
Based lunar phase training
progress troops deployed
our goal early August
How avoid enemy
antiaircraft fire
If shadow enemy squadron
returns raid mainland
we believe its possible arrive
targets minimum casualties
Vice Director issue
plea training unit Matsushima
to try swords American POWs
preparation handtohand combat
What do
Such plea willing
sacrifice lives mission
cannot coldly denied
I absolutely opposed We
kill defenseless prisoners war
It inhumane
If news leak US
military fuel morale rage
Look happened Italy
Germany defeated
We accused war crimes We
getting grave trouble
His Highness Prince Takamatsu
present meeting
Vice Director saying
acceptable implicate His Highness
First Divisional Director
way speak me
I apologize
Not His Highness
bear responsibility
everyone military
held accountable
However First Divisional Directors
views merit
So shall reconsider
matter later time
However defeatist discuss
postwar considerations time
I willing bet single
battle matter situation be
And final battle
absolutely afford lose
Winning battle parting gift
gone us
Perhaps
given up
believing calculations paper
outnumbered prevail
But in
We thoroughly committed
war forget that
Vice Director You line

Director continue preparations

senior statesmen
Konoe Fumimaro

Prime Minister Suzuki supported Foreign
Minister Togo Navy Minister Yonai

Japan act intermediary
but instead Soviet Union declared
abrogating treaty
Soviet diplomatic responses

Meanwhile military authorities assumed

However resources available
mount defense
could described
pitifully inadequate
At time weapons

Cabinet Minister
We knew war impossible

We knew steel production

The premise war illogical
were trying resolve logically
Its betrayal people
nation
Furthermore
in constitution set
Meiji Emperor
and military law word
surrender appear
Our frontline soldiers fought
man believing that
They chose path suicide
shame taken captive
If Imperial decision
choose peace
it betray souls

The governments decision seek peace
decided meeting
But late
As Ambassador Sato waited
Soviet leaders continued stall
In meantime July 16 Potsdam
Declaration ultimatum Japan
was drawn leaders
US Great Britain China
That day US detonated worlds

Japanese territory
The Soviets sought occupy Manchuria
Hokkaido Kurile islands
Their struggle control corpse
Japanese Empire

US Soviet Cold War
The Potsdam Declaration demanded
Japans unconditional surrender
was announced July 26th
US Great Britain China
Meanwhile government hoping
Soviet mediation Japans behalf
had placate extremists
Vice Admiral Onishi
and Prime Minister declared
Potsdam Declaration ignored
But Americans wanted Japan surrender
Soviets entered war
so unilaterally interpreted
ignore mean rejection
They immediately launched B29
Tinian island drop atomic bomb
As soon learned Americans
dropped atomic bomb Soviet Union
immediately declared war Japan
invaded Manchuria
The Soviet entry war meant
Americans needed force Japan
to immediately surrender
atomic bomb second time
As hope negotiating
peace early August 9th
the Emperor informed government
decided accept
the Potsdam Declaration government
immediately sent telegram Allies
acknowledging acceptance
unconditional surrender
The order cease fire
order disarm
These despicable orders
attempt destroy Emperor
Having lost faith assured victory
the government senior officers
committed high treason
and forfeited
authority orders
Therefore declare
reject commands
