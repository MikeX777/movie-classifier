200 years ago Bijapur Sultanate
ruled Raja Hari Man Singh
In days fear ghosts
spirits prevailed hearts people
The feared demon
called Saamri
One day Raja Man Singh travelling
daughter Rupali Bijapur
when royal
chariot broke down
How long take
Only little while sire
 Where Rupali gone
 She here
Rupali Rupali
Princess
She shouldnt left late
night This Saamris land
Dont look me
Go her Go
Saamri
Cut down
Kill him
Find him him
That demon came way
Quickly
This royal proclamation
Mughal King Hari Man Singh
states Saamri
satanic powers
has created terror
state Bijapur
The accusation unrobed
young married women
and violated honor
You accused
slake satanic thirst
you mercilessly killed
young innocent children
and sucked blood
You fallen low
human level
that Satan
shun you
To strengthen evil powers
opened graves
took corpses
and
and ate them
O King destroy
creature now
No Entomb wall
King
I believe monster
purged pure fire
and turned
forever ashes
No holy man
This demons head
separated body
The body buried
ruins temple
And head
will remain guard
palace far here
That way head body
joined together
I beg you lord guard head
holy trident Shiva
Thus demons powers
rendered ineffective
The old temple
Hari Man Singh
I curse you
As long head body
remain apart
all female heirs
die horribly
as soon birth
child
And day head body
joined again
will end
dynasty
And Hari Man Singh cut
head demon
and kept
apart body
The body buried ruins
Shankars Palighat temple
The demons head
trunk fastened chains
Raja Hari Singh secured trunk
dungeon palace
God Shivas holy trident
trunk
A wall built door
dungeon
and severed head hidden
eyes world
A painting Hari Man Singh
hung door
And stories
Saamris evil faded
into darkness
dungeon
The river time carried
main players
The faces Sher Khan
Rajguru Balbir Singh rest
became lost
mists time
The flame Hari Singhs life
extinguished
After reins state
fell Prithipal Singh
course time
Raja Ajit Singh
After him Thakur Ranbhir Singh
sat throne
The dusts time settled
ancient palace
and
forgotten about
The pulse life left
palace area moved city
This remaining heir
Hari Man Singh  Ranbir Singh
A grand important man
today
But fear Saamri
prevails heart mind
