The godfather
Dr Hendrik Verwoerd
 In South Africa
achieve
peace separating

And spelled

He said “The black
people got

They embarked
remarkable

It create

It twostate

When I look Israel I
traveled West Bank
I looking
Bantustans totally
unviable impossible states
In respects
struck
significantly worse
Apartheid
Bantustans
abhorred
South Africa Bantustan
leaders actually
power control
Palestinian
Authority has
What Oslo create
authoritywhich allowed
Israel
control occupied
Palestinian territory
control
Palestinian authority
Ostensibly there’s
kind Palestinian
authority that’s
controlling that’s power
occupied territory
But
fact Israel controls
borders
Israel controls taxes
Israel controls kinds
things access
area
To me big analogy
South
Africa taking
choices
you’ve got
nationalisms
laying claim
country
you’ve got
way live together
you’ve got
fair partition
The big similarity
Apartheid
South Africa
IsraeliPalestinian
situation
decided
partition solution
and cases
grotesquely
unfair partition
And Israel says
“Well Gaza problem
Gaza foreign country
It’s state
It’s
country It’s us”
Just like South
Africa it’s
logic We need
Palestinian state
can’t digest
Palestinians
We can’t citizenship
wouldn’t
Jewish state
We create
Palestinian state
that’s
way

Since 2006 Israel
imposed deadly

The siege caused
economic standstill
Gaza The unemployment

On ridiculous end

In 2009 Israel

The problem don’t
examples look now
You look

Maybe better example
hundreds
hundreds years

Just like Gaza
people died
insufficient access medicine
insufficient water
reasons
air strikes
There number people
governments claim
Israel
withdrew settlers

unilaterally 2005
it’s longer
occupying power
actually
case In
international law
occupation refers control

indigenous
government there
That’s precisely
exists
Israel Gaza
Strip right now
Israel
controls land
Gaza Strip
which people
don’t know completely
surrounded
wall similar
wall snakes
West Bank It
completely surrounded
The Israeli Navy controls
seas coast Gaza
gunfire
The airspace
controlled Israel
prohibited
Palestinians
reopening airport
So Gaza completely
control Israelis
The Palestinian
Authority can’t issue
identity documents

people come
go independent
Israeli

If look

They 95
territory right
They living areas
exercise yard

work
areas It belongs
prisoners
All prison authorities
maybe 5 And know what
If it’s minimal
security prison maybe
1 That’s
need
You need walls
around cell bars

corridors
locked doors that’s
it With 1 territory
absolutely
control inmates
helps
switch
The issue isn’t
territory prisoners have
The issue is
prison
When majority
world leaders
people power
change things talk
twostate solution nowadays
talk
Palestinian
state Bantustans
separated
other state
sovereignty
independent policies

similar economic
infrastructure
ones
Bantustans South Africa
The main thing
world
Israelis
issue
plate
that’s Israel
thinks away
Bantustan way
South Africa
couldn’t You know
push
twostate solution thats
Apartheid
If doesn’t
borders doesn’t
water doesn’t
access
greater economic resource
Jerusalem
It’s carved little islands
There’s freedom movement
theres freedom commerce
It’s prison state
Therefore essential idea
twostate solution
state
itself viable state
The Israelis
rendered West Bank
Gaza unviable
hopelessly unviable
I’m saying Israel longer
solution option
It twostate
solution impossible
Physically morally impossible
 It time
ahead forward
twostate solution
thank much
You hear talk
twostate
solution You opinion
polls
majority Israelis
willing accept it
majority
Palestinians willing
accept it
consensus disappears
moment try actually
flesh detail
That’s
twostate solution
proposals extremely vague
Palestinians
say “The West Bank
Gaza fifth
historic Palestine
Why
anymore” Israelis
say “Well there’s
450000 settlers
areas
generations
Why leave”
The thing difficult
trying live together
trying
force separation
music
Israel’s overall goal
create
Jewish state In
1948 75
population
nonJewish population
Christians
Muslims expelled
homeland
allowed return
For reason
reason

they’re Jewish
The 5 6 million
refugees living Lebanon
Syria Jordan etc
people
Israeli
citizens Israel
kicked
refused citizenship
Over million
Palestinians
refugees
1948 1967 wars
By natural population
growth
number 5 million people
await
right return
Some Palestinians
managed stay
inside
Israel 1948
today 20
Israeli citizens
So Israeli state
kind rights
privileges
resources allocated
entirely dependent
ethnic group
come from
You’re Jewish
you’re Palestinian
Arab
prefer them
And
situation welfare
benefits people
example
dependent
they’re Jewish not
You situation
Jew can’t marry
nonJew Israel For
South Africans
remember Mixed
Marriages Act
example You
situation people
ethnic group
Palestinians
able freely live
areas majority
Jewish similar
old Group Areas Act
Now criticisms
people
start accusing
Israel
Apartheid state inside
borders they’ll say
“Well Palestinians
sit Jews
inside restaurants
They sit
buses They
cinemas” that’s true
that’s
significance Apartheid
The idea Apartheid
isn’t
fact people
cant sit
park bench It
controlling
resources making
sure ethnic
group control resources
didnt
And sense
Israel
very effective
this

grand Apartheid
petty Apartheid
In key areas
people’s lives
education
employment owning land
Palestinian citizens
treated entirely
differently
Jewish citizens
I think that’s
reasons
Apartheid
comparison made
By far
fundamental element
Apartheid
South Africa Israel
control land
In apartheid South

I doubt it’s
Jewish state
I question
strongly
it’s democratic state
If talked
Afrikaner
democratic state
I think

oxymoronic
phrase use
So Jewish democratic
equally troubling us
There
million Palestinians
inside Israel today
thats major
concern Israel It’s
concerned
demographic growth
calls it
demographic time bomb
Palestinians inside Israel
I came realize
talk
elimination Israel
it’s demographic thing
That Israel
cease exist
longer
Jewish majority
In words
nationhood depends
having
ethnic
specifically
religious majority
permanently entrenched
Because
experience I’ve gone

country I saw
terrible injustice
committed
Afrikaners’

I ashamed country
grievously ashamed it
The reason Israel

entirely
artificial means
The framework

maintain Jewish
