Samuel Maleski
dead chalet
Turning now
Full shot
Close up
Ill dictate initial ideas
Insert conclusion
The parallel superficial abrasions
hands forearms
suggest body slid
1 2 meters impact
reaching
final supine position
A left temporal hematoma
related fatal brain trauma
indicates collision
blunt object environment
violent blow head
Injury location inconsistent
discovery position
impact occurred
body hit ground
In conclusion
determine
injury resulted
collision blow
We cannot stage
rule party involvement
Then usual
CAUSE OF DEATH HEAD TRAUMA
FORENSIC CAUSE
ACCIDENTAL ANDOR DELIBERATE
Toxicological analysis needed
establish truth
Anatomy fall

Mrs Boudaoud reaction
The judges decision rare
merit praise
A judge refusing
repressive reflexes
healthy sign
especially case
We feel release
judicial supervision

This rare decision
homicide accusation

repudiation Judge Janvier
Reactions hallways

Just focus him
How met
When met hed gotten job
university London
So moved together
He great teacher
He way making
sound alive accessible
great
But some
But wasnt enough
so
Deep down wanted
write
He working novel years
I watched struggle hard
And I came realize
relationship time
work was
complicated unlike me
No
stop comparing him
Just to
Go relationship
Our relationship revolved
intellectual stimulation
meant
neglecting else
Everything else
Meaning Daniel
We mention Daniel
early on
The accident
OK I didnt know so
 Its OK
 Its OK
Its I didnt know
so
like this OK
Everything changed
accident
Daniel four
That day Samuel supposed
pick school
But roll
writing so
called babysitter minute
showed late
As crossing street
motorcycle hit Daniel
His optic nerve
permanently damaged
After that
Samuel obsessive it
blamed loop
If hed gone
picked time
He overcome guilt
Perhaps
truly escaped feeling
We spent year
hospital
Daniel
We began having financial problems
Samuel started
taking antidepressants
Can clean
Vincent
Id like protect
image spare Daniel
Well try
OK
But like that
I to

One year later
Are interested in
What interests you
Come on sure
I anybody
I work day long
come me
course me
I run
Its favorite things do
Makes feel high
like Im drugs
What know drugs
Thats question
Big subject
Maybe dont write down
No surely not
I told you
Grenoble
Its fine
Ill write answers down
Do confirm
interview Mrs Voyter
Yes
She refuses talk herself
thats came
I came talk work
Right constantly
changing subject
looking for
suppose
We hear it
She asks me
She enjoy talking
herself
Was inciting
talk yourself
Inciting
No I wouldnt that
She wasnt manipulative
relaxed
It felt natural
She enjoy conversation
You relaxed
We hear serve wine 145
Had drinking
arrived
I think so
Would utmost
comfortable
mightve expected
interviewing writer
I wouldnt that no
It like Sandra Mrs Voyter
needed escape relax
 Escape
 Right
Did know Sandra
her bisexual
No
Did sense it
No
Hearing conversation now
hindsight
seduction
I felt told herself
didnt
social life
chances talk
new people
I suppose
form seduction
The court needs know
that
Seduction means things
But word seduction
implies some
seduction
The witnesss answer
clear enough
means seduction
Mrs Voyter kept expressing
you
She wanted interview
Grenoble
Didnt sense
She answered question
Not clearly
Please answer Miss Solidor
Could Mrs
I dislike reduced
marital status
Of course
That wasnt intention
I didnt feel seduced moment
So wonder afterwards
I atypical more
How interpret song
Samuel Maleski played
I felt tension noise
Samuel Maleski imposing
presence showing himself
And Sandras reaction
What reaction
She bit annoyed
And song started over
He playing loop
Clearly
good deduction
But feel
moment
It added strangeness
I felt presence less
It relaxed
So clearly felt tension
 Youre nitpicking
 No clarifying
Did feel tension
Yes
Did feel Mr Maleski
playing music
wanted disrupt interrupt
interview
That thought yes
But its hard read intentions
cant see
Thats pay for
Sandra Voyter
sought connection
divert interview
Correct
Thats leading question
There seduction
My question concerns connection
In recording youre chummy
laughing drinking wine
Were seeking escape
difficult homelife
connecting young woman
Mrs Voyter
initiate meeting
Please answer Mrs Voyter
Yes I surprising
I hadnt seen new while
And yes I needed drink
This person intelligent nice
more
That interview hardly
base thesis on
She laugh student
questions dont thrill her
Would music
Mr Maleski played
aggressively
indicated jealous you
Miss Mrs Solidor Sorry
The music cover
50 Cents PIMP
deeply misogynistic song
It instrumental version
Answer please
Could husbands song choice
express jealousy
I answer
He played song
I doubt intentional
He loved loud music relaxed him
He purposefully installed
What speaker Sorry
A powerful speaker sorry
He worked lot noisy
Mrs Solidor says
ended interview that
 Is true
 She said that
If defense
keeps reacting question
Ill irritated
Mrs Voyter answer question
The music loud
And started over
I realized wasnt going stop
That discussion difficult
So I
I preferred stop
And I tired yes
And I felt bit
woozy wine
Yet alone didnt ask
explain behavior
As I said habitual
No
You entertaining
attractive young woman
toiled upstairs
habitual neutral
He knew liked women
Youd recently cheated
Thats point
And sexist
Id said
attractive man
Excuse me couples
conflicts matter here
Theres
bit strange situation
You went upstairs
room work sleep
Right attic
deafening music
Music
interview impossible
In big house
chose spot
Yes thats I work
I work bed
When Samuel came talk you
didnt complain
Deafening music overhead
hardly normal
Im it I dont mind
I wanted work I earplugs
It normal
I work situation
You said tired
woozy wine
Yet wanted work
Yes
And I did Not long
A translation due
I wanted finish resting
As I said I work
environment condition
Apparently rest
anywhere anytime
So world
Thats all
No questions
Daniel thats told us
Zoe Solidor saw
leave house left
And mom says
spoke dad that
I got mixed up
You got mixed up
Indeed problem Daniel
Right
You couldnt places once
I think I went inside
What bothers sure
reenactment
You said statement
Each piece tape feels different
I wouldnt wrong
And
I open window
I know I heard
Then reenactment
said entirely
How come
I thought
I remembered I was but
Maybe shock happened
got mixed up
A psychiatrist met Daniel
says emotional shock
altered memories
Of course
Do remember
came inside
I think I mustve forgotten
gloves phone
But youre sure
I dont remember exactly
So went absolute certainty
uncertainty
memories day
This problematic
Youre fixating
memory
cast doubt memory
What want believe
That shock turned yelling
calm voices
You insinuate
lied protect mother
No
Im merely signaling
witnesss doubts
But entitled wonder
Daniel Maleski says leave
parents fought
Whereas day
happens
right argument
likely erupt
Thus doesnt hear thing
I didnt happen out
I fled music
And hes precise
heard
Hes budged that
The psychiatrist
visual impairment expert
observed
Daniels excellent aural memory
Clerk display
elements provided Mr Balard
Were listening
The decisive element
blood spatters
woodshed
indicated sketch
Can zoom woodshed
Their shape typical spatter
projected high above
They long narrow
The longest measures 4 centimeters
lot
So according tests
spatters
landed
Mr Maleski struck head
3rd floor balcony
He
leaning balcony
head far
blow struck
spatter land there
No explanation stands
Did violence blow
Mr Maleski fall
Most likely
combination
violent blow
deliberate push
Would aggressor
state extreme anger
provoke fall
administering violent blow
A state rage Id say
Hard imagine less
Such states
increase physical strength
The guardrail 12 meters high
Comes here
Mr Maleski 182 meters tall
weighed 85 kilos
So pushing guardrail
required
deliberate push right
The entire act deliberate
Such blow intentional
What I mean deliberate is
coordinated Methodical
Based weight assume
necessary lift legs
fall
hardly suggests rage
Rage exclude will
And Mr Maleski probably
offbalance
He fallen
blow
unstable position
As I said
material elements
Except 3 drops blood
Everything speculated
explain drops right
OK explanation
I gave
You gave theory
explanation
Actually theories
With deliberate push
According theories
type object used
A heavy object probably metal
dense wood
undoubtedly sharp edge
Did examine objects
premises
You know weapon found
Theyre easily disposed of
No questions
Two possible explanations
3 spatters
Either came here
violent blow
Or resulted skull
hit roof ledge
approximately here
The hypothesis unlikely
Its inconsistent shape
movement spatters
Focusing second hypothesis
account
bounce caused impact
roof ledge
Ill video
insitu tests
There
As
reenactment dummy
impact
causes body turn abruptly
And rollover spin
fraction second impact
3 spatters projected
surface
The valid explanation
Mr Maleski
fell attic window
I believe its way
couldve bounced roof
sustained injury
You use cautious qualifier
I believe
So its opinion
How explain
lack DNA trace tissue
point impact
bounce it
Ill you
This test carried
comparable conditions
At time incident
layer ice
underneath layer snow
We snow melting
acceleration
And see
1 hour 50 minutes
runoff
takes residue
embedded point impact
It ends blood

here
You violent blow hypothesis
improbable
Would impossible
No highly improbable
Meaning possible
As its possible
Ill president someday
I know definition
Its improbable reason
In hypothesis
order explain angle
3 spatters
imagine
Mr Maleskis head
leaning way out
80 cm past guardrail
This implies aggressor forced
lean backwards void
shoving guardrail
entire torso pitched backwards
The aggressor
leaning far
holding heavy object
striking victim
powerful momentum
All elements
addition
defendants body mass
hypothesis highly improbable
But impossible
Listen Daniel
I asked because
I know vested
case
Ive allowed
attend trial far
But tomorrow
far complicated
Well covering
disturbing details
Ive decided
wont attending
I think I hear anything
What
I think I hear anything
 Yeah
 Im prepared
You hear it
handle it
We job do
We need able work
serenity
Ive disrupted trial
Disrupted
Thats point
We need able
evoke facts bluntly
We address everything
fear hurting you
Ive hurt
And thats I need
hear I past it
The trial hearing
Its establishing truth
forced
censor ourselves
When
censored themselves
Even forbid come
Ill out
Ill know happened
TV radio internet
Ill obsessed
Mrs Voyter claim
husband attempted suicide
6 months died
You remembered late
surprising
Can
episode detail
Yes
It happened weeks
stopped medication
I lying floor
early morning room
Hed
lot drink
The night before passed out
Hed vomited
vomit I saw aspirin
The pills nearly dissolved
At I didnt understand
was
But later I found
blister packs
kitchen garbage
I cleaned
bed
Later
felt better
didnt want discuss it
He said hed
stopped meds soon
You separate bedrooms
It office
usually slept there yes
I see What
room early
I wake early
He too sometimes
We occasionally spent time
together talking
At 6 morning
Yes I saw light on Yes
Wed stopped sharing bed
close
I often
finish night him
office bed
Id gone coffee
I saw door ajar and
I saw lying floor
No witnessed that
No
Thank you sit down
Did know that
Which antidepressant
prescribe
Escitalopram 20 mg day
 Was choice stop
 Yes
About 7 months died
wanted wean off
I recommended tapering plan
weekly checkins
Any suicidal ideation
No Samuel wasnt depressive
Id prescribed Escitalopram
emotional shield
help cope
sons accident
Can sudden withdrawal low dose
trigger suicide attempt
Anythings possible theory
asked
help wean off
stop back
Makes sense
And mention
weekly sessions
Have patient
commit suicide
attempt suicide
In French committing suicide
means trying succeeding
Its action
Thanks language lesson
No patient committed suicide
Aside Mr Maleski
were
rule question
In case
cant consider
expert suicide
failed successful
You said husband
refused discuss you
else apparently
Why think
Because ashamed
He lot of
Its complicated
Can I change language please
Thanks
Yeah I think ashamed
Samuel
lot issues shame
Its complicated
He frustrated teaching
It burden
wanted write
Hed working
novel years
Daniels accident
I read wrote
I thought good
I told so
But day another
just
couldnt anymore
stopped
It feel like coward
He belittle himself
He ended convincing
write
dependency
medication
He wanted free that
not course not
Im sorry Im finished
He talk
suicide attempt
feelings failure
painful
He spoke that
Not once
He blamed getting hooked
pills session
It drove mad
He I decided together
You cant deny youre center
equation
Samuel came
felt guilty
blamed him
He described behavior
castrating
You pay
accident
forcing
mattered him
Writing
You
emotional roller coaster
On hand its true
encouraged write
wanted succeed
But had
wouldve unbearable you
Thats problem
It subconscious
All material
psychological burdens
resulting accident
bear
Its said
This problem
Youre responsible Deal it
I want free that
write
Material burdens
managed Mrs Voyter
husband
We bank statements
receipts etc
Im talking
emotional load
Responsibilities sense purpose
anxiety
In areas
Samuel felt unbearable imbalance
So patients
tell truth
As psychoanalyst
wondered
Samuel Maleski
mightve needed imagine
unbearable imbalance
prevent writing
After while I tell
whats real isnt
Lucky you
Im sorry interrupt
But
I dont know You come here
OK maybe opinion
tell
Samuel
going through
But
little situation
You know
I mean sometimes
couple
kind chaos
everybody lost
Sometimes fight
fight alone
fight
other happens
And I think its possible Samuel
needed things
way them but
If Id seeing therapist
stand
ugly things Samuel
But things true
Did resent husband
sons accident
We dealing
different emotions time
Yes no
Yes days
Daniel watch
Your son practically lost sight
resented
days
Yes responsibility
accident Yes
Of course
I mean maybe The doctor earlier said
tragic situation
I immediately refused
way
I saw Daniel handicapped
You know I wanted protect
perception
Because soon mark child
way condemn
life own
feel
its best life
its life hes got
own
He reads books
goes social media
like kid
plays piano
dreams cries laughs
Hes lively kid
Hes OK
Yeah
So perhaps I
I resented Samuel projecting
pain Daniel yes
Thank you

Do kill pleading

Thats main flaw
suicide theory
You depleted

Looking us
Can explain
You know I
Id heard about
dads suicide attempt
Id heard about
shrink medicine
vomit aspirin
When mom talked it
I remembered
time
One morning
Snoop lying bedroom floor
Not moving
He smelled like vomit
I figured hed vomited
I cleaned muzzle
I figured hed
I dont know caught virus
something because
acted strange days
He slept drank
See Now Im thinking
maybe ate dads vomit
that sick
Mom told truth
So experiment aspirin
hed react
And saw
He slept 14 hours
Now hes drinking time
He smells exactly same
Everything
Everythings exactly same
But since
Since yesterday
Im sure I believe not
I knew fought but
It wasnt
I didnt think violent
Your memories youre sure of
its important tell jury
But youre witness
Do think couldve killed him
Its judge
I know
tell me
I cant answer that
My role protect you
Fucking help me
Actually
lack element
judge something
lack unbearable
decide
You see
To overcome doubt
to
decide sway
way other
Since need believe thing
choices
choose
So invent belief
Yes well sense
So means Im sure
youre saying
I pretend Im sure
No Im saying decide
Thats different
What strikes
dont know whos lyrical
 The author character
 Both doubt
Voyter plays confusion
Her second book goes further
telling father
couldnt stand first
Undoubtedly true
The rift degenerates
forcing leave country
Fearing fathers rage
falls prey horrifying visions
I troubling quote
interview She says
My job cover tracks
so fiction destroy reality
Yes excites people
Samuel Maleski case
come
books
It feels like
shes written it
Even doubts death
way died
Voyters murky personality
amoral deceptive traits
overplay
It reads like books
I dont think matters died
The fact is idea writer
killing husband
far compelling
teacher killing himself
If I imagine mother it
I dont understand
But I imagine father
I think I understand
Prosecutor questions
The experiment dog
proves nothing
Its documented
More problematic
providential memories
clearly jarred
heard trial
No event placed
convincingly timeline
The time frame 6 months
Maleskis death
comes testimony
given defendant herself
Id like know
Did wonder
overdose
father supposedly took
mightve resulted
suicide attempt
attempt mother
poison him
Im accusing
making point
So taking speculations
choose other
Your memories speak
consequences causes
Yes I thought that but
I dont
wouldve it
It feels like lack proof
sure
happened
look further
trial doing
When weve looked
dont understand
thing happened
I think ask
happened
Thank you Daniel
Are finished
No
I want else
Since dog sick days
Dad I went vet
Dad quiet car
He didnt play music
He usually does
After while
started talking Snoop
He said
You know sick
Even die You know that
You need ready
I didnt want hear that
Snoop better
He young
Hed sick
I told wasnt going die
But kept going
He said You need aware it
Itll happen someday
And its wonder Snoop gets tired
Hes young dog years
Can imagine life
Hes dog
Hes great dog
An outstanding dog
Think it
He anticipates needs
foresees movements
keeps safe danger
He spends life
imagining needs
thinking cant see
Maybe hes tired
Always caring others
Maybe day hell done
That happen
And I remember end
said One day
when its time
go hell go
You wont able help it
Prepare yourself itll hard
But wont
end life
He meant himself
Now
Now I know meant himself
I implore jurors bear mind
