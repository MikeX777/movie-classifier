background prescribed

In keeping Mr Khans
religious cultural sensitivities
Your recommendation skews
facts religion
person represents
Honour killing happens
Christians Sikhs Hindus
The Druze Yehidi Muslims
And
religions condone it
Farah saying
Its Asian Islamic
The roots practice lie
ancient tribal code
And its followed
people world over
It predates Islam
An ancient code
So ingrained
peoples heads
They dont
realise follow it
Miss Siddiqui
mock client
A code promotes
killing daughter
The woman responsible
honour tribe
She carries future womb
Thats relationships
need controlled
A woman protected
God forbid lose
women taint good blood
Miss Siddiqui
