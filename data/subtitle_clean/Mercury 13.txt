Most harmful behavior based fear
Protecting one’s perceived position
society…
protecting one’s territory
one’s physical wellbeing
But progress inevitable
This Apollo Control
The situation landing
Repeat again landing
There was time
lot prejudice
Women astronauts What ridiculous idea
Roger
You’re by Jim We’re sailing free
Okay Jim How read Over
I read loud clear
You sound beautiful
I think know didn’t happen
Okay 300 feet

It good old boy network
And thing
good old girl network
Okay Fuel percent
I guess well
didn’t like that So…
Here comes shadow
Perfect place here I
couple big boulders bad
I didn’t tell people
I wanted astronaut
I gonna it
You’re leveled off Let down
Okay Seven percent Pretty fast
Contact Stop
Someone start fight
change opinion
Someone lead way
That’s small leap woman…
giant step mankind
Surprise
 How doing
 Great
Good you
 Hi honey How you
 Good
 Good you sweetheart
 Thank you Nice you
 What kind airplane usually fly
 Usually 172
Although time
I flying Cherokee

 Yeah Lowwing Comanches
I’ve lucky I’ve able
fly Stearmans month
 Oh good
 That’s great
That’s airplane I owned
I 20 years old California
I very curious kid
My ride airplane
years age
And wonderful
The freedom smell exhaust
air going hair
It me It me

I thought I too
My parents didn’t like idea
People didn’t think
women all flying
But I knew better
I liked I it
I think solo is
flying experiences
feel greatest accomplishment
It thrill going
free there
And you’d look

My experience flight um
I young
Mother pilot
And go sky
And Mother’s delighted
little girl

And just She truly laughed
said know Watch this
And away went
clouds
Quite wonderful
I still I lift off
think Why me God
Why I this
I don’t think I needed
lot encouragement
I raring go
I just I loved flying
There
certain prejudice
women getting men’s fields
But stories women
making breakthroughs aviation
So I knew possible
She’s break women’s
speed record Jacqueline Cochran
Takeoff Detroit girl
ranks lady sky
Women progressing rapidly
The women’s record
ladybird France
276 miles hour
Jacqueline flies
17 miles hour faster that
She lands I wonder looks
flying 293 miles hour
That’s fast
disarrange one’s hair
Sure enough…
No I met Jackie Cochran
But I tell Jackie Cochran story
I flying Cincinnati
tower gave
landing instructions
And I heard woman’s voice
She flying Lockheed Lodestar
And I thought My word female pilot
flies big old Lockheed
The tower called her said
Lockheed
lined wrong runway
And said
I’ll land goddamn runway I please
And course I thought
Wow I didn’t know
radio
We didn’t need reason
invite Jacqueline Cochran program
Our guest probably
distinguished woman pilot
world today
It soloed
Roosevelt Field 1932
 That correct And
 Came deadstick landing
Right And 48 hours
I’d seen airplane ground
How hours instruction
you
Five hours minutes
But you’ve
cosmetics business
I well
’Course helped married
millionaire admit that
I pretty
I got married
Jacqueline Cochran
extraordinary gal
She uh
She raised poverty South
She formed company
She met Floyd Odlum was
prior war
highestpaid CEO United States
Jackie individualist
First woman this
woman that
And Jackie wanted trailblazer
Women wings
At Avenger Field Sweetwater Texas
famous flyer Jacqueline Cochran
gives ferry pilot students
lastminute inspection
Then it’s plane
graduation ceremonies
Goodbye Daughter
I’m working army now
Jackie Cochran headed
WASP program World War II
Women’s Airforce Service Pilots
flew airplanes
That time happened
They flew military airplanes
didn’t war
What
provided ferrying capability
They pick aircraft
factories
fly point
turned over
And women flew planes
training less
men had
safety record
So proved
fly aircraft
Nobody tell WASP
flying’s woman’s job
They wouldn’t believe
said
girl can’t good flyer woman
woman time
After war
didn’t want up
They wouldn’t independence
A lot ’em stayed aviation
And lot ’em didn’t want
kitchen
They wanted freedom again
And WASPs great mentors
They organized air races
called Powder Puff Derby
The I flew ’52
You know you’re 18
don’t fear
don’t think brave
You think adventures having fun
Because 18yearolds think
happen ’em
You know Powder Puff Derby
great ring it
And great say
Yeah I flew Powder Puff Derby
When you’re takeoff line
flag drops
power it off
I stayed close runway
speed up
The women meet
flying air races wonderful
they’re inspiring
And lifelong friends
What thrill won 13th
Annual AllWomen International Air Race
Mary I feel proud this
We’re real happy Florida
What wonderful state have
The air racing important
It proved mettle It proved
gals knew doing
The racing fraternity strong
The bond strong
On October 4 1957
worldstirring event took place
Sputnik My word
To thing going world
Space very exciting then
Everybody space business
I remember
Mother’s extraordinary enthusiasm
knew Sputnik
gonna traversing sky
She got house
looking sky just I mean
grapefruit juice hand
poured herself
She excited
How quickly went
sending Sputniks …
sending animals
I think everybody astounded
accomplishments
I remember Russians had
point time
succeeded single endeavor
They ahead us
The United States needed catch up
One seven young men
American space
These astronauts
United States Project Mercury
When program started
lot military guys wanted it
So developed criteria
qualification astronaut
Each be
graduate navy air force
test pilot school
1500 hours flight time…
qualified jet aircraft
engineering background
5’11 less
Thirtytwo candidates reported
Lovelace Clinic Albuquerque New Mexico
exhaustive series
physical examinations
These tests divided
given normal clinical procedures
series time
Project Mercury
NASA picked Dr Lovelace
set standards astronauts
program
So developed testing
conducted testing
The question is
Dr Lovelace’s work done
We hope continue participate
program
I doctors
technicians
little tired right moment
My father
Dr William Randolph Lovelace II
He great smile
serious
He surgeon foremost
involved aviation
aerospace medicine
He invited
head space medicine NASA
That fun time
seven astronauts came
house dinner night
And instructed
conversation everyone
So did ate them
voted night
terms liked best
tell father
morning breakfast
It Scott Carpenter
It amazing time
They’d fun father
tests do and…
But obviously respect there
I think tests Dr
Lovelace’s place Albuquerque there
uh certainly tests
trying
And it’s difficult pick one
figure openings
human body
far ’em…
You gave away
Now answer
toughest you that’s it
The cookie cutters Cookiecutter males
And cookiecutter means
difference religion
state origin anything
They exactly same
My father felt strongly having
group women astronauts
If you’re pioneer start
instincts I guess
He felt women
definite role space
were physically
emotionally attributes
stronger
male astronauts’
And wanted test capability
comparing test results
test results male astronauts
Clearly
women life
catapulted action
relationship Jackie Cochran
I’m Jacqueline Cochran I
like woman space
Anyone who’s spent time air
I 34 years
bound yearn
little bit farther
Jackie Cochran godmother
And…
Floyd Odlum actually
board directors
I think president
He original chairman board
Lovelace Clinic
So turned Floyd Odlum Jackie
financed study
This program
Dr Lovelace own
outside contract NASA…
invited 25 women
come physical exam
similar
astronauts taking
They list
pilots knew
And called
Jerrie Cobb
She great gal
I asked Dr Lovelace
General Flickinger
woman
astronaut tests
This 1959
Both come
scientific meeting Moscow
At time heard Russians
gonna train women cosmonauts
And years ago
So thought ought
start something
They asked I
woman undergo astronaut test
I was couldn’t yes fast enough
then
Now I knew Jerrie
flew Aero Commander
She lot flying
She flew lot South America
And I knew life
I knew Jerrie Cobb yeah
She good pilot
But I think I fly
could
She think so
I think I could’ve
Why Western program
think need
feel need
women space
Well it’s thing as
need men space
I mean we’re going send
human space
send qualified
And certain areas women lot
offer areas men do
I think ought use both
Jerrie I Oklahoma
I Fort Sill
She called said
Do want astronaut
I said Absolutely
I knew Wally
And Wally took aside time
having competition
said I’m secret program
It’s astronaut program
it’s secret
And I thought That sounds like fun
I think I want involved that
So here’s letter
Dr Lovelace saying
I’m physically fit I’m pilot
I’d like participate
tests
And here’s letter back
And encloses card
outlines qualifications
women astronauts
First thing ask is
What total flying hours
I tell ’em that
Then wanna know total jet hours
aircraft flown hours each
balloon flights parachute jumps
hours flown 20000 feet
hours flown 30000 feet
hours flown 40000 feet
lowpressure chamber indoctrination
explosive decompression experience
partial pressure suit experience
I answer number one
Yeah None qualification
She engineer
We subjects tested
B list
This
fit was
I mean was…
finest professional pilots
country bar none men women
They contacted me I
And I guess knew I flying
talked it
I tour Europe were
kind of rumors background
going
names asked for
And thing I knew
I got phone call
I went boss
I said I’ve invited
astronaut physical exam
My boss said We spare you
So I quit job
this tests
I youngest
Second Jerrie
maybe third February ’61
There phases
astronaut testing
Phase Lovelace Clinic
Albuquerque
My parents drove
sign in
We went singly pairs
And I went Janey Hart
marvelous person
Janey Hart know
weren’t supposed children
Janey Hart eight
They curious
invited in
So I went together
We together
It took days
And incredible
didn’t know
think bodies
outer atmospheres
going react
The testing arduous
It thorough long hours
It little bit thorough
physical examinations
You’d run test test
We pulmonary function tests…
Some ’em not not uh
real friendly body
…total body determination tests…
 Some ’em kind exotic
 Every tooth taken pictures
Some ’em kind strange
Every bone body Xray
They xrayed xrayed xrayed
They gave cups
said Urine said Stool
I having fun
I kinda laughed stuff
I said I don’t know stool is
A stool me
I sitting stool

Oh A stool
bathroom
I said You don’t want that you
I’ll tell confidentially
don’t tell anybody this
enema morning
I said Wow
There oddball things

They inject water
tendegree water ears
that’s body
not… function
You control body
Oh yeah I remember that Yeah
I didn’t like it I it
What gals
ugly
Really tests
stood much
Shortly I left Jacqueline Cochran
coming interview too
And taken tests
going
results tests told me
And I believe told me
She’s gonna happy this
So wasn’t gonna able
program
I think kind downer her
She old I think point
considered spaceflight
Those aren’t issues her
Would like
Mercury astronaut astronautte
I like very be
I don’t think age thing
long you’re healthy vigorous
I’m that After I got
yesterday know I did
 No what
 Went played 18 holes golf
cooked dinner
The day
told I passed
And meant great deal me
It nice
doctors said
I tests
Remarkably know
having pregnancies
body wouldn’t quit
It great
And 23ish girls taken
13 passed
Later B sat
Randy Lovelace
absolutely thrilled
women far done
I following it Of course I
following Russians doing
When Yuri Gagarin went up
know
phenomenal thing happen
That huge event
All conscious it
All conscious
competition Russia
Soviet Union time
So was space race

scientific adventure hook
My memories are
Why can’t Americans it
This feeling time
The Russians basically crowing
clearly advance
space program
Our Mercury men prepared
basically compete
Three… two… one… zero
Liftoff
All right now
Liftoff clock started
Yes sir Reading loud clear
This Freedom 7  The fuel go
They strapped seat
sent brought down
And Whoopee I am
I it I didn’t fly it
Phase Oklahoma City
I stayed Jerrie’s house
And psychological tests
I heard test
submerged tank water and
long period time
lost normal senses
That interesting experiment
isolate
tank warm water
The tank great big room
They
earplugs ears
And I foam rubber
small back
I lay water
long possible
So I water I
comfortable I spreadeagle out
And I thought
There’s wrong here
I splashed water
couldn’t feel it
Splashed face couldn’t feel water
Couldn’t feel anything
She interesting
sensory deprivation chamber
socalled women
perfectly happy forever
men couldn’t it
They started crawling skin
You sort feel nothing
It’s relaxing I it
peaceful
I’d schedule
I went there
So I sort welcomed rest
set record
staying half hours
But people
average uh mature person
hours this
starts hallucinations
What’s gone
temperature water
humidity room…
exact body temperature
feel weightless situation
laying water
This thought
space travel like
So I lay there
I think I fell asleep
maybe minute so
I thinking
wonderful
feel lightness
It freedom
You look up stars…
moon sun
And wonder How work
I didn’t answers
But I thinking this
Floating stars
objective
The testing
Pensacola Florida navy
We going
time 13 us
It time
meet other
This letter Jacqueline Cochran
See Dr Randolph Lovelace II
Lovelace Foundation
notified invitation
Pensacola Florida
a series tests
start September 18 1961
I strongly urge go
We gonna jet orientation
We gonna centrifuge
There gonna lots
neat things gonna happen
Flying jets
oh looking forward that
They given tickets
time Everything set up
We supposed report
on I think Monday
I remember B Steadman telling
golf clubs packed
That’s NASA got wind it
They didn’t know
Dr Lovelace’s program
Regret advise
arrangements Pensacola canceled
Probably possible
carry program
You return expense advance allotment
Lovelace Foundation
Here’s one
Miss Cobb informed
Washington unable
reverse decision
postponing Florida testing
I’m sorry short notice
unavoidable
When results
thought superior men
tell
thought cool
took results Washington
They said
We need women astronauts
Forget it
There certainly great desire
NASA
In fact I’m confident
surprised terribly surprised
fact
women succeeded did
They want program
pure simple
Said biggest
slap face he’d had
I mean be… pretty devastating
It heartbreaking me…
I wanted pursue this
But kept getting letters
Jerrie Cobb
Keep hopes
Keep aviation
Maybe program reinstated
on
Shortly after
I airport
lot helicopter training
I decided
I think I’ll learn too
All men jealous woman
flying helicopter
And they’d park
real close hangar
And I little afraid
hover
But I kind mind
I didn’t care
I going fighting
Well I disappointed
But time I decided I
like flight instructing
different kind flying
So I went
work Beech Aircraft Corporation
And getting ready introduce
new model airplane named Musketeer
There women United
States flying aircraft manufacturers
’em Jerrie Cobb
flying Aero Commander
The Joyce Case
flying Beech Aircraft
They getting ready
introduce Musketeer
They gonna fly ’em
48 contiguous states 90 days
uh introducing airplane
And course
pilots female
we’ll lot free publicity
And I tell flew
dress high heels
We workin’ hard
We flyin’ flyin’ flyin’
We got flying formation
We knew flying formation
started out
But days it
got pretty good it
We 80 changes
airplane year
So test pilots
No question that
I hired right tests
California
Center Aviation
I bought Stearman
I taught acrobatics
I love I flying
I love I acrobatics
It fabulous free
You’re attached gravity
Earth
You want do
And that’s I feel
that’s I think
Freedom
I dream space
I wanna there
That’s me
How I gonna there
I imagine
I’m jet I person
I’m spirit going up
Roger
 Fifteen seconds
 Good Lord ride way
In Godspeed John Glenn
Glenn
orbit The American
Roger Cape go I go
Our capsule good shape
And let’s face it you’re
going untested system
Nobody knows
what’s going happen
Roger Zero G I feel fine
Capsule turning around
Oh view tremendous
So I Glenn credit courage
I credit courage
Uh Friendship 7 Cape
Do read
This Friendship 7
A real fireball outside
At time I women
credit courage
Their willingness
unknown
equally strong
courageous men
About time
Jerrie contacted women said
Okay Let’s Let’s noise
they’ve cheated
letting Pensacola
testing
So secret out
Jerrie Cobb Janey Hart figured
Senate committee
program reinstated
Janey Hart political clout
My father elected Senate
having
lieutenant governor Michigan
Janey Jerrie Cobb felt
Congress ought tell NASA
Now let’s this Let’s this
Both Miss Cobb Mrs Hart
agreeable
begin questioning
Janey started opening statement
I strongly believe women
role space research
In fact it’s inconceivable
world outer space
restricted men only
like sort stag club
A years ago
inconceivable
women serve
hospital attendants
Their essentially frail
emotional structure
stand horrors
military dressing station
Finally agreed
allow women try it
provided middleaged ugly
ugly women presumably having
strength character
I submit Mr Chairman
woman space today
preposterous
woman field hospital
years ago
Mrs Hart
you’re mother children
Do think it’ll difficult
woman astronaut family
In order Uh
 Well I’m asking that Which order
 Um
Well I’ve accomplished
production children
process raising them
I’ve able acquire
2000 hours flying time
considerable aeronautical experience
help husband uh
campaigns forth
So indicates I’ve able
constructive use time
outside of of uh having children
And I don’t think family life
sacrificed bit
You probably ask children
feel it
For her kids
years work
idea going space
I think great challenge
They asked her Why wanna
moon This paper
And said With kids
you’d want moon too
All right Miss Cobb Do
prepared statement Miss Cobb Yes
We women pilots
want space exploration
trying join
battle sexes
We seek place
nation’s space future
discrimination
We ask citizens nation
allowed participate
seriousness sincerity
making history now
women past
No nation sent female
space
We offer 13 women pilot volunteers
Miss Cobb think women
discriminated
space program
I don’t think necessarily
they’re discriminated against
I think rules
established
makes makes impossible
women meet
qualifications astronauts
The hypedup
qualifying catch22 course
test pilots
jetcertified pilots
fighter pilots cases
So qualification
women had
But course couldn’t
weren’t allowed
jet fighter pilots
There law
Eisenhower law
women fly military aircraft
men
I don’t think
astronauts because uh uh
I don’t men mature women
I think should I think women
equal right men
qualify like go
trained sent
Yes I do Because they’re well
they’re lighter small and…
Well I think ought be
 And opinion
 No I disagree I think that uh
I don’t think women physically fit
astronauts
I certainly think
women astronauts
If they’re physically fit mentally alert
they’re different men are
In fact women
going psychiatrists men
gives idea
mental capabilities
The people held hearing
awe astronauts
came spoke testified
Scott Carpenter John Glenn
gave point view
John Glenn hero He God
Space God
Oh John Glenn Yes
Not family’s
favorite characters
certainly Mother’s
John Glenn statement
It’s fact
The men fight wars
fly airplanes
come
help design build test them
The fact women
field
fact social order
He said that If women prove
theyre better men
we’ll welcome open arms
cheers multitude
Yeah right
But women
better qualified yourself
welcome program
They welcome
Can imagine woman flying jet
flying dangerous aircraft
Oh Goodness gracious no
But Jacqueline Cochran flown jets
She’d shattered kinds records
She access jets
husband Floyd Odlum
building jets
air force
So proved women
fly jets
When finally came hearing
congressional hearing testified
Of course Floyd Odlum Jackie Cochran
large supporters
Lovelace Foundation
So I didn’t hope
This great
Oh boy
All right So I’m reading
testimony Jacqueline Cochran
The manned spaceflights
extremely expensive
urgent national interests
therefore selecting astronauts
natural proper
sift group male pilots
proven
aircraft testing
highspeed precision flying
experienced
competent qualified
meet possible emergencies
new environment
From I told
newspapers
want
slow program
going to
necessity
waste great deal money
large group women in
lose marriage
I stunning
Why Why Jacqueline Cochran this
She basically knocked
women space program
How stomached then I don’t know
The shocking thing
hearings
felt like Jackie turned us
Janey Jerrie counted Jackie Cochran
supporting them
And Jackie Cochran
thought gonna do
 That shock Yeah
 Yeah shock
Jacqueline Cochran sort of…
Now
worked military
And Jackie convinced brass
generals
tried push now
going bad effect
program
In fact stop program
Well I think that’s ludicrous
bought in
And took testimony
I sent got
I going approved
chief staff air force
chief naval operations
army
little note said
This I’m gonna say
But don’t agree it
I’ll try avoid testifying
I won’t anything
Jackie Cochran feminist
In mind definition feminist
champions
promotes women
Jackie champion Jackie
I think Jackie
13 program
entire demeanor entire testimony
said
hearing different
After that Vice President Johnson
canceled program
The women well
There classic letter
signed Lyndon Johnson
And said
This program stop now
signed it
His words were Stop now
Lyndon Johnson supposedly
supposedly said
well know
women periods
I wish tampon box
fly
fly you’re having period
It typical day age
men judged women
There number ways
achieving
wanted achieve
I think
boys wanting
light taken away them
heroes time
One beautiful woman astronaut
dominated news…
extent
seven feel
What gone wrong
where’s money
If gentlemen denied Mercury 13
comfortable skin
behaved differently
But underneath all
it’s little boy who’s afraid
We know didn’t happen
And goes issue of…
uh prejudice
good oldfashioned prejudice
 Of course prejudiced
 It good old boy network
And thing
good old girl network
I disappointed
’cause I knew I well and
But didn’t like that didn’t
like people it
So end one
Years years later
Jackie admitted embarrassed
regretful…
somewhat ashamed told so
In order beat Russians moon
catch them
When think happen
expect
space mission be
A little difficult pinpoint
stand race
opposition
cloakanddagger type secrecy
don’t know they’re doing
You don’t know you’re racing against
You don’t idea mission
Supposed soon
None all I secret information
I read newspapers
Valentina
Russian wished
American
helped program
It bold
climb vehicles
shoot space
happens next
Valentina sport parachutist
We seen
pilot selected
But fact woman
going space
breakthrough
and uh wewe admired much
It huge
propaganda victory Russians again
B sat thought
stupid men were
The Russians
woman cosmonaut
Is room space programs
woman astronaut
opinion sir
Well woman the
second actually second
orbital MercuryAtlas had
We woman up
type woman
flown instead chimpanzee
Now
Mother angry
Really angry Yeah
Yes was
And stayed way actually
This termination program
began direction
radicalized
Mother
founding members NOW
National Organization Women
She’d invited
result hearings
She hammered women’s rights
day night
week week month month
almost um point of
Here goes again
That’s small step woman…
giant leap womankind
You’ve got 15 minutes
want driving LEM over
Okay
We’ll work
Sarah need sample here
Going moon
points ’60s

share pride
It’s great ride
Steering’s little tricky though
But imagine telling
significant
woman step moon
It
seriously missed opportunity
This
changed lives hugely
Not terms of know
little girls getting engineering degrees
moving positions real power…
implementing practices policies
represented
humanitarian component woman
know
opposed bellicose boys
It amazing
positive impact…
empowering women general
overcoming notion
women
men country
I liked
walked moon
I loved
American flag crust moon…
saluted it…
pick rocks boy
rocks worth lot today…
assignments
done
I would’ve loved it
I could’ve walked it I could’ve
kicked out I could’ve dust
Because I know guys did
I could’ve did
I grew Elmira New York
interesting thing Elmira
it’s location
National Soaring Museum
So I child
I’d watch gliders land
And I wondered
What like I there
So I started thinking child
maybe I fly someday
As I got older
I decided I wanted astronaut
But I don’t remember thinking
I can’t I’m man
It like
Well I’m going astronaut
I’ll woman astronaut
The air force opened flight training
women 1976
I class women pilots
air force
went right college
And test program
So knew failed
women wouldn’t continue fly
So I tried very hard
I wasn’t gonna date anybody
I wasn’t gonna crazy social life
Because important
best pilot I be
I loved air force
Absolutely loved it
But I told
I wanted astronaut…
I knew gonna tell
I couldn’t it
I flying
I came squadron…
yellow note
hanging bulletin board
And said Call NASA
I go This it
They’re gonna tell I’m out
John Young answered phone
He astronaut walked
moon Apollo program
The thing said was
Do want astronaut
I said Uh…
yes
So went long
narrative I gonna
Johnson Space Center
He said Do questions
I said Yes Am I gonna pilot
mission specialist
And said You’re gonna pilot
You’re gonna woman
pilot space shuttle
Thanks
Mr President Mrs Clinton
Administrator Goldin
I can’t tell honor
today
I think it’s important
I point I didn’t alone
There’s women
century
gone
taken skies
Um barnstormers
women air force
The women military air force
service pilots World War II
Mercury women
early 1960s
went the
All tough medical testing
All women
role models inspiration
I couldn’t today them
I’d like special thankyou
them
The Mercury 13 women heroes mine
We bond
pilots
So I invited launch
Well NASA
going on women were
NASA took list
VIP list
When Eileen Collins went up
uh I got call
invited come launch
They press conference whatever
astronauts
stage large hall
They Eileen microphone
Before else said
I like recognize
Mercury 13
And pointed them
She said Would stand up
And read names
And said
If Mercury 13
I today
They gracious outgoing
us nicer
But I forget that
astronauts
stood clapped us
We booster ignition
liftoff Columbia
reaching new heights women
Xray astronomy
This Columbia In roll
we’ve got fuel cell… number one
Roger roll Columbia
We’re looking it
And lot meaning us
know Eileen
especially watch
head sky
Just love it thinking
She’s driver’s seat
That woman driver’s seat
We felt redeemed
like mission vain
We started people thinking that
Yes women this
And Houston you’re seeing
actual moment deploy there
switch deploy
it’s quiet
When I talk future
space exploration
things
I tell young people nowadays is
Of 12 people walked moon
men
But function culture
world
1960s
You woman
walk moon
wanna astronaut
That’s message I tell young people
Maybe person walk Mars
woman
We got Eileen We got girls
A lot ’em engineers
Some pilots
This I speak
youngsters today
Get STEM program
Get engineering degree
Go NASA
And space
Get flying
Be airline pilot
Be flight instructor
If that’s wanna be it
’Cause that’s I love
