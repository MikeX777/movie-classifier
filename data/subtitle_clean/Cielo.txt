No sees
astronomers life
People imagine
look
were famous
Everything perfect
works fine
But here
theres
clouds clouds
I dont think clear up
Its depressing
And minutes
doesnt clear
Should switch light
calibration
So spectrum
Im curious this
Im missing two
No theyre there
See Here here
And little ones
between
Those two
I think its like this
I thought wed lost star
second there
Those physicists
minds
overwhelmed
nature se
We think
time
Maybe think
time
I dont spend life
thinking it
But its striking
You dont need sky
understand
big nature is
How wise is
How information
fail notice
An atom
universe itself
Your work constantly
watching sky
It extraordinary
I think
watch sky
I mean moment
look
profundity tranquility
realize
sky there
My God things
there
I believe realization
happens
looks sky
It hits time
look sky
I cant fathom
human look
genuinely amazed
Does happen you
Yes
Does happen
time look sky
I think so
Or when
Every time
I look sky here
I dont know express it
The silence
The beauty
In Chile its like
touch sky
And stars
I´m inspired mountains
care earth
They remind images
I seen Mars
desert
They
life there
theres life now
For astronomer
I earthcentred
I like physics
I spiritual person
I dont look stars
profound thoughts
I look stars
I think
earth
Look wars
People hungry
People homeless
People cant work
support families
And look insignificant
are
We absolutely nothing
We tiny immensity
universe
Why live
like this
Instead living harmony
helping other
Trying
progress humanity
positive way
things better
Not kill other
I think
amusing analogy
Human beings
equivalent
ants living ants nest
The ants food
bring nest
And ant comes
looks around
I wonder thinking
I mean I dont believe
ant thinks
ant see
For us
observers universe
its kind same
We ants
looking telescope
But universe
happen see
Or
capable seeing
An ant fathom
lives planet
round
mountains etcetera
And kind same
Like ants look
see
cant grasp
immensity universe
When I speak people

Some people exist

I slept well
Lets light campfire okay
Did out I sleeping
The scientists
dust stars
And offspring
treading footsteps
Yet Ive seen dust
deep beneath ground
Toiling
air heavy like stone
Sometimes I want
stare wideeyed star
She shines far away
desolate land
My search gold fruitless
I search I answer
But I think
theres truehearted star
Singing sky
That pretty pale blue light
hide
An impossible dream
shaped time star
She shines brighter gold
remains sleepless
I want near
Star mine Isabela
This music feels right
planet
Whats planet
The planet mine
A Swiss group discovered it
Its called WASP 4
But it
We Golem
What sunsets like there
Apparently considering clouds
now
sunrise sunset planet
white
If planet
notice change
Maybe wouldnt know
day night
Lets WASP 50
We watching star
time
What happen planet
cross it
So brightness star
fairly constant
suddenly diminish
We eclipse now
planet eclipses star
So decrease light
bring information
planets atmosphere
And light star
travel
way us
Each ray light created
centre star
This chaotic
Protons colliding protons
generating new elements
From chaos
ray light escapes
Now ray light
leaving centre star
takes millions
hundreds thousands years
exit star
reaches atmosphere
It crazy
storms circling around
It goes
planets atmosphere
leaves
easily travels
hundreds years space
meets pale blue dot
Earth
The light continues travel
reaches telescope
It goes inside bouncing
entire optical system
That light transformed
current
Thats goes computer
Its analyze
I magical
We observe light arrives
passes telescope
We analyze right away
We eclipse right away
Its incredible
In imagination
I eclipse directly
I imagine exactly
happening
rather happened
case
It hundreds thousands
lightyears away
happened
hundreds thousands years ago
But seeing now
We seeing information
reach real time
planet
passes star
I think Im flying stars
Because I beautiful moon
It
earth far away
In days
animals speak
Fox walking hill
And Fox met Condor
carrying guitar
Condor said Fox
We invited

Life death
Man pure dust
Among tracks
Needn´t sky

One metre surplus
One metre extra below
COCKTAIL OK
Okay cheers
Cheers
Yes light
Out focus however
He happy
camera working
Everyone seat
Just moment please
Id like toast
As scientists know
questions
One question leads another
Theres infinity questions
It wont surprise tonight
I question
What true connection
sky
One time
First things first
To sky
Which nourishes
quenches thirst
Thats wisdom earth
He didnt it
What mean
That sky nourishes us
Yes
Well
So youre exoplanet hunter
But mean
Its like science fiction
And chase planets
Why matter us
Planet hunting resonates
public
raises fundamental
questions origins
here
And questions connected
habitat earth
existence
similar worlds
maybe life elsewhere
So explain people
looking planets
life elsewhere
obviously resonates profoundly
These ageold questions
wondered
point another
And often think
look sky
And thats its connected
understanding sky
We feel renewed
watch sky
forget weve learned
We immensity us
terms distance
Of course people trouble
understanding huge distances
But theres immensity
possibilities
In sky imagination
takes flight
possible
Everything opens minds
important
catalyst growth
Historically
sky level
And understanding sky
whats sky
thats second level
For me
thats astrophysics is
Its scientific explanation
wanderings
imagination
screen sky
If want planet
discover

light years away
10000 years
there
10000 years there
So people sleep
wake arrive
were starting
science fiction
Ive loved
I love
Or create
like Noahs ark
We send families
future generation arrive
