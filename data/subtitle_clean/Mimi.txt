Hey Bikaneri chick slick
Lost house you
And Im lose job too
Hey Romeos

Innocent looking deceptive

Hey Romeos worthless boyos
Stop bothering me

You stolen hearts

This isnt right love
You look like Mona Lisa
And like mesmerising Lolita

From head toe absolute beauty
You supersupersuper

I like wild wind
I long way ahead me
I interested gems jewels
I interested chasing dreams
I dreams coming true
I dont want men chasing me

This isnt right love
You look like Mona Lisa

And like mesmerising Lolita
And like mystery
You supersupersuper

Hey Bikaneri chick slick
Lost house you
And Im lose job too
Looking curves
My heart starts race
Like hands clock
going hickory dickory dockery
