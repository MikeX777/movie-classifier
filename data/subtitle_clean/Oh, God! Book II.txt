LET ME
LET ME TELL YOU
A LITTLE STORY
THERE WAS THIS TIGER
IN THE JUNGLE
AND HE GOT A THORN
IN HIS PAW
IT WAS VERY PAINFUL
THIS LITTLE CAT
SAW THIS
AND PULLED THE THORN
OUT OF HIS PAW
THIS MADE THE TIGER
VERY HAPPY
THE CAT SAYS IVE
DONE YOU A FAVOR
YOU DO ME ONE
THE TIGER SAYS
ANYTHING
THE CAT SAYS
WHENEVER IM
IN THE JUNGLE
IM SCARED
OF THE ANIMALS
THE TIGER SAYS
NO PROBLEM
WHEN YOU WALK
THROUGH THE JUNGLE
HOLD YOUR HEAD UP
SHAKE IT
WAG YOUR TAIL
AND THEYLL THINK
YOURE A TIGER
THE LITTLE CAT
GOT AWAY WITH IT
FOR THREE YEARS
ONE DAY SHE MET
THE TIGER
SHE WAS
SHAKING HER HEAD
WAGGING HER TAIL
THE TIGER SAYS
YOU DONT HAVE TO
SHAKE AND WAG AT ME
I KNOW
YOURE A CAT
THATS IT
THATS IT
WHATS THAT
HAVE TO DO WITH ME
NOTHING
ITS A CUTE STORY
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT
CHEER YOU UP
THATS BETTER
YOUVE BEEN SEPARATED
SEVEN MONTHS RIGHT
YES
FROM WHAT YOUVE SAID
TRACYS CONTACTS
WITH GOD
USUALLY TAKE PLACE
IN EATING AREAS
THE CHINESE RESTAURANT
McDONALDS
AN ICE CREAM CART
THEYVE ALL TAKEN PLACE
SINCE YOU MR RICHARDS
LEFT THE HOUSE
FOLLOWING YOUR SEPARATION
SO OBVIOUSLY
TRACY HAS CREATED
A FANTASY FATHER FIGURE
AS A SUBSTITUTE
TO GIVE HER
THE EMOTIONAL NURTURING
SHE CRAVES
FROM HER MISSING FATHER
ARE YOU SURE
ONE IS NEVER
COMPLETELY SURE
BUT THERES SOMETHING ELSE
YOU SAID
THATS VERY INTRIGUING
TRACYS FANTASY FATHER
GOD
LIKE HER REAL FATHER
IS INTERESTED IN ADVERTISING
OR SPREADING A MESSAGE
SO TO SPEAK
WELL THATS TRUE

ONLY THEORIES
ILL HAVE TO GIVE TRACY
A SERIES OF TESTS
TO VERIFY THEM

OF ANY ORGANIC DISTURBANCE
IN TRACY
OH WELL THATS GOOD
HOWEVER THE EVALUATION

TRACY IS STILL
STEADFASTLY INSISTING

IVE BEEN BROADCASTING
FOR OVER FOUR DECADES
AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN
A PHENOMENON
LIKE THE ONE
THATS GOING ON TODAY
14 DAYS AGO
THIS LITTLE SCHOOLGIRL
FROM WEST LOS ANGELES
CALIFORNIATRACY RICHARDS
DECIDED TO WRITE THINK GOD
ON THIS SIDEWALK
SHE GOT SOME SCHOOL FRIENDS
TO HELP HER OUT
AND THIS THING
HAS REALLY SPREAD
ON FENCES
ON BUMPER STICKERS
AND LOOK AT THIS
AND THIS
AND IF YOU THINK THATS
SOMETHING THERES MORE
LONDON
FROM BUCKINGHAM PALACE
TO PICCADILLY SQUARE
EVERYWHERE
LONDONERS GO TODAY
THEY ARE REMINDED
TO THINK GOD
PARIS
SPEAKING FRENCH
TOKYO
SPEAKING JAPANESE
CAIRO
SPEAKING ARABIC
NOW HERE IS
NOTED PSYCHOLOGIST
DR JOYCE BROTHERS
WE SHOULD KEEP
AN OPEN MIND
IF THERE ISNT A GOD
ID LIKE TO POINT OUT
THAT THOSE CHILDREN WHO
EASILY ENGAGE IN FANTASY
WHOVE HAD
AN IMAGINARY PLAYMATE
OR AN IMAGINARY
COMPANION
DO BETTER IN DEALING
WITH THE CRISES OF LIFE
THAN THOSE WHO DIDNT
AND IF THERE IS A GOD
I BELIEVE TRACY RICHARDS
SAW HIM AND SPOKE TO HIM
STRANGELY CHILDREN
OFTEN HAVE
A FIRMER GRIP ON REALITY
THAN MOST ADULTS
AND AS
THE OLD TESTAMENT SAYS
AND A LITTLE CHILD
SHALL LEAD THEM
NOW WE KNOW THE REASON
THE CHURCHES ARE FULL
BUT THE CLASSROOMS
ARE EMPTY
WHEN TRACY RICHARDS
WAS EXPELLED FROM SCHOOL
IT SET OFF A CITYWIDE
STUDENT STRIKE
IT ALSO SET OFF
BITTER CONFRONTATION
BETWEEN SUPERINTENDENT
OF SCHOOLS
JEFFREY HODGES
AND DR JEROME NEWELL
THE PSYCHIATRIST
IN WHOSE CARE
TRACY HAS BEEN PLACED
THE SUPERINTENDENT
WANTS HER BACK IN SCHOOL
BUT DR NEWELL SAYS NO
THE CASE IS BEING HEARD
BY JUDGE THOMAS MILLER
WERE IN A CRISIS
AS SUPERINTENDENT
OF SCHOOLS
ITS
MY RESPONSIBILITY
TO GET THE CHILDREN
BACK INTO CLASS
I WANT A COURT ORDER
TO FORCE DR NEWELL
TO RELEASE
TRACY RICHARDS
SUPERINTENDENT HODGES
IS WRONG YOUR HONOR
SHE DOESNT BELONG
IN SCHOOL
SHES SUFFERING
FROM DELUSIONS
SHE BELONGS WHERE
SHE CAN GET CARE
AND TREATMENT
CHILDREN IMAGINE
LOTS OF THINGS
OUR WHOLE SCHOOL SYSTEM
IS PARALYZED
BECAUSE OF THE PERSONAL
OPINION OF ONE MAN
EXCUSE ME BUT
I DONT INTEND TO RELY
ON THE PERSONAL OPINION
OF ONE MAN SIR
NOW BEFORE I ISSUE
A COURT ORDER DR NEWELL
DO SOMETHING FOR ME
ID LIKE YOU
TO CONVENE A PANEL
OF TOP PSYCHIATRISTS
IN THIS CITY
AND HAVE THEM
THOROUGHLY EXAMINE
THIS POOR LITTLE GIRL
TRACY RICHARDS IS IT
TRACY RICHARDS
AND THEN WHEN THEYVE
MADE THEIR CONCLUSIONS
ILL MAKE MY DECISION
YES I MET HIM
IN MY DADS CAR
HE CAME THROUGH
THE TELEVISION SET
HE GAVE ME ICE CREAM
CHERRY JUBILEE
WE ATE AT McDONALDS
AND ILL SAY IT AGAIN
HE BROUGHT ME HOME
ON HIS MOTORCYCLE
DR WHITLEY
THERES ONE QUESTION
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK
I THINK THERE HAVE BEEN
ENOUGH QUESTIONS
MR AND MRS RICHARDS
IS THERE ANYTHING
THAT YOUD LIKE TO ADD
WELL UH
WHAT CAN WE SAY
NO UH
WED LIKE TO DO
WHATEVERS BEST
FOR TRACY
WOULD YOU THREE
MIND STEPPING INTO
THE WAITING ROOM

I MIGHT ADD DR NEWELL
YOUVE DONE
YOUR USUAL THOROUGH JOB
THANK YOU
MAY I BRING UP A POINT
ID LIKE TO REMIND YOU
THAT THERES A GREAT
DEAL OF SYMPATHY
FOR THAT LITTLE GIRL
MANY CHILDREN
ARE OUT OF SCHOOL
OUR PROFESSION WILL BE
UNDER TREMENDOUS PRESSURE
WE CANT
GIVE IN TO THAT
NO WE CANT
GIVE IN TO THAT
NO WEWE CANT
IF WE LET HER
RUN AROUND
WITH HER DELUSIONS
WHAT DO WE DO
ABOUT THE PATIENT
WHO THINKS
HES NAPOLEON
CERTAINLY
IF SHES RIGHT
THEN UH
WERE ALL WRONG
NO THE GIRL BELONGS
IN AN INSTITUTION
NOW ARE THERE
ANY OBJECTIONS
NO THEN THATS
SETTLED
CARL WOULD YOU BRING
THEM BACK IN PLEASE
THEYRE READY
NOW TRACY
WEVE ALL DECIDED
THAT UH YOU NEED HELP
AND BELIEVE ME ITS
IN YOUR BEST INTEREST
AND THE CHANCES ARE
THAT YOU WONT BE
THERE FOR LONG
IF YOU LOOK AT IT
IN A POSITIVE WAY
IM SURE THAT YOU
Its him
Its God
SORRY IM LATE
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO
MY DISTINGUISHED COLLEAGUES
I WOULDVE BEEN
HERE SOONER
BUT I WAS STUCK
IN TRAFFIC
EXCUSE ME SIR
WHO ARE YOU
DR STEVENS
I DONT RECALL
YOUR BEING INVITED
IF I WAITED
TO BE INVITED
ID MISS A LOT
OF IMPORTANT THINGS
HOWEVER
IN THIS CASE
I THINK
YOURE MISTAKEN
BUT YOUR NAMES
NOT ON THE LIST
YES IT IS
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
WERE ALL
LEARNED PSYCHIATRISTS
WHAT DID THIS LITTLE GIRL DO
THAT WAS SO TERRIBLE
SHE GOT CHILDREN TOGETHER
THEY ALL WROTE
THINK GOD
AND THE WORLD
IS THINKING GOD
IS THAT SO BAD
BUT SIR AS A
LEARNED PSYCHIATRIST
YOU OUGHT TO KNOW
THAT THATS NOT
THE POINT
THIS LITTLE GIRL
CLAIMS
SHE NOT ONLY SAW GOD
AND SPOKE TO HIM
BUT HE SPOKE
TO HER AS WELL
WHO ARE WE TO SAY
THAT SHE DIDNT
MAYBE SHE DID
MAYBE SHE DIDNT
LOOK SIR
WEVE ALL VOTED
I KNOW AND YOU SAID
IF SHES RIGHT
THEN WERE ALL WRONG
WELL
HOW DID YOU KNOW
I SAID THAT
I ALSO READ
TEA LEAVES
LOOK I MEAN
WE ARE COMPETENT
PROFESSIONALS
WE KNOW
OUR BUSINESS
WEVE BEEN OVER
THIS CASE BACKWARDS
AND FORWARDS
AND WE HAVE MADE
OUR DECISION
I WOULDNT WANT THIS
TO GET AROUND
BUT IF WERE
SO COMPETENT
SO RIGHT IN ALL
OUR METHODS AND THEORIES
HOW IS IT SO MANY PEOPLE
IN INSTITUTIONS
NEVER GET OUT
BUT THATS A SITUATION
BEYOND OUR CONTROL
MANY PEOPLE WILL NEVER
BE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH
BETWEEN REALITY
AND ILLUSION
REMEMBER SOMETIMES
ITS VERY DIFFICULT
TO DETERMINE WHAT IS REALITY
AND WHAT IS ILLUSION
FOR INSTANCE
THE UH THE CHANDELIER
NOW THATS REALITY
WE ALL LOOKED UP
WE ALL SAW IT
WE ALL KNOW ITS THERE
BUT IS IT
GASP
GASP
OH MY GOD
IT IS GOD
WHATS THE ILLUSION
AND WHATS THE REALITY
DID THE CHANDELIER
DISAPPEAR OR NOT
WERE ALL
INTELLIGENT PEOPLE
DID WE SEE IT
OR DIDNT WE SEE IT
MAYBE THAT LITTLE GIRL
DID SEE AND TALK WITH GOD
WHERE IS IT WRITTEN
THAT MOSES HAD AN EXCLUSIVE
JUST BECAUSE
WE HAVENT SPOKEN TO GOD
DOESNT MEAN SHE HASNT
I DONT KNOW
WHATS GOING ON
OR WHO YOU ARE
MAYBE A MAGICIAN
OR A HYPNOTIST
BUT THERE ARE SOME
THINGS IM SURE OF
I KNOW THAT WERE ALL
PSYCHIATRISTS HERE
I KNOW IM

OF OURSELVES
IF WE TOLD EVERYBODY
THAT WE SAW
DAY TURN INTO NIGHT
AND NIGHT INTO DAY
THEYD THROW US
OUT OF SCHOOL TOO
SO MAYBE TRACY
