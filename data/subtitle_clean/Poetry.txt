Mom
How there
How lonely it
Is glowing red sunset
Are birds singing
way forest
Can receive
letter I dared send
Can I convey
confession I dared make
Will time pass roses fade
Now its time goodbye
Like wind lingers
goes
like shadows
To promises came
love sealed till end
To grass kissing
weary ankles
And tiny footsteps
following
Its time goodbye
Now darkness falls
Will candle lit again
Here I pray
shall cry
know
deeply I loved
The long wait middle
hot summer day
An old path resembling
fathers face
Even lonesome wild flower
shyly turning away
How deeply I loved
How heart fluttered
hearing faint song
I bless
Before crossing black river
With souls breath
I beginning dream
bright sunny morning
I awake
blinded light
meet you
standing
