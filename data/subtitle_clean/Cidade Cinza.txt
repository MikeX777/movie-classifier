GREY CITY
SÃO PAULO DECEMBER 2008
This city
people
Its cars
robots know
Who routine going
coming work
everyday
thing
And year decide
different
Once year maybe twice
But that
São Paulo beach man
If youre stressed
sea surf little
feel great
But São Paulo concrete
jungle buildings buildings
buildings The
build trees
parks And
buildings
As youre building wall
you know
So escape
runaway these
Or apart it
Thats history
graffiti know
Of picho belong it
And youth talking
Its graffiti
its picho well
A lot people manifesting
talking
The guy cause needs
express himself
Some stuff know
But I think graffiti picho
movements nowadays
young
people talk real
Cause nowadays
settled quiet know
 These people talking
 They occupying buildings
They occupying city
In away another
expressing themselves
questioning something
The guy beating
wants
The city suffocates
need talk
need
it And it
The guy energy
it And fuck it I it
I think guy
took spray scribbled
I dont know
anything street
He
questioning this right
How city used
Not to
display product
sell car
like that
But art right
Its art
person owns
In São Paulo
pretty easy paint
You dont paint
dont want to
Like people
things worry about
look traffic jam
Everybody trying
somewhere think
theyre going worry
painting wall
They want arrive
house job
This Babylon
man chaos
A chaotic city deserves
chaos know
I dont wanna drive

graffiti artists
And work valued
abroad know
The work took abroad
created here
QOSGEMEQOS  PORTUGAL

I think
streets gives power
talk people
Regardless social class
cultural life person not
And talk positive
negative things
Its strong weapon
works image
And image direct language
dont need stop
read listen it
You its
mind already unconsciously
Like subliminal message
I think image street
powerful
If think city
support
And graffiti
manifestation it
Graffiti
interesting things São Paulo
produces considering
chaotic city like São Paulo
graffiti helps composing
chaos itself
When  left Brazil
I thought chaos
negative thing coming
I realized chaos best
thing have
Because thats makes
creative
That Brazilian way
vicious
improvising time
But theres
creativity generosity
I think
graffiti it
What got attention
painting streets
days
Ive met

The ink leaves
spray wall

Spray it
Its different picking
brush painting wall
Spray sort magic
offers you do
If hold spray can
