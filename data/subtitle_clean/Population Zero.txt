It like the
It rehearsed
Im standing outside

Dwayne Nelson
soon moved courthouse

A bizarre triple homicide
murderer immediately
turned
confessed
I cant understand

Nothing
Were live now
He pay murders

Because its so
Senseless random
It shook faith
long time
Cheyenne police
spent months
looking motive
They none
With Dwaynes confession
certain
conviction
There questions
needed answering
I canceled flight home
headed
Cheyenne Wyoming
hearing
took place years ago
I think
regret I is
Is maybe the uh
The overconfidence
were
That thing
A surefire
win us
But I uh
I honestly didnt think
through
I wouldnt arrogant
certainly
like
easy case me
You wanna
feelings it
were talking
confessed murderer here
One showed
remorse regret
We murder weapon
We fingerprints
Security footage
population
screaming justice
And wanted
away life
And time
doubt mind
gonna that
The fact
I got Nelson case
surprise
My first uh
Murder trial
And I knew
gonna big deal
Uh
And big deal
Dwaynes case unique
Okay
What
classic plea pardon case
There logic
motivation
Absolutely none
Which set
insanity plea
I wanted change
location trial
I wanted to uh
Make sure
impartial jury
He wouldnt stand it
The loophole
brought
exactly 24 hours
went hearing
So looked it
We looked it
danced it
conversation
And uh
And looked
legalities it
Then ran it
Will defendant
rise
Based federal
district law
constitution
legal precedent draw from
I choice
defense
Mr Nelson free go
The murder trial
Cheyenne morning
taken
unexpected turn
During todays
preliminary hearing
confessed murderer
Dwayne Nelson
acquitted charges

described
flaw system
an unusual case
And families
understandably shocked
judges decision
Imagine murderer
allowed
walk streets free man
Thats exactly took
place today
I remember
absolute confusion
shock
All hell broke loose
Right It was
Insanity
We werent prepared that
I wasnt prepared that
This guy
away life
It far logic
So far reason
It was was
Beyond justice
And worst
feeling shift
You know cause
like Dwayne
longer bad guy
I was
And
assistants came
gave news initially
So recipients
grief
anger moment
And head team came
explained
happened
The loophole
law changed everything
And prove
murders
premeditated
felony committed
leading murders
crime
tried
You need motive
We need motive
trail

protection
goddamn loophole
We
covered bases
We looked
connection
Dwayne Nelson
murder victims
But wasnt any
Dwayne north Dakota
boys
rapid city
So Dwayne confessed
isolated incident
There motive
We regular
People didnt
understand
half
begin with
And began

state line federal
state
I think assumed
work out
I dont think
understood
ramifications this
I think feeling
certainly me
I know
others
maybe
step
crossing huge hurdle

stick it
appeals
throw
weight this
And weeks
eventually months passed
realized
no No isnt
This isnt changing
This changing
favor
There incredible
anger
I dont feel guilty
adhering constitution
I dont feel guilty
whats right
according law
Right I dont feel guilty
letting man walk
constitution

Im job
The court job
We job this
He walks
Hes supposed walk
Right
Simple
The fuck on
Left main street
Daniel matcek
local yellowstone
newspaper reporter
He covered hearings
spent lot time
researching murders
Its small town
Ive lived

Thank much

Thank you Thank you
I went
courthouse
denied access
records
I told documents
sealed
couldnt tell why
Investigating loophole
however
easier
The constitution
supreme law
citizen living
United States
But constitution
protects
let murderer free
Article three section
constitution
This however clarify
jury
come from
So sixth amendment
written
requiring
jury be
So based constitution
person charged murder
tried
local jury
comes
state district
crime took place
Yellowstone national park
established 1872
recognized
national park world
It predominantly situated
northwest corner
Wyoming
But approximately
percent yellowstone
overflows north Montana
west Idaho
The strip park
located Idaho
law
civil rights collide
Yellowstone park
governed state law
It ruled federal law
So crime committed
park
tried
courthouse
mammoth hot Springs
Or Cheyenne
federal district court
So mean
The jurors drawn
small strip land
approximately
50 square miles
There problem
No lives here
You select jury 12
area
population zero
Hello sir
Can I ask question
Sorry interrupt you
I know youre middle
meal there
But uh
You herd
happen
region
theres uh
supposed
constitutional loophole
near Idaho side
No
Or family
associates
Nothing
Deutsch Speak deutsch
Its right here
So maps right
I think pretty
line here
So here
Is loophole
constitution
And
loophole
constitution
So boundary
kind right there
Most people
hear it
focus simple
matters case
They
Broad strokes
The murders hole
constitution
And understandably so
I mean
boldest parts case
But cant
shouldnt
miss kind
mind boggling things
happened murders
court hearing
All right
Number one
Dwayne turns
voluntarily immediately
Number two
He confesses
rights
representation
legal counsel
Number three
He refuses
plead insanity
Number four refuses
trial
Now add
things up
goes away
triple homicide
say fine
But didnt
He got away it
And
fair trial
reasonable
doubt raised
But
hole constitution
An overlap
Now consider
things again
Without them
goes away
very long time
So youre suggesting
Dwayne knew exactly
doing
Thats exactly
Im suggesting
Of course person
thats gonna know
answer
Dwayne
Why havent
investigations
this
Well thing
swept rug
Its embarrassment
A hole constitution
No I think right people
leaned right places
sure
went away

national uproar
So government basically
helped guilty man free
youre saying
No Im saying
Dwayne helped himself
This cover
happy consequence
