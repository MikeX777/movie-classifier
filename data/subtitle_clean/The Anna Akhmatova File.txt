deadly insulted love
  And country
wants raise lasting monument
I consent fame
With condition place
sea I born 
My ties open seas broken 
Not parkland tree
restless shade haunts vain
But I kept vigil
And locks heedless grief
Lest I forget deaths sleep
How fateful Black Marias rumbled
Or dreadful door crash
Or women wailed like wounded beasts
So melting snow like tears shall drop
unmoving bronzecast eyes
The prison dove shall coo nearby
And watch passing ships Neva
There odd human soul 
Poems greatest
fail author happy
Pushkin knew
He wrote The Bronze Horseman
Yet wasnt happy
But confidence

Pushkin wanted write more
And Akhmatova
Now let warn
time Ill exist
No water well
Nor reed evening star
Nor maple leaves rustling afar
Nor distant tolling bell
I shall trouble people all
I shall disturb sad dreams
As stifled groan wail
