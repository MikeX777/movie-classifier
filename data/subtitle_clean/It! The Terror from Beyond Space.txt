Edward THIS WAS
THE PLANET MARS
AS MY CREW AND I
FIRST SAW IT
DANGEROUS
TREACHEROUS
ALIVE WITH SOMETHING WE
CAME TO KNOW ONLY AS
DEATH
THIS IS WHAT WE FACED
WHEN OUR SPACESHIP
CRACKED UP IN LANDING
JUST SIX MONTHS AGO
IN JANUARY OF
THIS YEAR 1973
BUT IT SEEMS AS IF
SIX CENTURIES PASSED
BEFORE A RESCUE
SHIP ARRIVED
FOR TODAY
OF ALL MY CREW
I COL EDWARD
CARRUTHERS
OF THE UNITED STATES
SPACE COMMAND
AM THE ONLY
ONE ALIVE
NOW I WILL BE GOING BACK TO
FACE MY SUPERIORS ON EARTH
IN WASHINGTON
AND PERHAPS THERE TOO
I WILL FIND ANOTHER
KIND OF DEATH
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
OF THE PRESS
AS YOU KNOW
THE FIRST ATTEMPT
TO SEND A SPACESHIP
TO THE PLANET MARS
WAS MADE 6
MONTHS AGO
WE KNEW THAT
THAT SHIP
THE CHALLENGE 141
HAD REACHED ITS DESTINATION
BUT THATS
ALL WE KNEW
TELERADIO COMMUNICATION
WITH MARS CEASED IMMEDIATELY
AND WE WERE
FORCED TO ASSUME
THAT THE SHIP AND
CREW HAD BEEN LOST
THE MAN IN CHARGE
OF THIS EXPEDITION
WAS A MAN WHO HAD BECOME
KNOWN TO THE WORLD
AS THE FIRST MAN
TO BE SHOT INTO SPACE
THE MAN WHO PIONEERED
INTERPLANETARY SPACE TRAVEL
COL EDWARD
CARRUTHERS
2 MONTHS AGO WE SENT
A SECOND SHIP TO MARS
TO LEARN THE FATE OF
COL CARRUTHERS AND HIS CREW
THE PRESIDENT HAS ASKED ME
TO PASS ON TO YOU
THIS SIGNIFICANT NEWS
COL EDWARD CARRUTHERS
HAS BEEN FOUND ALIVE ON MARS
BUT THERE IS A TRAGIC SIDE
TO THIS HISTORYMAKING EVENT
COL CARRUTHERS WAS
THE SOLE SURVIVOR
OF THIS FIRST
EXPEDITION
1 HOUR AGO WE RECEIVED A
TELERADIO COMMUNICATION
FROM COL VAN HEUSEN
COMMANDER OF THE
SECOND SPACESHIP
THIS SHIP IS NOW
READY TO TAKE OFF
FOR ITS RETURN TRIP TO
THE EARTH FROM MARS
AND COL CARRUTHERS
IS BEING BROUGHT BACK
FOR A COURTMARTIAL
TO FACE TRIAL FOR THE MURDERS
OF THE REST OF THE CREW
Edward THE RESCUE SHIP IS
READY TO RETURN TO EARTH
I AM TO SPEND THE NEXT
4 MONTHS WITH STRANGERS
A CREW OF MEN AND
WOMEN WHO HAVE
BUT ONE SINGLE PURPOSE
TO SEE THAT I FACE
A MILITARY FIRING SQUAD
Rhythmic mechanical whirl
THE EMERGENCY AIR LOCK
IN C COMPARTMENT
HAS BEEN LEFT OPEN
WHAT GIVES
SORRY SIR
THAT WAS ME
I WAS DUMPING SOME EMPTY
CRATES OVERBOARD A WHILE AGO

WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING ABOUT
THOSE 9 BODIES
YOU LEFT DOWN THERE
YES
BUT I DIDNT
KILL THEM
STILL STICKING TO YOUR STORY
ABOUT A MYSTERIOUS CREATURE
DO YOU EXPECT A
COURTMARTIAL
TO BELIEVE IT
ITS ALL I CAN TELL THEM
I WISH WE COULDVE STAYED
AND SEARCHED FOR THE BODIES
HOWEVER THERES STILL
ENOUGH EVIDENCE
TO PUT YOU IN FRONT
OF A FIRING SQUAD
YOU HONESTLY BELIEVE ID
MURDER 9 OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS
IN ORDER TO
SURVIVE ON MARS
ISNT IT LOGICAL
COLONEL
THE CHALLENGE 141
CRACKS UP IN LANDING
YOU KNOW YOURE
MAROONED INDEFINITELY
ON MARS UNTIL
ANOTHER SHIP IS SENT
IF ANOTHER SHIP IS SENT
YOU KNOW THE FOOD
AND SUPPLIES ABOARD
WOULD LAST THE ENTIRE
CREW ONLY A YEAR
BUT THEYD LAST YOU 10 YEARS
IF THE OTHERS WERE DEAD
THOSE PEOPLE WERE
KILLED BY SOMETHING
NOT ME
I WANT TO SHOW YOU ANOTHER
SOMETHING CARRUTHERS
AFTER YOU
AT LEAST I APPRECIATE
THE FREEDOM OF A SHIP
WHY NOT CAN YOU THINK
OF A BETTER PRISON
ARENT YOU AFRAID ILL MURDER
YOU ALL IN YOUR SLEEP
EITHER LT CALDER OR MYSELF
WILL BE WITH YOU
EVERY SECOND
OF THE TRIP
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS
WE BROUGHT THE DENTAL RECORDS
OF THE FIRST CREW FROM EARTH
THIS IS FRANK KENNER
KENNER
WE FOUND IT NEAR
THE CHALLENGE 141
THE DAY AFTER
WE FOUND YOU
THERES ONLY ONE KIND OF
A MONSTER THAT USES BULLETS
THE SECOND
WE HIT EARTH
IM GONNA JUMP
THROUGH THAT AIR LOCK
ALL THE WAY
TO THE GROUND
THEN IM GONNA ROLL AROUND AND
STRETCH LIKE A CAT IN THE SUN
OH BOY
THE SUN
WELL BE 50 MILLION
MILES CLOSER TO IT
EVEN WHEN I WAS A KID I COULD
NEVER STAND BEING COLD
HOWD YOU EVER WIN THE
ARDMORE FELLOWSHIP
IN LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS
I WORE LONG UNDERWEAR
HA HA HA
AAH
THAT FIGURES
WHAT DO YOU
LOOK FORWARD TO
GIRLS
OH YOU
I THINK I REMEMBER
A FASCINATING RESEARCH
WONT A
GEOLOGIST DO
YOURE UH MILITARY
PROPERTY ANN
OCCUPIED TERRITORY
EVERY TIME VAN
SEES YOU HE FLOATS
EVEN THOUGH THE
SHIP IS EQUIPPED
WITH ARTIFICIAL
GRAVITY
Chuckling
THESE DAYS VAN SEEMS MORE
CONCERNED OVER A MANHUNT
THAN A WOMAN HUNT
ITS JUST THAT ERIC BELIEVES
CARRUTHERS STORY I DONT
I DONT BELIEVE IT
NECESSARILY
NOR DO I
DISBELIEVE IT
HOWEVER ONE THINGS SURE
HE DOES BELIEVE IT
HE HAD TO FORCE HIMSELF TO
BELIEVE IT OR HED GO INSANE
AND I DIDNT
DO THAT DID I
MISSED YOUR DINNER
COL CARRUTHERS
IM TIRED OF
RUINING APPETITES
ID JUST LIKE A COFFEE
IF I MAY MISS ANDERSON
OF COURSE
COLONEL
BETTER STAY HERE
CARRUTHERS
JIMMY
YEAH
HERES SOME LASTMINUTE
COMPUTATIONS
ON ADJUSTING
THE ORBIT
LOOK EM OVER WHEN
YOU GET A CHANCE
YES SIR
BY THE TIME WE
REACH EARTH
ILL HAVE HIS
CONFESSION ON TAPE
COL CARRUTHERS
THANK YOU
SUCH A COLD DESOLATE WORLD
WE SAW SO LITTLE OF IT
SOMETIMES I ALMOST
WANT TO BELIEVE YOU
I KILLED THEM OR I DIDNT
IT WAS ME OR SOMETHING
IVE ONLY HEARD THE
STORY THROUGH VAN
NOW YOUD LIKE TO
HEAR MY VERSION
ALL RIGHT
ITS A LONG STORY
BUT ILL MAKE IT BRIEF
WE WERE ALL
OUTSIDE THE SHIP
EXPLORING THE SOUTHERN TIP
OF SYRTIS MAJOR
SUDDENLY A SANDSTORM CAME UP
AND WE STARTED BACK
I WAS DRIVING
THE JEEP
THE SAND WAS SO THICK
WE COULD BARELY SEE
WE WERE ALMOST BACK
TO THE SHIP WHEN
CARTWRIGHT
JUST DISAPPEARED
ONE MINUTE HE WAS THERE AND
THE NEXT MINUTE HE WAS GONE
AS IF SOMETHING HAD JUST
PLUCKED HIM OUT OF THE JEEP
LIKECANDY OUT OF A BOX
WE HEARD A WEIRD
SORT OF SOUND
THEN WE THOUGHT
WE SAW A DARK SHAPE
RUNNING NEAR THE JEEP
AND STARTED SHOOTING AT IT
A FEW MOMENTS LATER
KENNER AND ALL
THE REST WERE GONE
I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO
MADE IT BACK TO THE SHIP
WHEN THE
SANDSTORM QUIT I
WENT OUT AND
SEARCHED ALL OVER
THERE WASNT
A SIGN OF THEM
HOW CAN YOU EXPLAIN
THE BULLET HOLE
IN THE SKULL
WE WERE ALL SHOOTING
AT THIS THING
MAYBE THE ONE WHO GOT
THE BULLET WAS LUCKY
YOU DONT BELIEVE
ME DO YOU
I DONT DISBELIEVE YOU
HOW ABOUT YOU
LIEUTENANT
MARS IS ALMOST
AS BIG AS TEXAS
MAYBE ITS
GOT MONSTERS
CARRUTHERS IS STILL TALKING
ABOUT HIS MONSTERS
WHY DONT YOU STOP
BAITING HIM VAN
YOURE NOT USING YOUR
AUTHORITY VERY WELL
IM NOT DOING IT FOR KICKS
BELIEVE ME CHICKEN
IM JUST PLAYING
THE ODDS
YOUR ODDS BECAUSE
YOU THINK HES GUILTY
ADMITTED
BUT ANNE THERES A TIME
FACTOR INVOLVED HERE
HES UNSTABLE
RIGHT NOW
IF I CRACK HIS STORY
I CAN TURN HIM OVER
TO THE COURTMARTIAL TIED
UP IN A LITTLE PINK RIBBON
WHAT IF HES DONE
NOTHING TO CONFESS
THEN HE WONT
BUT I OWE IT TO THE LIVES
OF THOSE 9 MEN WHO DIED
TO TRY AND
FIND OUT
DONT YOU OWE IT
TO CARRUTHERS
TO TREAT HIM AS
A FELLOW OFFICER
NOT AS AN ANIMAL
DO YOU THINK
HES INNOCENT
I DONT KNOW
ITS NOT FOR ME TO DECIDE
OR FOR YOU VAN
OK CHICKEN ILL LET UP
ON THE THIRD DEGREE

ERIC
THOSE GAS GRENADES
THAT GINO MADE UP
HE JOKED
ABOUT THEM

THEYRE IN THE
CHEMICAL CABINET ERIC

AS A LAST RESORT
JIM WILL YOU GET OUT
THE GAS MASKS
Panting
THE SECOND STORAGE HATCH
CLOSE IT CLOSE IT
BULLETS GRENADES
NOTHING STOPS IT
WHAT DO WE DO NOW
WHATD YOU FIND OUT
THERES NOT A
MOLECULE OF OXYGEN
OR A DROP OF WATER
LEFT IN KIENHOLZS BODY
WATER
BLOOD
BONE MARROW
GLANDULAR SECRETION
MOISTURE IN THE TISSUES
EVERY OUNCE OF EDIBLE FLUID
IN HIS BODY IS GONE
PROBABLY THROUGH
SOME OSMOSIS PROCESS
THERE ARE
NO PUNCTURES
THATS WHAT
KILLED HIM
CELLULAR COLLAPSE
AND DEHYDRATION
NOT BEING CRUSHED
INTO THAT DUCT
IT HOLDS TOGETHER
MARS IS A WORLD ALMOST TOTALLY
WITHOUT WATER OR OXYGEN
THE CREATURES ENTIRE
BEING IS PROBABLY
ORGANIZED TO FEED
IN THAT MANNER
IT PREYS ON
SMALLER CREATURES
WHICH IN TURN FEED
OFF THE SAND ITSELF
CONVERTING THEIR INTAKE
AND HOARDING IT AS WATER
Groaning
IM WORRIED
ABOUT VAN
INFECTIONS SET IN AND I
CANT SEEM TO CONTROL IT
Banging
ITS EXPLORING
TESTING
IT CAN GET THROUGH
THE CENTER HATCHES
IT HAS TO KILL
US OR STARVE
AND WEVE GOT
TO KILL IT OR DIE
WHY IS IT SO
QUIET NOW
WHY DOESNT
IT ATTACK
CAUSE ITS
GOT GINO HUH
BOB LOOK
IVE GOT AN IDEA
Machines beeping
HOW IS HE
ITS AN ALIEN BACTERIA
OF SOME KIND
SO FAR THE INFECTION
ISNT CRITICAL
BUT OUR DRUGS DONT
EVEN TOUCH IT
COL CARRUTHERS
I KNOW THIS MAY
SOUND HORRIBLE
BUT YOU WERE RIGHT
AND WE WERE ALL WRONG
ITS TAKEN THIS
TO PROVE IT
ANNE
ANNE
Clanging
ITS MOVING AROUND
Royce
JIMMY
ANNE
BOB AND I HAVE
A SUGGESTION
WE COULD GET AROUND
BEHIND THE CREATURE
BY GOING OUT THE CONTROL
ROOM EMERGENCY AIR LOCK
MOVING DOWN
THE HULL
TO THE EMERGENCY AIR
LOCK ON THE MOTOR LEVEL
THAT WOULD PUT US
ONE LEVEL BELOW IT
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO
SURPRISE IT THAT WAY
IF WE KNEW WHAT
TO SURPRISE IT WITH
IVE BEEN THINKING
OF SOMETHING
AT LEAST ITS
WORTH A CHANCE
EXACTLY 520 MINUTES
10 SECONDS
NOW
WELL TIME IT
TO GET TO
THE MOTOR LEVEL AIR
LOCK AT EXACTLY 525
START MAKING NOISE THEN
NOT A LOT JUST TALK
MOVE AROUND
DONT MAKE IT
SOUND THREATENING
JUST ENOUGH TO KEEP
HIS ATTENTION AWAY
IN CASE WE MAKE
NOISE COMING IN BELOW
Muffled voice GOOD LUCK
IN CASE WE DONT COME BACK
I SAID GOOD LUCK
IN CASE WE DONT COME BACK
Hissing sound
Mechanical whizzing
THE PLAN IS
A SIMPLE ONE
WHILE THE REST TRY TO HOLD
THE ATTENTION OF THE BEAST
WITH THEIR TALK
AND FOOTSTEPS
WE WILL ATTEMPT TO GET TO
A LEVEL BELOW THE MONSTER
OUR ONLY HOPE IS
THAT THIS WILL BE
THE LAST ATTEMPT WE HAVE
TO MAKE TO KILL THE THING
IVE GOTTA FIX THAT
PILLOW FOR VAN
Anne IM SURE THEY WILL
THEYLL BE ALL RIGHT
Ticking
I HOPE THEYRE
MAKING NOISE
Beep
Indistinct voices
DO YOU THINK THEYRE GONNA
BE ALL RIGHT DOWN THERE
Edward GRENADES GAS
AND BULLETS
HAVE FAILED TO
STOP THE BEAST
BUT PERHAPS IT CAN
BE ELECTROCUTED
THERES ENOUGH VOLTAGE
IN THESE LINES
TO KILL 30 HUMAN BEINGS
THE ONLY DRAWBACK IS
THE THING ISNT HUMAN
Indistinct voices
I KNOW BUT THEYLL BE BACK UP
THEYLL BE ALL RIGHT
Growling
Growling
Clanging
monster growling
AH
HEY
I CANT MAKE IT
MY LEGS BROKEN
GET OUT
GET HELP
Hissing sound
IVE SWITCHED THE INTERCOM
TO PICKUP HIS SUITRADIO
CALDER CALDER
CAN YOU HEAR ME
LOUD AND CLEAR
ITS NICE TO
HAVE COMPANY
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT
IM ALIVE IF THATS
WHAT YOU MEAN
I PICKED A GOOD SPOT RIGHT
BETWEEN THE INDUCTION PUMPS
YOU MEAN IT CANT
GET AT YOU
IT COULD IF I DIDNT
HAVE THIS TORCH
TO REACH ME IT HAS
TO STRETCH DOWN IN
EVERY TIME IT DOES I GIVE IT
THE TORCH IN THE EYES

Growling
Growling

MONEY BACK IF UNSATISFIED
HANG ON JIM
WELL LEAVE THE INTERCOM ON
JUST HANG ON
SURE WHAT ELSE
WILL YOU KEEP US INFORMED
OF ITS MOVEMENTS
WELL TRY TO FIGURE
HOW TO GET YOU OUT
JUST SEND CARE PACKAGES
YOU KNOW IF THAT THING
SHOULD ATTACK THE
INDUCTION PUMPS OR
THE BANK OF
CONTROL RELAYS
WE COULDNT MANEUVER
THE SHIP OR LAND IT
WED JUST
DRIFT RIGHT
PAST EARTH
TOWARDS INTERSTELLAR
SPACE WED
DRIFT FOREVER
Growling
SO I DECIDED AFTER
ONE BAD MARRIAGE
TO BURY MYSELF
IN SCIENCE
I DIDNT WANT ANYBODY
VAN CHANGED
YOUR MIND
Anne sighs
IF WE GET OUT

Machines beeping
ERIC
THE BACTERIA IS ATTACKING
THE BONE MARROW

LEUKEMIA CONDITION
I CAN FIGHT IT WITH

I WILL READ YOU THE TEXT OF
A TELERADIO MESSAGE
RECEIVED FROM THE CHALLENGE 142
LESS THAN AN HOUR AGO
THIS IS ERIC ROYCE TALKING
OF THE 19 MEN AND WOMEN
WHO HAVE SET FOOT
UPON THE PLANET MARS
6 WILL RETURN
THERE IS NO LONGER
A QUESTION OF MURDER
BUT OF AN ALIEN AND
ELEMENTAL LIFE FORCE
A PLANET SO CRUEL SO HOSTILE
THAT MAN MAY FIND IT NECESSARY
TO BYPASS IT IN HIS ENDEAVOR
TO EXPLORE AND
UNDERSTAND THE UNIVERSE
ANOTHER NAME
FOR MARS IS DEATH
