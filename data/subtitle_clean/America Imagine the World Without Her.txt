FOLK MUSIC PLAYING
Meet Alexis Tocqueville
French aristocrat traveled

CHOIR SINGING
DSOUZA Tocqueville witnessed
importance Christianity
He saw faith shaping
peoples inner life
political life
He wrote Religion regarded
political institutions
When private individual
meditates undertaking
he thinks soliciting
cooperation government
Rather
collaboration others
 God bless you sir
 God bless you
DSOUZA In end sum
private undertakings
far exceeds
government done
Now Tocqueville recognize
things Zinn talks about
At point Tocqueville stood
OhioKentucky border
He looked north
saw industrious Ohio
He looked south
saw idle Kentucky
On sides commented
the soil equally fertile
The situation favorable
So explained difference
Slavery Tocqueville
said degrades work
It produces people energy
spirit enterprise
SLAVES SINGING

DSOUZA
When Tocqueville saw slavery
saw treatment
Native Americans
knew
uniquely American
In fact
universal conquest ethic
Most countries
founded conquest
Europe conquest conquest
conquest
Look Britain
Before empire
conquered
Norman kings France
earlier Romans
Before British came
India invaded Persians
Mongols Afghans
Arabs Alexander Great
Conquest wealth acquired
Not entrepreneurship
invention business
Historically culture despised
entrepreneurs merchants
In India caste system
Whos top
The Brahmin priest
The entrepreneur
step bottom
The Islamic historian Ibn Khaldūn
says looting morally preferable
entrepreneurship trade
Why Because looting manly
In looting beat guy
open combat stuff
America based different idea
The idea acquiring wealth
taking else
Instead wealth created
innovation
entrepreneurship trade
Lets look Manhattan
Reportedly 1626
Native Americans sold Manhattan
Dutch 700 todays money
Theres land world
buy 700
But Dutch bought
Manhattan Manhattan
Prices astronomical today
whats built
past 300 years
Manhattan creation
people built it
original
inhabitants sold it
Manhattan represents new
American ethic wealth creation
An alternative conquest
Its time respond Zions
story American shame
Did America steal country
Native Americans
Much critique
focuses Columbus
actions
Spanish conquistadors
But Columbus
landed America
And actions Spanish
 150 years America
 GUNS FIRING
Zinn blames America
sins Spanish
Portuguese
Great Britain France
What broken
treaties 1776
Well idea treaty
departure conquest ethic
The conquest ethic
simple win I lose
This defense relocation
way Native
Americans treated
Some restitution due
And made
In case Black Hills
American courts acknowledge
land taken violation
Laramie Treaty 1868
1 billion fair market value
land plus interest set aside
But Sioux rejected it
They want land
But land
In late 1700s Sioux took
land Cheyenne
earlier pushed
Kiowa Arapaho
Land possession
long history
stronger Native American
tribes displaced weaker ones
The Native Americans too
subscribe conquest ethic
But
charge genocide
In centuries Columbus
Native American
population declined 80
But wasnt warfare
Rather historian William
McNeill points out
contracted diseases
measles typhus smallpox
cholera malaria
immunities
Now tragedy grand
scale its genocide
genocide implies
intention wipe people
Just century half earlier
onethird population
Europe wiped
series bubonic
pneumonic plagues
Those plagues came Asia
Europeans immunities
We dont genocide
I understand pain
Charmaine White Face

Native Americans

The enslavement African
Americans theft
Theft life labor
Were American founders hypocrites
affirming men created equal
approving constitution
allowed slavery continue
This debated
Republican Abraham Lincoln
Democratic opponent
So desire Negro citizenship
desire let
state settle white man
means support Mr Lincoln
black Republican party
Negro citizenship
AUDIENCE BOOING
The authors notable instrument
intended include men
They intend declare
men equal respects
They mean
equal color
size intellect moral
developments social capacity
They define
tolerable distinctness
respect
consider men created equal
Equal certain inalienable rights
Among life liberty
pursuit happiness
They mean
assert obvious untruth
actually
enjoying equality
Nor
confer immediately them
They simply meant
declare right
enforcement follow
fast circumstances permit
DSOUZA
Lincoln recognized founders
outlawed slavery
union
No Southern state
joined union
slavery
lasted longer
Earlier career

Our story

Born slavery
Ellison freed young man
He blacksmith

Gates scholars estimate
period Civil War
approximately 3500 free blacks
owned 10000 black slaves
In South Carolina Louisiana

country
ALINSKY
The thing Ive come realize

I dont think theres
doubt Barack Obama

public political past
And probably
dramatic example
Obama encountered
Alinskyite organizing
series socialist conferences
attended lived
New York City young man
Those conferences touted Alinskyite
organizing big political wave
best way bring
socialism America
And conferences
touted Chicago
place
best Alinskyite organizers
DSOUZA Clearly Obama mastered
Alinskyite strategy deception

DSOUZA Alinsky

distortion extortion
Heres distortion
Obama gives impression
colluding
insurance companies
But reality hes colluding
insurance companies us
Hes forcing Americans buy
insurance dont want buy it
And makes insurance
companies happy
means
profits them
With corporate bank
bailouts deal
Obama embraced bailouts
He recognized way
federal government gain
control institutions
What naive corporate
executives dont realize

But Obama wasnt disciple
KURTZ Well Hillary

Hillary looking
Alinsky way
existing leftist
ideology practice
But studying Alinsky
Hillary came conclusion
Alinsky organizing
truly transform America

connected deeply
To core
American political system
Alinsky opposed tight relationships
community organizers politics
So Hillary decided
Alinsky different direction
DSOUZA While Alinsky wanted
radicals pressure government
Hillary wanted radicals
government
Why try shame people
outside
intimidate
inside
KURTZ So I ideology
Hillary closer Obama Bill
DSOUZA Hillary figured out
Obama carrying out
The IRS EPA DOJ NSA

Welcome Panopticon
prison designed philosopher
Jeremy Bentham 1800s
His design gave
guards Gods eye view
Here theres privacy
What Bentham envisioned prison
hitech Panopticon
Nobody listening
telephone calls
The United States
spying ordinary people
dont threaten
national security
Theres question collection
huge amounts data
gives government ability
anybody everybody
The government use
power it
It

Visa warrant
This program way
fully overseen FISA Court

evaluate classified programs
sure
executive branch
government generally
abusing
its carried
consistent Constitution
The FISA Court
allowed use term court
It court
A court definition means
institution hears sides
case controversy
Due process open court
Adversarial process sides it
But its secret court
FISA advocate
individual thats spied upon
Judges
allowed wear robes
They shouldnt allowed
use word judge
They shouldnt allowed
use word court
And its misleading public
Many people say
I havent wrong
and I dont care
read mail
The problem its
different standard
innocent proven guilty
Its open
They come house say
Oh youve sending
emails Lebanon
We suspect terrorism
If house

Department Justice prosecutor
The problem federal felonies

theyre engaging
arguably prosecutable
PAUL Well consider
IRS scandal
appears government
IRS partisan reasons
Maybe Im so uh
confident I want
phone records given to
uh government
appears maybe I
targeted government
I talk people routinely
I dont think paranoid
saying Im little
worried having
publically associated conservatives
Republicans I fear retaliation
I fear I targeted
SEC IRS
or different arms government
And I think its legitimate fear
I think theres probably
fundamentally unAmerican
government target
political opponents
Well President it
means illegal
During Nixon Administration
I audited times
I audited I
vocal critic Nixon Administration
We pay taxes
We file tax returns
And talk trap unwary
They absolutely anybody

And rest game
going avoid
long prison sentence
pled guilty short sentence
There lot people
prison today based guilty pleas
won
case litigated it
But risks litigation
great cant afford it
It Lavrenty Beria
told Stalin
Show man
Ill crime
What government little group
Wetumpka Alabama unAmerican
It isnt matter firing
arresting individuals
The individuals sought intimidate
acting thought
government culture
little respect citizens
Many agents agencies
federal government
understand
servants people
They think masters
mistaken
Im interested
scoring political points
I want protect preserve
America I grew in
The America people crossed oceans
risked lives of
And I terrified
slipping away
