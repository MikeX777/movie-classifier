desert dark
I learned story
A story wild grass came
savior destroyed like locusts
This grass took shapes
joined greed
And great wanulü beast awakened
shadow darkened world
If listened dreams
heard deads voices
Strong winds coming now
Theyll erase footprints sand
thats I sing day
So Wayúus alijunas wont forget
summer winds erase
So birds sing story
remain forever
place dreams memory
