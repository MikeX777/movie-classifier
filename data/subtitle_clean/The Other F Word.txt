Are supposed money
from uh rock music
Do deserve income rock music
especially want kids too
Isnt rock music
wild rambling guy
maybe kids doesnt

And drug problem
And dies hes 34 35
Its time bring 
Your life goes stages I dont
think started punk rock
uh looked punk rock
career decision
longterm uh career path
pension plan
Its funny punk scene because
know I try instill Pennywises
Bad Religions
NOFXs
bands starting
20 25 years existence
And its meteoric
rise fall bands
Its steady
steady business
Oh God its killing everybody dude
How long think
it
and know supporting
kid helping the
I mean far want count
record sales its over man
I mean right is
I mean theres way were gonna
money record sales
For long time
stayed independent label
just album
got point thats
gonna viable anymore
Everybody its Fletcher Pennywise
Ive meaning ask
new record
its
Myspace weeks right
You guys feel good new
chapter Pennywise history
I mean yeah Obviously weve Epitaph
16 years like that
Its probably greatest
independent label world
Uh like family us And cant
good things Epitaph
But way music industrys
couple years
people buying records anymore
record stores closing
wanted change
little bit
Ive judged
second know
I think band itsits difficult
living musician
And bands gotta
gotta paid there
Something I read lot thought
into entity owned by
huge multinational conglomerate
probably worst words
mention punk arena
Just day I went
time meeting
walked lobby
literally hairs stood up
And Im like Oh God
Im monster 
Im standing lobby monster
theres Fox News wall
Well point meaning
world better prepared brand
I joke theres place
called Hot Topic malls
I big church
commodification subculture
Because its where like
bizarre subculture
friends mall
So youve got your like
Sex Pistols baby Ts
youve got anarchists bracelets
your like little Goth chokers know
Tim Burton ephemera Slip Knot
speed metal surfer whatever
Theyre friends
Theyre cheap
You know corporate culture
eating exists up
Let herding ground 
 Where good men
trampled 
Just settle bet 
The Pennywise deal did
worked Pennywise
album away free
sponsor sure
Pennywise um able paid art
Now the
rationale giving away
We thought cool way
fans
We figured we
dont sell records
then uh well cool
getting new fans
And sorrow 
Some people compare digital
revolution Web revolution
industrial revolution
Its significant
that
Stores longer necessary
Little shiny disks
longer necessary
The trucks ship content
forth longer necessary
The warehouses longer necessary
And probably record companies
longer necessary
 There sorrow 
No 
I think reason rock musicians
judged stricter standard
society
I idea why
You wrong turn
sellout like that
You know sell MP3 99 cents
think youre ripping off
You know problem
know paying 399 crappy coffee
Starbucks its freetrade product
You know its like exploiting some
peasant Nicaragua
You know I mean
Theyll chug it
theyll car
Shell Oil right
And theyll mad band
a uh Nike commercial
having music Nike commercial

Forget punk
Just ask person

huge kind sacrifice ends
The wife husband
trying figure balance
What paying for
What checks for
