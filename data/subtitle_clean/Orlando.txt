A virgin rose
How sweetly doth peep forth bashful modesty
That fair seems
That fair ye may
Lo soon how
Modesty
There things shell see
Lo soon how bold free bared bosom
A virgin rose How sweetly doth peep forth bashful modesty
There doubt sex
Despite feminine appearance young man time aspires to
And doubt upbringing
Good food
Education
A nanny
Loneliness isolation
Andbecause England
Orlando destined portrait wall
And history books
But he
That is
I
Came world
He looking else
Though heir meant power land property
Surely Orlando born
wasnt privilege sought

curse fate
Aah
Poetry
Get off

Unfortunately Greens came world erm
Weve little leave burrower Greenwich
And Mr Greene subject closer heart yours
The sacred subject poetry

Enthusiasm dangerous
As youth I mocked love poetry solitude
Tragic
And course Mr Greene works hold pride place library
Uhuh
To certain glory man express words
great emotions feel
Oh
You know I scarcely dared ask acquaintance
I feel I offer return
Im sure writer willing hospitality
Oh think so
If speak poetry
let speak poets lives
Do know Hamlet written
Written bailiffs pounding Shakespeares door
No wonder plays falsey too
Aw Im sure youre right
How aHow genius work pay bills
When I work
Erm work see is
people havent labored way dont understand
real poetry easy easily produced
Then I feel I understand little Mr Greene
Because I righteous attempt write poems
Did I hear mouses squeak
I I didnt hear any
Thats saying youre good health
My lord bad its marvel Im alive
I enlarged heart spleen diseased liver
Above sensations spine defy description
There nob burns like fire
Second bottomcold ice
Sometimes I feel thousand wax tapers lite
And people throwing fireworks inside brain I
Im sensitive
I feel rose leaf mattress
In short
Im piece machinery finely
curiously
confounds think
That Ive sold 115 copies poem
But said largely descried conspiracy me
But Mr Greene surely work widely admired young poets
 Including dare I it
 All young writers turn trash sell
It hurts it
For I love literature I love life
But art poetry dead England
You think so
Of course erhm
That I pension
of
300 pounds year
paid
quarterly
Id live literature alone
Id dedicate fine writing
Butsadly
Its necessary pension it
About 300 pounds year
Paid quarterly
Mr Greene I wounder kind opinion efforts
By means If I time
For time money
And I write eat
 Were pursuit art
 Of course I arrange small matter 300 pounds
To paid
Quarterly
 As wish
 My dear friend
Death lover
Listen friend This great work
Of gracious host soon be congratulate friend pension
His heart broken
cleft two
abandoned lost
what do
And retched cried
She said loved me
But lied
And betrayed
He fell died
Try might
This gracious noble lord
Who lifts pen
And thinks write
Can not pen
When bored
The mind leisure trite
This pretty knight feebly lifts sword
To witless thrust doom
Is foiled noble birth affords
Dogs dogs dogs far rooms
So fortune smiles land
And frowns trivia dabblers hand
I like drop midst filthiest manure
And Mr Greenes pension sir
Pay it quarterly
Abroad

But changed
She longer trapped destiny
And let past
She life beginning
