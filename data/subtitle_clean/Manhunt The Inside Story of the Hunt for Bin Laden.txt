huge development
Good evening

United States conducted
operation killed
Osama bin Laden
leader ALQaeda
Tonight thanks
countless intelligence
counterterrorism
professionals
worked tirelessly
achieve outcome
The American people
work
know names
tonight feel
satisfaction work
I think women
fantastic analysts
We
patience perseverance
And were looking
sexy payoff immediately
You know trying track
threads
threats
ones real
ones arent real
connects what
And know people say
Why didnt
connect dots
Well
page black
To pull story

information

single intelligence looking
information
Its lot different
brains looking
So
bring people
and know
share whats important
better works
At time people

deep expertise
ALQaeda
know women
And job

popular
managers
I counseled
performance review
I spending
time working bin Laden
They said
obsessed crusaders
overly emotional
You know
womens stereotypes
Men throw chairs
Women cry
I ask you
Which better
Yes
borderline obsessed
I thought
good reason
And crusading
I wouldnt
crusade
Were passionate
doing
Absolutely
And thats
bureaucratic
norm time
You werent supposed
passionate anything
I think
ridiculous
How
like passion
You cant
Take stand
We drove Russians
We destroyed
Russian empire
Now well drive
Americans
and well destroy
US empire
It worked then
itll work here
He felt
like United States
driving world movement
Muslims
driver

happening
bad
Your starting
point Afghanistan
Abdullah Azzam godfather
Afghan jihad
He called
fight
Afghanistan
Soviets
He helped set council
charities bring
people money help
jihad
And partner
Osama bin Laden
A link chart
visual representation
terrorist network
And its terrorism
analysts spend
time
building
My mental image
that know Im
Jacobs ladder
Youve got string
youre pulling
strings
fingers
I feel like thats
Im mentally
Well
certainly didnt know
ALQaeda existed
We didnt know
terrorist organization
We knew
wealthy man
named Osama bin Laden
funding lot
terrorist groups
We knew
people terrorist groups
world
hanging Afghanistan
bin Ladens
circle
So start
signs looks like
organization
But bin Laden
financial manager
bunch
companies funding
terrorist groups
separate
terrorist group here
And
big question
Even analytical
community theres
relatively smaller
percentage people
good
making sense
information doesnt
appear connected
So
pattern analysis
trying figure
things look like
And people
need people work
issue like terrorism
counternarcotic
international arms
trafficking
youve got
bits pieces
scattered information
place
try
sense it
And
organizations
certainly ALQaeda
one
didnt want announce
presence world
long time
You try
figure theyre
theyre trying
deny friends
exist
That takes talent
skill
people refer
magic
Not analysts
it
people
didnt talent
referred magic
What I
halfdollars
When youre following
intelligence event
things
change ways
cant see
You think
its place

So coins
gonna jump time

See jump Heh Heh
Reality changing
time
A single fact come
dramatically changes
understanding
projection
somethings going
Two two
Are me
Now analyst
intelligence
profession
dealing
highly ambiguous situations
information
arriving incrementally
fragments
Are me
You picture
The picture changes
pieces arrive
Your perception
reality changes
You clear
concretely

dont know
Alec Station
collection people
backgrounds

analysis operations
When think
CIA
theres
different cultures there
One analytic culture
people try
assess things
figure actually
happening
project ahead
operational culture
is people
collect intelligence
develop human spies
handle them
run them will
The unique thing
Alec Station
fusion
analysis operations
We pushed analysts
operations people
together operations
people knew
analysts thinking
analysts knew

operations people
doing
Covertly clandestinely
secretly dangerously
And fusion
things gave
organization
magic had
The people I worked

I walked
day there
I turned
colleagues
bay
analysts
I said Does

Middle East
basically
wish
What
future plans
Can couple
pictures now
Some photographs
The impact
interview time

pretty muted
You know didnt

anything
Imagine 1937
Japanese army gone
NBC RKO say
Hey planning
attack
United States
You know Pearl Harbor
turned
differently
These guys repeatedly
said publicly
We planning
attack
United States
paid
attention
I watched
latest statements
Their choices

important
Oh yeah cagey
claiming credit
anything
They didnt
want claim credit
Then later on
willing credit
fact demanding credit
it
You know its
stuff hitting you
horrible
images hitting you
Its rapid fire
horribly evil music video
horror film slash
AlQaeda
global organization
people
60 countries
speak 60 different
languages
So
communicate clear

statements
And theyre
religious obligation
warn enemy
So reasons
complete sense
meant
said
Theyre planning
something
But where When What
Is going

hijacking
Is going
assassination
A bomb You know where
There real answers
The CIA

There dozens
dozens reports
express view

large band uncertainty
thats fertile ground
argument

Middle East
South Asia Europe

Hello Theyre coming us
That was
late nights
You home youre driving
roll
operations going on
threats
believe genuine
Youre thinking
friends colleagues
downrange
Sometimes youre thinking
talking head
launched bunch
bullets
know blame trying
face TV
understanding
sincerity
people involved
That cause
grief day
I knew I
gonna
tell people
Listen dont
understand do
Dont know that
Now lets on
Something
people dont fully grasp
CIA felt
period time
Just virtue
evolution events
history ended
moment time
kind
unique knowledge
phenomenon
ALQaeda
I think feeling
was
This shoulders
prevent
happening again
The day 911
President pulled
said I want
war plan here
Well working
long time
We ready go
The challenge
look ALQaeda
911
understand
disrupt
dismantle it
Were business
disruption alone
disrupt
organization
adversarys committed
I mean believe

inspired holy book
theyll
plot attack
So business
dismantlement
How destroy it
And thats
people business
How
operators financiers
trainers et cetera
And know
theyre gonna tomorrow
pick up
The explosion
intelligence CIA
911
hard imagine
You small group
people Alec Station
looking
problem pre911
They limited resources
After 911 small
core group people
dwarfed newcomers
center post911
It foundational
change organization
They needed managerial horsepower
support increase
people budget
I know
ALQaeda
Just little I
read press
Was specialty
But know
youve 25 years
experience come
pretty good sense
needs done
its new
target you
Pretty quickly learn
need learn
target
I head
Counterterrorism Center
time
dealing
threats
I mean daily
constant intelligence
coming second wave
attacks
But I reputation
building strong teams
The phone rang
A senior came line
basically said
We need come back
You know gravity
situation
You need come
do
I basically came
senior manager
worldwide effort
ALQaeda
I multidimensional
responsibility
I protect people
know
We changed rulebook
bit
We empowered more
We things
aggressive
My job
kill ALQaeda
Either
shouldertoshoulder
us
way
We
focusing capturing
Abu Zubaydah
He knew
leadership was
He knew methods
attack targets
He highest level
ALQaeda terrorist
captured
When captured
March
severely wounded
knew
Pakistan
And past way
US dealt
issues like
transfer terrorist
friendly country
interrogation
needed
responsibility
high level terrorists
ourselves
So understood
do
And it
We took lot
bad guys streets
And got up
its public knowledge
nice little uh
lets say
boutique locations
Basically
things
bring
interrogation room
especially
individuals like ALQaeda
You bring knowledge
bring
empathy
And dont
two
I think probably
youre gonna fail
He gave couple
piecesinformation
early phase
But stopped talking
When regained
strength
stopped talking
And convinced
come
new alternative

working
Eight 12 techniques
humble opinion
pretty wimpy stuff
You know like slapping
Give break
OK unpleasant
slap somebody
its torture
Grabbing
lapel
bringing
unpleasant
its
attention grabber
its torture
We didnt ask this
We ask
attacked
They it
And cant
uncomfortable save lives
thenweve missed
boat here
I believe
intention was
We allow
happen
Lets
needs done
Theyre straightup haters
There reasoning
them
Some individuals
time places
decisions
believe reason
deal
individuals
techniques like this
If deal
hardcore
detaineesthey
compliant
maybe jovial
engaging
ask them
What gonna
out
theyll go Im gonna
come kill you friend
All information
came Abu Zubaydah
got
waterboarding
Most
things came
traditional
interrogation techniques
showing people
evidence
putting detainees
other
pocket litter
So traditional
interrogation techniques
worked tremendously
We interrogators
debriefers
The interrogators work
detainee
And
compliant
step
debriefers
targeting analysts
people knew
target
step
begin
question them
Jennifer Matthews
sitting
Abu Zubaydah
asking questions
There
big difference
expert
desk
field expert
You cant argue
success
And fact
matter
extremely
successful
Once started
techniques
Abu Zubaydah
compliant
started collect
incredible intelligence
Abu Zubaydah gave
play book
individuals
So short order
chief operations
captured killed
Ramzi bin ALShibh
Nashiri Hambali
KSM Remember guy
That nice one
But
Arab yuppie outfit
You know looking
prim proper
Im like Forget this
I want guy bad guy
downrange know
future is
This mack daddy
This
chief gangster
This future
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed
waterboarded
183 times
They tried quantify
numbers
pourings water
eventually pourings
water
waterboarding
times
So 183 total pourings
water
Khalid Sheikh Mohammad
183 times
crazy
Look its
FBI versus CIA
I know fact

weve told
resulted

waterboarding
thats true
Only terrorists
American blood
hands
waterboarded
In cases
days
In case Abu Zubaydah
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed
weeks
This program evolved
because know
stuff
tried
working
And evolution
process I realize
shouldnt

andI shouldnt
witness this
And I
headquarters
headquarters
pulled out
We knew Americans
point

to
There illusions
And try
provide lens history
doesnt exist yet
I understand people
uncomfortable this
options
good
In aftermath
911 people expected
realized
probably Tora Bora
did
After Tora Bora
likely went
Kunar somewhere
Well
in
I thought
running around
maybe
AfghanPak border
maybe Afghanistan
Thats favorite
been
having Afghanistan

spiritual home
speak
Afghan jihad
I asked
Where bin Laden
time
When I went testify
Congress
thing
wanted know was
Where bin Laden
I went Oval Office
number times
I asked president
Where bin Laden
Everybody
ask question
Where bin Laden
It frustrating
basically admit
didnt know
One time
colleagues came talk
about
Wheres bin Laden
And I told him Look

The time
person asks me
Where bin Laden
Im gonna say
You know what Fuck you

And later day
I went home

busy going
actually
plotting us
Congratulations
Abu Butthead

The bad news is

ALQaeda
Youd better buckle
chinstrap

career path

There aspect
intelligence business
called targeting
I think revolution
couple reasons
Just past years
agency
transitioned
strategic intelligence
tactical intelligence
helps identify
movements locations
specific individual
Im worried
ALQaeda
looks like strategically
I want analyst
whos spending
time looking
target
name
people
goal life
following
human being
I went women

targeting officers
I moved over
Jennifer Matthews
women

bin Laden side
You know
How I this
We didnt great

deadly synergy
And job
targeting officer
war theater

target
accurate possible
Wait
For me war sort like
radioactive
shouldnt touch
youve
tremendous
understanding
damage do
You flirt idea
I cross line
and dark
I walk
because Im going
dark
good purpose
And times
appropriate
dangerous
Its easier time
cross
I like
raids
That wasntI
analyst
WasntI didntI
I think
questions
intelligence
organization
slowly gets involved
executing types
global counterterrorism
operations
Thats real
mindset change
The war
agnostic video game
It personal game
know
youre responsible
lives
Americans
going
adversary
got kill
capture
August 2004
I think 18 raids
month Iraq
force
Two years later 2006
month
Iraq also
300 raids
Our ability collect
intelligence
act intelligence
collect
intelligence taken
industrial
size speed it
It definitely
welloiled machine
There rolling raids
Sometimes
fruitful
much
I think
momentum
sort overtook
substance
going after
You know its like
Theres target
Lets it
can
The machine kept going
We executed thousands
kinds raids
Iraq
Afghanistan
got better
better them
So evolution
particular CIA
ways
couldnt imagined
2001 2002
absolutely
critical turns out
order able
meet threat
But
definitely need know
moral center
define
order
able job
I mean I worked center
job hunt
person
capture kill
I mean I
OK that
And know paradox
wanting save
women children
Iraq
kill
order
wasnt lost
means
But know I
I justify
myself
The war terror
How
war terror
terrorism tactic
You war
people
So question
immediately becomes
Who people
were fighting
war against
And I think
people dont understand
hate us
Some strikes necessary
solution
kind problem
strike
trying
effective efforts
prevent rise
threats its endless
Shock awe
end wars terrorism
It creates
terrorism
Money starts flow
terrorist groups
people
radicalized
Wars terror
fought
radar
quietly possible
But counterterrorist
operations are
nature
satisfying
frightened public
And working closely
bin Laden unit
dynamic
relationship
Zarqawi
core ALQaeda
sort turned lot
assessments
happening
core ALQaeda head
Bin Laden didnt know
Im sure
getting Zarqawi
fundamentally
different

ALQaeda leaders

ALQaeda scholars had
He didnt same
lack better way
it
professional sense
jihad ALQaeda did
He didnt understand
rules game
He thought

brutal was
It surprising
hear
Zarqawi
deferential
He insubordinate
