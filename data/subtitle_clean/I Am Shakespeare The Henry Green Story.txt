It looked like it
But
times Im grateful
I suppose Renegade me
The thats
destructive
sees limitations

anger
sees limitations faith
It sees limitations miracle
It rebels that
I wont sprint I wont
able run not
What happens I try so
I wont able feel
toes right foot
Well lets that
Im gonna prove wrong
Im gonna fight that
If Im able progress body
I progress anything
And Renegade knows
rules given
limitations wont
able deadlift anymore
wont able run
Those rules dont matter
limitations dont matter
And I rebel limitations
I dont live them
I I wanna
I I wanna
get despite limitations
So long Henry Green
channeling Renegade
I think its good thing
Ever I shot
I able
life track
I personal mission
I possibly
share story
explain people possible
power
talent you
And use great
use good
And thats focus doing
And I ugliest parts life
mainly parts
Im ashamed of
And I there I open
I transparent
I explain
transition
I now
I think myself
identity formed
based environment
I adapt to
Right now I think
Im
Ive categorized
way another
You know I Henry Green
I Renegade somebody
Stanley Galbraith
laughs
That name Stanley Galbraith
DC Im like miracle patient
people Im different things
And I think Ive come
place I understand
different characters
people

I think
time coma
Ive accepted Im
one Im people
And Im going fight
try
Im gonna
I am
From New Haven Im

Stanley Galbraith anywhere
laughs
But I things
Im experiences
foolish
try hide one
away bring
push down
Its sides me
A lot people think
its
you
Its sides me
its its me
Its person
moody blues music
And Im finally whole
My life life
When gets shot
wants believe
innocent
its loved one
wanna believe theyre innocent
And its especially
its covered big news story
youre able
picture individual
Many times
picture victim criminal
picture criminal
get
story
crime
Their crime possibly
negative characteristics
meant explain crime
You know Im saying instance
shooter say
Oh gang affiliated
shot ran
And thats information
shooter
But myself probably reason
people feel
compassionate situation
able
fully understand afterwards
They able stories
stories familys
stories friends
people Ive worked with
able picture
I couldnt criminal
couldnt
dimensional picture
that
Im suddenly victim
instead simply black
black crime casualty
Im victim
face it
personality it
And thing thats different
I
shooters I personality
I face
I memories him
So now hes victim too
And view things way
were were
little biased
I know Im saint sinner
else
And I think
natural tendency
paint
saint sinner
its easier
hate love them
Its easier that
Its harder look
complex picture
thats great
time
mistakes flaws
I think Have unique situation
I able survive situation
I died
And I probably labeled
saint sinner
But I able survive
explain story
I able paint gray picture
instead black white
picture were gray
The shooter gray victim gray
I guess compassion
shooter comes from
I think honesty myself
The reason
really truly hate
think youre like them
If dont understand them
But Im gonna honest myself
hes similar me
We angry frustrated
situation in
We handled anger
frustration wrong way
Im sure kid grew
type environment
I did realized
didnt
things wanted
things
felt have
Maybe hes lacking type
love pride
naturally

instilled him
So hes going out
hes trying way
proud himself
Hes going hes
trying way
accept
things
didnt have
And I thing

short hypocritical
blame kid
monster
I thing
And I wish I
meet tell that
I wish I meet
talk
hes

channel right direction
I wish knew forgiven
After years
Ive narrowed thoughts
shooter be
And I know
hes jail right else
And know looking life
probably right now
actually people
Ive hurt shot
jail died
Whereas years shooting
I time job

I know way
start changing New Haven
steps like this
I wanna meet

Shooting somebody probably
traumatic getting shot
If I meet him
I love able meet him

story together
I think shooter

victim jailing shooter
I think creates change

think definitely does
The thing New Haven
curse New Haven

continues perpetuated
theres nonstop tit that
Someone gets shot
gets angry
shoots person shot person
Someone gets
angry shoots person
shot person stops
family members dead
Then children it

The way stops
person forgives
And I wanna start that
moody blues music
I bullet
Byron bullet theres way
I brought
worlds place
A bullet saved man
Sometimes its worst things life
bring greatest
profound change
Necessary change
Its climax plot
The climax plot makes nervous
sounds horrible
its needed happy ending
Its needed
moody blues music
Its hard
middle climax course
its needed
moody blues music
The dude wakes
gangster face
calls crying middle night
Its like oclock morning
calls bawling
He keeps repeating
thing
Im like Yo whats good okay
And says How it
How it
Henry it
And keeps crying asking
question over
He says How forgive him
How change
I wanna change I wanna
