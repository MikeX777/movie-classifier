life wrestled way slumber
I dreamt Gale Evelle decided
return prison Probably thats well
I dont mean sound superior
theyre swell coupla guys
maybe werent ready
come world
And I dreamed on future
Christmas morning Arizona home
Nathan Junior openina present
kindly couple
preferred remain unknown
I saw Glen years later
havinno luck gettin cops
listen wild tales Ed
Maybe threw Polack joke many
I dont know
But I dreamed on
future
Id dreamed before
Watchin Nathan Juniors progress afar
takin pride accomplishments
own
wonderin thought us
hopin maybe wed
broadened horizons little
couldnt remember
got broadened
But I hadnt dreamt
nothin Ed
end
And cloudier
years years away
But I saw old couple
bein visited children
grandchildren too
The old couple werent screwed up
kids grandkids
Dad
And I dont know
You tell me
This dream
Was wishful thinkin
Was I fleeinreality
like I know Im liable do
But Ed good too
And real
It like us
And like
well home
If Arizona land far away
parents
strong wise capable
children happy beloved
I dont know
Maybe Utah
