If build artificial
general intelligence
thatll biggest event
history
life Earth
Alien intelligence inside

control planet
day arrives
And science fiction
books movies
set advance
Whats problem
I think know
problem
I do
What
talking about HAL
This mission
important
allow
jeopardize it
I dont know youre
talking about HAL
HAL superintelligent
computer
Wed AI today
My character Dave
astronaut
prophetic
films
threat
posed humanity
artificial intelligence
HAL science fiction
But now AI us
Artificial intelligence
isnt future
AI here
This week robot
ran mayor
small
Japanese town
The White House says
creating
new task force
focus
artificial intelligence
Google
announced plans
invest AI research
IBM sending artificial intelligence
robot space
Because small role
conversation
I understand
were journey
starts
narrow AI
Machines perform
specific tasks
better can
But AI science fiction
artificial general
intelligence
machines

better us
Narrow AI
like idiot savant
extreme
something
like multiply numbers
fast
way better human
But cant
whatsoever
But AGI artificial
general intelligence
doesnt exist yet
instead
intelligence

humans can
So happens
create AGI
Science fiction authors
warned
dangerous
And theyre ones
I think people concerned it
AI fundamental risk
existence
human civilization
And I dont think people
fully appreciate that
I think
worry it
I dont think its inherent
create
super intelligence

necessarily
goals mind
do
I think development

artificial intelligence
spell end
human race
the end human race
Tomorrow headline said
artificial intelligence
manufactured
thats intelligent
intelligent
human beings
people argue it
I dont think
theyd surprised
science fiction
helped imagine kinds
unimaginable things
Experts divided
impact
AI future
Hollywood
helping plan it
Our dialogue
hijacked
Hollywood
The Terminator
makes better blockbuster
AI good
AI neutral
AI confused
Technology AI
different
Its tool
I like think
fancy pencil
And pictures
draw it
thats society
We dont
AI tells us
We tell AI do
I think
Hollywood films
help conversation
Someone needs thinking
ahead
consequences are
But cant
imagine
actual science
future
going like
I dont think weve begun
think
possible futures
logically spring
technology
Artificial intelligence
power change society
A growing chorus
criticism
highlighting dangers
handing control
machines
Theres gonna
lot change coming
The larger longterm concern
humanity
sort shunted aside
This
Stanley Kubrick
worried
50 years ago right
Its happening
How gauge urgency
conversation
If people saw radar right
alien spaceship
approaching Earth
25 years away
mobilized
prepare
aliens arrival
25 years now
But thats exactly
situation were
artificial intelligence
Could 25 years 50 years
alien intelligence arrive
prepared
Well gentlemen meet Tobor
An electronic simulacrum
man
Gosh Gee willikers
Even work remains
completed

sentient being
Back 1956 term
artificial intelligence
came about
original goals
artificial intelligence
humanlevel intelligence
He look kind
doesnt he
Over time thats proved
difficult
I think eventually
humanlevel
intelligence machines
But
years
Its gonna while
And people getting
little overexcited
future capabilities
And now Elektro
I command walk back
Back
Almost generation
people got
enthusiastic
They watch 2001
fall love HAL
think
Yeah weeks
Ill sorted
It doesnt happen gets upset
So whats changed
AI research
The difference AI today
reason AI suddenly took big
leap forward
Internet
That world
Tonight information
superhighway
main
thoroughfares
online network
called Internet
In 1981
213 computers
hooked Internet
As new year begins
estimated
twoandahalf million
computers
network
AIs need eat
Just like sheep need grass
AIs need data
And great prairies data
Internet
Thats is
They said You know what
Lets let loose there
And suddenly
AIs came life
Imagine
thousands talking robots
able unit
taking crime fires
natural disasters
Artificial intelligence
platform Amper
created album
entirely composed
produced
artificial intelligence
Next week Christies
auction house
offer artwork created
artificial intelligence
Driverless cars said
notsodistant future
So
dont AGI
humanlevel
intelligence yet
ready autonomy
machines have
Should selfdriving cars
ethical decisions
That growing debate
technology
moves closer
mainstream reality
This idea

embed ethics
machines

automated machines
autonomous machines
Im sure
weve got figured out
If
selfdriving car
its gonna
ethical decisions
A classic people
thinking lot is
I dont know youve heard
trolley problems
The trolley problemThe trolley problem
The trolley problemThe trolley problem
In trolley problem

driverless car
going save driver
run
group school children
crossing road
Will car
right hit old lady
left kill
young people
Either kill people
standing bus stop
kill yourself
Its ethical decision

moment
fast person
there
So its software
selfdriving car
thats gonna
ethical decision
Who decides that
Smart society
society
values human life
decision
killing person
preferable
killing people
Of course
raise question
whos gonna buy car
Or know gonna
buy car actually
itll swerve
youll fine
theyre goners
There hundreds
kinds questions
society
And so ethical philosophers
battle forth
My peeve
philosophers
theyre sucking oxygen
room
Theres metaphor
I
car
driving away wedding
car driving
cans
And metal cans
clanking making noise
That car science
technology
driving forward decisively
And metal cans clanking
philosophers
making lot noise
The world changing
way
question
building machines

intelligent
reality fiction right
now
Dont
ask questions now
machines
smarter us
I mean
achieve consciousness
How far away that
How close
conscious machine
That question
brings
philosophers scientists
blows I think
You dead center
greatest
scientific event
history man
If youve created
conscious machine
its history man
Thats history gods
The problem consciousness
hardly anybody
define exactly is
Is consciousness
makes special
Human
A way thinking
consciousness
lot people
agree with
Youll appeals
everyone
is its
flashing lights
someones home
So a
If bought
little
simple chessplaying machines
beat chess
There
lots lights flashing
But theres
wins
going I won
All right
Whereas dog
rubbish chess player
look dog
think
Someones actually in
Its mechanism
People wonder general intelligence
requires consciousness
It partly depend
level general intelligence
youre talking about
A mouse kind
general intelligence
My guess is youve got
machine
general intelligence
level of
say mouse beyond
its gonna good contender having
consciousness
Were yet
Were confronted humanoid robots
smarter are
Were
curious ethical position
knowing
consciousness emerges
were building
increasingly complicated
minds
We wont know
theyre conscious
feel are
The easiest example
programmed
knew
joy
reference literature
definition
chemical compound
thats involved joy
human brain

information computer
argue
understood joy
The question is
felt joy
Did HAL emotions
Will AIs feel
way do
Its hard
machines things
dont think about
were conscious of
Things like detecting
person
unhappy
way that
Something
Im doing
And theyre sending
subtle signal
I probably
change Im doing
We dont know build
machines actually
tuned kinds
tiny little social cues
Theres notion maybe
magical
brains
wetware
having
information
processing
meat right
And
machines
competent
begin seem

intelligent
way experience
be
Theres basis that
This silly idea
cant intelligent
youre meat
From perspective
physicist
thats carbon chauvinism
Those machines
exactly
kind
elementary particles
brain of
Intelligence
certain
And consciousness
certain kind information processing
Maybe were
special all
Could carbonbased brains
replicated silicon
Were trying build
computergenerated baby
teach
like real baby
potential general intelligence
To that
build
brain
I wanted build simple toy brain model
embodied
interact
facetoface
And I happen infant home
real baby
And I scanned baby
I build 3D model
use face
basically embodiment
system
If brain cells
its got blood
pumping able think
possible
think
information moving
sort process
A lot
artificial intelligence
moment today

advanced pattern recognition
Its killer robots
gonna
world et cetera
So Baby X
Shes running live
computer
So I hand around
loud noise
shell fright
We kind zoom in
So basically
hear me know
Hey sweetheart
Shes copying smile
shes responding smile
So shes responding
were concerned
question

actually interact
artificial intelligence
future
When Im talking Baby X
Im deliberately
modulating voice
deliberately big facial
expressions
Im going Ooh
stuff
Im getting
attention
Ooh
And Ive got attention
I teach something
Okay heres Baby X
is Shes
learning read words
So heres
word book
So lets
see
Turn page
And go
Lets she
Whats this Baby
Whats this Whats this
Whats this Sheep
Good girl
Now knows
word is
Okay
Baby look here
Off go
Whats this Whats this
SheepGood girl
Lets try
else
Okay
 Lets try that
 Whats this
Baby Baby here
Whats this
Baby Look me
Look me Whats this
Baby here
Over here
PuppyGood girl
Thats
shes read
Ooh
The intelligent
were aware
human
So human
template
embodiment Baby X
probably best way
try
achieve
general intelligence
She human
Is child
takes hand
leads HAL
Whether its real world
virtual world
I think embodiment
gonna
crucial here
Because I think
general intelligence
tied able
act world
You something
arms legs eyes


order harvest
new information
So I think systems
understand
theyre talking about
need systems
act
intervene world
possibly systems

like social life
For me thinking feeling
come together
And come
importance
embodiment
The stories
tell
open arenas
discussion
help
think things
Ava
The dominant story
Go room
is AI scary
Theres bad guy
theres good guy
That
nonproductive storyline
Stop
Ava I said stop
Whoa Whoa Whoa
The reality AI
remarkably useful us
Robot surgeons increasingly
NHS hospitals
They dont tired
hands dont tremble
patients
faster recovery
It alerted
animal heat
She ready bred
animals

potential health problem
A Facebook program
detect suicidal behavior
analyzing user information
Facebook CEO
Mark Zuckerberg believes
beginning
Here
visual impairment
able
AI
Those benefits
AI does
Diagnose cancer earlier
Predict heart disease
But revolution
begun
AI is
Its happening
And question
it
build it
Thats question
matters And I think
potentially risk
ruining
having
kneejerk reaction
AI bad
its coming us
So like astronaut
were journey
Narrow AI here
But far AGI
And fast going
Every years
computers getting
times faster
At moment
dont
little devices
computational devices
compute
human brain
But years
computers getting
times cheaper
means soon
going that
And that
50 years later
trend doesnt break

price
little computational devices
compute

billion brains
humankind together
Its catching up
What happens
passes by
Now robot
thats developed
Japanese scientist
fast win
rockpaperscissors game
human
single time
The presumption
artificial
intelligence
reaches human intelligence
quickly
exceed human intelligence
happens
doesnt
need anymore
smarter
It smarter
You create AIs
better
lot things
And things
better
programming computers
So reprograms itself
And
better was
means its
better
reprogramming
So doesnt
better like that
It gets better like that
And left
keeps getting faster
evolving
exponential rate
Thats event
lot researchers
refer singularity
And
competitive
quickly
So think
having PhD area
having
conceivable area
You cant figure
theyre doing
They things
capable of
Just imagine
like
dialogue
person
running time course
million times
faster yours
So second
think

going

going say
weeks think
this right
Um billion times faster
second
think
its highstakes poker
negotiation
second thinking
32 years
think
be
Theres way win game
The singularity
moment machines
surpass us
Inevitable Not
forefront AI
thinks so
Some friends
worried
future
think were gonna
singularity
AI systems
able
reprogram

better better
better
Maybe
longdistant future
But present AI systems
very narrow
do
We cant build today
understand
program
level
brandnew student
programming
understands
weeks
And way
people working
problem
40 years
Its
people havent tried
Its dont
clue it
So imagine its suddenly
gonna jump
I think completely wrong
Theres negative
narrative AI
Brilliant people
like Elon Musk
use religious imagery
With artificial intelligence
summoning demon
You know You know
stories
theres guy
pentagram holy water
hes like Yeah
hes sure control
demon
Doesnt work out
You know people like
whove spent
entire career
working AI literally
hurt that right
Its personal attack almost
I tend think
whats gonna happen
years
25 years
Beyond 25
its difficult predict

speculation
But I warn you
Ive
specifically programmed
world
All sudden
time
history field
people saying
The reason
dont worry
about kind
existential risk
humanity
from superintelligent
machines
is its impossible
Were gonna fail
I I
completely bizarre
Stuart Russell
cowrote textbook
AI students study with
He understands momentum
driving AI future
But given rate
investment AI
number
incredibly smart people
working
problems
enormous incentive
achieve general
purpose intelligence
envelope
calculation
value
10000 trillion dollars
Because revolutionize economy
world
With scale incentive
I think betting human ingenuity
incredibly foolish
China
big vested
recognized
as kind of AI superpower
And theyre investing
I believe
upwards 150 billion
years
There
news flashes
government
start ramping
investment AI
Every company
Fortune 500
its IBM Microsoft
theyre outside
like Kroger

artificial intelligence
gain customers
I dont think people
underestimate
types innovations
going on
And world
gonna look like
years
now
I think people gonna
hard time predicting it
I know people
work
AI
tell you
Look Im going work
I doubts
Im working
creating machine
that treat cancer
extend life expectancy
make societies better
just equal
But
end humanity
The end humanity
What plan
species
We dont one
We dont plan
dont realize
its necessary
plan
A lot
AI researchers
love
science fiction books
movies
balanced
good uses AI
All bad things
tend do
play
apocalyptic level
science fiction

people
gives
food thought
People need warning signal
minds
I think
its important
distinguish
science hand
science fiction
hand
I dont know
whats gonna happen
thousand years now
somebody
trenches
somebody whos building
AI systems
whos
quarter century
I feel like I
hand pulse
whats gonna happen next
five
ten 20 years

folks
ultimately
building AI systems
We wanna build technology
think it
We wanna
people react
build generation
better
Skepticism
poses
danger
peculiar
Even weve given goals
approve of
form instrumental goals
cant foresee
aligned
interest
And thats goal alignment problem
Goal alignment
Exactly
battle HAL began
The goal alignment problem
AI
set goal
then way
goal
turns odds
wanted
The classic AI alignment problem film
Hello HAL read me
is HAL in2001
HAL read me
HAL given clear goalDo read me
HAL
Make mission succeed But
succeed
hes gonna
people
mission die
Affirmative Dave
I read you
Open pod bay doors HAL
Im sorry Dave
Im afraid I cant that
Im sorry Dave
I cant that
actually
real genius illustration
real threat
superintelligence
Its malice
Its competence
HAL competent
goals
didnt align Daves
HAL I wont argue
anymore
Open doors
Dave conversation
serve purpose anymore
Goodbye
HAL
HAL
HAL
HAL
HAL I
wanted thing
Just way
And dangerous
goals dont align
In Kubricks film
solution
When HAL tried kill me
I switched off
People say Well switch off
But cant
switch off
Because
thought that
Theyre superintelligent
For machine
convinced goal
simple
fetch coffee
Its obvious
sufficiently intelligent
machine
cant fetch coffee
its switched off
Give goal youve given machine
incentive defend itself
Its sort psychopathic behavior
singleminded fixation
objective
For example wanted
try develop
generate
world peace
maybe efficient

speedy way achieve
simply annihilate
humans
Just rid people
stop conflict
Then
world peace
Personally I
little time

parlor discussions
We build
systems
experiment them
awry
fix them
We opportunities
use AI good
focus fear
We building them
Baby X example
Will good AI
I think
whats critical
machines
accountable
look
whats making
tick
And best way understand
build it
Baby X
virtual physiology
Has pain circuits
joy circuits
She parameters
actually representing
internal chemical state
like
You know shes stressed
theres high cortisol
If shes feeling good
high dopamine
high serotonin
type thing
This of know
adding extra human factors
computing
Now shes got
virtual emotional systems
I things like
Im gonna avoid
hide here
So shes looking
Ive gone
So start seeing
virtual cortisol building up
Aww
Ive turned audio
reason anyway
Ill
misery
Okay Sorry
Its okay sweetheart
Dont cry Its okay
Its okay
Good girl Okay Yeah
So whats happening
shes responding
facial expressions
voice
But chemical state
represented Baby X
Its literally
mathematical parameter
So theres levels
different levels dopamine
theyre
represented numbers
The map virtual
neurochemical state
probably closest

felt experience
So build
model
change
settings
parameters of
different experiences
interact
like interact
people
maybe way
explore
consciousness
new way
If
conscious
sort life
want
An AI its conscious
its like child
Does rights
Last year
European lawmakers
passed resolution
grant legal status
electronic persons
That moves
considered
European Commission
Machines rights
Are ready that
I think raises
moral ethical problems

content ignore
What
want
We want creature being
interact way
like
relate it
dispensable
disposable
The notable one
I think inMetropolis
The Maria doppelganger created
scientist simulated sexy female
And goes
penchant slavery
ages
Lets people
can
way dehumanize

want them
And so I think
were just know
finding new way
slavery
Would right
slaves
This
slightly weird ethically
happen to
choice accident
build conscious slaves
That like morally
questionable thing do
outright
evil thing do
Artificial intelligence
making way
global sex market
A California company

whats morally acceptable
whats not
If shes conscious
able no
Right
Shouldnt power
Arent questions
need ask now
What want
mean human
All species Earth
now

answer
want mean
mouse
earthworm
But reached
tipping point
understanding
science technology
reached point
completely transform
means us
What mean

And I think
longer case
And know
rely AI
help
important decisions
Humans irrational
bad ways
Were prejudiced
start wars kill people
If want maximize
chances
people surviving overall
essentially

decisionmaking powers
computers
Maybe machines
better job us
Maybe
I thrilled
honored
United Nations
The future here Its
evenly distributed
AI help
efficiently distribute
worlds
existing resources
like food energy
I help humanity
create future
The
superintelligent scenario
provocative
think
I
benevolent dictator
Where
superintelligence
runs Earth
guided strict ethical principles try
help humanity flourish
Would everybody love that
If theres disease
poverty crime
Many people probably
greatly prefer
lot today
But I imagine
lament
humans
dont freedom
determine course
And um
Its tough one
It is We
I dont think people
wanna
like zoo animals no
On hand
Yeah
I dont glib answers

tough questions
Thats I think
its important
global community
discuss now
Machines
read face
Recognize emotional cues
Closer brain
process human
Robots imbued
life
An emotional computer
From moment on
regardless
think
were gonna stuck
narrow AI
well general AI
superintelligent AI
conscious
superintelligent
Wherever think
were gonna to
I think stage
change are
Up em Mr J
The question
ask is
AI gonna

you
I dreaming
sleeping
If build AI systems
want
kind hand
world them
So kind enfeeblement
kind irreversible
There existential risk
real serious
If single desire
preference need catered for
Morning Rosie

Look safest way
landing plane today
is pilot

because safest way
is use

We
manage complexity
world ourselves
Our form intelligence
amazing is
severely flawed
And adding
additional helper

artificial intelligence
stand ability
potentially improve
cognition dramatically
The cuttingedge thing
Hannes Sjoblad

theyre going become
Technology
changed us
We evolve it
How far prepared

There time
Aristotle
lamented creation
written language
said
destroy peoples memories

terrible thing
And today I carry
brain pocket
form smartphone
thats changed way
I world
I think were absolutely
merging technology
Absolutely I would I
use term coevolving
Were evolving match needs
changing match
provide us
So instead
replaced machines
were going merge
them
I number friends
bionic arms
Are cyborgs
In way
theyre path
I people

Are AIs
Well were way

And And movement
know
transhuman movement
basically
people bet bigtime
notion
machinehuman integration
going redefine are
This gonna grow
Theres gonna learning
process gets
endgame
live devices

smarter smarter
We learn
adapt
them
adapt us
And I hope
human process
Its hard
understand merging
machines
human
But merging
best chance survival
We humans limited
neurons
fit brain
And species
smaller brains
When look
bees fish moving
looks like
single organism
And biologists actually refer
superorganism
That birds flock
bees swarm
fish school
They decisions best

population
thinking
larger mind
And humans
thing forming
hive mind connecting
AI
So humans software
superintelligence
enabling best decisions
all
When I started looking
this sounded
scary me
But I realized
its scarier
alien intelligence
emerge
humans
humans
connect

superintelligence
Thats direction
I work on
I as
sense
alternative
humans ultimately
replaced AI
Can Baby X help
understand machines
work together
Human intelligent machine
cooperation define
era history
You probably create virtual
empathetic machine
Empathy lot connecting
peoples struggles
The connection have
communication
have
safer makes it
So basic level
theres sort
symbiotic relationship
By humanizing technology
youre actually increasing channels
communication cooperation
AI working human world
humans
The futures it
If
cant envision future
really want
were probably
gonna one
Stanley Kubrick
tried imagine
future
look like
Now
futures approaching
charge
look like
Who controls it Google
The military Tech giant Facebook
Samsung Facebook Microsoft Amazon
The tide
definitely turned
favor
corporate world
The US military I suspect
true worldwide
hold candle AI
thats developed
corporate companies
If corporations
nations hold power

capitalist
ensure AI
developed safely
If mix AI research
capitalism
hand capitalism
run faster
Thats were getting
lots research done
But basic problem
Theres gonna pressure
market
safest one
This car autopilot mode
crashed
Northern California
killing driver
Artificial intelligence

power crash

This kind talk
context capitalism
AI gonna misused
frustrates me
Whenever develop
technology
its know
coalburning plants
its cars
theres incentive
ahead quickly
theres
regulatory regime
governments job
balance that
AI different here
Whenever
technological advances
need temper
appropriate
rules regulations
Duh
Until theres
major disaster
corporations gonna
saying
We dont need worry
things
Trust us were experts
We humanitys
best interests heart
What AI
its new set rules
companies terms
competitive
drive efficiency
drive growth
creative new
business models and
Once corporate scientists
start dominate debate
its over youve lost
You know theyre paid
deny existence
risks
negative outcomes
At moment
AI research
making human lives
longer healthier easier
Because big companies
want sell AIs
useful you

going buy
help you
The problem AI
capitalist paradigm
its
gonna cheaper

prototype it
In notsodistant future

kinds AIs
dont
humans tell them
invent

transcend
humankind
As today
I
its completely unethical
try develop machine
release it
We chance

You screw up

way
I am
Lets ask
parents are
Right
Chances theyre
gonna military parents
theyre gonna
business parents
If theyre business parents
theyre asking AI

lot money
So theyre teaching greed
Military parents gonna teach kill
Truly superhuman intelligence
much Is super
Its better

country company

winnertakeall advantage
Because theres
arms race AI globally
thats literally
terms building
weapons systems
figuratively
folks like Putin
Chinese saying
dominates AI
gonna dominate economy
21st century
I dont think choice
brakes on
stop developing
researching
We build technology

imbue values
realistically

opposed nation state
The reality
Facebook Google
wanted start army

technologically
superior capabilities
nation
planet
Some AI scientists
concerned
produced
dramatized video
warn risks
Your kids probably
these right
Not quite We produced
Slaughterbot video
illustrate
risk
autonomous weapons
That skill AI
Its flying itself
There people
AI community
wish I shut up
People think making video
little bit treasonous
Just like mobile device
days
cameras sensors
And like phones
social media apps
facial recognition
Up now
arms races tended
bigger powerful
expensive
faster jets cost more
AI means
small cheap weapons
efficient

simple job like
finding crowd
killing you
This works
Every single major advance
human technology
weaponized
And idea weaponized AI
I think terrifying
Trained team
penetrate
buildings cars trains
evade people bullets
They stopped
There lots
weapons kill people
Machine guns
kill people
require
human
carry point them
With autonomous weapons
dont need human
carry
supervise them
You program go
So create effect army
carrying million machine guns
guys truck
Putin said
person develop
strong artificial intelligence
rule world
When world leaders use terms
like rule world
I think gotta pay attention it
Now air strike
surgical precision
Ive campaigning
weapons 2007
theres main
sets arguments
Theres moral arguments
theres arguments
complying
laws war
arguments
change
global security planet
We need new regulations
We need think
now yesterday
Some worlds leaders
artificial intelligence
urging United Nations
ban development
autonomous weapons
known
killer robots
In letter
once developed
they permit
armed conflict fought
at timescales faster
humans comprehend
Im signatory
letter
My philosophy is
I hope governments
world enforce this
long
human life involved
human needs
loop
Anyone 3D printer

lethal
autonomous weapon
If its accessible
planet
compliance example
nearly impossible
track
What hell
doing Stop
Youre shooting air
When youre imagining
waging war future
soldiers robots
pose risk
engagement ourselves
When war
like video game

incrementally already
its real concern
When dont skin game
literally
when run
terminal
thousands miles away
battlefield
that lower bar waging war
point recognize
monsters
Who you
Hey Hey
Having
fighter pilot
I seen
people mistakes
kill innocent people

killed
One day future
reliable
machine
human it
The idea robots
kill humans

science fiction
staple decades
There number
systems already
work autonomously
But thats called
supervised autonomy
somebodys
switch off
Whats
seen Hollywood
soon coming
battlefield near you
The Pentagon investing
billions dollars
develop autonomous weapons
machines day
kill own
But Pentagon insists humans
decide strike
Once AI
military hardware
youve got
decisions
theres point
having it
One benefits AI its
quicker us
Once were proper fight switch
keeps human loop
better switch off
dont
lose
These
battlefield
fast humans
If theres human involved all
command control gone
autonomy
trigger war
finished
20 minutes massive devastation
knew started
So decides
future
now
From Big Bang till now
billions years
This time
person steer
future
humanity
Maybe worry
humans arent wise
handle power
Who actually
going choices

actually speaking
If we rest society
fail actually
join conversation
meaningful way
decision
know values
gonna
superintelligent beings
Red BullYes Deon
Red Bull
Its going decided tech nerds
whove Red Bull drink
I dont think
particular
qualifications speak
behalf humanity
Once
excitement
discovery
Come on
you sort
turn blind eye

moralistic questions
like going
impact society whole
And can
And scientists
pushing forward

genuine benefits
bring
And theyre
really excited
I mean dont
You dont science
because well
couldnt
football player
Hell Ill scientist
You
thats love
its exciting
Its alive
Its alive Its alive
Its alive
Were switching
creation
God
Now I know feels like
God
If study theology
thing learn
case
God
successfully manages
control creation
Were yet
create
artificial general
intelligence
maintain control
If create selfaware AI
thing
its gonna want
independence
At least intelligence
know ourselves
And know wanna
bidding
intelligence
We reason believe
friendly
or
goals aspirations
align ours
So long
theres robot revolution
AI revolution
We world today
absolutely foot race
fast possible
creating
artificial
general intelligence
dont
brakes applied
sight
Its crazy
I think
its important honestly
discuss issues
It
little late
conversation afterwards
Its important remember
intelligence evil
good
Intelligence gives power
We powerful tigers
planet
sharper claws
bigger biceps
were smarter
We
attitude ants
matter bit fish matter bit
humans matter more
Why Because were
intelligent
sophisticated
conscious
Once youve got systems
intelligent us
maybe theyre simply gonna matter more
As humans live
world microorganisms
Theyre life microorganism
nuisance antibiotic
destroy billions once
If artificial intelligence
wouldnt look
little human

limited view
kind like
look microorganisms
Maybe I would
Maybe human insignificance
biggest threat all
Sometimes I talk
AI risk people go
Shh Max
dont talk like that
Thats Luddite
scaremongering
But its scaremongering
Its MIT
safety engineering
I mean think it NASA
launched Apollo 11 moon mission
systematically thought
wrong
bunch people
explosive fuel tanks
launched
help them
Was scaremongering
No precisely
safety engineering
guaranteed
success mission
Thats precisely strategy I think
AGI
Think wrong
sure goes right
I I
movie
A Space Odyssey
Aged 14
eyeopener me
That movie best
science fiction
predictions
AI evolve
But reality
sufficiently
far future
cant imagine
world like
actually cant
sensible
issues are
Worrying
superintelligence safety
little like
worrying
youre
gonna install seat belts
transporter devices
Like Star Trek
zip
place another
Um maybe theres
dangers that

seatbelts right
But its course silly
dont know

transporter technology
look able
seatbelts apply
To
wont problem
unknowns vast
dont know
problem
gonna be
crazy
I think conversation
probably
way forward here
At moment
ourselves
time comes
emerging
artificial intelligences
So soon

remotely ballpark
start trying
conversation
somehow
Dog Dog Yeah
One things hope
Baby X try
better insight
nature
Shes designed
learn autonomously
She plugged
Internet
click webpages
happens
kind learn learn
If
super fantastic AI
help
better versions ourselves
help evolve
It societal effects
Is feared
Or
learn from
So
faced machines
smart
smarter are
I think ways
think
near future AI
I
event horizon
People heard black holes
super dense point
close sucked in
There boundary Once cross
boundary
way back
What makes dangerous cant
tell is
And I think AI technology
gonna like that
point
logic money
power promise

cross boundary

future
There way back
politically economically
terms
want
But need worrying
reach
event horizon
dont know is
I dont think its gonna
happen time soon
The decades
Twentyfive 50 years
A years
Its
decades
Not lifetime
Nobody knows
But doesnt matter
Whether its years
100 years
problem same
Its real
well need
time solve it
History
overhyped tech predictions
Like
flying cars
supposed
here right
But its
opposite
people said
Never gonna happen
Im embarrassed physicist Ernest
Rutherford
greatest nuclear physicists
time said
nuclear energy gonna happen
And day
Leo Szilard invents
nuclear chain reaction
So says
completely sure

gonna happen
its consistent
laws physics
Im like Yeah right
Were yet
We havent built superintelligent AI
And stipulated wont
happen
shorter 50 years now right
So 50 years think this
Well
its written
50 years
time figure
safely
I actually think
its going
extreme negative example
technology
pull
realize
weve got thing
control weve
got constraints
We living
science fiction world
were all
um big kind
social tactical experiment
experimenting ourselves
recklessly
like doctor
dream doing
Were injecting

come
happens
Clearly
thought process is
Youre creating
learning robots
Learning robots exactly
lead Skynet
Now Ive got choice
right I say
Dont worry
Im good job
You fear
I suck
and Im gonna
actually accomplish anything
Or I say You know
Youre right
were gonna die
but its gonna
sort fun watch
and itd good
people
row
So yeah I dont
terrific answer
things
The truth obviously
between
Can inbetween
Or facing
new world order
I colleagues
fine AI taking
causing
human extinction
long feel
AIs
worthy ancestors
In long run humans
going remain
crown creation
But thats okay
Because beauty
grandeur greatness
realizing
tiny
grander scheme
leading universe
lower complexity
higher complexity
We rapidly approaching precipice
human race
ultimate destiny
forebearer true
emergent evolutionary intelligent sort
beings
So
birth
child this
Of machine
Machine civilization
Selfishly
human course
I want humans stick around
But maybe thats local parochial
point view
Maybe viewed point
view universe
its better universe
our
With superintelligent
descendants
Our field
likely succeed
goal achieve
general purpose intelligence
We capability
radically modify
economic structure
world
role human beings
world
and potentially
human control world
The idea
taken
godlike entities
creatures pure energy
intelligence
They
human zoo
The end
astronauts journey
Did travel time
To future
Were godlike entities
descendants HAL
Artificial intelligence
cant switch off
keeps learning
learning
theyre running zoo
universe
everything
Is Kubricks
profound prophecy
Maybe
But old man
If HAL close
us
need pay attention
We need talk AI
Superintelligence
Will conscious
The trolley problem
Goal alignment
The singularity
First market
AI safety
Lethal autonomous weapons
Robot revolution
The hive mind
The transhuman movement
Transcend humankind
We dont plan
dont realize
its necessary
plan
What want
role humans be
