LUCIEN TUCKER ALL TO CHALLENGE
MOSES GUTHRIE AND HIS TEAMMATES
LOS ANGELES CONTROLS THE TIP
A HOOK SHOT NO GOOD FOR LOS ANGELES
REBOUND IS TAKEN OFF THE RIM BY BULLET HAINES
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PISCES TO HIT THE SCOREBOARD FIRST
BOUNCE PASS COMES OVER TO GUTHRIE
HIS PASS INTERCEPTED NICE PLAY BY BILL PINE
NOW DOWN THE FLOOR THEY GIVE IT TO NORM NIXON
THEIR LITTLE POINT GUARD AVERAGING 185 POINTS A GAME
HE GOES TO THE FREE THROW LINE
HIS 15FOOTER IS GOOD
AND LOS ANGELES IS IN FRONT 2 TO NOTHING
IN WHITE THE PISCES ON THIS PSYCHEDELIC FLOOR
ONE OF THE MOST UNUSUAL BASKETBALL FLOORS
MAN WILL EVER SEE
REVEREND JACKSON WITH IT
HIS PASS COMES INSIDE BACK TO JACKSON
UNDERNEATH THE BASKET TRAVELING IS CALLED
OVERPASSING ON THE PLAY
THE PISCES THEY LOOK A LITTLE BIT TENSE
THEY CAME OUT IN A COUPLE OF THE GAMES
IN THE PRELIMINARY ROUNDS OF THE PLAYOFFS THE SAME WAY
BUT RALLIED AND HERE THEY ARE IN THE CHAMPIONSHIPS
KAREEM ABDULJABBAR
A DOMINANT FACTOR IN THE HISTORY OF BASKETBALL
AND OUTSIDE LUCIEN TUCKER BURNS HIS EXTEAMMATE

AND WHEN YOURE IN THAT KIND OF A SITUATION
ITS GONNA BE TOUGH TO CATCH A TEAM
AS GREAT AS THIS LOS ANGELES CLUB
INSIDE A WRESTLING MATCH GOING ON
AND A LOT OF PUSHING AND SHOVING
LETS SEE WHAT HAPPENS
TUCKER REALLY JUMPS IN AND HE KNOCKS HAMMER DOWN
HE KNOCKED HIM DOWN HARD
AND THEY EXCHANGE A FEW UNPLEASANTRIES
THIS BASKETBALL GAME
IS GETTING A LITTLE BIT OUT OF HAND FOR THE PISCES
AND IF THEYRE GOING TO RALLY AND WIN THIS CHAMPIONSHIP
