drained blood The BAT treads calmly past A LEG snakes
out A BLACK BOOT catches EDDIE high chest 
 LIFTS HIM CLEANLY OFF HIS FEET 
 AND SENDS HIM FLYING THROUGH THE AIR EDDIE slams
brick chimney slumps roof unconscious broken
weightless puppet
THIS ACTION IS SO SMOOTH SO AUTOMATIC THAT THE BAT DOES
NOT EVEN BREAK HIS STRIDE NICK sees chance CHARGES
past black wraith scrambling escape
A GLOVED HAND slices air NICK pitches
forward legs ensnared tangle WIRES Screaming
now drags gravel roof looming

THE BAT grabs fistful NICKs shirt
supernatural ease HOISTS HIM air
NICK cont
Dont kill me dont kill me
When NICK finally opens eyes realizes THE BAT
standing ledge roof  HOLDING HIM OUT
arms length stories nothingness
The gruesome black apparition speaks rasping whisper
BATMAN
I wont kill you I want

NICK looks down Far far below CARS wink silently past
He looks up And sees mirrored lenses
BATMANs eyes be twin reflections
stricken face
BATMAN cont
Tell friends Tell

NICK HOWLS Almost afterthought THE BATMAN heaves
roughly roof And  casually
moments hesitation  STEPS OFF THE LEDGE OF THE
ROOF INTO MIDAIR
Trembling NICK crawls ledge looks over
