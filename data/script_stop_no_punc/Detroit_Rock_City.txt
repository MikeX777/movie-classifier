INT MRS BRUCES LIVING ROOM  NIGHT
Decorated Carol Brady chic When its gaudy tacky
loud its blander toast Colors like lime green

MRS BRUCE late 30s enters looking exhausted She carries
glass wine hand book other Erma
Bombecks The Grass Is Always Greener Over The Septic Tank
HUMMING Weve Only Just Begun Mrs Bruce crouches
wildlyancient entertainment center complete 8track
She flips record forward Ronco Record Mate
Album album flaps forward Olivia NewtonJohn Neil
Diamond Osmond Brothers She stops Carpenters
sighs serene cover art Just doctor

Placing vinyl turntable CLICKS dustcover
closed FLICKS Play Reclining Lazyboy sips
wine opens book awaits mellow tones Karen
Carpenter
Suddenly eardrums hammered machine gun GUITAR
Caustic ROCK N ROLL assaults senses She jumps spilling
wine herself This isnt Carpenters
ITS KISS
Racing entertainment center turns volume
control knob violently comes hand The
music louder now
Flustered awful noise tries lifting dustcover
Its stuck She screams covers ears This Hell
Running rear huge console stretches
reach plug cant Fingertips millimeters away
As cacophony POUNDS shakes entire stereo
frantic might
SCREEEEEECH The needle scrapes vinyl
shrill finally coming stop Whew silence
Then POP dustcover opens unceremoniously Shaken
grabs record trembling hands reads label
