Writing Directing Heavenly Creatures
A Talk Frances Walsh Peter Jackson
Peter Jackson Frances Walsh born raised Wellington New Zealand Jacksons film Bad Taste 1988 director period years working photo apprentice local newspaper Jacksons following films Meet Feebles 1990 Braindead 1992 cowritten Walsh Stephen Sinclair hit film festival circuit winning 16 international prizes including best picture award

Robert Zemeckis starring Michael J Fox released 1996 Jackson Walsh live Wellington son Billy
The version Heavenly Creatures published final draft completed March 1993 The screenplay 107 pages long
Fran understanding interested ParkerHulme murder case film subject It popular topic New Zealand
Frances Walsh Well popular topicIm sure that But its certainly piece New Zealand criminal history entered realm myth And young girl growing up I knew it read lurid newspaper accounts Lesbian killers rampage
FW Yes yes And I got hands novel called Obsession I read I 14 I thought time extremely good laughs It takes damning view girlsits written English journalists came cover trial It hack job set sensationalize case
And play wasnt there
FW Yeah theres play nonfiction books written it Theres great deal coverage years newspapers magazines its profile here
Since treated different ways compelled explore subject again
Peter Jackson Well didnt think treated well Nothing read particularly like And also treatments specific agenda attempted political statements murder What interested 15yearold girls agenda accurate possibly could imagine going inside minds
I know Paulines voiceovers film actual diary entries You interesting comment awhile actually informed structure film Could elaborate that
PJ Well structure fairly apparent started research It wasnt diaries themselves general research We read diaries couldwe havent actually seen full unedited diarybut gathered excerpts releasedat time trial could amounted pages And read newspapers interviewed people acts sort materialized neatly You know act girls meet friends turning point end act realize bonded
FW Its delusional experience Port Levy Fourth World You know girls imagination thats going lead interesting happening The second turning point comes decision murder Mother tips
story act
Whom interview cull information
PJ Well went 35 40 people We wanted interview people find Several refused We talk 15 16 classmates experience These 55yearold women spread country changed names theyd gotten married It detective job them
I read school particularly enthusiastic this help locate exstudents
PJ No school didnt want it Christchurch Girls School erased girls history The yearbook class photograph Pauline longer available If school library yearbooks available apart 1953s photo it It sort cleansing books The school didnt recognize trying do redress issue Why wipe girls school records I mean human beings
FW Peter Jim Booth producer movie went headmistress school explained wanted do allowed read script comment was Why cant film pupils proud
PJ We heard sources interviewed day murder happened headmistress time stood assembly said No girl discuss certain matter This was like day pupils murdered somebody couldnt refer directly Forty years later got sense school exactly same And gave reason movie felt people
living 1950s We lot people interviewedthat 40 years gone by presenting attitudes 50s dark sordid little thingthat best kept quiet mentioned Many times got Why earth want film this We forget it hope disappear
And actually thought that But 20 30 years people connected dead point time well know it We felt good time now people alive interviews try accurate record We aware responsibility had film persuasive medium knew that unlike mediumthe newspaper accounts playitcan audience visual images which way replace real event especially werent born time So thought film now people New Zealand look case different way That responsibility felt didnt want lightly
Pertaining quest accuracy reconstructing instance conversations Pauline mother scenes direct documentation
FW Well attempt people involvethe type people were class background etc So degree spoke people knew Riepers example good knowledge girls
Did interview boarders Rieper house
PJ Yeah I did briefly We boarders spoke telephone I interview following day I called ask questions clammed up didnt want talk anymore Hed obviously gone home wife shed
wound thing told shouldnt involved it
FW I think understanding set write able recreate right interiors characters precisely reflect people there Our intention true understood girls friendship nature
friendship nature families girls came It attempt recreate reality We that obviously So went things spirit trying reflect situation reality
PJ The Hulme family lot easier research Paulines family Hulmes public figures time Henry Hulme rector local university obviously lot university people talk professors studentswho worked him Hilda Hulme public figure They were respects royalty Christchurch English class exist there things seriouslyThere garden tennis parties Ilam lot people social contact parents Juliet time
The research actually carried shooting film I remember England auditioning actresses Juliet Kate Winslet the late Anthony Quayle English actor actually visited Hulmes Christchurch 50s tracked wife spoke her The research kept going time We trips Christchurch research started working film moved
nearly months ideal opportunity others Wed hear things person sat Pauline typing class wed rush them
Im sure production got certain notice local media people probably approached you
PJ To extent hoped Paulines people actually difficult research werent public private people
FW We heard subsequently Paulines sister Wendy seen film She lives Christchurch Her meets film managed capture atmosphere home time criticism family better that portrayed shabby light And touched me
PJ She thought portrayal tension Pauline mother accurate It nice Wendy key people alive refuses talk it She absolutely refuses journalists anyone actually sweet message us It amazing gone film She thought good incredibly difficult watch
In gathering material Im sure certain things didnt fit dramatically Was tempted use didnt sensationalistic ethically questionable
PJ There area deliberately steered clear felt ultimately didnt relation wanting tell Rieper household actually younger sister named Rosemary Downs syndrome alive Wendy looks her At time murder Rosemary 8 years old This Honoras life difficult daughter lived special home come home weekends Pauline writes Rosemary lot diaries fond her But area felt invasive privacy family
As say bit stuff leave structural reasons Paulines diaries very funny We ended lot dramatic material movie scenes shes talking murder suicide unfortunately leave lot funny things out She records hilarious conversations Juliet had its witty
Sometimes diary entries dramatized them opposed voiceover Like sequence Fourth World hilltop changes magical landscape That described diary So case having selective end day dramatic selections movie funnier stuff
The girls  sense humor manage come film though Im thinking instance scene Rieper house family having lunch Juliet girls HONORA
Victoria Park Were snide comments Sir Edmund Hillary diary invented you
FW That imagination We told extremely jolly mealit actually court recordsand cracking jokes saying silly outrageous things sort giggly high And knew Wendy worked Farmers localdepartment store big news year Sir Edmund Hillary New Zealander climbing Mt Everest He knighted huge national hero is Because hed spent time Christchurch felt appropriate thing
send up did terribly irreverent If Queen visiting example wouldnt bother note decorations pomp ceremony enrich royal celebrations They respect icons day interior world important them
The film critic Time Richard Corliss likened physician assumes patients fever order understand illness At point decide going presented girls point view
PJ I think beginning That motivations it None accounts came girls point view Like wed said before agendas felt telling girls story important It long time able that took long time learn were driving them We bit confusedthere bit mystery beginningbut read talked people gradually began formulate people were Ultimately lot Pauline I recognize myself useful
You too Fran
FW I felt diary offered insight friendship Pauline particular It extremely interesting account life documenting dramatic mundane events great deal literary flair She imaginative funny clever young woman pretentious ideas teenagers do I warmed immediately Reading diary wonder huge discrepancies young woman monster portrayed newspaper accounts else And I thought great journey was Because diary Juliets survivedwe heard people diary destroyedI thought harder know her wasnt case appeared readily shared life people social creature Pauline So combination private world shared understanding got talking school friends inparticular gave insight nature girls way appeared rest world
I think its fair Peter I felt hugely sympathetic Pauline Juliet start identify empathize them trying balance knowledge terrible act It dynamic liking them feeling abhorrence theyd done kept thing alive long minds gave film inner life
Peter camera work films youve directed extremely dynamic In Heavenly Creatures hyperactive camera organic relationship girls euphoric state Ive noticed script lot camera directions written in screenplays Ive read Do scripts read like this
PJ In particular screenplay camera movement came readily writing stages At end day script document want sell its document cast crew read When write script intended direct its right beginning shooting script document technicians use You know grips circle word DOLLY remember particular day shooting theyre going truck With movie probably Ive done camera moves integral scriptwriting Ill tell came from music We read early research Pauline Juliet obsessed Mario Lanza Neither familiar music went got records started writing played came songs liked One ones heard The Donkey
Serenade FW Well knew important Pauline named novels The Donkey Serenade
PJ When heard it life vitality song immediately indicated Steadicam laughs It immediately told moving camera We chose songs movie and case The Donkey Serenade wrote scenes them I great visual tool Its happened Ive doneI mean Ive music advance We songs playing working psyched write scene At time music helped visualize visualization ended going page Of course actually arrive set actors camera people there things change I dont regard thats written script terms camera direction asbeing locked stone
How long finish draft
PJ Not long I think draft written probably 10 12 weeks But didnt start write wed uncovered months worth research
And draft were publishing shooting script
PJ Yeah I think thats draft number five We interesting thing We certain research first working Braindead Dead Alive US wrote
draft position felt knew facts lot gaps We thought wrote draft know holes were know pursue terms research For instance Fran I Christchurch wrote draft Christchurch integral story Then trip second draft able modify lot things interview lot people We actually purpose wanted nail story overlaying lot historical detail
How handle writing collaboratively
PJ Well depends You know Frans working rewrites were shooting Im set shell work shes I come home well revise together generally were actually writing initial drafts script its together
I think good understanding structure helps Im obviously visually oriented Fran good dialogue character complement well I think best advantage writing scripts write script I make is I think wonderful thing It strange experience write script going make weve actually experienced loss control writers have So right beginning its movie Its piece writing thats going marketplace sell
Just little thing Even Heavenly Creatures written us favorite scene movie written Fran herself
Which that
PJ Well late night hoping finish draft scriptit was like oclock alreadyand arrived sequence tearooms theyre having cup tea walk track We sat wondering earth going write scene We knew theyd actually gone tea wed spoken elderly woman served them She said talking calmly another But dialogue mouths particular moment womans murdered Well phone rang I got answer ended stuck 45 minutes I came Fran written something She asked check out revised its slides plate cake Honora says Go on Mother treat yourself It perfect
I know Kate Winslet audition England How come Melanie Lynskey played Pauline I understand professional actress
PJ Well its stories sounds like its true We wanted cast New Zealand wed auditioned lot peoplefive hundredwho videotaped photographed I wanted young 1S 16 years old I didnt want 23yearold school uniform And wanted physically like original Pauline I thing accurate possible So quickly exhausted professional actors New Zealand happened look like Paulinetheres two laughs We knew looking experience them We kept saying Somewhere New Zealand theres somebody whos perfect roleWe actually weeks away beginning shooting people short list happy with coming enormous pressure cast them because know wardrobe department needed costumes
on Fran said me Youre happy choices you And I said No And said This crazy weve spent time energy film havent Pauline This close major tragedy I Christchurch Fran decided drive casting person lower half North Island New Zealandshe prepared drive far to Theyd visit small town local school visit principals office photo Pauline Parker Shed say Were making movie Pauline Parker pupils school resemble interested this
FW We rusting Ford Cortina official ID Wed roll provincial schools wed greeted curious teacher Although questioned authenticity asked car If youre films arent driving
Porsche both laugh So I pitch story entire classroom scanning room time looking sullen brooding school girls thinking What look like hair dyed black
PJ I guess went week Every night Id Fran Anyone vaguely appropriate videotaped I got couple tapes Christchurch bit depressing Finally Fran called small town called New Plymouth said I think Ive interesting  And Mel We flew Christchurch gave audition screen test cast weeks film started shooting I called mother Friday night said Id like Melanie film And said When start And I said Well shes got come Sunday The poor girl didnt chance school clean locker
Do think correspondence actresses backgrounds characters playing
PJ One things knew Pauline incredibly witty intelligent Melanie similarshe student province subjects And knew cast intelligent person going hit it Melanies enigmatic The character Pauline doesnt enormous dialogue In sense real Pauline Parker speaks her diaries So looking actress kind aspect thats real moviestar thing film somebody sitting room nothing theyre fascinating watch We Mel
Ive read actual locations this
PJ As could The location couldnt use Paulines house torn down Fortunately school community center actual school moved different location longer control buildings wed definitely refused
permission The school buildings owned Christchurch City Council them theyre 40 years ago They rent rooms community groups We classroom Pauline Juliet actually in Canterbury
Womens Embroidery Guildit sounds like Monty Pythonand went room right length wall huge tapestry stretched massive frame I thought want down managed it So actual classroom were seatingThe Ilam house Juliet lived there Its owned university happy use it As doctors surgery Pauline interviewed doctor address andyou know 40 years later idea expectit just like suburban house We thought strange didnt like doctors office Anyway knocked door woman answered happened doctors daughterthe doctors long deadand asked fathers office been said Oh rooms house here weve touched them We went doctors surgery exactly 40 years before So ended filming sequences actual room Pauline interviewed doctorWe spoke woman working tearooms Victoria Park exactly sitting filmed scene there Actually months later building demolished
And murder scene
PJ Well went murder site felt uncomfortable filming there It strange maybe imagination quiet tranquil I mean way path hear wind birds suddenly arrive spot hear nothing So filmed murder scene Victoria Park different track yards away
There sequence scenes script didnt appear film begins tennis party Ilam Pauline Juliet watching shrubbery Walter Perry Hilda Hulme play tennis
PJ Well sequence actually shot exists version film screened New Zealand When Miramax released film US screenings felt film long We final control film pleaded 10 minutes worth footage convinced tighter We looked it actually ultimately agreed funny sort way That sequence slows momentum down Its fun
readand its fun film wellbut slow things point didnt think things slowing down Although weve control films release world weve requested sequence cut versions screened country When youre writing script thinks Oh perfect mustnt change word it its finished takes life own We felt sequence wasnt telling wedidnt know characters time tension Paulines house growing going Juliets house watch tennis game necessary
FW I think wrote script felt Pauline Juliets story After edit however evident Paulines story line audiences focal point Whenever veered telling Hulme story Pauline wasnt screen pace started flag That look assemblywe trim cut Hulme scenes werent fundamentally interesting Rieper scenes
Although film different Braindead place New Zealand 1950s Im familiar country watching films I assume was period fairly repressive kind society acting breeding ground transgression explosive kinds behavior
PJ Well script Braindead set modern day minute I worried going movie hero film named Lionel acted fairly nerdy kind wayhe doesnt socialize takes care motherand wanted empathetic character film I afraid set modern day audienceespecially young audiencewould jeer character able relate all If set inthe 50s people actually feel sympathy him think Well sort thing happened then With Heavenly Creatures coincidence actual event taken place then
FW But repression evidence here were I expressive were demonstrative were scared showing saying much When New York instance people yelling horns blaringif happened here theircar rip open door bash up Theres level violence subtext violence running New Zealand society comes movies We veneer easygoing underneath were rage Its interesting social dynamic makes interesting art its pleasant actually live it Its link England PJ Christchurch particular
FW Christchurch suffers city New Zealand Its described a little piece England its considered English England Its aspired that ways
PJ The thing murder too sense talk older generation Christchurch embarrassment city shameful humiliating Which ridiculous story ultimately family tragedy
FW Its said Christchurch appalled revelation Paulines parents married murder itself And uncharitable souls suggested sinful act led other
Speaking generally films certain love campiness apparent use caricatures characters overall sort extremism reminiscent work like John Waters US Whats interesting Heavenly Creatures remains fundamentally realistic docudrama figures authority like doctor vicar headmistress hilariously overplayed
PJ Well I like movies entertaining little larger life With like Braindead obviously theres problem that But Heavenly Creatures telling hoped fairly accurate story At time however I wanted movie I didnt want totally tied real life totally dull So little bit fun characters I guess trying justify presenting girls point view thats strictly true I think people needed realistic with Juliet Pauline slightly larger life anyway Thats came interviews classmates They remembered sort terrifying Juliet confident loud Pauline brooding dark So sense film perfect us I dont Like stuff thats totally naturalistic I like having little bit fun
The fantasy sequences written pretty appeared film Were aware how technically going handle special effects writing
PJ Pretty much We hadnt optical digital effects Braindead Heavenly Creatures I knew I actually wrote digital effects script great excuse new equipmentI special effects company So right beginning wrote stuff morphing We got hired figure worked
What use Plasticine figures Was youd heard girls interested in
PJ Yeah interviewed people remembered model figures Plasticine I think HERBERT
Rieper refers court testimony We interviewed old guy round Hulmes place seen Juliets Plasticine horses mantelpiece
And course endless passages diaries Borovnia Diello murderous prince that When thought fun right beginning fantasy sequences thing I wanted dress actors medieval costumes
crowns looking like school play So decided fun tie Plasticine figures Borovnia together And knew theyd sculpted figures like Diello thought figures come life were
What linking certain actors certain figures like Orson Welles Diello
PJ Well devised ourselves But again springs fact girls pet names people Like boarders diary instance referred John while changed Nicholas
Thats referred scene Paulines sleepout
PJ Yeah reason Pauline refers Nicholas rest diary That happened lot people They clearly real live people prototypes fantasy characters We figured Diello lot qualities fear Orson Welles He represent sort dark sexual force figured giving features figure Diello appropriate
Could talk fact that production Anne Perry mystery writer outed  Juliet Hulme
FW Well start We knew possible outcome making filmthat try track Pauline Juliet Which good reason movie We compelling reasons film however didnt anotherone going anyway There were time film funded competing projects states preparation
Didnt Dustin Hoffman works
FW His company Punch Productions I believe script written American writer Peter had fact tentatively approached read it it At point week away starting shoot And trying film version play weve spoken of people developing politicized lesbian version story Then thered screenplay written late English novelist Angela Carter production company Auckland Australia developing screenplay So knew story going come screen soonthere doubt going it And felt that climate proceed despite possibility women exposedWe knew Paulines case likely Wed heard lot rumor gossip Juliet wed heard Pauline I think carefully hidden identity Juliet went trouble took stepfathers nameHilda Hulme ended marrying Walter Perryas novelist proceeded write series crime novels You look contemporary author index library Anne Perry birthdate Juliet Hulmes mothers maiden same etc There gap personal history leaves New Zealand picks left country So didnt huge detective work journalist New Zealand heard Anne Perry JulietHulme same
That rumor sprang production play gone year started shooting friend Juliets writing her confided actors Juliet Hulme writing murder mysteries Anne Perry That rumor hew acting community New Zealand reached ears set wanted entirely disassociate from knew damage film knew damage us It inevitable accused exploiting womans situation order promote movie When journalist rang Peter asked comment story begged print it Of course hopeless situation tabloid hack going ahead name dined since We felt enormous dread movie hadnt chance stand known its inextricably linked revelation So weve battling since But given its happened weve deal it has

Did fever consider coordinates actual event changing particulars push fictional realm
PJ No case wellknown New Zealand like
FW Fictionalizing OJ Simpson case
PJ Its unnecessary I mean sure movie international consumption then yeah But fact werent actually making film international audience We
making try rectify 40 years misunderstanding case New Zealand In way main motivation making film that obviously use real names But having said that Pauline Parker Juliet Hulme ceased exist people 1959 took different names In sense I dont think moral problem names stopped 30odd years ago
Were films looked inspiration writing this
FW Well looked movies like Let Him Have It based CraigBentley murder case England Bentley 18yearold low IQ hanged murder Although I think film lot merit end comes grim dark truelife murder
story similarly Dance Stranger Ruth Ellis the woman hanged England We felt thing didnt want do depressing murder film We wanted tell tale friendship murder story Sure movie ends murder part celebrates friendship
PJ We wanted lot funnier films And people said Its subject try funny Well obviously murder wasnt funny attempted funny friendship funny Life funny generally human beings
like enjoy themselves doubt Pauline Juliet hell good time time
FW But reason important tell true story kind universal truth anybody growing up When youre age focused things extreme way And I dont think Pauline Juliet different anybody else I think things went wrong livesJuliets parents broke up Pauline alienated family she obsessional manicdepressive characterand I think terriblecombination things led extraordinarily horrible act But its precluded anybodys experience growing up Adolescence crazy time
PJ A lot women come said I Pauline That me That childhood I dont think its unusual I think unusual thing aspects Paulines character led murder I dont think sort person particularly unusual freakish weird When hear things like that its best possible endorsement get
