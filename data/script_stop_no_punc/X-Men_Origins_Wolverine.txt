KAYLA contd
Leave us Keep walking till
feet start bleed
Stryker turns walks away
Kayla crawls Logan She lifts head lap
Hes unconscious breathing The bullet holes skin
healed She strokes jaw smiles sadly
One scraps paper base blows
leg She takes looks blank page
She pen She touches chest heart
wetting finger blood
She writes words page blows dry it
folds places Logans hand
She kisses lips rests head gently ground
Fighting pain dying woman Kayla manages stand

He sits up looking around The woods empty
He stands completely disoriented stranger world
He realizes hes holding piece paper hand
He unfolds reads message written blood

He stares moment folding carefully
