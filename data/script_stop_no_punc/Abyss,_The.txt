And payoff shot WERE HIGH LOOKING DOWN THE SPIRES FORM A

PERFECT RING A MILE ACROSS A VAST DARK FORM LIKE A GREAT SHADOW RISES FROM

THE DEPTHS BENEATH THE SHIPS THE SPIRES ARE CONNECTED IT IS ALL ONE

THE NTI ARK

It surfaces slow majesty gently beaching ships broad

back We recognize structure Bud led angelic

being assumed city The Explorer rocks gently flat

hull clunking massively settles

The bridge crew watch millions tons seawater streaming

vast slightly curved hull The missile cruiser rocks forth

nearby high dry prop whining futility

ON EXPLORERS DECK McBride Bendix DeMarco rest Navy

She blinks Seeing far away She gives little laugh

laughing crying

REVERSE Bud walks curving incline mouthlike

enterances NTI structure His suit casually unzipped FBS

helmet dangles hand jauntily

She starts him Breaks run Then stops feet him

Watching come her

His smile eyes illuminating her

He stops touches him lightly Is real

The look other wonderingly moment

Then laugh She sniffs loudly

LINDSEY
