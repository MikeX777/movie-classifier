DISSOLVE TO
EXT CEMETARY  LAUREN AND ALEXS GRAVES
XCLOSE JOURNAL A nottooloopy feminine hand writing
words hearing
ERINS VOICE
When I think Lauren fighting
dying tears apart
reassures me That Lauren
Alex meant other
REVEAL Erin writing journal shes radically
transformed wild child
A shock vividly colored dreadlocks holes
stitched mouth shut kept permanently open studs
ERINS VOICE CONTD
That theyre now Fighters
United love And anger That
theyve given me
Shes leaning new headstone
Alex Corvis 19811999 Always With Us
ERIN
I love Alex As sister
hoped I would And I love Lauren
And I know this

Thinking them Hoping that
sometimes theyre thinking me
Erin stops writing closes journal stands She takes
Locket neck drapes Alexs headstone
like Laurens
She stares moment puts index finger
lips transfers kisses stones And leaves
THE END
