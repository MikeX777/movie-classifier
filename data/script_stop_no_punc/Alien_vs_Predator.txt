gear ramp It touches bayou scarcely whisper
HIROKO watches PREDATORS file slowly out BROKEN TUSKs body
borne aloft carried inside The LEAD PREDATOR turns
HIROKO He crosses her HIROKOs face reflected faceted
eyepieces PREDATORs helmet
The extraterrestrial hunter pulls telescopic spear KERCHUNK
The tips lock place The PREDATOR offers HIROKO She
accepts little confused
Theres long moment The PREDATOR standing there Waiting
HIROKOs eyes narrow Her mind working furiously What
want
She realises It suddenly clear She smiles
HIROKO
Yeah Why not
HIROKO glances hovering DROPSHIPS walks
waiting PREDATOR shuttlecraft looking back
The PREDATOR follows her The ramp SLAMS closed we
CUT TO BLACK
THE END
