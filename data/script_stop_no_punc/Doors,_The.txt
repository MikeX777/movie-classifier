INT RECORDING SESSION LAST SESSION  LA  DEC
The bearded POET hunches chair exhausted clutching
paper finished Pause He downs final shot grunts
Indian Ghostman sitting stool watching
corner studio The Ghostman laughs but
comes mouth His wrinkled eyes happy
feathered ponytail nods pleased
MORRISON
Well didja that
GHOSTMAN
You good Jim  rest
The ENGINEER exhausted doesnt feel funny
ENGINEER
Yeah I got Jim
The poets face brightens A small eversosweet smile
triumph hikes corners mouth
JIM
Aw right Lets tacos
He stands sways moves view The bottle
whiskey sands run out left behind
As FADE OUT hardy mischievous Morrison laugh
ripple sensuous MUSIC carry lilting lamenting
strains AN AMERICAN PRAYER  THE END lyrics

INT PARIS BEDROOM  NEAR DAWN NIGHT 1971
PAMELA agitated sleep  waking feels
watching Is him At door A SHADOW  leaves
Footsteps moving narrow Parisian corridor
creaky floor
PAM
Jim you
Looks time Somewhere near dawn The sounds bath
drawn Nightmare sleep She tries fade
sleep MUSIC WHISPERING prod her pull
awake
DISSOLVE SAME FACE  AN HOUR LATER
Putting robe on slippers light moving She
ravaged looking before
INT BATHROOM  DAWN
She finds now His face floating upwards angelic eyes
beard gone little smile face He
playing joke Although knows
says words
PAM
Jim It you I know
its you
moving closer
Come baby tub
mamall dry off
pause
Jim Morrison stop joking
hear me cut out
His face At peace sobs MUSIC cresting Jims

severed garden know pale
wanton thrillful comes death
strange hour Unannounced unplanned

angels all And gives wings
shoulders smooth
ravens claws
