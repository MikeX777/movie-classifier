INT FAMILY ROOM  MORNING
WE ARE IN THE FAMILY ROOM THE HIGH PITCHED RINGING SOUNDS

THE BREATHING IS JOINED BY THE HISSING OF GAS AS ITS BEING
RELEASED
THE CREATURE FORCES POISON GAS OUT INTO MORGANS UNCONSCIOUS
FACE
THE ROOM IS ENGULFED WITH STREAMS OF SUNLIGHT FROM THE BROKEN
WINDOWS THE LIGHT SEEMS TO CATCH CERTAIN THINGS IN THE ROOM
AND MAKE THEM STAND OUT THINGS ON SHELVES THINGS ON

GLASSES OF WATER RESTING ON THE TELEVISION FALL AND SPILL
OVER THE EDGE  RIGHT ONTO ITS FACE
