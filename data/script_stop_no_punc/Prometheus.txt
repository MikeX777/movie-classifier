EXT EARTH  DAY 12000 BC
The world turns us vast slow
A RUMBLE A shadow sweeps land We
shadow We cast shadow
Landscapes slide by Reduced altitude abstractions
river deltas forests flood plains A raw natural world
No trace civilization
The shadow glides mountains glaciers Across
ocean pale beach Over lowland plain foot
VOLCANIC MOUNTAIN stops
EXT LOWLAND PLAIN  DAY
THREE FIGURES walk shadow
They men  men Their skin snowwhite
Their features heavy classical  Rodins Thinker
risen seat Their smooth heads earless
hairless Their glittering eyes entirely black
Against stark land height impossible judge
They ENGINEERS
Two cloaked dark robes strange design
The naked
One cloaked Engineers opens featureless black box
inside lies cake dark sticky material
The naked lifts dark cake ceremonial slowness
It hums buzzes Foams iridescent spheres He raises
seething cake mouth like sacrament
BLACK SCARABS boil dark material Swarm
lips Glittering insects chitter bite
Under swarm lips melt away A horrific vision
teeth black blood dissolving bone They devouring him
FLASH ON
A fevered glimpse microscopic cells rupture
bleed Protein chains unfold A DNA spiral unravels

The scarabs bellies genetic material
THE ENGINEER
spreads arms Stands cruciform nearly headless
The scarabs swarm shoulders chest When reach
hips collapses sideways toppling majestically like
felled tree Engulfed
The cloaked Engineers watch impassively
Behind them vast black SHIP hangs sky
As blown great gust wind scarabs disperse
millions directions Living DNA wing
Where sacrificial victim fell remains
EXT FOREST  DAY
A pristine wilderness The VOLCANIC MOUNTAIN distance
A PRIMITIVE WOMAN stands height staring amazement
far great dark ship hovers plain
A black scarab lands neck Bites deep
Injecting cargo DNA blood
FLASH ON
A microscopic invasion Cells pierced infused DNA
strands twining mating
CLOSE ON THE WOMAN
Pupils dilating shock breath hissing lungs
She slaps neck Looks hand The scarab
lies palm
As watches crumbles dust blows away
