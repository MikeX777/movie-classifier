Once stept street
And lips
Laid long pipe smooth
straight cane
And ere blew notes
sweet soft notes
musicians cunning
Never gave enraptured air 
There rustling like
bustling
Of merry crowds justling pitching
hustling
Small feet pattering wooden
shoes clattering
Little hands clapping little
tongues chattering
And like fowls farmyard
barley scattering
Out came children running
All little boys girls
With rosy cheeks flaxen curls
And sparkling eyes teeth like
pearls
Tripping skipping ran merrily
The wonderful music shouting
laughter
Inside barn SAM NICOLE engaged sexual
embrace The camera glides past NICOLEs voice

mountainside
A wondrous portal opened wide
As cavern suddenly
hollowed
And Piper advanced
children followed
And
