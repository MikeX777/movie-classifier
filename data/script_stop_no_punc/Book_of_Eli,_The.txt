EXT FOREST  DAWN
Bare hell The trees stripped bark white
like ghosts Some torn violently roots felled
STARK GRAY SUNLIGHT shafts trees clouded
creeping fog obscures true color everything A
LIGHT SNOW flutters The world monochrome lifeless cold
A CAT prowls dead earth Barely recognizable
domestic breed been Its fur mangy
rank body ribthin starvation Entirely feral
It moves slowly cautiously Sniffing air scanning
forest alert Trusting surroundings It paces
leafstrewn clearing closing stealthily on
A DEAD MAN splayed facedown earth His feet bare
Face frozen grim death mask A GAPING GUNSHOT WOUND
head dried blood caked matting hair
As cat moves closer approaching warily
POV FROM ACROSS THE CLEARING
About thirty yards away Someone watching Waiting SLOW
DEEP BREATHS heard GASMASK RESPIRATOR
CLOSE ON A PAIR OF INDUSTRIAL GOGGLES
The MIRRORED LENSES reflecting forest clearing locked
cat The slow metered breathing continues
THE CAT slows continues pacing corpse More
cautious ever It inches forward sniffing body
ON THE WATCHER Crouched mangled stump felled
tree Concealed beneath camouflaging mesh leaves twigs
bracken A ghillie suit kind snipers
THE CAT sniffs dead mans hand frozen death
grotesquely contorted claw The animal unsure Looks
again checking surroundings predators
THE WATCHER moves imperceptibly The leaves covering
rustle slightly hear  barely 
familiar creaking sound BOW STRING BEING DRAWN TAUT
THE CAT hears it Looks up alert Staring right
watcher camouflaged seen An
interminable tense BEAT  prey going flee
Finally cat turns attention carcass
nibbling gingerly flesh mans fingers

THE WATCHER looses arrow It sails clearing
SKEWERS THE CAT clean through It drops ground
THE WATCHER STANDS shaking ghillie suit revealing

FIGHTING TO THE DEATH  bites claws desperately him
Eli struggles violently cat wrestling
ground grabbing HUNK OF FALLEN BRANCH He holds
writhing animal CLUBS IT lays still
He sits back breathing harder dustmask allow
He yanks down revealing dirty unshaven face beneath
Impossible tell age certainly young man
For moment sits there Then bundles dead cat
