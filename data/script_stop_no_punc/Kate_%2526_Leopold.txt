The music changes A LIVELY CHARLESTON Leopold heaves
sigh relief makes way crowd
staircase
The dancers intricate maze dead end
turn Kate searches male face
In foreground Leopold stopped woman midway
stairs As chat Leopold reaches picks
muddy slipper offering her She turns huff
flouncing stairs
Simultaneously background Kate desperately looks
Leopold
Leopold studies slipper makes way stairs
He slows down hesitates STOPS Very slowly turns
around He still TEARS eyes
The ballroom clock strikes MIDNIGHT
Kate climbs opposite staircase better view
STOPS In heart SHE KNOWS Slowly turns Leopold
stands quietly stairs gazing
her He extends arm showing THE RING He offers
hand
The crowd room THE WORLD AROUND THEM DISAPPEAR Their
eyes lock As descends staircase THE YEARS MELT
AWAY Kates short hair grows long cascading
shoulders The fine lines Leopolds face gone
They others eyes moment
youth fell love
Leopold bends down places slipper Kates foot He
rises looks hands Kate His hands
caked mud She smiles helplessly Not caring
wraps arms tightly her
MUSIC begins play slow waltz He nods her She takes
deep breath Her head bobs rhythm She begins count
silently Leopold smiles counting along
THEY DANCE
An elderly couple watch Leopold interest
LORD WHITEHEAD
Who dancing Leopold
LADY WHITEHEAD
Ive seen before
Kate Leopold dance past They older As gaze
others eyes twirl THE LOOK OF YOUTH RETURNS
At center floor stop dancing THEY KISS The
rest world dances them
Over background THE SCRAPBOOK PICTURES BLEED ONTO
SCREEN
The old formal wedding photo photograph Kate
Leopold perfect bride groom discreetly
point rings
Kate stands Leopold establishes scholarship
studies physics
The old photograph Leopold Albert Einstein changes
include Kate waving smiling broadly camera
The professional photograph double portrait It
shows 70s sitting regally matching
chairs They hold hands smile serenely Staring directly
camera rings
SLOWLY scrapbook closes
Kate Leopold dance music swells lost
crowd The clock CHIMES Slowly we
FADE OUT
THE END
