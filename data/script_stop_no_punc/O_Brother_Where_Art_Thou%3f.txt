O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU
O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU
By
Ethan Coen Joel Coen
BLACK
In black hear chaingang chant voices together
spaced unison strike picks rock A
title burns in
O muse
Sing me tell story
Of man skilled ways contending
A wanderer harried years end
On sound impact cut to
A PICK
splitting rock
As chant continues wider angles chaingang
work They black men bleached faded stripes
chained together working brutal midday sun
It flat delta countryside straightruled road
stretches infinity Mounted guards shotguns lazily
patrol line
The chaingang chant regular and seems timeless
We slowly fade out returning
BLACK
The voices fades
After long beat hear guitar introduction Harry
McClintocks The Big Rock Candy Mountain
A WHEAT FIELD
A road cuts middle background Noonday sun beats
down
We hear distant picks shovels men work
see rising ground level occasional upraised pick
spade heaving dirt Men digging ditch alongside
road
After long beat men pop wheat field
middle foreground They wear faded stripes grey duck
billed caps They scurry abreast camera throwing
occasional glance ditchdiggers A clanking
sound accompanies run Oddly wheat
sweeps run After brief sprint drop
wheat
In background man enters frame left strolling
road wearing khaki uniform sunglasses shotgun
resting shoulder He glances idly
ditch strolls frame right
The men rise wheat and clanking
resume sprint
THREE PAIRS OF EYES
They topped cap bills peer
blind greenery We hear distant whistling
The men looking weathered barn A young boy
whistling heading road leads away
barn jiggling traces old plough horse leads
him He turns corner gone
BARNYARD
The clanking men we leg irons
awkwardly chasing chicken yard The squawking
yardbird doesnt need elude bunched
men
COUNTRY LANE
It curves gentle S background It sun
dappled pretty
We hear clanking footsteps approaching trot
The men enter foreground trot
lane The leftmost flapping chicken tucked
arm
AFTERNOON CAMPFIRE
The men sit sidebyside arc dying fire
contentedly picking teeth small chicken
bone wiping grease chin sleeve
idly poking spit
Each them bound chains clinks moves
One abruptly cocks head listening
The notice attitude freeze listening
We hear distant baying hounds
ROLLING HILLS
From high ridge chained men running

In addition clanks hear distant chugging sound
TRACKING
Laterally clanking running feet
The chugging sound loud
RUNNING
Next freight train A boxcar door open
INSIDE THE BOXCAR
The lead convict hooks elbow starts hauling
up clanking friends keeping pace outside
Six hobos sit boxcar lounging sacks
ODaniels Flour They impassively watch convict clamber
confederates run up
The convict hauls feet In spite stubble
carefully tended hair pencil mustache He

The hobos stare
Everett gives ingratiating smile as him second
convict starts haul boxcar
convict keeping pace outside
EVERETT

arts straitened circumstances
forced life aimless
wanderin
The convict running outside boxcar door stumbles
disappears middle convict yanked immediately
after Everett finishing speech flips forward
turn smashes chin floor sucked
open doorway clawing fingernails leaving parallel grooves
boxcar floorboards
The hobos impassively watch
OUTSIDE
The men tumble clanking track embankment
Squush  come rest swampland bottom
They shake heads clear rise feet

Everett makes sudden hushing gesture listen
The baying hounds louder now hear
distant scrape metal metal like workings
rusty pump The men turn unison look track
A small distant form moving slowly track
