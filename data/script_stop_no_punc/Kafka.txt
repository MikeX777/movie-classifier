PRAGUE  MORNING
The Old Town quiet Its early twisted
streets ancient ghetto Dark corners casting
medieval spell modern century oblivious
romance mystery
The River dividing line Elegant gardens
opposite bank embracing monotonous solemnity New
Town tower steeples silhouetted sombre sky
An motor bus rattles deserted street
A Gothic bridge links halves strange city
Its halfmoon arches circles meet
reflections water Thin mist swirls
cobblestones above
A boats water Fishermen casting lines
silence One lights burning buildings beyond
In Old Town Square great clock cathedral
strikes six
CUT
A MANS FACE
His eyes filled terror beads sweat crawling
brow
He stands middle murky courtyard perfectly
still Waiting Watching
The balconies overlooking successive floors looming
him empty All quiet
The mans EDUARD He dares fear
missing single sound And hears it A small noise
movement nearby He runs
TINY ALLEYWAY
He runs dim light deserted morning
CROOKED PASSAGEWAY
Running life
NARROW LANE
Running sheer pumping fear long verge
collapse
BLACK TUNNEL
Coming light means danger
allows brief pause gasping air
moment looking gloom starting retreat
does turning running 
WINDING STREET
He runs on past boardedup houses shuttered inns
strange relics Middle Ages casting frightening
shadows
AROUND A CORNER
Eduard appears suddenly quickly flattens
large notice board covers wall here
layers expressionistic theatre film posters pasted
it
He breathes painfully short bursts silently
can He watches corner hes come from ornate
archway pursuer emerge
Nothing there But shadow moves
Eduards shoulders tense His eyes widen He holds
breath
The shadow  spreading 
Eduard edges away slowly keeping unblinking gaze
archway backing off arm brushing notice
board feels way it macabre images
posters torn incomplete revealing fragments
behind Eduards eyes staring constant noise
A HAND clamps face behind All sudden
absolutely thing
it
But tries hands coming grip arm grasps
him arm iron
The hand huge It covers Eduards face entirely
eye gaping bloodshot fingers ghastly
fingers that second inhuman
fingers incompatible hand hand
covered scar tissue starting squeeze pulls
Eduard swiftly away

step step hands flailing finding
clutch onto screaming going unheeded
lonely sleeping city
The Laughing Man drags on slippery ledge

sewer alongside wall Vagrants cries choked
stagnant water continuing Laughing Man drags
dark tunnel bridge
disappearing blackness again combined
SHRIEKING louder ECHOES horribly
damp stone dimming deeper away
unseen screaming laughter longer
