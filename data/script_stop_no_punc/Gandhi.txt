FUNERAL PYRE  EXTERIOR  DAY

Blackness Silence

A moment  sense blackness moving  like dark smoke

The camera pulling slowly tell

blackness smoke rising fire

And funeral pyre And

pyre mass silent humanity Through smoke

sitting crosslegged near rim flames

Nehru Azad Patel Mirabehn Kallenbach

drawn faces Lord Lady Mountbatten Manu Abha

THE RIVER  EXTERIOR  DAY

A helicopter shot coming slowly wide river low

barge mass people distance

And barge covered flowers

Flowers flow downstream it An urn sits 

containing Gandhis ashes  Nehru stands near it Azad

Patel little him And barge floats

river Nehru bends lifts urn

Featuring Nehru He swallows restraining emotion

slowly ritualistically sprinkles ashes

water

And spread hold stretch river

flowers swirling languidly dark timeless

current moves sea

GANDHIS VOICE

weak struggling

spoke words

Mirabehn

There tyrants

murderers  time

invincible But end

fall Think  always

When doubt

Gods way way world meant

be think that

And slowly camera begins pulling back leaving

flowers brown rolling current leaving

story Gandhi going far out away great river

reaching higher higher streaks clouds end

titles begin

And them hear dimly reminiscently

rushing wind

At home children writing essays him

croaky voice singing God save gracious King Dyer

Sergeant Major  Sergeant Major Take aim Dyer

Fire sound massed rifle fire screams You

best friend highest guru sovereign lord

Who hell he I dont know sir My

Gandhi Mohandas K Gandhi sound rioting womens

screams terror Find child  child mother

father killed A little boy high

He thinks hes failed Long live Mahatma Gandhi

Long live Mahatma Gandhi

THE END
