150 EXT ASTAPOVO PLATFORM DAY 150
Sofya looks window sees people lined
rail mourn loss As looks away
people reflected glass kneel
remove hats
Valentin watches train pull away He holds Masha
him
As train moves slowly corridor mourners
fall walk it The camera travels
train travels north taking Sofya
husband Yasnaya Polyana
