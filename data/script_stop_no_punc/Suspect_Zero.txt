FADE IN
on BLACK WAVE  vast oceanic coming right us
BEGIN TITLES
The wave relentless huge menacing We cant tell
daytime night simply obscures 
noisily It sucks yawns roars
Then realize massive wave darkness actually
RUNOFF dirty black WATER alongside edge
Interstate We PULL OUT OF IT now
to concrete garbage weeds END TITLES
1 EXT DITCH  OFF THE INTERSTATE  430 AM 1
Amongst refuse discarded MILK CARTON resting
back The carton asks Have You Seen Me photographed
face thats obscured grime
Yellowing newspaper old Coke cans Twinkie wrappers
bed untended weeds A hollow Texas wind blows
all We stay carton
Then hollow wind gains speed deep RUMBLE grows
distance ROAR The yellowed newspaper lifts
whips past us
as 18WHEEL MACK TRUCK blows by blur
corner frame 75 predawn darkness
Then truck gone rush air dissipates The
milk carton coke cans lie undisturbed
A LIGHT RAIN begins fall grime washes
away milk carton revealing face A child Have
You Seen Me Its heartbreaking
TILT UP vast flatness Texas I35
concrete forever In distance gray highway yields
black STORMCLOUDS gathering silently endless prairie
A vertical vein LIGHTNING streaks them
