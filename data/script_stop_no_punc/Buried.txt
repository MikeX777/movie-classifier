Something wrong doesnt need know

Finally him lit flame Zippo holds
hands bound
rope A rolledup dirty rag tied tightly
head stretched mouth Dried blood stains
hair forehead
We lying old fashioned wooden coffin
Nothing rottedout planks wood nailed
together Realizing same Paul struck
overwhelming instant panic
With great difficulty holding lit Zippo
Paul removes muzzle mouth
PAUL

fear understood utterance
He screams aloud voice captured coffin
walls

PAUL

He kicks slams hands sides
coffin avail His violent movements cause small
grains sand trickle space
sides coffin small gap
exists coffins broken wooden planks
Sweat cascades neck dripping
dampened brow The heat inside extremely close confines
coffin stifling
PAUL CONTD
Somebody help me Please
Paul continues futile efforts pry
coffin The sides top 
thoroughly reinforced force surrounds
coffin Sand It clear buried
He tries best calm himself trouble
catching breath It takes time
eventually achieves semblance calm
Getting good look time
Paul 37 years old Unshaven
physically unremarkable embodies bluecollar American
everyman
He coughs The minimal oxygen coffin makes
hard breathe
His eyes widen bit seeing exposed rusty nail He
tries desperately use nail cut old
frayed ropes bind hands Doing easy task
The incredibly tight quarters makes action nearly
impossible
After lengthy struggle rope snaps Paul quickly frees
hands A small victory Very small
The heat unbearable Paul takes buttondown
shirt leaving Tshirt His body battles

He tosses buttondown shirt feet His
undershirt drenched sweat
Still trying calm himself having little success
so Paul looks coffin His feet
bodylength away miles him

He looks coffin feet
With great difficulty shifts body feet
pressed coffin He attempts
use leg strength push him
doesnt millimeter
After failed attempts legs exhausted
Paul drops feet coffin He lay

Close head corner floor theres
broken plank A small hole
He closes cigarette lighter extinguishing flame In
total darkness continues cry
PAUL CONTD
What this
With sobbing slowly subsiding coffin soon grows
eerily silent
The sound Pauls labored breaths hear softened
blanket absolute darkness
After beat silence interrupted subtle buzzing
sound The muted sight strange blueish light flickers
coffin Pauls feet He extremely startled
The buzzing continues minimal splashing
light Its coming underneath discarded buttondown
shirt near feet
He lights Zippo better look
Pulling shirt away realizes hearing
seeing vibrating ring display features
older model cell phone
He frantically reaches it coffin far
small reposition easily
To dismay phone stops ringing But efforts
reach continue He uses feet search phone
After trouble finding it eventually locates it
Clamping phone clasped feet Paul
painfully angles body reach feet
hands grab it
He soon able reach it Immediately thereafter
flips open phone puts receiver him

illuminating coffin fluorescent green hue
Paul starts move suddenly freezes His eyes widen
His pupils dilate Something clearly wrong

His eyes slowly shift downward watching

measured breaths held long be
Moving excruciatingly slow Paul lowers glow stick
looking at
A shape moves stomach underneath Tshirt
Pauls eyes fixed be He cautiously
slowly moves glow stick closer
The shape disappears light glow stick

Pauls pant leg moves slightly starting top slowly

Paul leans glow stick further And further
Carefully Moving millimeter time He shifts
position head slightly charily
feet
He leans closer glow stick But 
 wary movement comes immediate stop
Its snake A twofoot sawscaled viper It
positioned corner coffin inches
Pauls feet

His terror evident Paul slowly pulls feet
upper body away snake The confined
space offers little room safety
The snake turns muscled neck face Paul Their eyes
meet time The snake hisses poised strike
moment Paul raises foot Steels himself
Prepares preempt snake solid stomp
A sensible plan soon prevails After lowering foot
Paul cautiously removes flask pocket Slowly
unscrews top Splashes small alcohol

The snake recoils slightly menacingly twists
new posture ready attack Paul lowers Zippo

Desperately straining muscle body extends
arm backward Zippo hoping away
spilled alcohol He cant reach it
tries might
The phone stops ringing He missed call
He tries blowing flame head far away
breath strong
cause flicker
With alcohol mere inches away flame Paul
reaches shoe His odd positioning makes reaching
foot impossible He struggles undo laces
remove foot
With face beet red force strain Paul
finally removes shoe The mere inch leg room
creates allows slide leg him
The trail alcohol come contact
