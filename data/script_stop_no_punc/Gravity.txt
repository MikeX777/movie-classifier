OUTER SPACE 600 KILOMETERS ABOVE

PLANET EARTH

Like images Earth seen space image

planet mythical majestic

The globe tangible slowly spinning floating

endless void space It blue planet bright white

clouds twirl stretch capricious patterns deep

blue oceans jigsaw continents green yellow

It noon Cape Town early night India

The sphere perfect orb darkened

sliver Eastern edge

It beautiful And life

But here

Here completely silent

SILENCE

IN THE DISTANCE

A small metal object crosses space surrounding Earth

If appears small satellite

far away us It size football field It is

The INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION ISS

It resembles dragonfly Its solar panels stretch out like

wings long body connected pressurized modules

It floats sense proud achievement

It orbits altitude 500 sea level It moves

average 27700 kilometers hour completing 157 laps

Earth day

It cruising Zimbabwe To East island

Madagascar Up North expansive dry lands Somalia

Ethiopia

Soon ISS curves spherical planet

smaller indistinguishable small bright

spec grazing blue atmosphere

CLOSER TO US

Orbiting altitude 600 km

The EXPLORER SPACE SHUTTLE visible

This icon space exploration played key role

NASAs missions late 90s

Faintly hear static voices murmuring radio frequences

As babble bulds hear conversation
