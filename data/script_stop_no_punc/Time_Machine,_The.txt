THE LAND OF THE LEAL

Words Music Peggy Lee

When I wee lad L

And dark night

Afraid I

Til bright morning light

And sometimesfor comfort

Away I steal Away

I Land Leal

And soon I

It took time

My heart soaring

As I climb

And green grass

So cool sweet

So good run

With happy bare feet

And teacher

And I know

Just going

And way go

But wishing

Away I steal

Away I Land Leal

And Im older

I try wise

But I troubled

I close eyes

And like wee lad

Away I steal

Away I Land Leal

For questions

And lies

And storm

To darken skies

The birds flying

No freer feel

Than I

When I live land Leal
