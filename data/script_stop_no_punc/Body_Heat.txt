To real face Matty Mary Ann alive
fine sun 
EXT A HIGH PATIO  AN EXOTIC LAND  DAY
One shot close lovely face moving
tight halfcircle barely lets glimpse
sundrenched foreign town far tropical
foliage surrounds patio For brief moment
crying But no tear It
little drop sweat She wipes cheek
turns unseen male COMPANION spoken
Spanish She wipes eyes looks him
COMPANION OS
Hace Calor
MATTY
What
COMPANION OS
It hot
MATTY
Yes
She turns face sun
FADE OUT
THE END
