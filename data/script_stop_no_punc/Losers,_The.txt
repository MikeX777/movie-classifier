A nice quiet neighborhood Outside kitchen window

Poochs wife JOLENE dishes sink again

A RUSTLING Jolene looks time She obviously

heard it She puts dishes goes door

Opens looks see

Nothing Not swingset

She sighs About head inside spies

A GLINT OF LIGHT By oak tree front She

steps outside Walks sees is

Her breath hitches chest

A frilly purple ribbon tied old oak tree

And tears Jolenes eyes Because

knows means

Her husband alive And home

Someday

FADE OUT
