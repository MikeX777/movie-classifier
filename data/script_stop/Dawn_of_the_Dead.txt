DAWN OF
THE DEAD
(The working draft 1977)
George A. Romero
1 We face young woman. She asleep. It
quiet first, credits appear. The woman's face begins
twitch, having bad dream. She moans slightly
expression grows desperate.
A mix subtle sounds begin fade in. As louder,
discern sounds like busy office area. It actually
frantic television studio hum panic national
emergency.
The woman's moans louder desperate
background sounds reach volume credits stop. The
woman sits up, snapping awake.
2 She lurches forwards arms strong young man. She
Francine, years old attractive,
gritty dirt. Her hair hanging, dishevelled
sweaty. Her jeans blouse worn days.
She sitting floor, slept
hours, covered old overcoat.
Tony: YOU OK?
Fran stares young man. She shaking. She doesn't speak.
Tony: THE SHIT'S REALLY HITTING THE FAN.
The girl tries clear head young man moves
sleep floor. He wakes time.
We begin hear voices busy hum studio. They
electronic tinniness, broadcast monitor. Fran
looks about. She shaken dream.
3 We television studio. Reporters buzz madly.
Everybody looks dishevelled exhausted. Technicians man
monitors, people little screens, arguing
emotionally.
4 Voice: WHAT'S MAKING IT HAPPEN? WHAT THE HELL
DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE, WHAT'S MAKING IT
HAPPEN.
Voice: YES, BUT THAT'S...
Voice: THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER STUDY. THEY'RE TRYING...
Voice: BUT IF WE KNEW THAT, WE COULD...
Voice: WE DON'T KNOW THAT! WE DON'T KNOW THAT!
WE'VE GOTTA OPERATE ON WHAT WE DO KNOW!
5 The room pandemonium. People run wire copy;
organise stacks bulletins arrive. Others trip
cables generally other's way.
6 Francine stares madness, trying clear head.
Man's voice: I'M STILL DREAMING.
Fran turns head. Another young man sits
floor. He ones Tony awakened.
Fran: NO YOU'RE NOT.
Woman: MY TURN WITH THE COAT.
Fran looks up. A young woman offering coffee paper
cup. She line overcoat hours sleep.
Fran takes coffee struggles feet.
Woman: THE GUYS ON THE CREW ARE GETTING CRAZY.
A BUNCH OF 'EM FLEW THE COOP ALREADY.
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER WE'LL BE ABLE
TO STAY ON AIR.
7 Fran staggers control consoles. The technicians
end ropes.
Technicians: (all once)
WATCH CAMERA TWO...WHO THE HELL'S ON CAMERA
TWO, A BLIND MAN...
WATCH THE FRAME...WATCH THE FRAME...
ROLL THE RESCUE STATIONS AGAIN.
Technicians: WE GOT A REPORT THAT HALF THOSE RESCUE
STATIONS HAVE BEEN KNOCKED OUT.
SO GET ME A NEW LIST.
SURE, I'LL PULL IT OUTA MY ASS.
Fran focuses monitors. She incredulous... stunned
madness surrounds her. She realises hopelessness
situation zeroes televised conversation.
8 We begin listen din news room.
TV Man 1: I DON'T BELIEVE THAT, DOCTOR, AND I DON'T
BELIEVE...
TV Man 2: DO YOU BELIEVE THE DEAD ARE RETURNING TO

TV Man 1: YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ABANDONING EVERY HUMAN
CODE OF BEHAVIOUR, AND THERE'S A LOT OF US
WHO AREN'T READY FOR THAT DOCTOR FOSTER...
10 A great assent goes studio floor. Doctor
Foster flustered frustrated. The stage hands
cameramen screaming him, swearing ridiculing. We
notice Police guards, armed, studio doors. They control
traffic big room.
11 Back control panel. Fran stares screens. Confusion
reigns.
Man: FRANNIE, GET ON THE NEW LIST OF RESCUE STATIONS.

Fran: I'M GONNA KNOCK OFF THE OLD RESCUE STATIONS.
I'LL HAVE THE NEW ONES READY AS SOON AS I CAN.
Technician: WE'RE SENDING PEOPLE TO PLACES THAT HAVE

14 Fran moves control room. An armed officer stops
her. A young man rushing copy intercedes.
Man: HEY, SHE'S ALRIGHT.
Officer: WHERE'S YOUR BADGE?
Fran reaches instinctively lapel blouse. Her
badge missing.
Fran: JESUS!

The man clicks camera. Fran moves studio.
17 On monitors, rescue stations blink shots
men argue air.
TV Man 1: WELL I DON'T BELIEVE IN GHOSTS, DOCTOR.
TV Man 2: THESE ARE NOT GHOSTS. NOR ARE THESE HUMANS!
THESE ARE DEAD CORPSES. ANY UN-BURIED HUMAN
CORPSE WITH ITS BRAIN INTACT WILL IN FACT
RE-ACTIVATE. AND IT'S PRECISELY BECAUSE OF
INCITEMENT BY IRRESPONSIBLE PUBLIC FIGURES
LIKE YOURSELF THAT THIS SITUATION IS BEING
DEALT WITH IRRESPONSIBLY BY THE PUBLIC AT

18 Another outraged goes stagehands observers.
Doctor Foster tries out-scream cries...

WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE PEOPLE SEE?
19 Fran moves large studio area broadcasters
argue. The commotion maddening. Fran stares moment.
20 TV Man 2: (now distraught...almost pleading)
THIS SITUATION IS CONTROLLABLE. PEOPLE
MUST COME TO GRIPS WITH THIS CONCEPT.
IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT...WITH FRIENDS...
WITH FAMILY...BUT A DEAD BODY MUST BE DE-
ACTIVATED BY EITHER DESTROYING THE BRAIN
OR SEVERING THE BRAIN FROM THE REST OF THE
BODY.
Another outburst studio.
TV Man 2: THE SITUATION MUST BE CONTROLLED...BEFORE IT'S
TOO LATE...THEY ARE MULTIPLYING TOO RAPIDLY...
21 Fran moves crowded room emotional people

She gives rest coffee men.
Fran: NOT MUCH LEFT, BUT HAVE A BALL.
The men slug eagerly paper cup. Fran rushes

22 The broadcasters argue emotionally.
TV Man 1: PEOPLE AREN'T WILLING TO ACCEPT YOUR SOLUTIONS,
DOCTOR, AND I, FOR ONE, DON'T BLAME THEM.

Givens spots Fran moves room.
Givens: GARRET, WHO TOLD YOU TO KILL THE SUPERS?
Fran: NOBODY. I KILLED 'EM. THEY'RE OUT OF DATE.
Givens: I WANT THOSE SUPERS ON THE AIR ALL THE TIME.
Fran: ARE YOU WILLING TO MURDER PEOPLE BY SENDING THEM

Givens: WITHOUT THOSE RESCUE STATIONS ON SCREEN EVERY
MINUTE PEOPLE WON'T WATCH US. THEY'LL TUNE OUT.

broadcast rages.
30 TV Man 2: THEY KILL FOR ONE REASON.
THEY KILL FOR FOOD.
THEY EAT THEIR VICTIMS, DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT,
MR. BERMAN. THAT'S WHAT KEEPS THEM GOING.
31 Fran stops listen argument. She falls

studio disgust.
32 TV Man 2: IF WE'D LISTENED...IF WE'D DEALT WITH THE
PHENOMENON PROPERLY...WITHOUT EMOTION...

A murmur studio begins build emotional

SUCKERS...AND YOU GET EATEN! HOW YOU LIKE THAT?
Peter speaks low, unemotional tone. Stephen transfixed.
Peter: THEY GOT A BIG ADVANTAGE OVER US BROTHER.
THEY DON'T THINK. THEY JUST BLIND-ASS DO WHAT
THEY GOT TO DO. NO EMOTIONS. AND THAT BUNCH
OUT THERE? THAT'S JUST A HANDFUL AND EVERY
DAY THERE'LL BE MORE.
A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE DIE EACH DAY
FROM NATURAL CAUSES. THAT PROB'LY TRIPLES OR

Fran: WHAT HAPPENED TO GROWING VEGETABLES AND FISHING?
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE IDEA ABOUT THE WILDERNESS...
HUNDREDS OF MILES FROM ANYTHING AND ANYBODY...
STEVE, I'M AFRAID. YOU'RE HYPNOTISED BY THIS
PLACE. ALL OF YOU. IT'S ALL SO BRIGHT AND NEATLY
WRAPPED THAT YOU DON'T SEE...YOU DON'T SEE THAT IT

She leans him, making final plea.
Fran: STEPHEN, LET'S JUST TAKE WHAT WE NEED AND KEEP

Steve: WE CAN'T HARDLY CARRY ANYTHING IN THAT LITTLE BIRD.
Fran: (angry)
WHAY DO YOU WANT? A NEW SET OF FURNITURE? A
FREEZER? A CONSOLE TV AND A STEREO? WE CAN TAKE
WHAT WE NEED. WHAT WE NEED TO SURVIVE.
382 Cut close Peter's face. His eyes pop open.
Peter: SHUT THAT THING OFF!
Roger clicks radio. They listen. They hear slight sounds

Roger crawls clicks TV well. The electronic

Steve steps wall cartons. Fran peers
corner look, sits floor.
Another noise. The faint squeaking door

lumbering.
The faces humans tighten. Peter Roger pull

Some thumping hall. Steve squats holds Fran.
The sounds closer now. The door cartons clicks

After time, footsteps recede stairs.
Peter: SOMEBODY BETTER SIT WATCH ALL THE TIME.
Roger: THEY'LL NEVER GET THROUGH THERE.
Peter: ENOUGH OF 'EM WILL. AND IT AIN'T JUST THEM THINGS
WE GOT TO WORRY ABOUT. THAT CHOPPER UP THERE COULD
GIVE US AWAY IF SOMEBODY COMES MESS' AROUND.
Roger: WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO? LAND ANOTHER PILOT TO FLY
IT OUT. THEY'RE NOT GONNA MESS WITH A LITTLE BIRD
LIKE THAT. THEY GOT ENOUGH ON THEIR HANDS. YOU
KNOW BACK IN PHILLY WE FOUND A BOAT IN THE MIDDLE
OF INDEPENDENCE SQUARE. SOMEBODY TRYIN' TO CARRY
IT TO THE RIVER, I GUESS. DIDN'T MAKE IT. DAMN
THING SAT THERE FOR EIGHT DAYS.
Peter: SOMEBODY FINALLY GOT IT, THOUGH. IT COMES DOWN TO
HOW MUCH ITS WORTH.
383 Fran ducks blanket. She disgustedly lights
cigarette. Steve sits again.
Steve: FRANNIE...
She doesn't respond.
Steve: DAMMIT, FRAN, YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES WE'D
HAVE TO LAND FOR FUEL TRYIN' TO MAKE IT UP NORTH?
THOSE THINGS ARE OUT THERE EVERYWHERE. AND THE
AUTHORITIES WOULD GIVE US JUST AS HARD A TIME...
MAYBE WORSE... WE'RE IN GOOD SHAPE HERE, FRANNIE.

EVEN ANIMALS WILL ADOPT THE BASIC USE OF TOOLS IN
THIS MANNER.
388 Fran's eyes pop open voice awakened her. She

Voice: THESE CREATURES ARE NOTHING BUT PURE, MOTORISED
INSTINCT...
The woman looks around. Morning sunlight spilling
skylights above. She sits peers area
room. The men gone. The television playing. On

reading report.
389 Voice: THEIR ONLY DRIVE IS FOR THE FOOD WHICH SUSTAINS
