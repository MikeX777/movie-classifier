MORRIS
Our latest composition
follows: entitled:
"The Thrill" --
"I stand hill
Not thrill
breath
fresh kill
Never mind man
contemplates
away license plates
He stands
Baking cookies discontent
By heat laundrymat vent
Leaving soul"
(Then like poetry I dot dot
dot drop line
kind center.)
"Leaving soul parting waters
Under medulla oblongata
