3 INT. STORE DAY
Once store itself, though, impression disappears.
It ordinary, slightly seedy, junk shop.
The stall sell odd mixture items; native trinkets
share space second-hand items European colonists. These
second-hand goods sense period. They suggest
late 'twenties/early 'thirties. This reinforced
sounds coming them, old-fashioned mahogany-cased
wireless. A foreign voice speaks language don't

relevant - 'I'll follow Secret Heart', perhaps,
'Dancing Dark'.)
Into shot comes ENGLISH OFFICER. His uniform, too, suggests
'twenties, days Empire. He tall, thin,
dark-haired, stage face clearly. He
stands stall.
The TRADER suddenly stands counter. He
crouched beneath it, checking preparing something. He
big, impressive-looking black man. His face totally
impassive stares customer.
Neither men speak. Obviously, deal
struck today pay-off.
The OFFICER, little arrogantly - suggesting racist contempt,
slaps bag gold stall's counter.
Keeping eyes firmly OFFICER, reaches beneath

Pink flesh-like long gray-blue stalk,

softly.
KIRSTY
Wait. Wait.
KIRSTY begins room slowly shakes head
gently.
KIRSTY
Hey, remember me? From
hospital? I room?
KIRSTY rewarded small recognizing smile TIFFANY,
KIRSTY returns smile.
KIRSTY
You don't want
there. You REALLY don't
want there.
TIFFANY turns head look corridor
turns KIRSTY. For second looks KIRSTY's
persuasions succeeded, MALAHIDE's training
thorough; TIFFANY knows puzzle sees one. She smiles
KIRSTY suddenly turns disappears

KIRSTY stands moment, can't believe
TIFFANY it. She shakes head - half disbelief
half despair.
KIRSTY

81 INT. CORRIDORS/LABYRINTH
We looking straight long corridors
Hell.
It architecture corridor appeared
hospital room HELLRAISER; walls stained gray stone broken
vaguely medieval-looking arches.
KIRSTY comes view, walking away camera. Ahead
her, illogically far distance given entered
corridor seconds KIRSTY, TIFFANY.
KIRSTY breaks slight run, calls girl.
KIRSTY
Tiffany. Wait!
Her voice unpleasant ring acoustics
corridors echos horribly. KIRSTY pulls face doesn't
shout again. She increases pace slightly.
Suddenly TIFFANY makes sharp turn enters intersecting
corridor. KIRSTY forced increase speed more.
KIRSTY makes turn corridor. Even
so, sees TIFFANY disappearing
intersection.
KIRSTY follows and, again, thing happens.
This happens times and, always, KIRSTY loses
sight TIFFANY catches either.
In short, TIFFANY's instincts absolutely right;
puzzle. The girls lost concrete maze,
twists turns labyrinthine windings.
After turns completely confuse KIRSTY's
sense direction, makes final turn corridor
sees different.
At end corridor blinding white light. As soon
KIRSTY sees light, air filled beautiful
birdsong.
TIFFANY disappears light soon KIRSTY sees it.
Despite light, despite birdsong, KIRSTY
suspicious shouts out.
KIRSTY
Tiffany! Don't trust it! Don't
Trust it!
But late. The girl gone. KIRSTY follows-and vanishes

82 INT. CORRIDORS/LABYRINTH
JULIA MALAHIDE seen corridors labyrinth.
MALAHIDE's face delight. He absolutely
enchanted visitor.
JULIA, hand, walks brisk assurance
familiar territory.
The corridors MALAHIDE sees different KIRSTY'S;
grotto-like, dotted stalactites stalagmites
immediately unattractive. The walls contain portals glass-
like substance random intervals emit blooming lights
different colors MALAHIDE peers eagerly these.
In one, view like aquarium. An alien fish swims past
eyes. Its body resembles human brain pincer-like claws.
MALAHIDE presses hand glass thing comes nearer.
Suddenly, body, thing produces perfect
human forearm hand meets MALAHIDE's hand

MALAHIDE starts slightly keeps hand there. He

MALAHIDE jumps sharply, thing shatters glass

As pass JULIA, tuts slightly exasperated

JULIA
Do careful.
83 INT. HELL'S SITTING ROOM DAY
White light fills screen KIRSTY steps
view. Instantly White light contracts disappears.
KIRSTY finds standing beautiful family sitting room.
The room bathed warm light perfect summer's day.
The birdsong KIRSTY heard earlier continues is, anything,
melodic, sweet.
The room vaguely Edwardian decor; real wood furnishings
decorative porcelain ornaments. There large wooden
dresser, photographs old-fashioned
brass frames.
Despite herself, KIRSTY resist smile pure pleasure
appearance room.
She touches furniture, assure
real.
She approaches dresser picks large framed
photographs. She gasps pleasure.
We photograph. It family group looks
taken years ago. It man, woman,
young girl five.
The man clearly LARRY, albeit younger version,
little girl dark, thick, slightly curly hair - like
KIRSTY'S. The woman beautiful similar hair
daughter.
KIRSTY's eyes prick tears - clearly tears
happy memories. She smiles.
KIRSTY
Mommy...
KIRSTY puts photograph family looks
room again. A troubled look crosses face.
Despite aparent Summer light room, KIRSTY suddenly
realises odd.
She looks wall wall mounting distress face.
There windows room. And door.
At point, odd discordant note birdsong
apparent. It obvious moment - total
effect simply sweet was.
KIRSTY looks photograph snatches up,
look concern.
The photograph changed. It wedding photo. The
wedding LARRY JULIA.
Suddenly photograph begins bleed. Blood pours
paper itself, pressing smearing glass-so
momentarily framed blood, single trace
picture showing. The blood begins escape frame,
trickling lip holds glass place dripping
KIRSTY's fingers.
With horror, KIRSTY drops frame. It lands
floor glass shatters. The blood continues flow. In
fact, glass restrain it, fairly
fountains out, spreading floor.
KIRSTY steps glances dresser. Blood flowing
frame, pooling dresser overflowing
floor.
By now, discordant elements birdsong
predominant and, KIRSTY sweeps frames dresser
floor scream anguish, birdsong gives
way completely hideous, dissonant shrieking.
KIRSTY throws hands ears.
KIRSTY
Nooooo!
She rushes walls begins beating
fists.
The walls soft pulpy slightly fists
strike, like flabby flesh. KIRSTY stands disgust.
The wall visibly bruises eyes, swelling purpling.
The light room, like birdsong, changed utterly. It
dark, simply dull, featureless, depressing.
KIRSTY turns away disgust finds room
given decay. The sofas chairs mildewed rotten,
wooden furniture ridden woodworm rot. A skinned rat
runs room buckled chipped skirting board.
A rotten leg gives way small chest drawer
spills out, freeing family large spiders
run wildly floor.
Suddenly room begins smoke, churned
ever-increasing intensity wind. The smoke obscures screen.
84 INT. BARE CHAMBER HELL
The smoke wind subside entirely.
KIRSTY standing exactly position room

Suddenly, rising KIRSTY, comes PINHEAD.
PINHEAD

KIRSTY swings round terror. As mist continues clear,

KIRSTY begins work furiously BOX brought

She obviously hopes work again.
PINHEAD raises hand box simply flies KIRSTY's
hands hovers air them. KIRSTY stares, open-

PINHEAD
How send back, child?
We're here. And you.
Suddenly PINHEAD works box - remote control
dazzling skill.
He turns box rapidly positions KIRSTY

large, two-dimensional square. Finally, closes -
wholly new shape; white, multi-faceted, diamond shape
- drops KIRSTY's hands.
He stares KIRSTY makes small gesture brow. It
ALMOST cute. If anything, resembles cocky, aren't-I-
clever look STEVE gave KIRSTY swallowing cigarette

KIRSTY shakes head dumbly begins corner,
hoping converge her, able
slip labyrinth.
KIRSTY
No! You... You can't! It wasn't

open box!
FEMALE CENOBITE
Didn't open box. And

PINHEAD
Oh, Kirsty; eager play,

FEMALE CENOBITE
Perhaps you're teasing us. Are

To extent, KIRSTY's ploy working. The CENOBITES
moving closer advance corner

KIRSTY
But I didn't open it! I didn't!
PINHEAD
Then here?
KIRSTY
I've come father!
KIRSTY shouts brave defiance. PINHEAD laughs

PINHEAD

And unreachable.
Suddenly KIRSTY makes break shouting so.
KIRSTY

It moment succeeded. She swings
CENOBITES begins run chamber.
The CENOBITES suddenly, hook flies

KIRSTY screams.
The CENOBITES turn face her, attempt cross

PINHEAD
But it's true, He Hell.
Just yours.
KIRSTY
And you?
PINHEAD smiles naivete question.
PINHEAD
It's different us.
FEMALE CENOBITE
We've here.
PINHEAD
We surprises.
Suddenly, quickly came, hook withdraws wall
flies nothingness.
PINHEAD puts hand expansive gesture.
PINHEAD
But, please; feel free.
Explore. We'll

85 INT. CORRIDOR
KIRSTY can't believe intention
questioning it. She runs corridor away,
PINHEAD's words echoing her.
PINHEAD

Delighted CENOBITE laughter follows labyrinth.
KIRSTY drops transformed BOX pocket
begins running corridors again. The labyrinth
tighter - corridors shorter, turns sharper.
Corner corner KIRSTY turn.
Accompanying tightening, light corridors
gradually murkier - dark, like oppressive
colourlessness descends thunderstorm breaks.
Occasionally little hissing noises walls

smoke escaping bricks.
Over this, grows volume soundtrack
rhythmic, labored, resonant sound - sound

Suddenly, KIRSTY turns corner, hand reaches

KIRSTY throws far wall corridor,

On table lie hand cards, face down, cloudy

Over far wall (the wall opposite containing

The gash heals itself, closing MALAHIDE within.
Despite gash having closed MALAHIDE, leathery flesh

Small rips gashes appear disappear surface, allowing

At stage MALAHIDE's hand forearm appear. A long deep,

Another gash opens MALAHIDE's face visible. Here

Again, MALAHIDE's torso appears, naked. Two large triangular
