Perceval, stunned command, doesn't move.
ARTHUR
Obey me, Perceval. You act
me. It order King.
Do it, back!
Perceval picks sword, mounts horse rides
inland. Arthur watches go, struggling pain,
kneeling, head falls chest.
EXT. POOL, MOORS - EVENING
Perceval steps tall reeds edge pool. He
bring throw Excalibur water. He
examines blade, haloed faint iridescence.
PERCEVAL
It precious thing. I can't...
He backs away water hides sword reeds,
starts back.
EXT. MOORS BY THE SEA - EVENING
Perceval dismounts, rushing kneel King's side.
Arthur looks up, calm intense.
ARTHUR
When threw in,
see?
PERCEVAL
...I saw nothing.
The King looks piercing power. Perceval blurts
out.
PERCEVAL
My King, I couldn't it. Excalibur
lost. Other men--
ARTHUR
--By piece
steel. Its power comes
wields it. For one.
Do I ordered!
Perceval leaves more. The daylight failing, sun
near horizon sea, bursting clouds.
EXT. POOL - EVENING
He picks sword looks long time.
Finally, great misgiving, hurls middle
pool. As Excalibur touch water
woman's hand reaches grasps hilt. It holds
sword aloft moment draws under.
Perceval backs away pool stunned marvel.
EXT. MOORS BY THE SEA - SUNSET
Perceval returns King, terribly excited, shouting
horse:
PERCEVAL
Arthur!
But Arthur isn't there. Perceval looks him, doesn't
understand. He sees trail blood. He spurs horse
follows trail sea.
EXT. BEACH - SUNSET THEN NIGHT
There trail blood prints sand left
man crawling.
Perceval follows sea. He looks around,
searching, terribly distraught.
Where blood prints cease, footprints
coming returning sea. Perceval looks
waves.
He sees sailing vessel rising swell. On deck
distant figure Arthur, lying surrounded
women, gossamer robes rippling wind. The sun
hovers horizon ship heading it.
He gallops waves horse further,
calling strength, futile attempt:
PERCEVAL
Arthur! Will return?
The sun slips horizon. Night falling,
wind whips wavecrests. He turns sea wades
back.
PERCEVAL
All knights Round Table
dead. Excalibur returned.
Arthur gone. Maybe lives, maybe
return...
He stops edge water. In uncertain light
sky sea one. He draws chalice pouch
saddle, holds him.
PERCEVAL
Only I remain, this...
The wind swirls whistles mysteriously hollow
cup. Music grand melancholic grows it. The
chalice, etched starlight, thing taken
sight enfolding darkness.
FADE OUT:
THE END
