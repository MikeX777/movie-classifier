MARCH 12 2008
SPACE.
But dark lonely corner we're to. This
glittering inferno -- center distant galaxy.
Suddenly, TEARS past incredible speed: NEUTRON
STAR. It SMASHES headlong encounters...
planets, stars. Can stop juggernaut?
Yes. Something looms heart galaxy, hidden
inside blinding starlight, dark flaw fabric
existence itself: BLACK HOLE.
The neutron star pulled black hole's swirl,
spiraling closer closer destruction. Finally,
contacts hole's edge EXPLODES.
The EXPLOSION powerful sends shock waves
fabric space-time itself. We ride waves,
racing black hole.
Suddenly, portion wave disappears crystal-
like hole, emerging darker region universe --
backwater that, wave races past giant red planet
distinctive eye, recognize own.
The wave, infinitesimal ripple, finally reaches
blue planet. It drops atmosphere North
America, high desert east Cascades,
roof nondescript warehouse.
The wave tickles atoms steel shell vacuum
chamber, dances tiny jig laser beam reflected
heavy piece glass.
The wave shoots building disappears
fractal branches tumbleweed resting
concrete tube stretches miles desert.
An SUV speeds past tumbleweed follow till
parks plain-looking building opposite end
tube. A MAN climbs SUV.
INT. CONTROL ROOM, WAREHOUSE -- DAY
The man lets large room looks like Mission
Control. He pours cup coffee. It weekend
place empty. No
displays flashing distinctive shape -- pulse followed
series echoes.
The man looks screen, DROPS cup coffee.

2.
INT. LIGO OFFICES, CALTECH, PASADENA -- DAY
The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory
headquarters Caltech frenzy activity. POSTDOCS
RESEARCHERS huddle monitors printouts, arguing.
ANSEN, 60s, director LIGO, walks frenzy.
A postdoc hands printout: pulse followed echoes.
INT. LIGO DIRECTOR'S OFFICE, CALTECH -- DAY
Ansen steps relative calm large, sunlit office,
overlooks grassy stretch Caltech's campus.
His ASSISTANT, 30s, phone, hold. He looks
Ansen enters.
ASSISTANT
I'm hold INS.
(COVERS MICROPHONE)
Don't think double
check triangulation
CALL ANYBODY-
ANSEN
We double checked it.
Someone finally picks line.
ASSISTANT
Yes. I'm trying reach-
(pause, listens)
No, I don't think understand
is.
(PAUSE)
Because did, we'd having
conversation person.
He listens moment, hangs phone, confused.
ANSEN
What say?
ASSISTANT
They said look
window.
Ansen steps window looks out:
In courtyard below, coeds scrambling
way military helicopter sets middle
quad dozens ARMED FEDERAL AGENTS converge
building.
3.
INT. MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM, LIGO, CALTECH -- DAY
Ansen sits, alone, conference table.
The filled GOVERNMENT MEN -- NSA mostly,
DIA. The door opens assistant steps in. Armed
guards pat down, shove seat.
ANSEN
Is necessary?
One NSA agents leans forward.
NSA AGENT
You've complaining years
government doesn't
project seriously enough, Doctor.
(SMILES)
You can't ways.
Ansen motions assistant, turns projector.
On-screen, familiar pulse echoes.
ANSEN
Yesterday morning, facility
Hanford identified signal:
neutron star colliding
supermassive black hole. We went
year's data
triangulated source.
The pulse translated crude animatic neutron
star circling black hole.
NSA AGENT
We know that, Doctor. What don't
know why, according
numbers, event took place right
solar system.
Suddenly, image overlays sun, earth,
rest solar black hole.
ANSEN
It didn't. Because we'd
dead now.
On-screen, Jupiter, Earth inner planets
consumed black hole. Only sun survives, pulled
orbit new master.
ANSEN (CONT'D)
Which leaves explanation:
The signal traveled

ANSEN (CONT'D)
wormhole. A gateway distant
corner universe. The black
hole far side.
On-screen, black hole removed distant
corner, connected tunnel space-time. A
gravity wave collision travels tunnel.
NSA AGENT
I've read book, Doctor. You
said wormholes impossible.
ANSEN
There satisfying
proved utterly wrong.
(SMILES)
I said wormhole couldn't exist
naturally. Not
billionths second. It
be... stabilized.
NSA AGENT
Stabilized what?
Ansen pauses, unsure. His assistant steps defense.
ASSISTANT
We don't way answer
question.
NSA AGENT
(IGNORES HIM)
You're peer review here,
Doctor. I don't care
reputation. I need know
thing got there. Now.
Ansen finally speaks up.
ANSEN
If you're worried invasion,
I start drafting articles
surrender.
(SMILES)
Whoever are, build
wormhole, erase
blink eye. Luckily,
means
interested in.
NSA AGENT
Then there?
5.
ANSEN
I don't know. Maybe it's
invitation. A chance commune
advanced species.
The assistant, embarrassed, looks down. The agent notices.
NSA AGENT
You don't agree?
ASSISTANT
(DELICATE)
No. I don't think assume
alien intelligence built wormhole.
(CHANGES TACK)
But opportunity represents
incredible. We explore parts
universe dreamt
reaching lifetimes.
The agent exchanges look colleagues,
steps room.
ANSEN
We need work. I
conference European
partners minutes.
NSA AGENT
We severed connections
European partners morning.
ANSEN
(INDIGNANT)
You can't that. The Europeans
funding...
GOVERNMENT MAN
We'll send check.
(STANDS)
Your project classified
State Secrets Act.
He steps door, leaving men alone. The assistant,
outraged, turns boss.
ASSISTANT
They can't secret. You
know that. Sooner later...
The younger man looks down, embarrassed, notices
tears rolling older man's cheeks.
6.
ANSEN
I don't care that. I've spent
life afraid
wipe moment
arrived. We've mistakes,
I wasn't sure we'd it...
The assitant realizes old man weeping joy.
Relief.
ANSEN (CONT'D)
But change everything.
Fifty years now,
same.
The older man looks simulation screen

She stops. Something caught attention.
COOPER
What?
BRAND
Nothing. I -- I
sworn moved.
She walks thick, knotted trunk tree. Puts
hand it.
Overhead, ice flickers darkness begins
descend, rapidly Earth.
Suddenly, tree SHUDDERS. Then, bark begins ooze
Brand's fingers.
Brand snaps hand away steps back. Even her,
much. She turns Cooper, looking
jungle them, spooked.
COOPER
You know plants don't usually
move? Is universal rule?
BRAND
No. There aren't rules.
All them, life-forms begins melt
ground, breaking different, smaller forms.
BRAND (CONT'D)
(trying stay calm)
Remember, we're aliens.
Cooper steps pieces nearest tree drop
ground begin scuttling him.
BRAND (CONT'D)
Hold still. Don't
sudden movements.
Two pieces join together, stacking
staggering him.
84.
A piece climbs two, looking good
place hang on. After moment hunkers top,
forming crude head. Thirty eye-like structures blink open
creature.
The skin life-form begins flicker dim light
like animals trapped ice above, bathing Cooper
Brand warm glow.
The creature creeps closer them, taking in. Cooper
tries best non-threatening.
COOPER
Hello there.
The creature lurches legs, head
splits open BELLOWS.
COOPER (CONT'D)
OK. Now run.
Brand doesn't argue. They turn sprint trees.
EXT. JUNGLE -- NIGHT
Cooper Brand smash headlong jungle. At first,
they're running rumbling, smashing melee
them. But run, entire jungle begins
break apart move.
After moment, they're surrounded. The jungle completely
disassembling million different pieces,
different size shape others.
COOPER
We reach shelter.
They head off, crashing melee.
EXT. SHORE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
Case, Doyle Roth standing shelter
finishing day's work.
Doyle turns around. The jungle breaking apart crawling

It's going long night.
EXT. JUNGLE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
Ahead, Cooper gleaming water inland sea,

COOPER
This way.
Brand begins follow.
BRAND
No... wait.
Too late. Cooper forces way writhing
creatures, steps through, falls...
EXT. WATERFALL -- NIGHT
Cooper gasps surfaces ice-cold water. Brand
floats past.
The river appears flow randomly slope, good
reason -- forest rearranges night.
Ahead, ground drops away water rushes
torrent.
Cooper catches minute, grabbing
tree branch hand and, second later, Brand
slides past.
COOPER
I've got you.
Suddenly, branch Cooper's hand illuminates wrenches
rock -- it's limb huge colony
organism. It shakes Cooper loose fall again...
86.
EXT. POOL -- NIGHT
Brand surfaces first. She grabs Cooper hauls
water. She smiles him, little smug.
BRAND
I've got you.
Creatures begin splashing pool them,

For moment, looks like Brand Cooper unnoticed.
Then, three-foot-tall creature dozen legs creeps
way entrance cave. Another follows,
another, cave entrance full.
Cooper looks cave, frantic. He picks rock.
Brand, scared thinking, takes rock
hand drops ground.
BRAND
It's game theory. The best
cooperate first.
COOPER
By "cooperate" mean let
eat me?
BRAND
These organisms
us. They survive photosynthesis.
All need light.
COOPER
Then killing other?
BRAND
I don't know.
(LOOKS AROUND)
But we're outnumbered, Cooper. So
better idea, I
suggest nice.
87.
The creatures hesitantly, faster.
Cooper stands stock creatures gather
him. Several join bigger animals
better look him.
One wraps chest begins prodding
shoulders, neck.
COOPER
(trying calm)
What doing?
BRAND
It's colony organism. It's trying
incorporate structure.
COOPER
I don't want incorporate me.
BRAND
Don't open mouth.
COOPER
WHY N-
As speaks, creature chest extends spindly,
pointed feelers reaches gently mouth.
Cooper holds breath organism taps
teeth. Its skin roughened texture, incomplete,

Cooper's skin, luck.
Bored, life-forms climb Cooper. The
creatures link imitation Cooper's lower

moment, creatures tumble ground flail away.
Cooper breathing hard cave empties
Brand left again.
Brand steps edge cave watches, fascinated,
creatures resume wrestling battling other.
COOPER (CONT'D)
They're killing other.
BRAND
No. They don't bleed... don't
die... they're competing...
trying different shapes, looking

88.
Cooper watches hideously-awkward-looking, five-legged
beast stumbles past tackles animal.
COOPER
I'd long way go.
BRAND

As watch, two-foot-long creature huge claw
scuttles ground, grabbing smaller opponents
smashing apart, sorting wreckage
adopting writhing parts own.
Something movement endearing, way
experiments piece -- like massacre
like over-caffeinated self-assembling erector set.
Suddenly, massive, lumbering creature SMASHES
claw beast. No match, smaller creature turns
scuttle away. Too slow. The larger organism brings
club-like limb smashing it. After moment,
lifts claw -- animals one.
The new organism lumbers away jungle, happily
snapping new claw larger opponents.
BRAND (CONT'D)
The behavior changes animals
bigger bigger. More
sophisticated. More calculated.
Two larger organisms square off, circling other,

I don't know.
Brand shivers -- it's getting colder.
INT. CAVE -- NIGHT

BRAND
These creatures billions years
older are. But they're
relatively primitive. They haven't
developed tools, culture, language.
COOPER
Why not?
BRAND
I don't know. No knows
intelligent life began Earth.
But surface planet
virtually craters. No impacts.
It's sheltered local
black holes.
COOPER
What difference make?

Maybe gone wrong here.
Maybe bad luck key

They sit silence while.
EXT. CAVE -- NIGHT
Cooper sleeps. After moment, Brand steps

For tiny moment, hope lost.
Suddenly, distant RUMBLE, building begins SHAKING.
