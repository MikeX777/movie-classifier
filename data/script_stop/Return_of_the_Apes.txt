DEEP SPACE.
No atmosphere, life, nothing. Just web lights- billion stars hang
velvet void. The sound howl cosmic wind.
The light distant sun strikes rising planet. We ragged
continents oceans wreathed cloud. This earth rise. Our world
spins slowly space, thing beauty, awesome majesty. In
nothingness - life.
We push planet - Americas. The wind grows louder -
A PUEBLO VILLAGE.
A broken-down pick-up bumps God-forsaken villagea cluster adobe
houses, blinding flurries dust sand. The pick-up stops
crumbling church. A man 60s gets carrying medical bag. This
DOCTOR. '
A WOMAN'S FACE.
Screaming. She's young - South American Indian - lying bed
corner houses. She final throes childbirth,
sheet draped loins. The Doctor works legs, encouraging
Spanish.
The local PRIEST, long seminary, crouches
counting beads rosary. He looks like pass out.
SUDDENLY THE WOMAN BITES DOWN HARD ON HER LIP. A THIN LINE OF BLOOD COURSES
DOWN HER CHIN. THE BREATH EXPLODES FROM HER LUNGS AS SHE PUSHES REALLY HARD
-
DOCTOR
Arriva!
He lifts child loins, makes sound. We don't
baby - shock Doctor's face. The mother struggles
child.
The Doctor grabs sheet torso covers baby it. He
thrusts bundle Priest's hands.
DOCTOR (CONT'D)
(in Spanish)
Dead - child dead. Now go!
We hold mother's anguished face. Dissolve
A HELICOPTER
Off roof tall hospital building. As rises night
red cross painted side. It's air ambulance.
The chopper turns away. The Manhattan skyline, skyscraper blaze
lights, opens it. The chopper swoops Brooklyn bridge
night.
GROVE OF TREES
Winter's coming - leaf different shade amber gold. The
helicopter drops branches lands immaculately
tended lawn. Surrounding gracious buildings great
university. Harvard.
Two paramedics clamber helicopter load
stainless steel casket gurney. They wheel fast
buildings. As go' doors, hold sign etched
stone
DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY
A PAIR OF MECHANICAL HANDS
slide long cylindrical "key" stainless steel casket. We pull
reveal casket lies sealed, uncontaminated room. A group
people lab coats -scientists researchers - stare glass
walls.
A young TECHNICIAN, working console, keyboards series
commands.
Sswhish. The steel casket swings open. Clouds white gas
stream -whatever's inside nitrogen cooled.
The gas clears. Lying inside body newborn child -
baby skin, face features man eighty. The
scientists researchers react - shocked.
One mechanical hands glides baby. In fingers
holds long steel scalpel. This highest-tech autopsy you've
seen. The scalpel drives down, open chest cavity -
BLOOD SPRAYS
But baby's chest - it's glass vials, exploding white-hot
flames consume them. A plastic-gloved lab assistant, silhouetted
flames, emptying hospital waste furnace. He slams door
shut.
He turns face. He's 4Os, handsome rough-hewn way -
strong jaw muscular body. There's cool intelligence eyes,
two-day beard worn-out uniform look like man who,
youth middle-age, lost way. And has. His WILL
ROBINSON.
He takes steel trolley, wheels set swing doors
sight.
CLOSED CIRCUIT TV SCREEN
features image scientists recognize autopsy.
She's 30s - attractive, long hair left loose shoulders,
air authority her. Her BILLIE RAE DIAMOND. She
Professor Biology.
We tilt screen. It hangs wall deserted laboratory
-overhead lights, rows rows wire animal cages. Moving death
row, feeding lab animals, Will Robinson.
TWO SAD-EYED CHIMPS, CLEANING EACH OTHER IN THEIR TINY CAGE, TURN AND STARE
AT HIM. SUDDENLY WILL STOPS - HE'S HEARD SOMETHING ON THE SCREEN THAT HAS
CAUGHT HIS ATTENTION. HE TURNS AND LOOKS -
DIAMOND
The exact cause death unknown. What certain - we're dealing
we've seen before. Every organ body
affected...
Superimposed Diamond's face dimensional, computer-generated
graphic baby's body.
Will forgets he's doing. He walks screen. We push
it. Screeds new data appear
Vascular System ...............Atrophied
Neurological Function .........Senile dementia
We hold Will's eyes - stares it.
AN AUDITORIUM
Billy Rae Diamond stands podium continuing briefing. About
scientists sitting dimly-lit lecture hall.
Diamond impressive person - tall gracious
don't Professor Harvard' age having iron
sparkling intelligence. She speaks great authority -
DIAMOND (CONT'D)
The baby question, Michael James Flanagan -she points
computer-generated graphic huge screen
born New York Hospital yesterday.
MAP OF THE WORLD ILLUMINATES AN ADJOINING SCREEN -
DIAMOND
But Center Disease Control Atlanta received similar reports
village Bolivia, cities Australia, seven countries
Europe, cluster cases Namibia Mexico. Forty-two cases all.
As speaks, pinpoints light map identify exact locations.
They dot way entire globe. Dr Diamond turns face
audience-
DIAMOND (CONT'D)
Like Michael Flanagan, full-term babies. Two seventy
days conception yet, reasonable medical standards,
completed entire life cycle. They gone conception
death, score years ten, slightly
months. Michael Flanagan died old age.
Silence Diamond lets scientists researchers absorb it. On
balcony high above, man taking notes. He sits alone,
hidden shadow. It's Will Robinson.
SHEETS OF ICE ON A SHUTTER DOOR
Will crouches row self-storage units edge town.
It's night, place deserted. He slips rusted key padlock.
Snapl The key breaks.
Will curses. He grabs piece timber pulls nail it. He
slides nail padlock manipulates tumblers. The padlock
springs open.
SPIDERS
weave web corner storage unit. A work light hangs
ceiling. Will ripping open stacks boxes long ago. He puts
pile yellowing files old floppy disks.
PULLS OUT A CASSETTE TAPE AND STARES AT IT, UNSURE WHAT'S ON IT. HE TAKES A
CASSETTE PLAYER FROM OUT OF THE JUNK, SLIDES IT IN AND PRESSES "PLAY"A HUGE
ROUND OF APPLAUSE. AS IT DIES, WE HEAR A MAN'S VOICE. IT'S WILL, SPEAKING
FROM YEARS AGO -
WILL
(on tape)
I like thank faculty staff great honor...
We push Will's face listens himself...
WILL (CONT'D)
opportunity work talented colleagues. I'm
privileged friends -
A shadow pain crosses face. He shuts tape sits
motionless.
LAFAYETTE PARK
Night. Homeless people park build cardboard shelters
coming storm. Across road, drops rain splatter
White House.
A string Government cars pass huge gates pull
West Portico. From inside, hear man's voice -
well-spoken, authoritative
PRESIDENT (O.S.)
There's mistake - you're sure?
JEFFERSON LIBRARY
Diamond sits President's study - book-lined walls,
hearth. A group men sit sofasthe Surgeon-General, Chief
Staff, National Security Advisor, Secretaw Health. A table
littered graphs end files.
DIAMOND
We've got thousand cases now, Mr President. That's weeks. The
number doubling sixty-eight hours.
The President stands near window, half shadow, firelight playing
face. He's 50's strain office makes look
older.
DIAMOND (CONT'D)
That's geometric progression, sir. In months there'Il seven
million cases. After hit wall -
She pushes thick, bound volume table.
DIAMOND (CONT'D)
According this, won't live birth planet.
The President looks moment. Then reaches picks
bound volume. It's hundreds pages numbers projections.
PRESIDENT
These projections -
species don't disappear fast.
DIAMOND
Tell dinosaurs, sir.
He looks window winter storm sweeping them.
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
What date - exactly hit wall?
DIAMOND
Six months twenty-one days.
Silence. The President keeps looking window.
PRESIDENT
Can't somebody tell - exactly dealing with. Is virus
what?
DIAMOND
We don't know, sir.
The President turns Chief Staff.
PRESIDENT
Whatever need, Bob - anything. Harry Truman Manhattan
Project - understand?
The Chief Staff nods head - yes.
PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
(softly)
A world children -it's inconceivable. And rest
- do? Just sit watch species die? Will person
leave planet turn lights.
Silence again. Finally young woman - White House Press Secretary -
speaks.
PRESS SECRETARY
We're going manage public. Right now, truth
inoperative -
PRESIDENT
Of course we're going manage itl We're going manage
lot things. But can't moment human?
He looks room. We hold somber faces.
A CHEAP APARTMENT
Through window - neon sign gas station. This Will's place,
He lives - bed corner, run-down furniture, dishes
sink.
The kitchen table turned desk - Will sits old
computer, surrounded yellowing stacks files floppy disks. He
stares screen - notes equations blurred. He's
long, barely focus. He rubs hand eyes.
A small mewing sound. Will turns alcove corner - cat lies
basket, panting. Will goes her.
She's giving birth - new-born kittens lies her.
Will strokes mother's head, looking miracle new life. He puts
fingers water bowl, moisten mother's mouth.
Then stops. He looks kitten - there's now. A
beat stares -
WILL
(softly)
Jesus Christ... course!
A LUXURIOUS BATHROOM
Through frosted glass silhouette woman taking shower.
Whoever is, she's got great figure. The sound doorbell. The
shower door opens -Diamond sticks head out. She looks clock - it's
midnight.
VIDEO ENTRY PHONE
A video screen monitors door. On Will - hair
tousled, old overcoat buttoned neck, battered briefcase
arm.
Diamond - towel shoulders, hair dripping - picks phone.
DIAMOND
Who it?
WILL (O.S.)
Will Robinson.
DIAMOND
I think wrong house.
WILL (O.S.)
I work department.
He turns looks straight camera. Instinctively, Diamond covers
breasts. She looks - recognition dawns.
AN ELEGANT ROOM
Will Diamond sit living room gracious townhouse - wooden
floors beautiful rugs. Diamond doesn't wear make-up -just jeans
oversized shirt. She looks beautiful. It ease
Will's nerves. He's got briefcase open him, speaking
sheaves notes papers.
DIAMOND
(interrupting)
Hold - know case load? The Government's trying
manage - they've withheld information.
WILL
The Internet, Doctor. It's highway - ride want. I
got 'the Center Disease Control. I look raw data.
DIAMOND
Jesus. Do know you're doing? This White House we're talking
about.
WILL
(Heated))
No, it's disease doesn't come worse - that's
we're talking about.
HE LOOKS AWAY, CALMING HIMSELF. HE SHUFFLES HIS NOTES. HE SPEAKS AGAIN,
QUIETLY -
WILL
I've listened lab - I think I know you're looking. Bacterias
mostly, there's strong push retro-viruses. You're wrong,
Doctor.
DIAMOND
Really - I thought I arrogant. But then, I'm professor.
WILL
No virus bacteria discriminated grounds sex.
DIAMOND
I think one.
WILL
Sure, start pockets stays there. This thing does. It
affects women child-bearing age. What - it's smart
recognize motherhood? I don't think so. No, heart
are. This genetic. This DNA.
DIAMOND
Thank you. A thousand genes human DNA - narrows
down.
WILL
As matter fact does. There's DNA that's passed
exclusively women. Thirty-seven genes, oldest human
organism -
DIAMOND
(realizing)
The mitochondrial DNA.
WILL
Over years there's speculation -not crazy -
triggers aging, He slides sheaf yellowing extracts
scientific journals table. She doesn't pay attention -
she's thinking.
DIAMOND
You realize you're saying, don't you? A bacteria - I think we'd
sure. A virus -you'd we've got chance. But you're
right. The mitochondrial DNA - that's far frontier,
barely it.
WILL
Like I said - doesn't worse this.
She keeps staring documents notes lying table. A
beat.
WILL (CONT'D)
Are okay?
DIAMOND
Sure.
WILL LOOKS AT HER FOR A MOMENT -
WILL
Shit. You're pregnant, aren't you?
DIAMOND
Nine weeks.
THEIR EYES MEET - SHE SHRUGS, TRYING TO PUT A BRAVE FACE ON IT. SHE GETS TO
HER FEET -
DIAMOND
Do want drink - coffee, sandwich something?
WILL
(Recoiling)
No...no, I'm fine thanks.
Watches picks papers puts battered
briefcase.
AN EMPTY STREET
It's late night. Will clutches briefcase arm, heading
home. A bitter wind blows north. He looks lonely forlorn
figure makes way pools light cast
streetlights.
CONVOY OF N.A.S.A. TRUCKS
RUMBLE THROUGH THE EARLY MORNING - THE CITY IS JUST WAKING. THE TRUCKS,
DOZENS OF WHITE EIGHTEEN-WHEELERS, TURN THROUGH THE FRONT GATES OF HARVARD.
THEY STOP IN FRONT OF THE GROVE OF TREES. WE CRANE UP FROM THEM TO A WINDOW
IN THE BIOLOGY BUILDING -
HAND HITS A TABLE
IT'S DIAMOND - SHE'S ANGRY. BREAKFAST TRAYS CLUTTER THE TABLE -SHE'S IN THE
MIDDLE OF A CONFERENCE WITH A GROUP OF SCIENTISTS. SHE GLARES AT AN
ARROGANT YOUNG NEUROLOGIST -
DIAMOND
It's idea, Bob. All we're taking walk
block.
A man 60s - distinguished, diplomatic - intercedes.
DE MAUPASSANT
There lot work 7Os. I can't recall details
idea mitochondriel DNA like genetic memory.
If unlock it, physically travel it. Through
evolution - like time machine.
BOB
Wowl Those 70s, man. I'm sorry I missed them.
Everyone - Diamond included - laughs.
OLD PHOTOS OF A SAILING BOAT
They hang wall tiny room - office,
hole-in-the-wall Will turned own. He sits table, making
notes. A knock - Diamond enters.
DIAMOND
I thought you'd like know - we're looking mitochondrial DNA,
WILL
Thanks telling me.
THEY LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER. IT'S AN AWKWARD MOMENT - NEITHER ONE QUITE SURE
WHETHER OR HOW TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION. DIAMOND SEES THE PHOTOS -
DIAMOND
Is you?
She points man 20s standing deck photos,
Will nods.
DIAMOND (CONT'D)
Seattle. Is went school?
Will hesitates - sense doesn't want answer.
WILL
No. Princeton.
DIAMOND
Expensive.
WILL
A scholarship. Then I post-graduate work... I
finished.
Something way Will says - sense loss - makes Diamond
pause. She recovers looks wallet. She pulls photograph
hands Will. It shows small sailing boatgaff-rigged varnished
hull.
WILL (CONT'D)
It's Kestrel 24 - I haven't seen years. She's beautiful
boati
DIAMOND
My grandfather left me. I don't sail - it's hard
for'etd hand.
WILL
What husband - doesn't sail.
DIAMOND
I don't know - I haven't met yet.
WILL LOOKS AT HER. HIS EXPRESSION SAYS IT - WHAT? SHE SHRUGS -

(pauses)
Good idea, bad timing.
WILL
How people mDNA?
DIAMOND
Seven.
WILL
That's all?!
DIAMOND
That's I spare. It's theory -one dozens theories.
Will looks away disgust.
DIAMOND (CONT'D)
What - it's science it? Why
passionate this?
WILL
I know I'm right. It's mutation. A thousand years it's probably
lying -shifting, weaving mDNA. You
change evolution engineer out. Seven peopleYou
shoot peas dam.
DIAMOND
You haven't answered question - passionate?
WILL
The question's relevant. The thing I'm interested
science.
He turns work. We hear door close Diamond leaves.
A GEODESIC DOME
White, space-age, erected lawn. Workmen unloading
NASA trucks. We pull high window Biology building. A
woman stands there, looking out. Her KRIS McQUADE. This
office -
MCQUADE
You want tell what's going on?
She turns looks Diamond, sitting desk,
DIAMOND
Don't ask, Kris, I'd lie I don't want best
friend,
MCQUADE
The rumor is, you've big. They Defense
Department taking over.
Diamond sits there, staring straight ahead. McQuade waits. Finally -
MCQUADE (CONT'D)
Okay, okay - I'm sorry I asked. So guy - what's done?
DIAMOND
He hasn't - I'm interested.
MCQUADE
Ten thousand employment records I've got file want know
lab assisant?
DIAMOND
The smartest assistant I've known.
MCQUADE
What - mop fart time?
She picks pages printer - including copy Will's
photo I.D.
MCQUADE (CONT'D)
He's handsome, I'll -
(a thought strikes her)
Jesus - you're interested like that, you?
DIAMOND
No, he's unbelievable smelling man.
MCQUADE
Smelling? You're pregnant - obviously hormones gone crazy. What
exactly smell like?
DIAMOND
You know...
(searching right word)
.., wholesome.
MCQUADE
Of course - that's Lysol.
Diamond laughs McQuade barely notices it. She's leafing WiU's
file -
MCQUADE (CONT'D)
That's strange - there's supposed background sheet. Family, school
-all shit. It gotten lost.
Before Diamond anything, young man enters. He's McQuada's
assistant.
ASSISTANT
Your secretary's line, Dr Diamond. There's you.
DIAMOND
Tell message.
ASSISTANT
It's New York Times.
MCQUADE
What want?
DIAMOND
I think Washington's news management went south.
THE WHITE HOUSE
Night. Scores television news vans parked outsideDutch, Japanese
French reporters stand-ups live-to-air. We hear Peter Jennings
ABC.
JENNINGS (O.S.)
We're standing live Washington events continue unfold
remarkable day. I don't think there's person who's
sitting radio television now. I'm told President way
press room -
FIFTH AVENUE
totally - young man rollerblades. He skates effortlessly
deserted avenue - past Tiffany's Trump Tower, silent
now.
PRESIDENT (O.S.)
My fellow Americans...
The rollerblader passes cathedral St John. The doors open.
Someone playing organ - Mozart's Requiem. The rollerblader fades
night.
STEEL DOOR OPENS
A sharp-faced caretaker - scruffy clothes limp - escorts Will
vaulted basement. All silhouettestowers crates, racks
equipment...
CARETAKER
This basement Psychology Department. We sort
stacked 'em -
He flicks switch - storage room floods light. He points
long iron cylinders - like small submarines - rigged series
valves pipes.
CARETAKER (CONT'D)
Flotation tanks. They 'em experiments sensory degradation -
WILL
Deprivation - sensory deprivation.
CARETAKER
Yeah, - whatever.
SHAFT OF LIGHT
WILL OPENS AN IRON HATCH THAT GIVES ACCESS INTO ONE OF THE TANKS. HE DROPS
INTO IT AND WALKS FORWARD, EXAMINING IT. THE DARKNESS CLOSES AROUND HIM. HE
STARES AHEAD. VOICES DRIFT OUT OF MEMORY -
YOUNG MAN (O.S.)
Now I know mole feels like -
YOUNG WOMAN (O.S.)
(lightly)
It feels like fucking coffin, that's feels like.
Other voices laugh. They're young like young think they'll
die.
CARETAKER (O.S.)
Hey, fella - doing?
HE'S PEERING DOWN THROUGH THE HATCH. WILL DRAGS HIMSELF OUT OF THE PAST. HE
TURNS -
WILL
Just looking. I'll coming - I'll need key.
The caretaker shrugs - sure. Will climbs tank.
WILL (CONT'D)
One thing - don't tell anyone, huh?
CARETAKER
Who I tell? They treat like shit Worse shit. All work,
appreciation. The phantom Harvard. Someone write fucking
musical me.
CIRCLES OF LIGHT
Desk lamps, glowing office. Diamond team researchers
working piles old journals extracts scientific papers.
RESEARCHER
Here's - "Mitochondrial DNAA Map Past."
DIAMOND
Who's by?
RESEARCHER
Same guy - Doctor Robert Plant.
DIAMOND
Jesus, guy - write book it? Who he?
HUGE BOOK BEING OPENED
It's scientific directory. The researcher flicks pages stops
"Plant".
RESEARCHER
Wow - I thought career impressive.
Diamond looks reading.
RESEARCHER (CONT'D)
Degrees medicine microbiology. A PhD 24, member Academy
Sciences, published times 1974...
DIAMOND
And then?
RESEARCHER
Then nothing.
DIAMOND REACTS. SHE GETS TO HER FEET, COMING CLOSER -
DIAMOND
Where undergraduate?
RESEARCHER
Princeton.
DIAMOND
On scholarship?
A CORRIDOR
It's late night. The scientists staff working
clock. Will wheels trolley laden bottles, vials, catheters
crowded corridor. Diamond pushes people behind, trying
catch him. Scientists turn speak ignores them.
DIAMOND (CONT'D)
Robert!
Will keeps walking, heading elevator. Diamond skirts knot
people.
DIAMOND (CONT'D)
Doctor Plant!
Will hesitates - split second - keeps going. The elevator doors
slide open. Will steps in, turns hits button. He watches Diamond
pushing him. For moment eyes meet. She comes closer.
Sswhish! The doors slide shut.
DIAMOND'S OFFICE
She sits desk, listening chief campus security.
SECURITY OFFICER
The equipment saw taken labs. It includes
range genetic material-
(hands inventory)
We've checked buildings team - he's
them.
DIAMOND
What hie house?
SECURITY OFFICER
He asked landlady look cat. She hasn't seen
days.
IN THE BASEMENT
there's make-shift bed hot-plate battered saucepan. Next
rack medical equipment laboratory vials.
Will sit'ting computers running parallel - data
equations reel them. The caretaker comes shadows,
carrying mugs coffee. He puts Will -
CARETAKER
You wanna tell exactly you're doing?
WILL
Looking date.
The caretaker stares confusion diagrams equations
screen -
CARETAKER
What's wrong calendar?
WILL
These chemical sequences - represent human genes. By following
trail mutations, I date them. I'm trying major
change occurred called mitochondrial DNA.
CARETAKER
The mitochondrial DNA? Yeah... makes sense.
But Will barely hears it. Suddenly he's leaning forward, keyboarding
complex commands. The caretaker watches -
CARETAKER (CONT'D)
You've it?
WILL
Maybe...
He illustrations long-chain molecules screen. He moves
together. Aa overlap, they're identical - tail
kicks upwarda. Will starel -
WILL (CONT'D)
(softly)
Yeah - I've it.
CARETAKER
So - what's date?
Will presses key. Faster eye follow, long-chain
molecule starts shift mutate. Finally resolves
second molecule. Will looks graph screen -
WILL
The best science do? One thousand years ago.
CARETAKER
Sort I figured - day two.
DIAMOND'S OFFICE
Diamond poring scientific articles written Will. She flicks
page -there's photo Will, 20 years younger, surrounded
colleagues. He's got arm - attractive young
woman.
Diamond lifts photo, looking closely. She starts read
caption. We push hold words... "UC Berkeley".
WE ARE FLYING
swooping soaring - weird landscape towering cliffs,
tumbling streams primordial forest. There's unreal -
pull reveal they're computer-generated images, playing
screens basement.
The caretaker pulled chair. He Will watching images
generated CD-ROM.
WILL
This someone's version prehistoric world. I'm interested
geography, atmosphere -that sort stuff.
CARETAKER
Where we?
WILL
Africa - that's Mankind started.
Will keeps looking strange images. The caretaker gets feet -
CARETAKER
I'll morning.
WILL
Yeah.
The caretaker limps door. Will looks -
WILL (CONT'D)
Thank - helping me, I mean.
CARETAKER
It sounds like you're leaving something.
WILL
No. I wanted it, that's all.
The caretaker keeps looking -
CARETAKER
What exactly doing? You're bit old try mark,
aren't you? Anyway, listens people like us.
WILL
Fate kind - man gets second chance. Do know
it's like ridiculed, ideas thrown face? And
easy part. I guess that's I'm - I want prove
I right.
CARETAKER
You're lying me.
WILL
What mean?!
CARETAKER
You going somewhere. I don't know is. I'm sure I
imagine it. Good luck, though. I hope you're
looking for.
WILL
Thanks.
CARETAKER
No point getting breakfast, huh?
Will shakes head - no. They smile other. The caretaker turns
goes.
DIAMOND'S OFFICE
Diamond looks papers articles littering desk. Her
Secretary stands doorway -
SECRETARY
I've got Eleanor Wilkins phone. She runs archives Berkeley.
DIAMOND
(into phone)
Ms Wilkins?
We push tight Diamond's face listens. Anxiety alarm
register it.
OUTER OFFICE
The security officer men looking maps
campus. Researchers scientists gathered office, rumors
flying. Everyone turns - Diamond stands doorway office. She
looks deMaupassant.
DIAMOND (CONT'D)
You right, Luc. That work remembered Berkeley -
it. He said man step evolutionary trail.
Within history race. It's imprinted
genes - like map. Anyone chemical key travel
it. Through womb. Through time space -
(she looks all)
That's he's doing. He's going back. He's going try change
evolution.
SECURITY OFFICER
Is possible?
DIAMOND
He best generation. He thinks so. He's got genetic
material key. All needs flotation tanks.
THE FLOTATION TANKS
The valves open - warm water pouring tanks.
Will sits rack medical equipment, beads sweat
forehead. He slides syringe forearm inserts catheter. He
opens series tiny valves glass vials. A cocktail fluid -
minutely measured doses - flows clear plastic arm. The
fluid hits blood stream drains it.
A LONG CORRIDOR
Diamond run fast pools light cast naked bulbs.
Ahead -a pair swing doors -
BOB
A theory's thing - think he'll try it?
DIAMOND
He's spent years lab assistant. He lives room walk-up
cat. No family, friends. What's There's left here? Of
course he'll it.
Smack! They push doors, corridor.
AN IRON LADDER
Will climbs flotation tank. Suddenly stops -
tremor, rippling wave, passes feet head. It's muscles
contracting. It wracks pain. He gasps intensity it.
Smash! The steel door basement shudders tries
in. Will looks - door twists moves. His vision starting
distort. He grabs access hatch swings -
Splashl He drops water. Clang! He closes hatch.
Barn? The steel door flies open. The security officer lowers sledge
hammer. Diamond steps end throws light switch.
DARKNESS IN THE TANK
Will floats back, sound rapid thump
heartbeat. The water sloshes forth - muscles going
spasms. We push body - face. His eyes roll
headl
All whites them. They shatter web capillaries -
WILL'S POV
red mist swirls him. It resolves web
interwoven tendrils -the double helix DNA molecule. Will starts
travel -
INSIDE THE TANK
Will morphing, shedding cells - we're losing warm, dark fluid
tank. It's like womb. His body disintegrating,
dissolving it. Water flows sockets eyes
were.
His hollow mouth opens. From far away hear scream - primal scream.
OUTSIDE THE TANK
Not sound escapes. The security officer try open
hatch.
DIAMOND (O.S.)
NO!
The security officer turns - Diamond holding catheter hand.
DIAMOND (CONT'D)
If open hatch, I think we'll kill him. It's late - it's
journey, he's going it.
INSIDE THE TANK
Will's body like shadow, water, growing
distinct moment. What left face - strange, shifting
shape - floats us. Closer... closer. It melts completely
water -
WILL'S POV
He spirals tunnel - whirlpool white light. As hits,
shatters million fragments light. It looks like comet, wheeling
heavens. A cosmic wind blows forward. Will traveling
space time -
OUTSIDE THE TANK
Diamond gathered computers. Bob working
keyboard. Diamond looking.through piles papers, notes
star charts.
DIAMOND
Everything's - kept record step. He tell
date -forty hours arrives there's solar eclipse.
BOB
Billie - there's note you.
Diamond looks shoulder screen. She reads
writ'ten -
DIAMOND
"I won't here, I solve thing sure tell them,
Billie. Tell Robert Plant, Doctor Robert Plant UC Berkeley."
THE FRAGMENTS OF LIGHT
blaze heavens. They draw together, changing reconstituting
shape recognize - interwoven strands DNA molecules. The
strands connect. A blast light! It's rays -
THE SUN
streaming cave. Will lies fetal position, bleeding
nose ears. The light grows stronger - it's dawn. Will drags
stumbles entrance. We tilt him. He doesn't it,
- prehistoric cave paintings etched rock.
A CRAGGY PEAK
Will steps cave. Sunrise sweeps world born brand new -
plains jungle primordial forest. Rising snow-capped
mountain looks like Kilamlnjlro. A ragged gash runs earth -
rift valley. Will stares it. He raises face sun. He it.
The step's - itl He looks - rising
valley tiny pillar smoke.
A FOREST CLEARING
In middle smoldering remains camp-fire. Will moves
cautiously it. He stops - bodies, terribly mangled, lie
ground.
Will turns - he's got matted hair, heavy brow
short, muscular body. As primitive is, there's doubt
species. He man. A Paleolithic man.
This hunting party -scattered weapons trussed carcasses
dead animals lie nearby. For moment Will thinks hunters
torn apart wild animals. Then looks trees -
bodies hunters. But animal - hang iron chains,
left sort trophy. Or warning.
CRUSHED LEAVES AND BROKEN PLANTS
Will following tiny trail forest. He's taken
useful bodies hunters - otter-skin water bag,
short-handled spears bed-roll animal pelt. He moves -
deeper shadows forest.
A SPARKLING STREAM
Will splashes crystal water. He looks upstream - small lake.
A flock strange birds - like huge flamingos flight blaze
pink gold.
He steps stream path beneath canopy
over-arching trees. We hold feet - whip! He triggers something. A
net woven vines engulfs him. He drops spears bedroll. Suddenly
he's soaring air.
He jerks halt - he's netted animal hanging high trees. The
faces Paleolithic men, crouched boughs, stare him.
PLUME OF WATER
cascades feet hidden gorge. Smoke curls fires.

fallen city. The apes confusion - soldiers workers
running, children screaming. A horse thrown rider
bolting terraces.
The darkness grows deeper. In sky, face moon
obliterates sun - it's solar eclipse.
Two horses, flying gallop, charge doors

THE SPACE DOME

INSIDE THE DOME
An illuminated chart dominates wall - like strategy map
Pentagon's war room. Every research center identified -
function list personnel. We Princeton, Stanford, Texas

technicians routing re-routing phone calls faxes.
We come glass wall. On Diamond -
A SMALL OFFICE
Glass doors seal electronic hum. Diamond, staring
glass, looks exhausted. DeMaupassent sits couch. He's

You're certain - time, I mean?
DEMAUPASSANT

Twelve weeks.
They look another. The old man speaks gently -

Good night, Billie.

INSIDE THE TANK
Water sloshes forth. Diamond lowers floats there.
For moment, stares circle light spilling

So beat on, boats current.
She reaches pulls hatch shut. Clang! Darkness.
THE SUN AND THE MOON
It's strange twilights celestial bodies hang

A column smoke flame spirals stone chimney
slaughterhouse.
RED HOT FIRE
burns huge furnace end slaughterhouse. The rickety
conveyor belt working, clattering away. Several ape workers throw
bodies lab animals - dead tribes-people - belt.
The body young boy carried forward belt. It dumps
furnace. The flames engulf him.
WILL'S EMPTY CELL
The door hangs open. The space lit dozen torches. Drak alone,
moving cell, trying work Will escaped. He looks
smashed bed, hole wall, torn clothing
harness.
He swings heavy door hinges touches lock. No answers
there. Lying doorway length wood nail end.
Drak picks up. He turns hand, th!nking it.
He jumps! One handed catches hold bars door.
Effortlessly, hauls pokes wood bars. The

Nazgul looks - sees Drak approaching shadows.
NAZGUL
Drak. I saying - maybe it's blessing.
DRAK
A blessing?
NAZGUL
Where there's one, others. If we'd killed him,
them.
MA-GOG
But animal's stupid - knows come day-break we'll tracking
him. Who's he'll run home?
Drak stops them.
DRAK
No - he's stupid. But dogs hunt packs seven. Every animal
needs kind. And - then?
MA-GOG
What think?!
DRAK
Just like tribes - burn holes, sword?
I don't mind - I like - it's enough, it? No
matter kill, year they're here. Why
different Blue Eyes? What need final solution.
NAZGUL And that?
DRAK (CONT'D)
Doctor Zora's brought patients place called Kismatu. I've
talking -
Several Council looking - perplexed.
MA-GOG

He turns Drak - eyes intense, interested.
NAZGUL (CONT'D)

A double set bars provide sort air-lock. Hanging sign

Drak Council Elders stare children. Doctor Zora

DOCTOR ZORA
We don't know causes it- virus probably. I'd hoped complete
research I came proposal. But, given
circumstances -
NAZGUL I
It's brilliant idea.
(turns smiles her)
Brilliant.
HORSES' HOOVES

Of children, I think - ape children.
WILL
How die, Strider? Old belly -is how?!
STRIDER

WILL
What you, Strider - cell?
STRIDER
I fought ape. Nothing heroic, I'm afraid - I drunk. He
fell badly, head hit branch tree going down. It broke
neck.
He pauses We're like humans. An ape kills own. Never.
WILL
What's punishment?
STRIDER
At ceremony summer rites, high priest curse death.
I left die forest -no journey waterfall,
no-one sacred words. Without that, ape walk
world. You saved life, Will I'm grateful. But there's I
soul. I'm dead ape walking.
Strider stripe meet hare. Will picks saddle blanket

STRIDER (CONT'D)
You knew, didn't you? You knew sun going swallow moon.
That's weren't afraid.
Will pauses - turns him.
WILL

STRIDER
WHO ARE YOU, WILL?
WILL
I've come long way, Strider - it's farther I explain.
STRIDER
I've heard stories - old apes tell 'round late night -
strange lands creatures tell future. Is you're

WILL
In way.. yeah, it's like that.
STRIDER
So happens afl, world we've built? Tell that.
WILL
It passes away.
Strider stares firelight.
STRIDER
History remembers, - it's passed on, did, I mean?
WILL
No, Strider - there's nothing, trace left behind.
Strider thinks moment, smiles gently.
STRIDER
So it's vanity - believe, works ape

WILL
Yes, it's vanity. But apes, Strider -maybe men, too.
He turns settles makeshift bed. Strider - food

Aragorn places hand circle stones, feeling warmth.
ARAGORN (CONT'D)

Strider nods head - yes. Will hasn't heard thing. He listens hard -

This rift valley Kenya -
He points towering, snow-capped peak.
WILL (CONT'D)
That's Kilamanjaro - thousand feet higher thousand years

DIAMOND
How long you?
WILL
All life.
DIAMOND
Dream more. You've it. Like said note - Doctor
Robert Plant UC Berkeley.
WILL turns looks valley -

DIAMOND
An ape civilization? You said city.., happened all?
WILL
You know we've Aragorn's race? Seventeen bones, that's
all. Anthropologists discovered evidence apes -
skulls. Bones lot longer civilizations.
DIAMOND
I guess there's lesson that.
WILL
Listen, Billie - apes discovered disease.
Diamond reacts. Will crouches - dirt scratches small
chain circles. It's molecule.
WILL (CONT'D)
It's rare and, lucky them, it's isolated area. They're
stupid - understand it's potential. They plan tribes

upright human.
WILL (CONT'D)
Somewhere rift valley like - man.
DIAMOND
Woman. You said mitochondrial DNA - woman.
She reaches forward scratches long hair figure's head.
WILL
You're right. Sooner later apes her. She doesn't look like
tribes apes don't care - she's human.
So disease. She's different - doesn't work,
doesn't to. It gets integrated her. It's passed on,
mutates, weaves way mDNA. It lies - bomb waiting
off. And day -
DIAMOND
After thousand years?
WILL
The planet's billion years old. What's Nature? A blink
eye.
Will throws stick ground.
WILL (CONT'D)
That's theory, anyway.
DIAMOND

A helluva theory, Doctor Plant.
HE TURNS AND LOOKS IT HER -
DIAMOND (CONT'D)
There's time, Will. We apes

Sure. Of course it's too.
DIAMOND
But then, don't care muchabout people you?
THEY LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER. A BEAT. WILL'S VOICE IS HARD -

Strider sits apart, watching, sure humans lost minds.
STRAW MAN FLIES TOWARDS US
