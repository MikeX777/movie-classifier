Robert Zemeckis starring Michael J. Fox; released 1996. Jackson Walsh live Wellington son, Billy.
The version Heavenly Creatures published final draft, completed March 1993. The screenplay 107 pages long.
Fran, understanding interested Parker/Hulme murder case film subject. It popular topic New Zealand.
Frances Walsh: Well, popular topic-I'm sure that. But it's certainly piece New Zealand criminal history entered realm myth. And young girl growing up, I knew it, read lurid newspaper accounts- "Lesbian killers' rampage"?
FW: Yes, yes. And I got hands novel called Obsession, I read I 14. I thought time extremely good. [laughs] It takes damning view girls-it's written English journalists came cover trial. It hack job set sensationalize case.
And play, wasn't there?
FW: Yeah, there's play, nonfiction books written it. There's great deal coverage years newspapers magazines, it's profile here.
Since treated different ways, compelled explore subject again?
Peter Jackson: Well, didn't think treated well. Nothing read particularly like. And also, treatments specific agenda, attempted political statements murder. What interested 15-year-old girls agenda accurate possibly could, imagine going inside minds.
I know Pauline's voiceovers film actual diary entries. You interesting comment awhile actually informed structure film. Could elaborate that?
PJ: Well, structure fairly apparent started research. It wasn't diaries themselves, general research. We read diaries could-we haven't actually seen full, unedited diary-but gathered excerpts releasedat time trial could, amounted pages. And read newspapers, interviewed people, acts sort materialized neatly. You know, act girls meet friends, turning point end act realize bonded.
FW: It's delusional experience Port Levy, Fourth World. You know girls imagination that's going lead interesting happening. The second turning point comes decision murder Mother, tips
story act.
Whom interview cull information?
PJ: Well, went 35 40 people. We wanted interview people find. Several refused. We talk 15 16 classmates, experience. These 55-year-old women spread country, changed names they'd gotten married. It detective job them.
I read school particularly enthusiastic this; help locate ex-students?
PJ: No, school didn't want it. Christchurch Girls' School erased girls history. The yearbook class photograph Pauline longer available. If school library, yearbooks available apart 1953's, photo it. It sort cleansing books. The school didn't recognize trying do, redress issue. Why wipe girls school records? I mean, human beings.
FW: Peter Jim Booth, producer movie, went headmistress school, explained wanted do, allowed read script, comment was, "Why can't film pupils proud?"
PJ: We heard sources interviewed day murder happened, headmistress time stood assembly said, "No girl discuss certain matter." This was, like, day pupils murdered somebody, couldn't refer directly. Forty years later, got sense school exactly same. And gave reason movie, felt people
living 1950s. We lot people interviewed-that 40 years gone by, presenting attitudes '50s: dark, sordid little thingthat best kept quiet mentioned. Many times got, "Why earth want film this?" We forget it, hope disappear."
And actually thought that. But 20 30 years people connected dead, point time we'll know it. We felt good time now, people alive, interviews try accurate, record. We aware responsibility had, film persuasive medium, knew that, unlike medium-the newspaper accounts, play-itcan audience visual images, which, way, replace real event, especially weren't born time. So thought film now, people New Zealand look case different way. That responsibility felt didn't want lightly.
Pertaining quest accuracy, reconstructing, instance, conversations Pauline mother, scenes direct documentation?
FW: Well, attempt people involve-the type people were, class background, etc. So degree, spoke people knew Riepers, example, good knowledge girls.
Did interview boarders Rieper house?
PJ: Yeah, I did, briefly. We boarders, spoke telephone. I interview, following day I called ask questions clammed up; didn't want talk anymore. He'd obviously gone home wife, she'd
wound thing told shouldn't involved it.
FW: I think understanding set write able re-create right interiors, characters precisely reflect people there. Our intention true understood girls' friendship, nature
friendship nature families girls came. It attempt re-create reality. We that, obviously. So went things spirit trying reflect situation, reality.
PJ: The Hulme family lot easier research Pauline's family, Hulmes public figures time. Henry Hulme rector local university, obviously lot university people talk professors, students-who worked him. Hilda Hulme public figure. They were, respects, royalty Christchurch, English class exist there, things seriously.There garden tennis parties Ilam, lot people social contact parents Juliet time.
The research actually carried shooting film. I remember England, auditioning actresses Juliet Kate Winslet, [the late] Anthony Quayle, English actor, actually visited Hulmes Christchurch '50s, tracked wife spoke her. The research kept going time. We trips Christchurch research, started working film, moved
nearly months, ideal opportunity others. We'd hear things person sat Pauline typing class, we'd rush them.
I'm sure production got certain notice local media, people probably approached you.
PJ: To extent, hoped. Pauline's people actually difficult research, weren't public; private people.
FW: We heard, subsequently, Pauline's sister, Wendy, seen film. She lives Christchurch. Her meets film managed capture atmosphere home time, criticism family "better" that, portrayed shabby light. And touched me.
PJ: She thought portrayal tension Pauline mother accurate. It nice, Wendy key people alive refuses talk it. She absolutely refuses journalists, anyone, actually sweet message us. It amazing gone film. She thought good, incredibly difficult watch.
In gathering material, I'm sure certain things didn't "fit" dramatically. Was tempted use didn't, sensationalistic ethically questionable?
PJ: There area deliberately steered clear felt ultimately didn't relation wanting tell, Rieper household actually younger sister, named Rosemary, Down's syndrome, alive; Wendy looks her. At time murder, Rosemary 8 years old. This Honora's life difficult: daughter lived special home, come home weekends. Pauline writes Rosemary lot diaries; fond her. But area felt invasive privacy family.
As say, bit stuff leave structural reasons. Pauline's diaries very, funny. We ended lot dramatic material movie, scenes she's talking murder suicide, unfortunately leave lot funny things out. She records hilarious conversations Juliet had, it's witty.
Sometimes diary entries dramatized them, opposed voiceover. Like sequence Fourth World, hilltop changes magical landscape. That described diary. So case having selective, end day, dramatic selections movie funnier stuff.
The girls ' sense humor manage come film, though. I'm thinking, instance, scene Rieper house, family having lunch Juliet girls HONORA
Victoria Park. Were snide comments Sir Edmund Hillary diary, invented you?
FW: That imagination. We told extremely jolly meal-it actually court records-and cracking jokes, saying silly, outrageous things, sort giggly high. And knew Wendy worked Farmer's, localdepartment store, big news year Sir Edmund Hillary, New Zealander, climbing Mt. Everest. He knighted, huge national hero; is. Because he'd spent time Christchurch, felt appropriate thing
send up, did, terribly irreverent. If Queen visiting, example, wouldn't bother note decorations, pomp ceremony, enrich royal celebrations. They respect icons day; interior world important them.
The film critic Time, Richard Corliss, likened "physician assumes patients fever order understand illness." At point decide going presented girls' point view?
PJ: I think beginning. That motivations it. None accounts came girls' point view. Like we'd said before, agendas, felt telling girls' story important. It long time able that, took long time learn were, driving them. We bit confused-there bit mystery beginning-but read, talked people, gradually began formulate people were. Ultimately, lot Pauline I recognize myself, useful.
You, too, Fran?
FW: I felt diary: offered insight friendship, Pauline particular. It extremely interesting account life, documenting dramatic mundane events great deal literary flair. She imaginative, funny clever young woman pretentious ideas, teenagers do, I warmed immediately. Reading diary wonder huge discrepancies young woman monster portrayed newspaper accounts else. And I thought great journey was. Because diary Juliet's survived-we heard people diary, destroyed-I thought harder know her, wasn't case, appeared readily shared life people; social creature Pauline. So combination private world shared understanding got talking school friends, inparticular, gave insight nature girls way appeared rest world.
I think it's fair Peter I felt hugely sympathetic Pauline Juliet, start identify empathize them, trying balance knowledge terrible act. It dynamic, liking them, feeling abhorrence they'd done, kept thing alive long minds, gave film inner life.
Peter, camera work, films you've directed, extremely dynamic. In 'Heavenly Creatures,' hyperactive camera organic relationship girls' euphoric state. I've noticed script lot camera directions written in, screenplays I've read. Do scripts read like this?
PJ: In particular screenplay, camera movement came readily writing stages. At end day, script document want sell; it's document cast crew read. When write script intended direct, it's right beginning shooting script; document technicians use. You know, grips circle word "DOLLY" remember particular day shooting they're going truck. With movie, probably I've done, camera moves integral scriptwriting. I'll tell came from: music. We read early research Pauline Juliet obsessed Mario Lanza. Neither familiar music, went got records, started writing played came songs liked. One ones heard "The Donkey
Serenade"- FW: Well, knew important Pauline named novels "The Donkey Serenade."
PJ: When heard it, life vitality song immediately indicated Steadicam. [laughs] It immediately told moving camera. We chose songs movie, and, case "The Donkey Serenade," wrote scenes them. I great visual tool. It's happened I've done-I mean, I've music advance. We songs playing working psyched write scene. At time, music helped visualize, visualization ended going page. Of course, actually arrive set, actors camera people there, things change. I don't regard that's written script terms camera direction asbeing locked stone.
How long finish draft?
PJ: Not long. I think draft written probably 10 12 weeks. But didn't start write we'd uncovered months' worth research.
And draft we're publishing shooting script?
PJ: Yeah. I think that's draft number five. We interesting thing. We certain research first, working Braindead [Dead Alive U.S.], wrote
draft position felt knew facts, lot gaps. We thought wrote draft know holes were, know pursue terms research. For instance, Fran I Christchurch wrote draft, Christchurch integral story. Then trip second draft able modify lot things, interview lot people. We actually purpose, wanted nail story overlaying lot historical detail.
How handle writing collaboratively?
PJ: Well, depends. You know, Fran's working re-writes we're shooting, I'm set, she'll work she's I come home we'll revise together, generally, we're actually writing initial drafts script, it's together.
I think good understanding structure, helps, I'm obviously visually oriented, Fran good dialogue character, complement well. I think best advantage writing scripts write script I make, is, I think, wonderful thing. It strange experience write script going make, we've actually experienced loss control writers have. So right beginning, it's movie. It's piece writing that's going marketplace sell.
Just little thing. Even Heavenly Creatures written us, favorite scene movie written Fran herself.
Which that?
PJ: Well, late night, hoping finish draft script-it was, like, o'clock already-and arrived sequence tearooms they're having cup tea walk track. We sat wondering earth going write scene. We knew they'd actually gone tea we'd spoken elderly woman served them. She said talking calmly another. But dialogue mouths particular moment, woman's murdered? Well, phone rang, I got answer ended stuck 45 minutes, I came Fran written something. She asked check out, revised: it's slides plate cake Honora, says, "Go on, Mother, treat yourself." It perfect.
I know Kate Winslet audition England. How come Melanie Lynskey, played Pauline? I understand professional actress.
PJ: Well, it's stories sounds like it's true. We wanted cast New Zealand, we'd auditioned lot people-five hundred-who videotaped photographed. I wanted young, 1S 16 years old; I didn't want 23-year-old school uniform. And wanted physically like original Pauline; I thing accurate possible. So quickly exhausted professional actors New Zealand happened look like Pauline-there's two. [laughs] We knew looking experience, them. We kept saying, "Somewhere New Zealand there's somebody who's perfect role."We actually weeks away beginning shooting, people short list, happy with, coming enormous pressure cast them, because, know, wardrobe department needed costumes,
on, Fran said me, "You're happy choices, you?" And I said, "No." And said, "This crazy; we've spent time energy film haven't Pauline. This close major tragedy." I Christchurch, Fran decided drive casting person lower half North Island New Zealand-she prepared drive far to. They'd visit small town, local school, visit principal's office photo Pauline Parker. She'd say, "We're making movie Pauline Parker; pupils school resemble interested this?"
FW: We rusting Ford Cortina, official I.D. We'd roll provincial schools, we'd greeted curious teacher. Although questioned authenticity, asked car: "If you're films, aren't driving
Porsche?" [both laugh] So I pitch story entire classroom, scanning room time, looking sullen, brooding school girls, thinking, "What look like hair dyed black?"
PJ: I guess went week. Every night I'd Fran. Anyone vaguely appropriate videotaped, I got couple tapes Christchurch, bit depressing. Finally, Fran called small town called New Plymouth, said, "I think I've interesting. ' And Mel. We flew Christchurch gave audition screen test, cast weeks film started shooting. I called mother Friday night said, "I'd like Melanie film." And said, "When start?" And I said, "Well, she's got come Sunday." The poor girl didn't chance school clean locker.
Do think correspondence actresses backgrounds characters playing?
PJ: One things knew Pauline incredibly witty intelligent, Melanie similar-she student province subjects. And knew cast intelligent person, going hit it. Melanie's enigmatic. The character Pauline doesn't enormous dialogue. In sense, real Pauline Parker speaks her, diaries. So looking actress kind aspect that's real movie-star thing: film somebody sitting room, nothing, they're fascinating watch. We Mel.
I've read actual locations this.
PJ: As could. The location couldn't use Pauline's house, torn down. Fortunately, school community center; actual school moved different location, longer control buildings; we'd definitely refused
permission. The school buildings owned Christchurch City Council, them; they're 40 years ago. They rent rooms community groups. We classroom Pauline Juliet actually in, Canterbury
Women's Embroidery Guild-it sounds like Monty Python-and went room right length wall huge tapestry stretched massive frame. I thought want down, managed it. So actual classroom were, seating.The Ilam house, Juliet lived, there. It's owned university, happy use it. As doctor's surgery, Pauline interviewed doctor, address, and-you know, 40 years later, idea expect-it just, like, suburban house. We thought strange, didn't like doctor's office. Anyway, knocked door, woman answered happened doctor's daughter-the doctor's long dead-and asked father's office been, said, "Oh, rooms house here; we've touched them." We went doctor's surgery exactly 40 years before. So ended filming sequences actual room Pauline interviewed doctor.We spoke woman working tearooms Victoria Park exactly sitting, filmed scene there. Actually, months later, building demolished.
And murder scene?
PJ: Well, went murder site, felt uncomfortable filming there. It strange, maybe imagination, quiet, tranquil. I mean, way path hear wind birds, suddenly, arrive spot, hear nothing. So filmed murder scene Victoria Park, different track, yards away.
There sequence scenes script didn't appear film. begins tennis party Ilam, Pauline Juliet watching shrubbery Walter Perry Hilda Hulme play tennis.
PJ: Well, sequence actually shot, exists version film screened New Zealand. When Miramax released film U.S., screenings felt film long. We final control film, pleaded 10 minutes' worth footage, convinced tighter. We looked it, actually, ultimately, agreed funny sort way. That sequence slows momentum down. It's fun
read-and it's fun film well-but slow things point didn't think things slowing down. Although we've control film's release world, we've requested sequence cut versions screened country. When you're writing script, thinks, "Oh, perfect, mustn't change word it," it's finished takes life own. We felt sequence wasn't telling wedidn't know characters, time tension Pauline's house growing, going Juliet's house watch tennis game necessary.
FW: I think wrote script felt Pauline Juliet's story. After edit, however, evident Pauline's story line audience's focal point. Whenever veered telling Hulme story Pauline wasn't screen, pace started flag. That look assembly-we trim cut Hulme scenes weren't fundamentally interesting Rieper scenes.
Although film different Braindead, place New Zealand 1950s. I'm familiar country, watching films I assume was, period, fairly repressive kind society, acting breeding ground transgression, explosive kinds behavior.
PJ: Well, script Braindead set modern day minute. I worried going movie hero film, named Lionel, acted fairly nerdy kind way-he doesn't socialize, takes care mother-and wanted empathetic character film. I afraid set modern day, audience-especially young audience-would jeer character, able relate all. If set inthe '50s, people actually feel sympathy him, think, "Well, sort thing happened then." With Heavenly Creatures, coincidence actual event taken place then.
FW: But repression evidence here: we're I expressive, we're demonstrative, we're scared showing, saying much. When New York, instance, people yelling horns blaring-if happened here, theircar, rip open door bash up. There's level violence, subtext violence, running New Zealand society comes movies. We veneer easygoing, underneath, we're rage. It's interesting social dynamic. makes interesting art, it's pleasant actually live it. It's link England- PJ: Christchurch particular.
FW: Christchurch suffers city New Zealand. It's described "a little piece England"; it's considered English England. It's aspired that, ways.
PJ: The thing murder, too, sense talk older generation Christchurch embarrassment city, shameful humiliating. Which ridiculous, story ultimately family tragedy.
FW: It's said Christchurch appalled revelation Pauline's parents married murder itself. And uncharitable souls suggested sinful act led other.
Speaking generally films, certain love campiness, apparent use caricatures characters, overall sort extremism reminiscent work like John Waters U.S. What's interesting Heavenly Creatures remains fundamentally "realistic" docudrama, figures authority, like doctor, vicar headmistress, hilariously overplayed.
PJ: Well, I like movies entertaining, little larger life. With like Braindead, obviously there's problem that. But 'Heavenly Creatures,' telling hoped fairly accurate story. At time, however, I wanted movie; I didn't want totally tied real life, totally dull. So little bit fun characters. I guess trying justify presenting girls' point view, that's strictly true. I think people needed realistic with, Juliet Pauline, slightly larger life anyway. That's came interviews classmates. They remembered sort terrifying: Juliet confident loud, Pauline brooding dark. So, sense, film perfect us. I don't Like stuff that's totally naturalistic. I like having little bit fun.
The fantasy sequences written pretty appeared film. Were aware how, technically, going handle special effects writing?
PJ: Pretty much. We hadn't optical digital effects Braindead, Heavenly Creatures, I knew I actually wrote digital effects script, great excuse new equipment-I special effects company. So right beginning wrote stuff morphing. We got hired figure worked.
What use Plasticine figures? Was you'd heard girls interested in?
PJ: Yeah, interviewed people remembered model figures Plasticine, I think HERBERT
Rieper refers court testimony. We interviewed old guy round Hulme's place seen Juliet's Plasticine horses mantelpiece.
And, course, endless passages diaries Borovnia, Diello, murderous prince that. When thought fun right beginning fantasy sequences, thing I wanted dress actors medieval costumes
crowns looking like school play. So decided fun tie Plasticine figures Borovnia together. And knew they'd sculpted figures like Diello, thought, figures come life, were.
What linking certain actors certain figures, like Orson Welles Diello?
PJ: Well, devised ourselves. But again, springs fact girls pet names people. Like boarders diary, instance, referred John while, changed Nicholas.
That's referred scene Pauline's sleepout.
PJ: Yeah, reason, Pauline refers Nicholas rest diary. That happened lot people. They clearly real, live people prototypes fantasy characters. We figured Diello lot qualities fear Orson Welles. He represent sort dark, sexual force, figured giving features figure Diello appropriate.
Could talk fact that, production, Anne Perry, mystery writer, "outed " Juliet Hulme?
FW: Well, start? We knew possible outcome making film-that try track Pauline Juliet. Which good reason movie. We compelling reasons film, however, didn't, anotherone going anyway. There were, time film funded, competing projects states preparation.
Didn't Dustin Hoffman works?
FW: His company, Punch Productions, I believe, script written American writer; Peter had, fact, tentatively approached read it, it. At point week away starting shoot. And trying film version play we've spoken of, people developing politicized lesbian version story. Then there'd screenplay written late English novelist, Angela Carter, production company Auckland, Australia developing screenplay. So knew story going come screen, soon-there doubt going it. And felt that, climate, proceed, despite possibility women exposed.We knew Pauline's case likely. We'd heard lot rumor gossip Juliet, we'd heard Pauline, I think carefully hidden identity. Juliet went trouble: took stepfather's name-Hilda Hulme ended marrying Walter Perry-as novelist, proceeded write series crime novels. You look contemporary author index library, Anne Perry, birthdate Juliet Hulme's, mother's maiden same, etc. There gap personal history, leaves New Zealand, picks left country. So didn't huge detective work journalist New Zealand heard Anne Perry JulietHulme same.
That rumor sprang production play gone year started shooting, friend Juliet's, writing her, confided actors Juliet Hulme writing murder mysteries Anne Perry. That rumor hew acting community New Zealand, reached ears set, wanted entirely disassociate from, knew damage film, knew damage us. It inevitable accused exploiting woman's situation order promote movie. When journalist rang Peter asked comment story, begged print it. Of course hopeless situation, tabloid hack going ahead name, dined since. We felt enormous dread, movie hadn't chance stand known, it's inextricably linked revelation. So we've battling since. But given it's happened, we've deal it, has.
PJ: I mean, absolutely disgusted ads Miramax ran. On day released America, I rang Miramax said, "For heaven's sake, don't associate film don't approve publicity." And couple months later, lo behold,
sent friend States clippings ads saying, "Murder, She Wrote," references Anne Perry Miramax running, very, angry.
Did fever consider coordinates actual event, changing particulars push fictional realm?
PJ: No, case well-known New Zealand; like-
FW: Fictionalizing O.J. Simpson case.
PJ: It's unnecessary. I mean, sure, movie international consumption, then, yeah. But fact weren't actually making film international audience. We
making try rectify 40 years misunderstanding case New Zealand. In way main motivation making film, that, obviously use real names. But having said that, "Pauline Parker" "Juliet Hulme" ceased exist people 1959, took different names. In sense, I don't think moral problem names, stopped 30-odd years ago.
Were films looked inspiration writing this?
FW: Well, looked movies like Let Him Have It, based Craig/Bentley murder case England [Bentley 18-year-old low I.Q. hanged murder]. Although I think film lot merit, end comes grim, dark, true-life murder
story, similarly Dance Stranger, Ruth Ellis [the woman hanged England]. We felt thing didn't want do, depressing murder film. We wanted tell tale friendship, murder story. Sure, movie ends murder, part, celebrates friendship.
PJ: We wanted lot funnier films. And people said, "It's subject; try funny?" Well, obviously murder wasn't funny, attempted funny, friendship funny. Life funny: generally, human beings
like enjoy themselves, doubt Pauline Juliet hell good time, time.
FW: But reason important tell true story kind universal truth anybody growing up. When you're age, focused things extreme way. And I don't think Pauline Juliet different anybody else; I think things went wrong lives-Juliet's parents broke up, Pauline alienated family (she obsessional manic-depressive character)-and I think terriblecombination things led extraordinarily horrible act. But it's precluded anybody's experience growing up. Adolescence crazy time.
PJ: A lot women come said, "I Pauline. That me. That childhood." I don't think it's unusual. I think unusual thing aspects Pauline's character led murder, I don't think sort person particularly unusual freakish weird. When hear things like that, it's best possible endorsement get.
