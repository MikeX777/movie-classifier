EXT. HANCOCK TOWER, CHICAGO - LATE NIGHT
Lake Shore Drive. Four o'clock morning. Minimal traffic,
minimal life. As MAIN TITLES BEGIN, PAN UP face of...
...Hancock Tower. Up, up, floors, sixty, eighty, dark
here, street sounds fading fast, CREDITS CONTINUE

...a dark FIGURE. Like spider. Inching way steel
surface 98th floor, CLOSE see...
The THIEF. All black, nearly invisible, sleek visored
helmet conceals face. Two long, oblong backpacks, climb-
ing ropes harness shoulders, tools belt.
Moving STRAIGHT UP face skyscraper. How possible?
CLOSER see...
...the piton-like BOLTS electromagnetic, CLANKING steel
support weight. A button releases magnetic charge
bolt pulled cords higher position. The Thief
remarkably strong agile, scaling wall fluid precision,
until...
...our summit. A softly-lit, glass-walled PENTHOUSE
100th floor. Subtle spots bathe paintings, sculptures,
cavernous coldly-decorated space.
Swiftly, deftly, Thief rigs suction-mounted HARNESS
steel casing massive window. Pulleys, metal caribiner
clips, yellow Kevlar ropes. So superbly practiced, rigging

...RELEASES outside suction cups. The window's weight
supported interior rigging. The outside equipment pulled
INTO apartment single tug. The WHINE motor,
pane pulls UP, Thief expertly POPPING place.
No trace entry.
Rapidly folding rigging astonishingly compact bundle,
Thief SCANS...
...the profusion priceless art. The paintings run Otto Dix,
Franz Marc, Marcel Duchamp. One statue obvious Rodin. The soft
lighting makes walls invisible, infinity
perspective mind. An obsidian slab dining table
end horizon.
The Thief packed rigging away, taken large cylin-
drical TUBE bearing label can't read. Knows way, quickly
spectacular apartment, past oils early German
expressionists, Russian futurists, Rothko, Kandinsky, Francis
Bacon. The Thief these, CREDITS CONTINUE,

...a powder room. A lime-green poured concrete sink, copper-
plated commode, these...
...a single PAINTING. Unlike others, clearly Old Master.
A 17th century city water, churches, spires, ancient
bridge. The Thief wastes time, unceremoniously...
...CUTS painting frame sure, perfect strokes.
Rolls quickly acid-free paper. Opens cylindrical tube,
pulling out...
...another CANVAS see. Deftly unrolls this,
fitting carefully stolen painting's now-empty frame.
Re-hangs it. Stares beat opaque helmet visor.
Approves. Slips rolled-up stolen canvas tube.
Leaves. Before follow, shift angle replacement
