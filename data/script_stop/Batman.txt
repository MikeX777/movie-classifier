FIRST DRAFT
October 20, 1986
FADE IN:
EXT. CITYSCAPE - NIGHT
The place Gotham City. The time, 1987 -- removed.
The city Tomorrow: stark angles, creeping shadows,
dense, crowded, airless, random tangle steel
concrete, self-generating, subterranean
aspect... hell erupted sidewalks
kept growing. A dangling fat moon shines overhead, ready
burst.
EXT. CATHEDRAL - NIGHT
Amid chrome glass sits dark ornate Gothic
anomaly: old City Cathedral, grand, abandoned --
long boarded scheduled demolition.
On rooftop far us, STONE GARGOYLES gaze
shadowy, windswept perches, keeping monstrous watch
distant streets below, sightless guardians
Gotham night.
One moving.
EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - NIGHT
The pulsing heart downtown Gotham, neon nightmare
big-city corruption, surreal oppressiveness.
Hookers wave drug dealers. Street hustlers slap high-
fives three-card monte dealers. They know
other... conspicuous exception:
A TOURIST FAMILY, Mom, Dad, little Jimmy, staring
straight ahead march perfect lockstep
main drag. They've come bit blocks
over; respectable theatre crowd thinned out,
-- Playbills hand -- adrift
predatory traffic Gotham's meanest street.
MOM
For God's sake, Harold,
taxi??
DAD
I'm trying --
(shouting)
TAXI!!
Three cabs streak pass disappear. MOM grimaces
frustration LITTLE JIMMY consults subway map.
JIMMY
We're going wrong way.
Nearby, STREET TYPES beginning snicker. DAD surveys
nervously, gestures subway map.
DAD
Put away. We'll look like
tourists.
TWO COPS lean patrol car outside all-night
souvlaki stand, sipping coffee chatting HOOKER.
The HOOKER smiles JIMMY. JIMMY smiles back. MOM yanks
street glowers DAD.
DAD (cont.)
We'll cab here. Let's
cut Seventh.
JIMMY
Seventh way.
DAD
I know are!
EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
A deserted access street, sidewalks lined husks
stripped-down cars. MOM, DAD, JIMMY deep breath
march darkened street. A VOICE startles them.
VOICE
Hey, mister. Gimme dollar?
The VOICE belongs DERELICT -- nineteen twenty,
acne-scarred -- sits garbage cans, palm
uplifted. His ratty t-shirt reads: 'I LOVE GOTHAM CITY.'
MOM, DAD, JIMMY pause merest seconds,
-- pretending hear.
DERELICT
Mister. How it. One dollar?
(standing up)
One dollar, man. Are deaf?
Are deaf? -- Do speak
English??
By TOURISTS halfway street.
Mercifully, DERELICT doesn't following.
They pick pace. They don't SHADOWY FIGURE
alleyway. They don't GUN gloved hand
brings down, butt-first, DAD's neck.
DAD crumples. MOM grabs JIMMY backs brick
wall, terrified scream. The DERELICT races
street join confederate, STREET PUNK, who's
searching DAD's wallet.
MOM's mouth opens panic. They she's
snap -- STREET PUNK, crouch, trains
gun JIMMY.
STREET PUNK
Do kid favor, lady. Don't
scream.
The poor woman utterly horrified. TEARS stream
face. But keeps wits her, stifles urge
shriek, hustles JIMMY street.
The PUNKS watch break run -- chuckle,
slap hands, race opposite direction.
EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT
Six stories up. The PUNKS -- NICK EDDIE -- hunker
tar-and-gravel roof, sizing take.
NICK
(emptying wallet)
All right. The Gold Card.
(tossing credit card
EDDIE's face)
Don't leave home it.
A chill wind whips roof NICK extracts
cash begins count it. There's distant, indistinct
CLANG: metal metal. EDDIE hears tenses up.
EDDIE
Let's beat it, man. I don't like
here.
NICK
What, scared heights?
EDDIE
I dunno, man. After happened
Johnny Gobs --
NICK
Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped
walked roof, right? No big
loss.
EDDIE
That ain't I heard. That ain't
I heard all.
(beat)
I heard bat got him.
NICK
Gimme break, you? Shut up...
EDDIE
Five stories, straight down. There
blood body.
NICK
No shit. It
pavement.
NICK patience campfire tales --
roof, pale moonlight, can't ignore slight
tingle base spine...
EDDIE
There blood, man.
(beat)
My brother says... bad things
done... come
haunt you...
NICK
Listen this. How old you?
There ain't bat.
EDDIE
My brother's priest, man.
NICK
No wonder you're chickenshit.
Now shut up.
(conclusively)
There ain't bat.
As speak attention shifts point
opposite corner roof, yards away...
where, end line, STRANGE BLACK SILHOUETTE
dropping slowly, implacably, frame...
EDDIE
You shouldn'ta turned gun
kid, man. You shouldn'ta --
NICK
Do want money don't
you? Now shut up! Shut --
BOTH PUNKS FREEZE sudden, inexplicable sound
BOOTS CRUNCHING ON GRAVEL. They turn slowly. Their JAWS
DROP.
Standing edge roof, bathed moonlight,
BLACK APPARITION. IT DOES NOT MOVE.
EDDIE stands rooted spot, choked gurgle
throat, he's seen death. The BLACK
FIGURE advances, spreading arms. Or rather, WINGS:
GREAT BLACK BATWINGS, flapping wind.
NICK drops gravel, gropes gun, brings up.
And BLACK FIGURE draws closer, deliberate,
menacing. On chest: THE EMBLEM OF A BAT, oval
yellow field, glowing like target darkness...
NICK FIRES TWICE. TWO CLEAN HITS. The strange black figure
knocked bodily roof.
Trembling, sweating buckets, NICK gets feet. He
whacks motionless EDDIE arm --
NICK (cont.)
I'm gettin' outta here.
-- bends retrieve loot. EDDIE lets
strange, pre-verbal squeal...
... NICK sees THE HUMAN BAT, BACK ON ITS FEET,
NIGHTMARISH, UNDEAD, MOVING SLOWLY AND INEVITABLY CLOSER.
Panic. Sheer, raw, unrelenting panic. Stolen money flutters
NICK's hands. He scuttles periphery
roof, feet skidding gravel searches
way down. The BLACK SPECTRE blocking path
escape. Trapped like rat, NICK FIRES WILDLY.
EDDIE frozen place, eyes glazed over, face
drained blood. The BAT treads calmly past. A LEG snakes
out. A BLACK BOOT catches EDDIE high chest --
-- LIFTS HIM CLEANLY OFF HIS FEET --
-- AND SENDS HIM FLYING THROUGH THE AIR. EDDIE slams
brick chimney slumps roof unconscious, broken,
weightless puppet.
THIS ACTION IS SO SMOOTH, SO AUTOMATIC, THAT THE BAT DOES
NOT EVEN BREAK HIS STRIDE. NICK sees chance CHARGES
past black wraith, scrambling escape...
A GLOVED HAND slices air, NICK pitches
forward, legs ensnared tangle WIRES. Screaming
now, drags gravel roof, looming
figure BAT heels...
... there's place left go. NICK cowers
ledge, pants torn, hands knees bloody. He
dissolved total mindless hysteria.
Almost reflex, NICK keeps shooting. He'd better
manage open eyes. By hammer falling
chamber, NICK continues, obsessively,
pull trigger. He weeps; moans; wails...
THE BAT grabs fistful NICK's shirt,
supernatural ease HOISTS HIM air.
NICK (cont.)
Don't kill me... don't kill me...
When NICK finally opens eyes, realizes THE BAT
standing ledge roof -- HOLDING HIM OUT,
arm's length, stories nothingness.
The gruesome black apparition speaks, rasping whisper:
BATMAN
I won't kill you. I want
favor.
NICK looks down. Far, far below, CARS wink silently past.
He looks up. And sees, mirrored lenses
BATMAN's eyes be, twin reflections
stricken face.
BATMAN (cont.)
Tell friends. Tell
friends.
NICK HOWLS. Almost afterthought, THE BATMAN heaves
roughly roof. And -- casually,
moment's hesitation -- STEPS OFF THE LEDGE OF THE
ROOF, INTO MIDAIR.
Trembling, NICK crawls ledge looks over...
finding ABSOLUTELY NO TRACE Batman.
NICK screaming PAN UP bilious yellow
globe Gotham's moon. MAIN CREDITS ROLL:

And HAND enters frame. Much like GUNMAN's
hand, feminine, beckoning. BRUCE, hearing name,
LOOKS UP; then, agonized, ashamed, BURIES HIS FACE
GORDON's side. GORDON gestures angrily intruder.
But hand keeps beckoning. And ultimately BRUCE turns.
Showing tear-stained face famous photo. A
