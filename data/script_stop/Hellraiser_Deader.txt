She crosses street, passes door --
comes building that's sealed -- doors
windows cemented shut cinder-blocks.
Beyond narrow railing stairway, pressed sideways
building, running basement entrance.
Amy looks stairway it's narrow bottom. The stairs
littered trash. A filthy mattress
lies bottom. Amy heads down.
EXT. THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS - DAY
At stairs, there's wooden door. A hole
punched heavy padlocked chain
threaded heavy hasp that's
bolted door frame. Some official government notice
kind tacked door -- long rendered

Amy inspects padlock. It's heavy uncompromising. She
tugs door opens limits chain --
that's inches. Amy peers darkness

She approaches it, reaches pushes door open. It's

As enters FIGURE hallways,

INT. THE BATHROOM - DAY
This nasty little makeshift places built
available corner -- basically toilet sink close
there's hardly room move. A mop
supplies, long forgotten, propped corner.
Amy steps in, looks toilet. Nothing left
nasty stains -- water long dried up. Her face brushes
hanging air. She pulls back. It's
pull string hanging naked light bulb.
She tugs it. Nothing. No power here.
She stands dark, claustrophobic place, puzzled. She
looks hall. It she's come
dead end. Then stares bathroom door. Open
now, blocks piece bathroom wall -- place
hasn't looked.
Amy steps back, virtually straddling toilet, pushes
door closed. As does, course, little light
is, vanishes completely. If there's
door, can't it, else.
Abruptly, there's sharp click lights lighter,
wavering light illuminates tiny bathroom --
previously unseen space door.
The walls meet there. There narrow gap, leading
passage, apparently "between" walls,
inches wide.
41
Hesitating moment, Amy turns sideways slides
claustrophobic slot. She holds lighter

end passage. She moves forward cautiously --
floor littered dried chunks plaster, rotting
insulation -- seventy-five years stuff crumbled
insides walls.
As disappears tunnel, door slowly opens
her. Passing rusty doorknob, menacing
blade appears.
Inside tunnel, Amy reaches vertical pipe
wall - - inches thick, reduces
available room inches. She hesitates.
Meanwhile, lighter hand getting hot. She lets

She flicks flint. The lighter lights.
And, abruptly, million roaches , returned

skittering way.
Amy lets squeak roaches vanish instant.
AMY

She looks pipe again, starts squeeze past

From inches nine, eight, sides

At end outstretched arm, walls

Clearly, she's reached end line. Annoyed,
starts -- realizes light far

She brings hand holding lighter close body,
can't bring hands --
space narrow. Finally, reaches hand up,

As does, lighter slips. She grabs it,
goes out. Again lost virtual darkness.
She strikes flint. It flickers doesn't light. As
strikes again, IT LIGHTS SOMETHING IN THERE WITH HER! Amy
doesn't it, do...
AND IT HAS A KNIFE IN ITS HANDS.
The light returns -- illuminating
body -- way she's come. But, space
narrow, can't turn head entrance.
Once again, roaches skittering away.
And Amy starts heading "back" entered. Her
head facing away progress backward, trying
squeeze through.
She holds lighter, lights area "ahead"

The walls narrow. The space

AMY
What ...
She continues, barely feet
wall narrow pass. She pushes, trying
shove narrow gap. But move. The walls
literally closed in, squeezed

Gasping, Amy pushes wall she's facing. Trying
desperately turn head around. She forces
turn head, facial features stretching
comically. She finally gets around.
43
She face face knife comes RIPPING
THROUGH FRAME, narrowly missing arm.
Amy screams drops lighter. Now darkness,
scurries frantically away -- deeper space.
Amy starts struggling, panic growing her, trying climb,
crouch, tug free direction, movement
limited. The walls close her.
She struggling breathe pressing walls. The
figure keeps advancing her.
AMY
Stop! Please stop! Stop this!
She's flailing arms now, frantic. The knife-wielding
figure struggles, having difficulty well. One Amy's
hands flies hits wall her.
Now panics, hands desperately scraping

She looks attacker, who's right
raising knife final blow.
Amy braces blade's impact pushes

Falls backward floor. Her heart pounding. Her
