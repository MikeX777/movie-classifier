Whether larger world round flat, spinning
orbiting, Hector knows cares. He knows
simple things. Cold hunger. He knows warmth, rough
comfort companionship. His family safety

Further shore Hector drops bag straigh-
tens himself, easing ache back. Then some-
thing disturbs him. From distant headland
smudge smoke trails sky. Hector picks
bag runs. He knows going. He reaches
vantage point rocks. He steadies
gazes hard sea. We feel strain

glinting water. Then jaw drops fear. Around
edge headland dark shapes proceed regular
motion. Their steady progress menace. Oar-

barity, rape abuse. That intention
Raiders. To them, fertile woman healthy
children gold plunderers later ages.
For part, family accept situation.
Food shelter best life offer.
Painfully, Hector takes reality scene. His

painful. He retreats dark-
ness hills again.
14 EXT. ROCK SHELTER - NIGHT 14
Hector spends long, cold night alone, squatting

Hector's missiles aside, like flies smiling.
Suddenly Hector's rage energy leave him. He stands
