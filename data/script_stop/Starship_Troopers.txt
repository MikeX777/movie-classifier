RASCZAK (O.S.)
The end school year,
doubt failure...
Rico, pay attention !
The teacher JEAN RASCZAK, 38, rugged veteran proudly
displays missing hand, scowls Johnny, bemused.
JOHNNY
Sorry, Mr. Rasczak.
But soon Rasczak turns class, Johnny begins sketch
cartoon desk's touch screen.
RASCZAK
Here History Moral Philosophy
we've explored decline
Democracy social scientists brought
world brink chaos,
veterans took control imposed stability
lasted generations since...
You know facts I taught
value ? You.
Why citizens allowed vote ?
Rasczak points LANNY, 17, stump
.
LANNY
It's reward... Federation gives
Federal Service.
Rasczak crestfallen, makes big patience.
RASCZAK
No. Something given value !
Haven't I taught dimwits ?
I guess ought revoke
teaching credential...
Laughter. Johnny's cartoon, meanwhile, taking shape:
Johnny Carmen flying round planet Venus space ship.
RASCZAK
When vote, you're exercising political
authority. You're force. And force,
friends, violence, supreme authority
authority derives.
CARL JENKINS, 18, superintelligent geek, jumps in.
CARL
Gee, thought
supreme authority, Mr. Rasczak.
Laughter. Rasczak grins.
RASCZAK

exerted billion, political
authority violence degree. The
people citizens earned
right wield it.

solves anything.
