First Draft Screenplay
--------------------------------------------------------------
INT. BOULEY RESTAURANT, NEW YORK - NIGHT
Dim lighting, crowd buzz, long line rich, celebrated,
congenitally impatient. Everyone queue holds
reservation hour overdue. Tourists can't
line. PAN ahead to...
... burnished dining room, tables power, elegant
service. Covertly, eyes drawn table receiving
far lavish service all. Captains hover, presenting
delicacies, pouring wines, murmuring obsequiously guest
person screen view. We see, however...
... honored guest's companion. Ignored, bemused,
table. This DIGGER DOWNES, 36, darkly attractive. Kind eyes,
intellectual's mouth, Saville Row's unobtrusive
conservative chalk-stripe suit. He gay, wouldn't guess
it. Loyal wise generous, might. He watches
quiet twinkle, Captains step back, revealing us...
... unlikely icon. JULIANNE POTTER, 28, wears
favorite bulky sweater bunch stuff pulled
seconds. She unkempt, quick, volatile,
scattered, beneath all, all,
original beauty. Dark liquid eyes, cynical mouth, slender
expressive fingers, point to...
CAPTAIN
A variation squid ink
risotto. Trace Moselle,
sweeten stock.
She doesn't like idea all. Shoots sharp look
doubt makes smile. Murmur...
CAPTAIN
Don't kill one, it's
long shot.
Places moist lump black rice her. She takes
surprisingly small amount, rolls tongue. Makes dead
flat eye contact Digger. And nods, it's actually nice.
The Captain breathes relief. She turns dark eyes him.
The tone says they're pals...
JULIANNE
I'm writing inventive
confident. Which is. Off
record, I'll need extra boat
ink. Or salt shaker.
CAPTAIN
I'll toss coin.
As Captain splits, Digger looks tables,
makes pairs eyes awkwardly glace away.
DIGGER
Is embarrassing, having
bum kissed public?
JULIANNE
If ass isn't chapped,
good-writer note.
She glances remaining waiters, shamelessly fawn
nearby.
JULIANNE

The waiter hanging now. Openly listening.
JULIANNE

Digger sees guy listening, gestures eyes. So

JULIANNE

The kid stunned, speechless. People lose jobs lot less.
JULIANNE

He reddens disappears.
DIGGER
I've lost interest.
JULIANNE
He takes razor dinky
little dopp kit, cuts fingertip,
takes hand, me...
She places tips index fingers together.
DIGGER
Blood oath.
JULIANNE
He says, "Swear. When we're
28, we've married...

And laughs again. Can believe that? But Digger isn't smiling.
She wonders why. Begins spoon black squid ink risotto.
JULIANNE

INT. WALLACE ENTERPRISES - DAY
Julianne crisp chalk-stripe trousers buttoned-up dress

INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - DAY
Julianne enters spacious corner office, high city.
Closes door, quietly, her. So anxious,

cherrywood desk. Its monitor standing silent. She
stalking it, like deadly animal. And then. She there.
Talking herself, desperate support network...
JULIANNE
(softly)
You this.
Sacred, filled doubt conflict. Her hands clutch
other. Then, flicks out. And goes ON. The
screen GLOWS. Waits her. Her mouth sand, stomach
water. She pulls paper pocket...
... looks it. Looks monitor. And begins. To type...
JULIANNE
(mumbling herself)
E-mail address. To Ben Isaacson,
Senior Editor, Sports Illustrated,
from... Walter Wallace.
And stops. Her heart thumping.
JULIANNE
See, it. It's easy.

MICHAEL
Please?
She nods, stumbles room, closing door her.
Now she's corridor, clutching big jumbled bag,
sinking sit carpet, door.
She doesn't look elated. She frightened, distraught,
all, confused. Because can't understand why. She digs
absently bag. Cigarettes. Box matches.
She lights up. Draws deeply. Somehow, near tears,
laughs bitterly that. Shakes head fucked-up finds
herself. Squeaking wheels approach, lost hear them.
BELLMAN
Miss, locked out,

She looks up. A small, wiry man nearly 60, slightly faded
neatly-kept uniform. On cart, ton bags.
JULIANNE
No, I stepped out, because...
it's non-smoking room.
And inhales deeply. Leans door, look
comfortably.
BELLMAN
(politely)
Well, it's non-smoking floor,

She squints nameplate.
JULIANNE
Do smoke, Richard?
BELLMAN
Yes, ma'am, I do, it's...
JULIANNE
... non-smoking floor, yeah.
Well, know what?
And takes cigarette lips. Turns around, holds

... reaches down, takes cigarette hand. Staring
eyes, takes deep drag. Savors expert nostril-inhale
exhaled smoke. Hands cigarette her...
BELLMAN
My grandmother said,
"This, too, shall pass."
She swallows. Wipes eyes. Finds smile.
JULIANNE
Thanks, Richard. If weren't
duty, I'd buy drink.
He nods. She waves. He waves back, pushes cart
hall. As watches go, door suddenly OPENS,
she...
... FALLS it, flat Michael's feet. Staring
him, seeing looks bad feels, takes raw, deep
drag.
JULIANNE
What happened?
MICHAEL
(softly)
It's over.
And crouches down. Close her. The cigarette drops
hand, unnoticed carpet. So lifts it, crushes
heel shoe.
MICHAEL
I want quit shit,

She nods, obediently. Okay, I will.
MICHAEL
She denied it. Said I crazy

JULIANNE
A bad combination.
He tries smile. It's hard.
MICHAEL
There's big brunch tomorrow

Looks deep eyes. He's glad she's there.
MICHAEL
Hey. You got ring?
She holds left hand, flapping sleeve falls away. The
ring finger swollen raw.
JULIANNE
I tried on. But won't
come off.
He smiles that. A sad smile friendship. Then takes
finger gently...
... mouth. It like kiss. And
removes moistened finger...
... pulls ring OFF. Nothing it. She blinks.
JULIANNE
It's mental, know.
He doesn't understand that.
JULIANNE

She nods, sure. He kisses cheek. Stands up.
