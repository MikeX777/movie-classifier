A substitute teacher Long Island
dropped job fighting
student. A weeks later, teacher
returned classroom, shot student
unsuccessfully, held class hostage
shot himself. Successfully. This fact caught
eye: sentence. Times. A neighbor
described teacher nice boy. Always
reading Catcher In Rye.
The nitwit - Chapman - shot John Lennon said
wanted to-`draw
attention world Catcher In Rye
reading book defense.
And young Hinckley, whiz kid shot Reagan
press secretary said want
defense read catcher
Rye. It time read again.
FLAN
I haven't read years.
OUISA shushes FLAN.
PAUL
I borrowed copy young friend
I wanted underlined
I read book
touching, beautiful, sensitive story published
July 1951 turned manifesto
hate.
I started reading. : It's exactly I
remembered. Everybody's phoney. Page two: "My
brother's Hollywood prostitute."
Page three: "what phony slob father was."
Page nine: "People notice anything."
Then page hair stood up.
Remember Holden Caulfield--the definitive
sensitive youth--wearing red hunter's cap.
"A deer Hunter hat? Like hell is. I sort
closed eye like I taking aim it.
This people shooting hat. I shoot people
hat."
40
PAUL (CONTINUES)
Hmmm, I said. This book preparing people
bigger moments lives I
dreamed of.
Then p. 89 "I'd push guy
window chop head ax sock
jaw. I hate fist fights...what
scares guy's face..."
I finished book. It's touching story,
comic boy wants
can't anything. Hates phoniness
lies others. Wants like him,
hateful, completely self involved.
In words, pretty accurate picture
male adolescent.
FLAN, OUISA, .GEOFFREY transfixed.
And alarms book--not book
aura it--is this: book
primarily paralysis. The boy can't
function. And end run
away start new life, starts rain
folds. Now there's wrong writing
emotional intellectual paralysis. It
thanks Chekhov Samuel Beckett
great modern theme.
The extraordinary lines Waiting For
Godot--"Let's go." "Yes, let's go." Stage
directions: They move.
But aura book Salinger's--
read ut
young men---is this: It mirrors like fun
house mirror amplifies like distorted
speaker great tragedies times-
--the death imagination.
Because paralysis?
The CAMERA moves closer closer PAUL.
42
PAUL (CONTINUES)
The imagination debased
imagination--being imaginative--
lynch pin existence stands
synonym outside
like Science fiction new use
tangerine slices raw pork chops---what
imaginative summer recipe--and Star wars! So
imaginative Star Trek--so imaginative! And
Lord Rings--all dwarves--so
IMAGINATIVE---
The imagination moved realm
link, personal link,
inner lives world outside world--
world share--what schizophrenia
horrifying state what's doesn't
match what's there?
Why imagination synonym style?
I believe imagination passport
create real world.
I believe imagination phrase
uniquely Is.
Jung says greatest sin unconscious.
Our boy Holden says "what scares
guy's face--it wouldn't bad
blindfolded"--most time
faces face guys'
faces. And it's worst kind
yellowness scared
blindfolds deal yourself.
To face ourselves.
That's hard thing.
The imagination.
That's God's gift act self-
examination bearable.
