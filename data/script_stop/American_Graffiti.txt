RADIO
On dark screen immense amber light appears
electric humming begins. The eerie light glows brighter
illuminates single huge number--11. We hear static
large vertical band red floats mysteriously
screen.
Pulling slowly, watch glowing band traverse
forth amber light past numbers appearing--
70... 90... 110... 130. And begin hear voices--strange
songs, fading conversations snatches music drifting
static.
Pulling further, realize car radio filling
screen radio stations we're hearing,
indicator stops. There's pause...and suddenly hit
blasting-out-of-the-past, Rocking Rolling, turn-up-
the-volume, pounding Intro Vintage 1962 Golden Week-End

growling music pumps grinds...
WOLFMAN

The Wolfman howls like soulful banshee "Rock Around
Clock" blasts forth.
