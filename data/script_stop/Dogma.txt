The Troubadors 'love' fashionable. And influence altered
balance significant fashion. Until them, people got married
to. After them, people started 'falling love'. Romantic
courtships norm. What started simple entertainment
dramatic impact forever alter way society operates.
LOKI
That's human beings - easily misled. From Garden Eden

Rufus bites sandwhich. Bethany, Jay Silent Bob look

JAY
Bullshit. I've seen pictures Jesus, He blonde hair blue

That's what's particularly insulting. Between time He established
faith church started officially organize, powers-that-be
decided message Christ integral, fact He
black detriment. So renderings ordered Eurocentric,
brother blacker Jesse.
BETHANY
If that's true, why'd He written left out?

I don't buy it.

That's good people Antioch saying stoned ass.
BETHANY
You martyred?

spread His word. Antioch garnering big Christian
following, I got sent there. And big hit. They loved hearing
Jesus' message, He Redeemer. But I mentioned He
black, town turned - called liar shit. I pressed
point, I know it, I'm wearing stones -
accessonze.
BETH ANY
Why didn't let point saw reacting?

BETHANY
What mean - expulsion? I thought came

SERENDIPITY

month, ethereal time. They bring back, days
peace quiet - free black nationalist rhetoric.
RUFUS
(joking)
Artsy-fartsy bitch.
SERENDIPITY
Who calling artsy-fartsy?
RUFUS
(to Bethany)
Serendipity hang Jerusalem.
BETHANY
Let guess - fourteenth apostle; left bible she's
woman.
RUFUS
The girl's woman.
(to Serendipity)
No offense.
BETHANY
Oh, weren't tits I saw Jay cozying to?
SERENDIPITY
(tugs boobs)
What, these? You know better table tits
don't woman.
RUFUS
Hell, tubby, coat-wearing mother fucker's got tits - don't
woman.
SERENDIPITY
Aside intuitive knack accessorizing, traditionally defines
woman falls things : legs. But see...
Serendipity stands unbuttons jeans, dropping slightly,
revealing smooth, sexless crotch, like Metatron's.
SERENDIPITY
I lack definition.
OC JAY
Hey! They're getting free show!
Serendipity pulls pants sits down, smiling OC party.
BETHANY
(weary)
Oh God. Another angel. Like Metatron.
SERENDIPITY
How know Metatron?
(to Rufus)
How know Metatron?
RUFUS
This Scion.
SERENDIPITY
(beat)
You're kidding.
RUFUS
Don't resemblance?
SERENDIPITY
(stares Bethany)
A bit.
(suddenly nervous)
Oh shit. If she's tapped, something's up.
BETHANY
I'm confused.
RUFUS
Bethany, Serendipity isn't technically angel,
means human like I are.
SERENDIPITY
Amen that.
(swigs beer spits out)
BETHANY
Then she?
SERENDIPITY
Not - what. I haven't anthropomorphic club. I
abstract.
BETHANY
Now I'm lost.
RUFUS
Serendipity's idea.
SERENDIPITY
Try ideas.
BETHANY
Meaning?
SERENDIPITY
I'm muse, stupid.
Bethany stares beat, Rufus. Rufus nods affirmatively.
BETHANY
I can't this.
(downs beer)
RUFUS
(to Serendipity)
She's met seraphim, dead man, muse.
You appreciate frame mind.
BETHANY
(to Serendipity)
So - - inspire people?
SERENDIPITY
What went friends there-you don't think
thought themselves? I knew Kane's weak spot Fat Albert
passed boys.
RUFUS
If hadn't interceded, they'd chalk lines right now.
BETHANY
You sing song?
SERENDIPITY
I offered solution hole dug themselves.
Thankfully, took it.
BETHANY
Are kidding? Those dense, wouldn't good idea
given specially marked box.
SERENDIPITY
Dense people open suggestion - it's vou so-called
intelligent folks hard time accepting good idea.
RUFUS
Ain't truth.
BETHANY
Prove it. Give good idea.
SERENDIPITY
If I do, accept it, you'll confirmation -
- dense.
BETHANY
(beat)
Alright. So you're muse. So kind people inspire -
stupid ones?
SERENDIPITY
I specialize entertainment - literature, theatre, forth.
BETHANY
Movies?
SERENDIPITY
In cases, I'd bang starlets casting couch.
BETHANY
What I seen you've involved with?
SERENDIPITY
Off head - everything. Well everything. For example:
I'm responsible grossing films time.
BETHANY
Nine?
SERENDIPITY
The kid, house; burglars trying
fights off?
(Bethany nods)
I one. Somebody sold soul Satan
grosses piece shit.
RUFUS
Which brings logical question -
stripping?
SERENDIPITY
Well remember I left, right?
RUFUS
You tired work getting credit
ideas.
SERENDIPITY
And sick watching incapable people brilliant inspiration turn
real trash.
(to Bethany)
So I opted quit muse write myself. I gave weeks
notice. got body, bucks, got sent world
fortune.
BETHANY
So happened?
SERENDIPITY
Writer's block.
RUFUS
Writer's block?
SERENDIPITY
Can believe it? Me - muse, God's sake! I sit
typewriter, I get? Nothing. Blank page. 1 can't write
grocery list.
BETHANY
What Jay Silent Bob? You inspired them.
SERENDIPITY
That's cosmic joke. I zillion ideas second,
I can't myself. Her quirky sense humor.
BETHANY
Whose?
SERENDIPITY
God's.
BETHANY
You're saying God's woman.
SERENDIPITY
Was doubt mind?
BETHANY
The possibility presented itself. He's referred Him.
SERENDIPITY
I didn't write way My job stops idea stage. The person
holds pen adds perspective, pen-holders men.
One drawbacks intangible
editorial process.
RUFUS
Another one's can't jerk off.
SERENDIPITY
(to Bethany)
See. male-dominated times, Pharisees High Priests felt
threatened idea woman lording controlling
fates. sure She He Doesn't stop God -
book slanted gender-biased: woman's responsible
sin, fall man, expulsion Eden. woman cuts
Sampson's coif power, woman asks head John Baptist.
Read book time - women painted bigger antagonists
fucking Egyptians Romans combined.
BETHANY
(stunned)
God woman...
SERENDIPITY
I don't know big surprise - women gender
create life, like God created universe. Who mother
infinite patience impudent children God
humanity. A woman birth nurture sexes,
psychologists theorize women gender sexes feel
completely comfortable with; faithful - male female - feel
ease God. In time trial, instinct implore
aid Almighty, you're child, person
better is...
BETHANY
...mom. God, makes sense.
RUFUS
(to Serendipity)
Shit, knack words.
SERENDIPITY
Not useful new line work.
RUFUS
What that? Why'd choose stripping?
SERENDIPITY
In effort create artistic I claim own.
See, I've able fool thinking isn't stripping, it's
dancing; dancing artistic. But She won't
- way God designed dance, it's creative act results
tangible product. Unlike paintings, poems, movies arts
forms. dance over, there's -
save enjoy... sell.
(takes drink)
Believe me, irony wasn't lost muse.
RUFUS
How long going up?
SERENDIPITY
Believe me, I think eating crow going grind time
time. But I'd hate Her satisfaction playing
prodigal. And sucks I can't stand flesh anymore -
especially halfway crap. Not I care
aesthetic - showers, haircutting, pit-shaving - I can't
advantage benefits - like getting laid period
excuse laid...
(conspiratorily Bethany)
...the true boon having period, I understand.
RLFLS
Well sure use help. We need good ideas. You
remember couple angels named Loki Bartleby?
SERENDIPITY
Sure - angel death squeamish pal conscience.
RUFUS
They way back.
SERENDIPITY
(shocked)
God no. Not plenary indulgence loop hole?
BETHANY
You know that?
SERENDIPITY
I knew thing bad idea. Leave Catholics
destroy existence.
RUFUS
Bethany's Catholic.
SERENDIPITY
My condolences.
BETHANY
What Catholics?
SERENDIPITY
Ever Catholic mass?
BETHANY
Once twice.
SERENDIPITY
It's like bad sex - up, down, up, down, kneel, leave.
And time you'd watching t.v.
You people don't celebrate faith - mourn it.
BETHANY
So we're wrong, what's right religion?
SERENDIPITY
When people going learn? It's right wrong - it's
question faith. It doesn't matter believe -
believe.
Jay Silent Bob join them, wearing bandannas.
JAY

Looks like it's taking memory training courses...
SERENDIPITY
(off trickle)
JUMP!!!
The leap perch steps, doors explode,
dumping torrent crap steps. The body muck morphs NoMan

Silent Bob stares wide-eyed approaching demon. And then,
occurs him. He stops backing stands. The

In beginning, Him. Angels God. And He

acknowledge Him. All time we've here, everyday I felt
absence Divine presence. And pained me... I'm sure
pained sometimes, you'd gloss jokes. But
feel absence, why? Because way He -as servants.
Had given free will, ignore pain... like them.

You know - maybe nap something.
BARTLEBY
Loki, don't it? It's humans - it's humans. They
given paradise; threw away. They given planet;
