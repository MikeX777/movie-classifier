MARCUS sits piece rubble skeleton. He tears
open packet puts dried-out, stale cigarette
lips, tries lighter times, finally gets flame.
He lights cig, inhales deeply-- waits rush,
feels nothing. He takes drags, increasingly

He rises, looks caved-in STOREFRONT, makes
clothing store's TATTERED SIGN ground, amidst broken
glass: "SALE! GOING OUT OF BUSINESS! EVERYTHING MUST GO!"

The FIGURES pause, turning unison.

He freezes tracks. These aren't humans. They're T-
400s-- PLASTIC-SKINNED TERMINATORS-- armed PLASMA
RIFLES. They wear motley collection CLOTHING,
male humanoid faces identical, unnatural
motionless, like masks. Their EYES FLICKER RED scan

JEREMY
Yes. We're lucky. Want some?
He holds plastic bag Marcus, obligingly takes

MARCUS
Your family. You lost them?
Jeremy nods SMILES, looking more.
MARCUS (cont'd)
