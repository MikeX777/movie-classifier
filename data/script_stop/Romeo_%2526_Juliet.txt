As Jesus' face fills screen, droplets water begin
streak cheeks.
HOLD: Music swells; droplets grow torrent,
heavy rain begins fall.
For long beat, stay image.
CRANE DOWN: From Jesus. A sea black umbrellas
stretches steps Freedom Tower.
EXT. FREEDOM TOWER. DAY.
At steps pair flower strewn caskets.
Before caskets stand Fulgencia Gloria Capulet,
Ted Caroline Montague. They stare blank,
uncomprehending sorrow.
Among crowd distraught faces Benvolio,
Balthasar, Father Laurence Nurse.
The caskets gently slid pair long black cars.
Montague Capulet descend stairs. Captain Prince
blocks path. He holds gaze.
CAPTAIN PRINCE
See scourge laid
hate,
That heaven finds means kill
joys love;
And I, winking discords
too,
Have lost brace kinsmen. All
punished.
The Prince steps aside. The procession moves off. Montague
Capulet look another, moment,
adversaries follow bodies dead children.
AERIAL SHOT: The rain falls. Two black cars lead people
Verona Beach sorrowful parade.
As cars pass beneath towering effigy Jesus,
image pixilates television picture.
PULL OUT: A TV anchor woman watches image studio
monitor.
She turns:
ANCHOR WOMAN
(to camera)
A glooming peace morning
brings:
The sun sorrow
head.
Go hence, talk
sad things.
Some shall pardoned,
punished,
For story woe
Than Juliet Romeo.
The anchor woman changes beat story;
dialogue fades, image gets smaller television
recedes black distance.
The music reminds lost lives
swells. When television small switched off.
BLACK SCREEN. HOLD A BEAT.
THE END
