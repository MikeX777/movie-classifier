BLOOM
I'm hysterical. I'm having

BIALYSTOCK RUSHES TO THE DESK. PICKS UP A CARAFE OF WATER
AND SHOSHES ITS CONTENTS INTO BLOOM'S FACE.
BLOOM
I'm wet! I'm wet! I'm hysterical
I'm wet!
BIALYSTOCK IN A DESPERATE MOVE TO STOP BLOOM'S HYSTERICS,
SLAPS HIM ACROSS THE FACE.
BLOOM
(holding face)
I'm pain! And I'm wet! And I'm
hysterical!
BIALYSTOCK RAISES HIS HAND AGAIN.
BLOOM
No! No! Don't hit. It doesn't
help. It increases sense
danger.
BIALYSTOCK
What I do? What I do?
You're getting hysterical.
BLOOM
Go away me. You frighten me.

Nonsense, nonsense, dear boy. I

BLOOM LOOKS AT HIM SUSPICIOUSLY.
BIALYSTOCK
And I promise faithfully, I
won't discuss silly scheme
million dollars anymore.
BIALYSTOCK DONS HIS CAPE AND "BELASCO" HAT. FROM A RACK HE
SELECTS A GOLD-TOPPED WALKING STICK. HE GOES TO DOOR, OPENS
IT, AND WITH A GRAND FLOURISH, MOTIONS BLOOM TO PRECEDE HIM.
BIALYSTOCK

IN A RAGE BIALYSTOCK FLINGS THE MANUSCRIPT ONTO THE PILE OF
DISCARDS AS HE BELLOWS:
BIALYSTOCK
It's good!!!
CAMERA MOVES UP AND WE DISSOLVE THROUGH TO MEDIUM SHOT OF

BADLY IN NEED OF A SHAVE.
BLOOM

BIALYSTOCK
A flop, ha! That's putting

THEY ARE SEATED IN A CORNER BOOTH OF A LITTLE VIENNESE CAFE.
LITTLE OLD LADY #3
Here's success new
play.
BIALYSTOCK RAISES HIS GLASS.
BIALYSTOCK
Our play, love.
HE GALLANTLY INTERTWINES HIS ARMS IN HERS IN A LOVER'S TOAST.
IT IS HARD TO DRINK WITH ARMS ENTWINED, ESPECIALLY IF ONE OF
THE ARMS IS ATTACHED TO A LITTLE OLD LADY. THE TOAST IS A
FIASCO, BIALYSTOCK GETTING MOST OF THE CHAMPAGNE OVER HIS
VEST AND TROUSERS.
LITTLE OLD LADY #3
Oh, I'm sorry, Bialy, I wet you?
BIALYSTOCK
Think it, dear. A
mere trifle. A mere trifle. Did

45.
LITTLE OLD LADY #3
It's right purse I
told --
cash. That's funny
play.
BIALYSTOCK
Think it.
SHE SNAPS OPEN HER LITTLE BEADED PURSE, TAKES OUT THE CHECK
AND BEGINS TO HAND IT TO BIALYSTOCK. AT THIS MOMENT, WE ARE
ASSAULTED BY THE PASSIONATE SOUND OF A CRYING VIOLIN.
CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL A VIOLINIST IN GYPSY ATTIRE
CLOSING IN ON THE TABLE. THE LITTLE OLD LADY IS DELIGHTED
BY THE VIOLINIST AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR BIALYSTOCK STOPS THE
PASSAGE OF THE CHECK AS HER ATTENTION IS DIVERTED.
BIALYSTOCK CAUTIOUSLY REACHES OUT TO SNATCH THE CHECK BUT
EACH TIME THAT HE DOES, A TURN IN THE MUSIC MAKES THE LITTLE
OLD LADY CLUTCH HER HEART. BIALYSTOCK IS VERY UNHAPPY. HE
QUIETLY BRINGS HIS FOOT FROM BENEATH THE TABLE AND PLACES IT
DIRECTLY OVER THE FOOT OF THE VIOLINIST.
CUT TO CLOSE-UP OF BIALYSTOCK'S FOOT POISED OVER VIOLINIST'S
FOOT. BIALYSTOCK PROCEEDS TO CRUSH VIOLINIST'S FOOT.

BY GRIEF, HE LIMPS TO ANOTHER TABLE. BIALYSTOCK QUICKLY
REACHES OUT AND SNATCHES THE CHECK.

Go, Bialy, baby, go!
SWISH PAN CUT TO POSH PARK AVENUE APARTMENT. NIGHT. A
PRIVATE CONCERN IS IN PROGRESS. A THIN, CONSUMPTIVE-LOOKING
YOUNG MAN FINGERS HIS WAY THROUGH A CHOPIN NOCTURNE.
CAMERA SLOWLY PANS THE ROOM. SEATED IN A SEMI-CIRCLE AROUND
THE PIANO ON VARIOUS PIECES OF DELICATE EMPIRE FURNITURE IS
AN AUSTERE GROUP OF ELDERLY DIGNIFIED PATRONS OF THE ARTS.
SUDDENLY AN OLD LADY'S SHRIEK RENDS THE AIR. EVERYONE'S
HEAD TURNS.
LITTLE OLD LADY #6
(slightly flustered)
Go concert! Go

DESCENDING TWIN STAIRCASES, WE SEE TWO LINES OF BEAUTIFUL

CURTAIN FALLS. THE NUMBER IS RECEIVED BY THE AUDIENCE WITH
HUSHED SILENCE. FOLLOWED BY A SURGE TOWARD THE DOORS. THE
AISLES ARE CHOKED WITH UNHAPPY PEOPLE, WHO CAN'T WAIT TO GET
OUT.
CURTAIN RISES. ON STAGE ARE EVA BRAUN AND HITLER (LSD).
EVA BRAUN IS A FETCHING BLONDE IN LONG BRAIDS. LSD IS
PACING UP AND DOWN. EVA BRAUN SITS ON LOVE SEAT DOWNSTAGE.
IN HER HAND IS AN OVERSIZED DAISY. AS SHE PULLS THE PETALS
FROM IT, SHE WHINES. SHE HAS A PRONOUNCED AMERICAN ACCENT.
EVA

Hey, Harry, he's funny.
NOW THERE IS A MAD RUSH TO REGAIN THEIR SEATS.
CUT TO INTERIOR BAR. IT IS EMPTY EXCEPT FOR THE BARTENDER
AND A DRUNK AT THE FAR END OF THE BAR. BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM
ARE SEATED ON STOOLS AT THE BAR. THEY CLINK GLASSES.
BIALYSTOCK
Here's

THEY BOTH LAUGH AND DOWN THEIR DRINKS. BIALYSTOCK RAPS ON
THE BAR WITH HIS CANE.
BIALYSTOCK
Innkeeper, innkeeper, round
drinks here. As matter
fact, round drinks

BARTENDER LOOKS AROUND AT THE ALMOST EMPTY BARROOM. DOES A
LITTLE TAKE. HE THEN REPLENISHES THEIR DRINKS AND PLACES A
GLASS IN FRONT OF THE DRUNK. THE DRUNK TIPS HIS HAT
GRACIOUSLY TOWARDS BIALYSTOCK.
BLOOM

PINCHES HIS FACE AS HE SEMI-COHERENTLY MUMBLES TO HIMSELF.
LIEBKIND

WOMAN IN ADJOINING SEAT

LIEBKIND

BIALYSTOCK
Bartender, bartender, drink
associate, Mr.
Bloom. And don't forget good-
natured inebriate there.
DRUNK TIPS HIS HAT GRACIOUSLY.
DRUNK

DURING DRUNK'S SPEECH, BARTENDER HAS REFILLED THEIR GLASSES.
HE STANDS BACK, WATCHING THEM AS HE DRIES GLASSES.

74.
BIALYSTOCK STOPS ABRUPTLY. HE POINTS TOWARD THE DOOR. WE
HEAR THE SOUND OF PEOPLE ENTERING THE BAR.
BIALYSTOCK
Intermission! Quick, hide
face. They'll tear pieces.
BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM HOP ON THEIR STOOLS AND COVER THEIR
FACES WITH THEIR HANDS. THE DRUNK SHRUGS, HOPS ON THE STOOL
NEXT TO THEM AND ALSO HIDES HIS FACE. A HORDE OF FIRST
NIGHTERS SWEEPS INTO THE BAR. THEY ARE ALL AROUND
BIALYSTOCK, BLOOM AND THE DRUNK, CLAMORING FOR DRINKS.
CROWD
(ad-lib)
"Scotch rocks,"
"Bourbon soda."
"Two martinis."
"Whiskey sour."
THE CROWD IS VERY CHEERFUL. THEY ARE STILL BUBBLING FROM
THE FIRST ACT.
WOMAN
(to escort)
Well, far that's
funniest thing I've seen
Broadway.
BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM LOOK AT EACH OTHER.
WOMAN'S ESCORT

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM FREEZE. A LITTLE OLD LADY COMES UP
BEHIND BIALYSTOCK. SHE RAPS HIM ON THE BACK WITH HER
UMBRELLA.
LITTLE OLD LADY #8
Bialy, sly fox, you've it.

Smasheroo. Smasheroo.
THE CROWD STARTS TO LEAVE.
LITTLE OLD LADY

THE FIRST NIGHTERS LEAVE THE BAR. ALL THAT REMAIN ARE
BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM, THE BARTENDER AND THE DRUNK.
BIALYSTOCK SLIPS OFF THE STOOL AND WANDERS TO MIDDLE OF
BARROOM.
BIALYSTOCK
(dazed)
Got think... Got think... Got
think... Got think... Got

CUT TO BLOOM AT THE BAR, FROZEN, STARING STRAIGHT AHEAD.
HIS EYES ARE GLAZED WITH SHOCK. HE STROKES HIS CHEEK WITH
HIS LITTLE BLUE BLANKET.
BLOOM
Mrs. Cathcart -- 50%
Mrs. Biddlecombe -- 50%
Mrs. Wentworth -- 50%
Mrs. Resnick -- 100%
THE DRUNK STARES FROM ONE TO THE OTHER. UNHAPPY WITH THEIR
PRESENT MOOD, HE DECIDES TO LIVEN THINGS UP AGAIN. HE
TIPTOES OVER TO BIALYSTOCK, PUTS HIS ARMS AROUND BIALYSTOCK'S
WAIST, ROCKS BACK AND FORTH AND BEGINS TO SING.
DRUNK
(singing)
"By light...
By light, light...
Of silvery...
BIALYSTOCK PICKS HIM UP AND THROWS HIM ACROSS THE BAR.
BIALYSTOCK
Get away me, drunken bum!
76.
DRUNK PICKS HIMSELF UP AND DUSTS HIMSELF OFF.
DRUNK
(indignantly)
Fairweather friend!
THE DRUNK STAGGERS OUT OF THE BAR. BIALYSTOCK GETS A HOLD
OF HIMSELF.
BIALYSTOCK
Maybe it's true!
BIALYSTOCK RUSHES OVER TO BLOOM.
BLOOM
(still mumbling himself)
No way out. No way out.
BIALYSTOCK
Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's true.
BLOOM DOES NOT RESPOND. BIALYSTOCK SHAKES HIM.

No way out. No way out. What? Who?
BIALYSTOCK

Let's hear majority.
THEY START TO LEAVE.
DISSOLVE TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTERING LOBBY OF THEATRE.
AS THEY OPEN DOOR TO THEATRE, THEY ARE GREETED BY A SHOCK
WAVE OF LAUGHTER. THEY PAUSE STRICKEN.
BLOOM
I don't want in.
BIALYSTOCK
Come, to.
THEY TAKE EACH OTHER'S HANDS LIKE TWO FRIGHTENED LITTLE BOYS
AND CAUTIOUSLY WALK IN.
77.
CUT TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM AS THEY ENTER. THEY TAKE THEIR
POSITIONS AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE AND WATCH THE PROCEEDINGS
MEEKLY, LIKE TWO LAMBS AWAITING THE SLAUGHTER.
CUT TO STAGE. HITLER HAS OBVIOUSLY CALLED A COUNCIL OF WAR.
THE FUHRER IS SURROUNDED BY HIS GENERAL STAFF.
GENERAL
(making report)
We falling fronts.
Our soldiers retreating.
LSD
No good, baby, good. You heard
orders. Nobody retreats.
Attack! Attack!
GENERAL
Who attack? They're

LSD
(getting inspiration)
Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!
GENERAL
We can't... money there!
CUT BACK TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM. THEY STARE STRAIGHT
AHEAD, STONY-FACED. HUGE TEARS WELL UP IN THEIR EYES AND
RUN DOWN THEIR CHEEKS.
CUT TO LIEBKIND. HE HAS RIPPED OFF THE ARM OF HIS CHAIR AND
IS EARNESTLY GNAWING AT IT.
LIEBKIND
Baby, baby. There

LIEBKIND LEAPS FROM HIS SEAT AND HEADS TOWARD THE SIDE
ENTRANCE LEADING TO THE STAGE.
CUT BACK TO STAGE.

THEY SMACK HANDS.
LAUGH FROM AUDIENCE.
CUT TO BACKSTAGE. LIEBKIND COMES CHARGING IN LIKE A LUNATIC.
LIEBKIND
Bring curtain! Bring
curtain!
HE RUSHES FOR THE CURTAIN ROPE. A STAGEHAND ATTEMPTS TO
STOP HIM. HE RIPS OFF HIS HELMET AND BANGS HIM OVER THE
HEAD WITH IT. AS HE SLUMPS TO THE GROUND, LIEBKIND UNDOES
THE CURTAIN ROPE.
CUT TO ACTORS ON STAGE.
LSD
Goebbels, you're one...
THE CURTAIN DROPS WITH A THUD. FROM BENEATH IT CRAWLS
LIEBKIND. HE JUMPS UP AND ADDRESSES THE AUDIENCE.
LIEBKIND
I author play. You

words. The Fuhrer
said baby. The Fuhrer sweet,
Fuhrer kind, Fuhrer

79.
STAGE MANAGER
(off camera)
Get curtain up.
CURTAIN STARTS TO RISE. LIEBKIND HURLS HIMSELF IT, AND
HOLDS IT DOWN.
LIEBKIND
NO! No! The curtain up!
DESPITE HIS EFFORTS, THE CURTAIN SLOWLY RISES. LIEBKIND
DOES NOT RELEASE HIS HOLD ON IT. HE STARTS TO GO UP.
LIEBKIND
Stop! Stop!
AS THE CURTAIN RISES, WE SEE A BEWILDERED GROUP OF ACTORS
AND STAGE HANDS WATCHING LIEBKIND'S ASCENT. THE AUDIENCE,
THINKING LIEBKIND'S BEHAVIOR PART OF THE SHOW, ENJOYS THE
PROCEEDINGS TREMENDOUSLY. THEY BREAK INTO APPLAUSE.
CUT TO CRITIC. HE IS LAUGHING UPROARIOUSLY AND TEARING UP
HIS NOTES.
CUT BACK TO LIEBKIND.
LIEBKIND
We betrayed! I
return! I returnnnnn...
LIEBKIND DISAPPEARS INTO THE FLIES.
DISSOLVE TO ANTEROOM OF BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM'S OFFICE. DAY.
ULLA, WEARING A BELTED RAINCOAT, SITS AT THE TYPEWRITER.
MUSIC FROM A RECORD PLAYER SOFTLY ROCKS IN THE BACKGROUND.
IN HER LEFT HAND SHE HOLDS A GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE, FROM WHICH
SHE SIPS, WHILE HER RIGHT HAND, INDEX FINGER EXTENDED, STABS
AT THE FUNNY LITTLE KEYS. SHE IS HAPPY, IT IS THE RIGHT ONE.
THE DOOR FLIES OPEN. THE DESPERATE BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM
ENTER. ULLA LEAPS UP, QUICKLY UNDOES HER RAINCOAT, EXPOSING
HER DELICIOUS BODY, CLOTHED ONLY IN BLACK LACE UNDERTHINGS.
ULLA
We love?
BIALYSTOCK
No! No! We don't love. Go
work.
ULLA IMMEDIATELY TURNS UP RECORD PLAYER TO A CRASHING BLARE
AND DOES HER GROOVY DANCE. BIALYSTOCK HOWLS IN DESPAIR AND
FLEES INTO HIS OFFICE TOGETHER WITH BLOOM.
80.
HE CLOSES THE DOOR, SHUTTING OUT THE NOISE. THE OFFICE IS
FILLED WITH FLOWERS AND CONGRATULATORY TELEGRAMS. BIALYSTOCK
SWOOPS DOWN ON THE TELEGRAMS. HE RIPS ONE OPEN AND BEGINS
READING.
BIALYSTOCK
"Congratulations. It's biggest
hit Broadway."
HE TEARS IT UP AND THROWS IT AWAY. HE PICKS UP ANOTHER AND
READS.
BIALYSTOCK
"Congratulations. Hitler run
forever."
HE THROWS IT AWAY. BIALYSTOCK ATTACKS THE PILE OF TELEGRAMS.
WITHOUT OPENING THEM UP, HE TEARS THEM ONE AT A TIME.
BIALYSTOCK
(boiling rage)
Congratulations!
HE TEARS TELEGRAM.
BIALYSTOCK
Congratulations!
HE TEARS TELEGRAM.
BIALYSTOCK
Congratulations!
HE TEARS TELEGRAM.
BIALYSTOCK
Congratulations!
HE TEARS TELEGRAM.
THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN. POSED IN THE DOORWAY IS ROGER DE BRIS.
IN ONE HAND HE CARRIES AN OPEN, BUBBLING MAGNUM OF CHAMPAGNE.
DE BRIS
(ecstatic)
Congratulations! Have seen
reviews? Have seen lines
box office? It's torrent,
it's avalanche, it's biggest
hit Broadway!
HE STARTS INTO THE ROOM. BIALYSTOCK GROWLS AND LUNGES AT HIM.
81.
BIALYSTOCK
You lousy fruit. You've ruined me!
HE SMASHES DE BRIS UP AGAINST THE WALL. THE CHAMPAGNE GOES
FLYING.
DE BRIS
(shrieking)
Help! Help! He's crazy! He's
going kill me. Call police!
Call police! Help, help,
murder, murder, rape, rape!!!
BIALYSTOCK THROWS HIM OUT, SLAMS THE DOOR AND LOCKS IT. HE
FALLS INTO THE CHAIR AND PUTS HIS FEET UP ON THE DESK.
BIALYSTOCK
(moaning)
How happen? I
careful. I picked wrong play,
wrong director, wrong cast.
Where I right? We forgot
important, Bloom. Adolf Hitler
drew crowd.
BIALYSTOCK IS SUDDENLY AWARE THAT BLOOM IS DOING STRANGE
THINGS AT THE NEXT DESK.
BIALYSTOCK
What doing?
CUT TO BLOOM. HE IS FEVERISHLY PILING LEDGERS AND ACCOUNT
BOOKS TOGETHER. HE SWOOPS THEM UP IN HIS ARMS, CLUTCHES
THEM TIGHTLY AND BEGINS BACKING TOWARDS THE DOOR.
BLOOM
(defensively)
Don't try stop me. I've
mind.
BIALYSTOCK
What books?

BLOOM
(with hysterical conviction)
I'm turning in. It's
way. I'm going cooperate
authorities. They'll
reduce sentence there's
time good behavior. And
maybe I'll job prison
library. So long.
82.
HE TURNS THE KNOB. THE DOOR IS LOCKED. HE FIDDLES WITH THE
CATCH. TOO LATE! BIALYSTOCK IS UP AND AT HIM IN A FLASH.
HE BLOCKS THE DOOR.
BIALYSTOCK
(reasonably)
Leo, easy. Relax, you're
overwrought. You don't know
you're doing. You're acting
panic... GIMME THOSE BOOKS!
BIALYSTOCK LUNGES AT BLOOM AND GRABS FOR THE BOOKS. BLOOM
STILL RETAINS A FIRM HOLD. THEY STRUGGLE BACK AND FORTH.
BLOOM
I listened you.
BIALYSTOCK
I listened you.
BLOOM
Ohhhhhhhhh, I hate you.
BIALYSTOCK
Double. Double. Double.
WITH A MIGHTY WRENCH, BIALYSTOCK RIPS THE BOOKS OUT OF
BLOOM'S HANDS.
BIALYSTOCK
(clutching books triumphantly)
Haaaaa! Haaaaa! Haaaaa!
BLOOM FLIPS. HE ATTACKS BIALYSTOCK LIKE A CRAZY KID,
SCREAMING HYSTERICALLY AND PUNCHING WITH ONE ARM AS HE
PROTECTS HIS FACE WITH THE OTHER.
BLOOM
(shrieking)
FAT! FAT! FAT! FAT! FAT!
BIALYSTOCK GOES CRASHING TO THE FLOOR UNDER THE ONSLAUGHT.
BLOOM DIVES ON TOP OF HIM. THEY ROLL ON THE FLOOR LOCKED IN
MORTAL COMBAT. SUDDENLY THREE SHOTS RING OUT IN SUCCESSION.
BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM IMMEDIATELY STOP WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND
TURN TOWARD THE DOOR.
CUT TO LOCK AND HANDLE OF DOOR. THEY DROP OFF. A LITTLE
SMOKE RISES FROM THE HOLE.
LIEBKIND
(off screen, outside door)
I betrayed!
83.
BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM LOOK AT EACH OTHER.
CUT TO THE DOOR. IT FLIES OPEN. FRAMED IN THE DOORWAY IS
FRANZ LIEBKIND, SMOKING LUGER IN HAND.
LIEBKIND
(solemnly)
You broken Siegfried Oath.
You die.
HE BLASTS AWAY. THE WINDOW IS SHATTERED. PIECES OF WALL GO
WHIZZING THROUGH THE AIR. BIALYSTOCK DROPS THE LEDGERS AND
HE AND BLOOM DIVE FOR COVER BEHIND THE DESK.
LIEBKIND
This good. I'm killing
you. Don't understand,
broken Siegfried Oath.
You die. Vill cooperate!!!
CUT TO TIGHT TWO SHOT. BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM SCRUNCHED
BEHIND DESK. THEY STARE AT EACH OTHER IN AMAZEMENT. THERE
IS A TIMOROUS KNOCK AT THE DOOR.
BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM
(together)
Come in. Come in.
ULLA ENTERS.
ULLA
I hear noise. You call?
SHE LOOKS AROUND.
ULLA
Where you?
SHE CONTINUES WALKING UNTIL SHE SEES THEM CROUCHED BEHIND
THE DESK.
ULLA
Ahhh. I you. You like

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM LOOK AT EACH OTHER IN DISBELIEF.
BIALYSTOCK

CUT TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM. THEY STARE AT EACH OTHER,
DUMBFOUNDED.
LIEBKIND
Yes, please. Black. Two sugars.
ULLA REPEATS TO HERSELF AS SHE STARTS FOR THE DOOR.
ULLA
Three coffees. Two regular. One
black... sugars.
SHE EXITS AND CLOSES THE DOOR BEHIND HIM.
BIALYSTOCK LOOKS UP TO THE FATES AND MAKES A SMALL SOUND OF
DESPAIR.
LIEBKIND
And ve resume hostilities.

BIALYSTOCK
Not.
LIEBKIND
Cowards, miserable cringing cowards.
Clinging life like baby

HE PLACES THE MUZZLE OF THE GUN AGAINST HIS TEMPLE. BLOOM
AND BIALYSTOCK PEER OVER THE DESK TO SEE.
LIEBKIND
(exhalted)
Soon I vill vit Fuhrer, und
Goering, und Goebbels, Himmler.

HE PULLS THE TRIGGER. CLICK. CLICK. CLICK. THE GUN IS
JAMMED. HE THROWS THE GUN DOWN IN DISGUST.
LIEBKIND
(in utter anguish)
Boy, vhen things wrong!
HE FALLS INTO A CHAIR AND SOBS LIKE A CHILD.
85.
LIEBKIND
I'm failure. I'm failure. I'm
failure.
BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM COME OUT FROM BEHIND DESK. BIALYSTOCK
LOOKS AT HIS WATCH.
BIALYSTOCK
Five o'clock. Killed day
playing hide-and-seek crazy
Kraut.
BIALYSTOCK PICKS UP LUGER.
LIEBKIND
(still sobbing)
I'm crazy. I'm inept.
HE CONTINUES TO SOB. BLOOM WALKS OVER TO THE WEEPING
LIEBKIND AND COMFORTINGLY PATS HIM ON THE SHOULDER.
BLOOM
There, there.
LIEBKIND
(looking around)
Vhere? Vhere?... oh...
BIALYSTOCK
(to Liebkind)
You crazy lunatic! What

BIALYSTOCK
(to Bloom)

LIEBKIND
Yes. The actors. I destroy

LIEBKIND STARTS TO GO.
BLOOM
Stop! Stop! This insanity.
HE LEAPS ACROSS THE ROOM AND WRENCHES THE GUN FROM LIEBKIND'S
HAND.
BLOOM
(screaming)
Have lost mind? What
talking about? Kill actors.
You can't kill actors --
they're animals, they're human
beings!
BIALYSTOCK
They are? Have eaten
one? Liebkind, go! Kill!
BLOOM
Liebkind, no!
BIALYSTOCK
(to Bloom)
What doing? We're trapped.
It's us. There's
way out. What do, blow

BIALYSTOCK FREEZES AS THE THOUGHT TAKES HOLD.
CUT TO CLOSE-UP OF BLOOM. HIS EYES NARROW AS HE SERIOUSLY
CONSIDERS THE PROPOSAL.
CUT TO CLOSE-UP LIEBKIND. HIS FACE A POSTER OF SHINING
APPROVAL.
87.
CAMERA PULLS BACK. THE THREE OF THEM SEARCH EACH OTHER'S
FACES EARNESTLY. THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY IN ACCORD.
FADE OUT:
FADE IN. DARKENED CELLAR OF THEATRE. WE SEE THE FAINT GLOW
OF A SHIELDED LAMP AT THE END OF A TUNNEL. AS THE CAMERA
MOVES THROUGH TUNNEL CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE LIGHT, WE MAKE
OUT THE SHADOWY FORMS OF THREE MEN.
CAMERA DOLLIES IN TO REVEAL BIALYSTOCK, BLOOM AND LIEBKIND.
BLOOM IS HOLDING A MINER'S LAMP. LIEBKIND IS TRYING BRICK
LOOSE FROM WALL. BIALYSTOCK IS CONSULTING MAP. BRICK COMES
LOOSE. LIEBKIND REMOVES IT.
LIEBKIND

BIALYSTOCK REACHES INTO HIS POCKET AND HANDS HIM A FUSE CAP.
LIEBKIND PUTS CAP IN PLACE.

LIEBKIND TIES FUSE IN PLACE.
LIEBKIND

CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM AS THEY MOVE BACK THROUGH THE TUNNEL.
LIEBKIND TRAILS FUSE FROM SPOOL. THEY FINALLY EMERGE INTO
AN OPEN AREA OF CELLAR DIRECTLY BENEATH THE STAGE.
LIEBKIND
Gut. Now vhere's fuse?
BLOOM RAISES HIS LAMP, REVEALING A SIMILAR TUNNEL ON THE
OTHER SIDE OF THE CELLAR.
BLOOM
There is.
88.
CAMERA INSERT: CLOSE-UP SIMILAR FUSE PROTRUDING FROM SECOND

THE THREE OF THEM GINGERLY TIPTOE OVER TO SECOND TUNNEL
ENTRANCE. BLOOM PICKS UP THE FUSE. THEY TIPTOE BACK.
BLOOM HANDS FUSE TO LIEBKIND.
LIEBKIND REACHES INTO HIS KNAPSACK, TAKES OUT LITTLE BLACK
METAL BOX WITH TWO TERMINAL CAPS AT EITHER END AND SETS IT
DOWN ON CELLAR FLOOR.
LIEBKIND
Now ve fuse leads,

LIEBKIND TAKES A WOODEN MATCH OUT OF HIS POCKET.
LIEBKIND

HE STRIKES THE MATCH AND LIGHTS THE FUSE. WHOOSH! IT
IGNITES. THE SPARKS RUSH TOWARD THE MASTER CONNECTION.
LIEBKIND CHARGES DOWN THE STAIRS AND CHASES AFTER THE QUICK
BURNING FUSE FOR ALL HE'S WORTH. HE CATCHES UP WITH IT JUST
BEFORE IT REACHES THE MASTER CONNECTION AND QUICKLY STAMPS
IT OUT.
LIEBKIND
Let's face it. That dumb.
HE TROTS BACK.
LIEBKIND
Boys, vhere you?
BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM COME CRAWLING OUT FROM BEHIND STAIRS.
LIEBKIND
