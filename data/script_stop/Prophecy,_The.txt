The moment drifts silence.

DAGGETT
Till die.
Her eyes settle his.
KATHERINE
When I die, I want me.
DAGGETT
I want too.
She touches cheek, Mary cradled them.
DISSOLVE TO:
Thomas sitting tribal police bronco,
looking window shimmering sands; red yellow
black. To clouds brewing faraway forgotten mountains.
To end earth.
As bronco drifts away empty, rocky
horizon, slowly blends consumed land,
FADE SLOWLY TO BLACK
THE END
