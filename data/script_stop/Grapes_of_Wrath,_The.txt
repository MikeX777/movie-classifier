And tractor roars slow motion again...
We HOUSE AND TRACTOR. The womenfolks scamper

hard, frightened desperate, Muley shouting warnings
Davis, roar tractor drowns voice. The
dog barks excitedly, snarling tractor. THE WOMENFOLKS
stand watching, terrified dead pan, bursts
Muley's wife.
WIFE

The little girl begins whimper.
MULEY

The TRACTOR moves yard, nosing chair

The scene fades out.
