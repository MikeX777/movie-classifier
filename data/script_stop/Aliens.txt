ALIENS
FADE IN
SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE - SPACE 1
Silent endless. The stars shine like love
God...cold remote. Against drifts tiny chip
technology.
CLOSER SHOT It NARCISSUS, lifeboat
ill-fated star-freighter Nostromo. Without interior
running lights devoid life. The PING
RANGING RADAR grows louder, closer. A shadow
engulfs Narcissus. Searchlights flash on, playing
tiny ship, MASSIVE DARK HULL descends
it.
INT. NARCISSUS 2
Dark dormant crypt. The searchlights stream
dusty windows. Outside, massive metal forms
BE SEEN descending shuttle. Like tolling
bell, BASSO PROFUNDO CLANG reverberates
hull.
CLOSE ON THE AIRLOCK DOOR Light glares cutting
torch bursts metal. Sparks shower
room.
A second torch cuts through. They machine
precision, cutting rectangular path, converging. The
torches meet. Cut off. The door falls inward REVEALING
bizarre multi-armed figure. A ROBOT WELDER.
FIGURES ENTER, backlit ominous. THREE MEN
bio-isolation suits, carrying lights equipment. They
approach sarcophaguslike HYPERSLEEP CAPSULE, f.g.

Internal pressure positive. Assume
nominal hull integrity. Hypersleep
capsules, style circa late twenties...
His gloved hand wipes opaque layer dust
canopy.
ANGLE INSIDE CAPSULE light stabs dust
wiped away, illuminating WOMAN, face peaceful
repose.
WARRANT OFFICER RIPLEY, sole survivor Nostromo.
Nestled JONES, ship's wayward cat.
LEADER
(voice over; filtered)
Lights green. She's alive.
Well, goes salvage, guys.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - TIGHT ON RIPLEY - GATEWAY STATION 3
She's lying bed, looking wan, female MED-TECH
raises backrest. She surrounded arcane white
MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. The Med-Tech exudes practiced
cheeriness.
MED-TECH
Why don't I open viewport?
Watch eyes.
Harsh light floods motorized shield slides
ceiling, REVEALING breathtaking vista. Beyond
sprawling complex modular habitats, collectively
called GATEWAY STATION, curve EARTH seen
high orbit. Blue serene.
MED-TECH
And today?
RIPLEY
(weakly)
Terrible.
MED-TECH
Just terrible? That's better
yesterday least.
RIPLEY
How long I
Gateway station?
MED-TECH
Just couple days. Do
feel visitor?
Ripley shrugs, caring. The door opens MAN
enters, Ripley sees carrying.
A familiar large, orange TOMCAT.
RIPLEY
Jones!
She grabs cat like life preserver.
RIPLEY
(cooing baby-cat talk)
Come Jonesy ugly old
moose...you ugly thing.
Jones patiently endures Ripley's embarrassing display,
worse wear. The visitor sits
bed Ripley finally notices him. He
thirtyish handsome, suit looks executive
legal, tie loosened studied casualness. A
smile referred "winning."
MAN
Nice room. I'm Burke. Carter Burke.
I work company,
I'm okay guy. Glad
you're feeling better. I'm told
weakness disorientation
pass soon. Side effects
unusually long hypersleep,
like that.
RIPLEY
How long I there? They
won't tell anything.
BURKE
(soothing)
Well, maybe shouldn't worry
yet.
Ripley grabs arm, surprising him.
RIPLEY
How long?
Burke gazes her, thoughtful.
BURKE
All right. My instinct says
you're strong handle
this...Fifty-seven years.
Ripley stunned. She deflate, expression
passing amazement shock realization
lost. Friends. Family. Her world.
RIPLEY
Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...
BURKE
You'd drifted right
core systems. It's blind luck
deep-salvage team caught
they...are right?
Ripley coughs suddenly choking expression
dawning horror. Burke hands glass
water nightstand. She slaps away. It
shatters SMASH. Jones dives, yowling. Ripley
grabs chest, struggling strangling.
The Med-Tech hits console button.
MED-TECH
(shouting)
Code Blue! 415. Code Blue!
4-1-5!
Burke Med-Tech holding Ripley's shoulders
goes convulsions. A DOCTOR TWO TECHS run
in. Ripley's arches agony.
RIPLEY
No...noooo!
They try restrain thrashes, knocking
equipment. Her EKG races like mad. Jones,
cabinet, hisses wide-eyed.
DOCTOR
Hold her...Get airway, stat!
And cc's of...Jesus!
AN EXPLOSION OF BLOOD beneath sheet covering
chest! Ripley stares SHAPE RISING UNDER THE
SHEET. Tearing her.
HER P.O.V. sheet rises. A GLIMPSE OF
CHITTERING HORROR...IT SCREECHES.
TIGHT ON RIPLEY screaming, snapping INTO FRAME.
Alone darkened hospital room. She gasps
breath, clutching pathetically chest. There
demented horror rigging her. Her eyes
snap wildly, slowly focusing reality
safety. Shuddering, bathed sweat, kneads
breastbone heel hand sobs.
A VIDEO MONITOR bed snaps on. A MED-TECH's
face.
MED-TECH
Bad dreams again? Do want
help sleep?
RIPLEY
(faint)
No.. I've slept enough.
The Med-Tech shrugs switches off. Touching button
nightstand opens viewport, REVEALING
Gateway turquoise Earth. She hugs Jones
rocks like child, shattered
nightmare. Shivering. Sleep far off.
RIPLEY
We it, Jones. We it.
But price?
CUT TO:
EXT. PARK 4
Sunlight streams shafts stand poplars,
verdant meadow VISIBLE.
EXTREME F.G. Jones stalks bird hopping
fallen leaves. He leaps. And smack A WALL.
RIPLEY
(voice over)
Dumbshit.
WIDER ANGLE Jones steps confused
HIGH-RESOLUTION ENVIRONMENTAL WALL SCREEN, sort
cinerama video-loop. Ripley sits bench

bowels Gateway Station. Benches.
Some unenthusiastic potted trees. The sterile corridors
VISIBLE glass doors b.g.
Burke ENTERS usual mode, casual haste.
BURKE
Sorry...I've running

Ripley healthier now, bit brittle.
RIPLEY
Have located daughter

BURKE
Well, I going wait

He opens briefcase, removing sheet printer
hard copy, including telestat photo.
RIPLEY
Is she...?
BURKE
(scanning)
Amanda Ripley-McClaren. Married
name, I guess. Age: sixty-six
...at time death. Two years
ago.
(looks her)
I'm sorry.
Ripley studies PHOTOGRAPH, stunned.
The face woman mid-sixties. It

little girl knew.
RIPLEY
Amy.
BURKE
(reading)
Cancer. Hmmmm. They haven't
licked one. Cremated. Interred
Parkside Repository, Little Chute,
Wisconsin. No children.
Ripley gazes off, pseudo-landscape,
past.
RIPLEY
I promised I'd home
birthday. Her eleventh
birthday. I sure missed
one.
(pause)
Well...she learned
promises grain
salt. When came flight
schedules, anyway.
Burke nods, simpatico presence.
RIPLEY
You think
somebody...later, know.
But I can. I
can.
Let's thing straight...Ripley tough
lady. But terror, loss, emptiness are,
moment, overwhelming. She cries silently.
Burke puts reassuring hand arm.
BURKE
(gently)
The hearing convenes 0930. You
don't want late.
INT. CORRIDOR - GATEWAY 5
Elevator doors Ripley emerges, mid-conversation
Burke. DOLLYING AHEAD OF THEM rapidly

RIPLEY
You read deposition...it's

BURKE

RIPLEY

BURKE

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - ON RIPLEY - GATEWAY 6
She's cool. Not unemotional.
RIPLEY
Do people earwax,

want tell
story?
She faces EIGHT MEMBERS board inquiry
long conference table. Gray suits grim faces. They
aren't buying. Behind Ripley large VIDEO SCREEN,
PARKER grins like goon personnel mugshot. His
file prints it. BRETT's face dossier
replace it, SCENE continues...
KANE, LAMBERT, ASH android traitor, DALLAS.
VAN LEUWEN, ICC representative, steeples fingers
frowns.
VAN LEUWEN
Look perspective.
You freely admit detonating
engines of, destroying,
M-Class star-freighter. A
expensive piece hardware...
INSURANCE INVESTIGATOR
(dryly)
Forty-two million adjusted dollars.
That's minus payload, course.
VAN LEUWEN
The shuttle's flight recorder
corroborates elements
account. That Nostromo
set LV-426, unsurveyed
planet, time. That
repairs made. That resumed
course subsequently set
self-destruct. By you. For
reasons unknown.
RIPLEY
Look, I told you...
VAN LEUWEN

entries concerning hostile
life form allegedly picked up.
Ripley sense noose tightening.
RIPLEY
Then somebody's gotten it...
doctored recorder. Who
access it?
The ECA (Extrasolar Colonization Administration)
Representative (ECA REP) shakes head.
ECA REP
Would listen

VAN LEUWEN
The analysis team went

RIPLEY

That's I blew
Goddamn airlock!
(pause)
Like I said.
INSURANCE MAN
(to ECA Rep)
Are species like
'hostile organism' LV-426?
ECA REP
No. It's rock. No indigenous
life larger simple virus.
Ripley grits teeth frustration.
RIPLEY
I told you, wasn't indigenous.
There alien spacecraft there.
A derelict ship. We homed
beacon...
ECA REP
To perfectly frank, we've surveyed
worlds one's
reported creature which,
words...
(read Ripley's
statement)
...'gestates living human host'
'concentrated molecular acid
blood.'
Ripley glances Burke, silent far end
table. His expression grim. Her mouth hardens
bit old nail-eating Ripley surfaces.
RIPLEY
Look, I
going. But I'm telling
things exist. Back planetoid
alien ship ship
thousands eggs. Thousands.
Do understand? I suggest
it, flight recorder's

VAN LEUWEN
Thank you, Officer Ripley. That
be...
RIPLEY
(louder, stepping
him)
...because
things managed kill entire
crew, hours
hatching...
Van Leuwen stands, patience.
VAN LEUWEN
Thank you, all.
Ripley stares down, glowering board.
RIPLEY
That's all, Goddamnit! If
things here,
all. Then
kiss good-bye, Jack! Just kiss
goodbye.
Ripley turns sharply away, trembling frustration
anger. Dallas looks video

INT. CORRIDOR 9
DOLLY BACK conference room door bangs open
Ripley strides through. She shrugs Burke's
restraining arm catches Van Leuwen walking
corridor.
RIPLEY
(insistent)
Why won't check LV-426?
VAN LEUWEN
(condescendingly)
Because I don't to. The
people live checked
years ago
reported 'hostile organism'
alien ship. And way,
Acheron now.
RIPLEY
What talking about.
What people?
Van Leuwen steps elevator others,
Ripley holds door closing.
VAN LEUWEN
Terraformers...planet engineers.
It's shake 'n' bake
colony. They set atmosphere
processors air
breathable...big job. Takes
decades. They've
years. Peacefully.
The door tries close. Ripley slams back. People
getting annoyed.
RIPLEY
How colonists?
VAN LEUWEN
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
RIPLEY
(low)
Sweet Jesus.
ELEVATOR PASSENGER
Do mind?
Ripley's hand slides door, strengthless.
TIGHT ON HER FROM INSIDE elevator doors close
like fate lost expression.
EXT. ALIEN LANDSCAPE - DAY 10
A hideous, storm-blasted vista. Tortured rock forms.
Bleak twilight midday.
PAN SLOWLY ONTO CORRODED METAL SIGN set concrete
pylons, reads:
HADLEY'S HOPE - POP. 159
"WELCOME TO ACHERON"
Some local added spray-can graffiti
"Have nice day." Gale-force wind SCREECHES
steel sign, driving freezing rain.
The COLONY, b.g., squat complex lots
floodlights.
EXT. COLONY COMPLEX 11
The town cluster bunkerlike metal concrete
buildings connected conduits. Neon signs throw garish
colors vaultlike walls, advertising bars
businesses. It looks like sodden cross
Krupps munitions works truckstop casino
Nevada boondocks.
Huge-wheeled tractors crawl toadlike rutted
"street" vanish rampways underground garages.
ANGLE ON THE CONTROL BLOCK largest structure. It
resembles vaguely superstructure aircraft
carrier...a flying bridge.
VISIBLE half kilometer barren heath, b.g.,
massive complex nearest ATMOSPHERE
PROCESSOR, looking like power plant bred active
volcano. Its fiery glow pulses low cloud cover
like steel mill.
INT. MAIN CONCOURSE - NEAR CONTROL BLOCK 12
A central space, laid like scaled-down shopping
mall styling flourishes. We SEE cross section
types people come live
Godforsaken Acheron. Tough. Pragmatic. "Grapes
Wrath" faces. Calloused hands. Not interior
decorators. Some children race corridor things
look suspiciously like "Big Wheels."
INT. OPERATIONS ROOM - CONTROL BLOCK 13
Jammed terminals, technicians, displays...
business running colony flows
here. It's high tech scrungy. Papers
piled up. Coffee cup rings.
DOLLY AHEAD OF LYDECKER, Assistant Operations Manager,
catches harried Operating Manager,
SIMPSON.
LYDECKER
You remember sent
wildcatters

range, couple days ago?
SIMPSON
Yeah. What?
LYDECKER
There's guy horn,

LYDECKER
So I tell guy?
SIMPSON
Tell him, far I'm concerned,
finds it's his.
EXT. ACHERON - THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - A SIX-WHEELED 14
TRACTOR - DAY
It roars corrugated rock, blasting soggy
drifts volcanic ash.
INT. TRACTOR 15
At controls, intent PINGING scope, RUSS JORDEN,
independent prospector. Beside wife/partner
ANNE kids playing
heavy sampling equipment.
JORDEN
(gloating cackle)
Look fat, juicy magnetic
profile. And it's mine, mine,

ANNE
Half mine, dear.
NEWT, six-year-old daughter, yells back...
NEWT
And half mine!
JORDEN
I got partners.
NEWT
Daddy, going
town?
JORDEN
When rich, Newt.
NEWT
You that. I wanna
back. I wanna play 'Monster Maze.'
Her older brother TIM sticks jeering face close
hers.
TIM
You cheat much.
NEWT
Do not. I'm best.
TIM
Do too! You places
can't fit.
NEWT
So! That's I'm best.
ANNE
Knock off! I catch

I'll tan hides.
NEWT
Mom. All kids play it...
JORDEN
(reverently)
Holy shiiit!
ANGLE THROUGH FRONT CANOPY ON bizarre shape looming
ahead. An enormous bonelike mass projecting upward
bed ash. The tractor slows.
Canted buckles rock outcropping
lava flow, recognizable
EXTRATERRESTRIAL SHIP. Bio-mechanoid. Nonhuman design.
JORDEN
Folks, scored big
time.
EXT. TRACTOR 16
Jorden Anne step down, wearing ENVIRONMENT SUITS.
Carrying LIGHTS, PACKS, CAMERAS, TEST GEAR. Their
breath clouds chill air.
ANNE
You kids stay inside. I mean

They trudge alien derelict.
ANNE
Shouldn't in?
JORDEN
Let's wait till know
as.
ANNE
(nervous)
How 'big weird thing'?
They pause twisted gash hull. Blackness
inside.
INT./EXT. TRACTOR 17
Newt face pressed glass, steaming it.
Watching parents enter strange ship. Tim GRABS
HER behind. She SHRIEKS.
TIM
Cheater!
EXT. LANDSCAPE - NIGHT 18
The tractor derelict dark motionless.
The wind HOWLS them.
Tim curled driver's seat. Newt shakes
awake, trying hard cry.
NEWT
Timmy...they've gone
long time.
Tim considers night. The wind. The vast landscape.
He bites lip.
TIM
(quavering)
It'll okay, Newt. Dad knows
he's doing.
CRASH! Newt SCREAMS door RIPPED
OPEN. A dark shape lunges inside!
Anne, panting terrified, grabs dash mike.
ANNE
Mayday! Mayday! This
Alpha Kilo Two Four Niner
calling Hadley Control.
Repeat. This is...
As Anne shouts mayday Newt looks past her,
ground. Russ Jorden lies inert, dragged
Anne inside ship. There SOMETHING ON
HIS FACE. An appalling MULTILEGGED CREATURE, pulsing
obscene life. Newt begins SCREAM hysterically,
competing shrieking wind rises
crescendo we:
CUT TO:
INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT - GATEWAY - DAY 20
Silence. Ripley, looking haggard, sits table
dining alcove contemplating smoke rising
cigarette. The place modest, charitable,
personal touches. Though it's late
day Ripley wearing robe. The bed
unmade. Dishes sink. Jones prowls
counter. The WALLSCREEN on, blaring vapidly.
VOICE FROM VIDEO
(o.s.)
Hey, Bob! I heard
family heading
colonies!
BON
(o.s.)
Best decision I made, Bill.

slightly.
BURKE
Hi, Ripley. This

SLAM. Burke buzzes again. Talks door...
BURKE

(pause)
They've lost contact

The door opens. Ripley considers ramifications
that. She motions inside.
INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT - A LITTLE LATER 22
Burke Gorman seated, nursing coffee. Ripley
paces, tense.
RIPLEY
No. There's way!
BURKE
Hear out...
RIPLEY

It's second chance, kiddo. And

RIPLEY

Spare me, Burke. I've

Burke leans close, let's-cut-the-crap intimacy.
BURKE
Yes, I've read it. You

soaking, nightmare

RIPLEY

No! The answer no. Now

CUT TO:
INT. APARTMENT 24
Ripley lunges INTO FRAME animal outcry. She
clutches chest, breathing hard. Bathed sweat
lights cigarette trembling hands. Do
hear faint, desolate wind?
TIGHT ON PHONE CONSOLE Ripley's hand inserts Burke's
card slot. "STAND BY" prints screen
replaced Burke's face, bleary sleep.
BURKE
(on video phone)
Yello? Oh, Ripley. Hi...
RIPLEY
Burke, tell thing.
That you're going

...forever.
BURKE
That's plan. My word it.
CLOSEUP - RIPLEY taking deep slow breath. It's time
look demon eye.
RIPLEY
All right. I'm in.
She punches Burke replies,
change mind. She turns Jones sitting

RIPLEY
And dear, staying
right here.
Jones blinks, cynical cat eyes..."count right

CUT TO:
EXT. DEEP SPACE - THREE WEEKS LATER 25
An starfield. Metal spires slice ACROSS FRAME.
A mountain steel following. A massive military
transport ship, SULACO. Ugly, battered...
functional.
INT. CORRIDOR TO CARGO LOCK 26
An corridor, seemingly miles long. No movement.
The THRUMMING hyperdrive engines.
INT. CARGO LOCK 27
An enormous chamber, cavernous dark. Squatting
shadows orbit-to-surface shuttles.
DROP-SHIPS. Heavy machinery them...
cranes, loading equipment.
INT. BRIDGE 28
Dark electronic womb. CAMERA DOLLIES SLOWLY
murmuring instrumentation. A sudden high-pitched
TRILLING accompanies sequence lights. An alarm.
INT. HYPERSLEEP VAULT 29
Blackness, bank indicators lights up.
Hydraulics lift grid equipment row
horizontal HYPERSLEEP CYLINDERS. It reaches
ceiling. Locks.
CLOSE ON RIPLEY'S CAPSULE trickles water run
frosted canopy.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. HYPERSLEEP VAULT 30
Lit up, white sterile.
The canopies row capsules raised. Ripley
sits up. Rubs arms briskly. Next Gorman
Burke stirring troopers,

SPUNKMEYER
Arrgh. I'm getting old

SPUNKMEYER says sincerely,
enlisted underage long ago. Looking surly, DRAKE
sits up. He's young street-tough. Nasty
scar curling lip sneer.
DRAKE
They ain't payin'

DIETRICH
Not wake

DRAKE
Suck air. Hey, Hicks...you look

HICKS, older lifer-type keeps counsel,
snorts good-naturedly.
Ripley scans group shuffle past

hardened...tough, capable, jaded. They combine
specialized techno-combat training twenty-first
century fighting man qualities universal

HUDSON
This floor's freezing.
APONE
Christ. I saw
buncha old women. You want

HUDSON
Would you, Sir?
Ripley steps troopers shuffle past nodding

tightknit group.
VASQUEZ eyes coldly passes. Like Drake,
Vasquez younger rest combat-primer

Eyes cunning mean.
HUDSON
Hey, Vasquez...you
mistaken man?
VASQUEZ
No. Have you?
She slaps Drake's open palm clenches
greeting contest. It gets rougher.
Painful. Until cuffs hard break

bond.
BISHOP helping like valet. As passes

FROST
Hey, hand job,

INT. MESS HALL 32
An unconscious segregation takes place troopers
assemble long table Gorman, Burke, Bishop
Ripley sit another. Everybody nursing

"Pray War" "I've Served My Time Hell: Cetti
Epsilon NC-104" others.
HUDSON
Hey, 'Top.' What's op?
APONE
Rescue mission. There's
juicy colonists' daughters

Apone stocky, grizzled, peregrine eyes. He runs
loose fair, knows people

SPUNKMEYER

What's crap supposed be?
WIERZBOWSKI
Cornbread, I think. Hey, I wouldn't

Looks like new Lieutenant's

WIERZBOWSKI
(glancing

Yeah. Got corn cob ass,

Across room, table, Gorman sits
creases perfect...the consummate strack NCO. Bishop
takes seat Ripley, pointedly gets

BISHOP
I'm sorry feel way
Synthetics, Ripley.
Ripley spins Burke, tone accusing.
RIPLEY
You said

BURKE
Well, didn't occur me. It's

BISHOP
I prefer term 'artificial person'
myself. Is problem?
BURKE
A synthetic malfunctioned

involved.
BISHOP
I'm shocked. Was older model?
BURKE
Cyberdyne Systems 120-A/2.
Bishop turns Ripley, conciliatory.
BISHOP
Well, explains it. The
A/2's bit twitchy.
That happen

(smiling)
More cornbread?
WHAM! Ripley knocks plate hand, halfway

RIPLEY
Just stay away me, Bishop!
You got straight?
Burke Gorman exchange glances.
Wierzbowski, table, shrugs turns
