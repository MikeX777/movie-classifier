loves!" -- That's somethin'
called "Othello" --
OR, ALTERNATE SPEECH:
JAKE (CONT'D)
Is whispering nothing? Is leaning
cheek cheek? Is meeting noses?
Kissing inside lip? Stopping
career laughter sign?
-- A note infallible breaking
honesty -- horsing foot foot?
Skulking corners? Wishing clocks
swift? Hours, minutes? Noon,
midnight? eyes blind
pin web theirs, theirs
only, unseen wicked?
Is nothing? Why,
world that's in't
nothing; The covering sky
nothing; Bohemia nothing; My wife
nothing;
nothings, nothing." --
That's called "The
Winter's Tale" -- Shakespeare! You
remember Shakespeare.
He wrote famous plays
other, went
big slump ain't
good years. That speech
jealousy -- jealousy's
bad thing. Jealousy bothers lot
guys... me... I
killed brother... I love him...
he's family... I mean, there's
nothin' wouldn't me. And
that's way goin'
life -- doin' nothin'
other! Anytime got trouble
kids, I got
it. You know, steal
little things growin'
up. But particular...
stole things begin 'a'
-- watch, car, suit,
ring... But I wrong... I
shoulda hit brother.
Afterwards, I sorry. Now
time I need somethin' I gotta
