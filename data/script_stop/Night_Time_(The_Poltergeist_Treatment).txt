easily fixed. The furniture, slightly first, rearranged. Just annoy
meticulous mother; cause suspicion. Elmer, family dog, begins wandering
certain alcove house. He sits there, facing wall, occasionally whimpering
it, reaching paw scratching air. But, well, he's getting old, people

door neighbors playing tricks remote controls. But neighbors
aren't home. And phone friend assures Steven friend's remote control wouldn't

silenced something: sight aviary torn open, feat accomplished
human strength. But noise awakened them..."what going on?"
Windows doors open close, seemingly themselves. In middle night
downstairs re-bolt window re-lock door. Furniture moved

Nora, preparing meal kitchen, hears swimming pool. She calls outside
ready dinner. Her calls ignored. She goes outside
sight invisible looks like laps pool (Or we,
audience, laps, Nora gets there, gone). This
nervous, thinking wrong her,
playing tricks.
One evening, Angel getting ready bed, takes clothes moves bed

Steven accuses lying. "Record players don't turn on, know."
Angel, upset father breaking album, accusing unjustly, goes
room upset. She prepare date.
She sits vanity looking herself, angry father. She starts

This brings image mirror. She frightened look mirrors point

Anxious house, Angel hurries older brother,
friends going movies, house. The babysitter, 15 year old teenager,

As puts children bed, talk telling story. She concedes, tells
ghost story. As tells story, actual events house upstage fictional story

negligent duties, runs screaming house night. Neighbors' lights on,
obviously disturbed screaming.
The older children home little ones sitting steps, babysitter
sight. The parents return story deserting babysitter says house haunted.
The evening's events edge, especially Steven Nora.
Nora sits vanity brushing long auburn tresses. As brushes hair somewhat
mindlessly past right shoulder, invisible wind lifts hair brush
hand. It arches hair slowly head lays rest left shoulder. She sits
frozen, unable speak, brush hand, wide eyes locked image
mirror. At moment, feels touching cheek. We indentations,

That evening hotel room, feeling things getting better, Nora Steven love.
However, happens. A spirit enters Steven's body, causing personality actions
altered bit. He says things obviously doing. Things

causes home.
On arriving home, realize house invaded entourage young,

Also taking place time major archeological dig. This going

discovered unearthed extremely large grave site. The results

As Freelings house unwitting celebrities, children saddled
barrage torment schoolmates. They avoided. They "the haunted people."
One people comes help Freelings TAGINA BARRINS, psychic, regular
contributor National Enquirer. She comic character who, comes
crazy old lady seeking attention, probably helpful authentic psychic all.
She spends lot time walking talking house. At point, TAGINA
awakened dead night, somnambulistic state, drives Freeling's home,

start, finding talking television set static.
The Freeling's neighbors, friendly, hostile. A petition
started Eisenhowers force leave neighborhood. It Steven
family want anything. They look home area Steven works,
informed boss think bringing bizarre ghostly rumors cultist
rituals 400 acres suburban tranquility, fired work real estate

Within short period time, Freeling neighbors problems own. Screams
panic indicate like contagious virus, haunting spread: Eisenhower
home, street neighbors; block. Beyond causing
frightened residents harm fleeing ghostly manifestations, ghost fires
set. (A ghost phenomenon place room house. Perhaps
cold center haunting home. The devastate specific area,
spread rooms floors.) Each haunting, home, signaled
television. Where remote control device, TV flip early
hours morning station broadcasting static noise. The manifestations originate
there.
Other items possible incorporation be:
The manifestations love materialize (not humanoid form ghosts), occasionally
ectoplasmic displays, emanating toaster house. (Ectoplasm
spermatozoa-like substance originates fingers mediums trying
contact spirits side). But ectoplasm manifestations come
family toaster, microwave oven, naturally uncommon.
Occasionally manifestation whisp-like type smoke basic humanoid form
keeps changing shape travels room next, finds recipient
looking for. When found, smoke dissipate sleeping person. We
hair blow ear, ghostly breath whispering privately,
chillingly. We hear mournful crying "help me, help me"
poltergeist. Beyond toaster microwave oven, ectoplasmic manifestations
finally develop foremost television sets static hours,
form trying climb TV set home haunt you. This
climax story.
Another aspect dog's affected Haunting, family roll

One possible ending NIGHT TIME evacuation town townspeople.
