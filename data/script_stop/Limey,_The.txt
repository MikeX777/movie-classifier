book seat check route.
EXT. BOULEVARD. DAY.
Wilson makes sudden lane change avoid getting fed
wrong direction. Gets HONKED driver.
EXT. A STREET DOWNTOWN. DAY.
Wilson cruises past particular building. We don't

important seeing it. Casing eyes
professional. Sniffing out; instinct
predator prey.
INT. CAR. DAY.

personalized items: set select slim
lockpicking/cutting tools.
EXT. SIDE STREET. DAY.
Wilson locks car. Walks away. STAY him.
AROUND THE CORNER
He walks block. A nice long walk. What
sense Wilson -- cool cat; ambling along;
loner; sun beating down; bothered; shadow doubling
-- this:
The building approaching. The eye on. The
target. It's street. A kind flat windowless
warehouse adjoining loading yard. Loading yard
surrounded chain-link fence -- topped barbed wire.
The actual geography left car relation
building. Safely corner. And
practically it, way
circuitous route round block.
The sense downtown L.A. lazy Saturday
afternoon you're ghost town. Particularly
shabby kind industrial section.
EXT. THE BUILDING.
Wilson crosses now. From sunny shade.
Walks past chain-link fence. The padlocked gate, big
accommodate (couple of) trucks parked
compound.
Walks past closed security door appear
building's main entrance.
Round corner -- SEES there's steel door
well.
Comes block again. Looking surreptitiously
now. Streets utterly deserted. Not passing car.
Crappy residential building opposite corner, SPANISH
MUSIC blaring open windows,
direct view loading yard fence side. Wilson
nearing -- taking pocket. One
mysterious metallic tools travel kit. Snaps
wrist, unfolding tool CRACK. Wire cutters.
He doesn't gate, padlock, like
thought. He suddenly drops knee, shadow
fence meets adjoining building. SNAP, SNAP, SNAP, SNAP,
SNAP -- quick, great dexterity, face
grimaces strength exert
application pressure -- cuts links
knows needs push little flap fence roll
under. Whole thing accomplished seconds.
LOADING YARD
Walks fast cover trucks. Passes. Looks
around. Cement loading docks bays. Shuttered doors. He
jumps one, puts ear metal. Listens awhile.
WILSON
Scans wall sign alarm box anything.
Then cocks ear upwards... CAMERA CRANING UP
hears: air-conditioning unit HUMMING away. Which
means inside.
Wilson looks entry options. Not loading
doors -- conventional door end,
conventional lock eye zeroes on. Gets tools,
going over.
INT. WAREHOUSE HALLWAY.
A SCRATCHING door. It opens. He's in.
Waits. Cautious. Nothing. He starts hallway.

The Supervisor shoves him. The Meat Puppets little
anticipation. Wilson isn't giving indication he's
going leave.
SUPERVISOR
Jesus, want ass kicked,

He pushes Wilson again, hard.
SUPERVISOR
Go on, outta here.
He pushes Wilson again. Still, Wilson won't leave.
SUPERVISOR

This time tries slap Wilson. Wilson blocks
Supervisor's hand punches him, hard. The Supervisor
