A sharp jolt turbulence. Russell begins pounding
card table rhythm.
RUSSELL
(singing Buddy Holly)
"Peggy Sure... Peggy Sue... "
DICK
Please.
RUSSELL
"Pretty pretty pretty pretty Peggy
Sue... "
A moment laughter, bam. Jeff's drink rises
suspends briefly mid-air. The plane takes mighty
knock.
JEFF
We shouldn't here.
RUSSELL
Doris, miss you!
Fear creeping edges. William,
uneasy flier, looks down.
PILOT'S VOICE
This Craig, pilot. It appears
we've caught edge electrical
storm trying outrun. Buckle

getcha this.
The rocking plane worsens, buckle up.
JEFF
"Electrical storm?"

Rock roll.
The sky darkens abruptly. William looks up, increasingly
nervous, stares straight ahead. The plane suddenly drops
stabilizes. Everyone silent Russell.

A moment later, ashen-faced CO-PILOT emerges, balancing
hands ceiling shuddering plane.
CO-PILOT

He returns cockpit. The weather worsens, hail
suddenly pelts plane, comes hard. Inside lights
shut off. William stares straight ahead, cockpit door
swings open - total chaos visible inside - shuts again.
DICK
And thinks it's glamorous
here.
LARRY

He told we're gonna die.
JEFF
(insecurities running wild)
We're gonna crash Elvis' hometown --

Nervous laughter. Another sheet hail hits plane.
LESLIE

PUSH IN ON WILLIAM
Just shaking. Nearly tears. Hyperventilating.
RUSSELL
If happen. I love

The plane shakes. Now lightening strikes close. A
flashing wall electricity rolls plane
evaporates burning smell air. In
darkness:
DENNIS HOPE
I hit man Dearborn, Michigan.
A hit-and-run. I hit kept
going. I don't know he's alive
dead, I'm sorry.
LESLIE
(gripped fear)
Oh God.
The plane wildly rises, falls. It stops moment. A
strange smooth patch.
DICK

(incredulous, giddy)
And don't like me.
JEFF

Bam. The plane pulling sideways, dropping altitude.
LESLIE

RUSSELL

Whatever happens, you're dead.
JEFF
Don't self-righteous, Russell,

groupie. Last summer,
yesterday. Why don't tell
Leslie THAT?
Russell tries attack him. The force keeps
seat. He yells. Loud.
DENNIS
(freaking out)
I quit.
The turbulence worsens. William finds mouth saying
emotional words control.
WILLIAM
"That groupie?" She Band-Aid.
All love band. And
-- her, you.
You threw away. She
died night,
Bob Dylan. You're talking
fans, fans, fans.
She biggest fan threw

that's biggest problem.
Russell Jeff stare other. The plane rocking
hard. Leslie crying.
ED
I'm gay.
They turn silent drummer. (It's spoken
dialogue movie.)
Then.
The plane pops clouds. Sunshine spikes
embattled windows plane, float
downwards city Tupelo, Mississippi. A
uneasy silence fills plane. No look other.
Out bursts Co-Pilot, giddy victory.
CO-PILOT
Thank God above, WE'RE ALIVE!! WE'RE
ALIVE!! WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT!!
Shot occupants, ending Russell. Suddenly,
alternative far attractive. We hear Rod Stewart's
"Jo's Lament" music plays still-shocked faces.
148 INT. TUPELO AIRPORT CORRIDOR -- DAY 148
Music continues, walk like ghosts long
pregnant silence, ignoring kid. Everything
different now. The kid peels throws dumpster.
We continue band, unhappily moving forward. William
hustles catch up. They ignore him. There
bigger thoughts play. No wants speak.
JEFF
Well, I think build new
honesty.
Boom. Russell attacks him, they're pulled apart. The
band continues moving forward, arriving fork airport
terminals. William stops. This company.
He stands mouth terminal, band
continues, unaware he's split off. He watches backs,
they've forgotten him.
Then Russell turns, sensing missing. William. All
stop turn. Still shell-shocked, summon pre-
occupied heartfelt goodbye. William waves. Music
continues.

Good evening!
162A EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY 162A
Russell stands outside, traveling man go.
Oddly, way surprises him, world begins
speak again... little noises everywhere, turning
music own. It's beautiful compelling "silence."
He thrusts hands deep pockets, takes breath
life. His head filling music world,
begins walk street. Very naturally,
randomly, noticed young passersby. They can't help
it. He looks like star. They can't figure
is, it's someone, begin follow
street. Unbeknownst walks along, deep thought,
small crowd begins form... following him.
163 INT. BREAKFAST TABLE - DAY 163
A quiet kitchen. Anita cooking. A substantial
breakfast placed table. Sausage, orange
juice... Anita sets plate pancakes,
syrup butter, mother. William watches
mother facing old enemy - white sugar.
ANITA
They're called pancakes. Who knows
we'll again. Splurge.
It's people breakfast.
Mom looks children, takes breath.
ELAINE
I went records. And I
song play you.
She goes stereo puts record. The children
eye - what's coming next? (Song chosen)
The kids eye again. Self-consciously avoiding
gaze, Mom sits toys breakfast. It's song
clearly wants hear. It's song heart.
They look her, amazed. Elaine looks up, regards family.
Somehow they're table. They continue eating
breakfast.
164 ON SIDEWALK 164
Bam. A bundle bound Rolling Stone Magazines lands
newsstand pavement thud. Someone reaches cut
cord, magazines puff view. It's new issue,
Russell Hammond cover. The title: Stillwater Runs
Deep. Just stack magazines waiting places
racks.
FADE OUT
Music segues Led Zeppelin's "Four Sticks." Penny Lane's
sleeping Polaroid shots characters, featuring
self-portraits.
THE END
