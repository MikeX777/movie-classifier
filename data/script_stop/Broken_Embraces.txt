Diego writes title caps: DONATE BLOOD.)
DIEGO
The vampires like type ethnic group,
completely assimilated Spanish society,
don't stand out. There vampires occupy
important positions, keeping secret (like
Opus Dei). But live shadows,
amassed great social economic power...
HARRY
They control industries. For example,

DIEGO
(Smiles) And provide nightly entertainment:
bars, discos, after-hours... Since don't need drugs
stay awake, apt working
night. They don't burn out...
HARRY
65

...After having written dramas, I finally
managed write script comedy, that's
I thought. I wanted change genres... risk
(ironic-destructive) And I swear I accomplished that,
taking risk.
In 1994, calls Harry "Mateo". He sitting table
filled papers, photographs, books, magazines, ashtray, pencil
pen holders, etc. At center, script lies open, tons
notes scribbled margins pages. He finishing
definitive version "Girls Suitcases".
The casual messiness place produces aesthetic. The
decorations walls, there, following
particular symmetrical rule, postcards painters, actors
landscapes, held place tacks. There newspaper page
caught Mateo's attention. Or astonishing photograph,
taken magazine. The cover magazine. Everything
framing, tacked directly wall.
The furniture pastel, medium-shade green red, velvet
tapestry, worn outmoded. The pieces don't match, look
good together.
Judit enters (also fourteen years younger, obvious.
She woman unmarked march time.)
Mateo focused script's pages. Judit Mateo's right-hand
man, accomplices everything, professionally
emotionally.

Even she's bit nervous, tell Lena strong
