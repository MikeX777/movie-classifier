FADE IN:
EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT
Mist. Dark trees. Dripping vines. An ENGINE RUMBLES
distance.
The moon shimmers puddle. A FROG SPLATS IN,
splashing man pup tent.
INSIDE THE TENT
LUKE's eyes pop open, disoriented, realizing he's fallen
asleep reading flashlight. He's nineteen, slightly
awkward unaware he's growing handsome.
He listens ENGINE RUMBLES LOUDER, closer.
He peers tent flap. Glaring head lamps ROAR
him. Scrambling sleeping bag, HURLS
tent, as...
OUTSIDE
RV CAMPER nearly plows tent, skidding stop
mud.
Stillness.
Luke extricates tent. He runs driver-
window RV.
LUKE
Are right?
Inside, ALEXA, thirties, earthy, looks bleary-eyed.
She nods 'yes.'
LUKE (CONT'D)
How here? There's
road.
ALEXA
I'm sorry. I'm Utah.
LUKE
It's okay.
ALEXA
Are here?
2.
He nods 'yes.' She bursts TEARS.
ALEXA (CONT'D)
My husband. Bastard. I've
driving days. I don't
know I'm going.
LUKE
Oh, wow. I'm sorry.
She gathers herself, sniffling.
I warm apple kringel
camper. Would like some?
LUKE
Uh, it?
ALEXA
Pastry.
INSIDE RV CAMPER
Luke stands RV's tiny kitchen counter, wolfing pastry
paper plate.
ALEXA
So, "Survival Quest"

LUKE
Yeah. It's try. Kind a'
lame, huh?
ALEXA
No. Seven days
wilderness? I'd afraid.
LUKE
It's I wanted
do.
Luke notices odd pile stuff sink.
ALEXA
His shoes. Fishing lures. The
electric drill.
LUKE
Good.
3.
She smiles, grateful, eyeing torn t-shirt shorts.
ALEXA
You're wet muddy. Why
don't I hang dry?
LUKE
Thanks. I'm okay.
ALEXA
I'm propositioning you.
LUKE
Oh...
Oh, wow.
You are?
He considers, fearful, thrilled.
EXT. LANGFORD UNIVERSITY - MORNING
Students crisscross bikes quadrangle.
The huge round headlights muscular grill old
SEMI-TRUCK RUMBLES curb. It's cab only, like
sliced-off train engine.
Luke hops down, startling friends, KEENAN JANINE,
passionately making sidewalk.
Twenty, brainy athletic, Janine adjusts glasses,
remnant bookish past, thoughtfully considers
Luke's massive truck.
JANINE
It's remarkable. Sort retro. I
thought gettin' pickup?
LUKE
I changed mind.
Hoping enthusiastic response, turns Keenan,
climbs peeks inside cab. He's rugged,
streetwise, perpetually bemused, -maybe Ed Norton Bill
Murray son...
KEENAN

LUKE
Fuck you. You think it's stupid.
