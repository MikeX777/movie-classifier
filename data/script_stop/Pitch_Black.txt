AND SOME "OMITTED" SLUGS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS
SOFT COPY.
NOTE ALSO: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT WAS IN THE NON-

TO PREFORMATTED TEXT FOR THIS SOFT COPY.
Though mentioned script, creatures PITCH BLACK
seldom seen length; rather, glimpsed, heard,
felt. They are, really, embodiment nocturnal fears: A howling
coyote jars awake; painting wall comes life
stared long...the sway bed earthquake
hits. Chimera night. The point reader appreciates
focus finished film creatures do,
creatures reveal inner nature characters.
For PITCH BLACK is, heart, story humanity courage --
lack same.

CUT IN:
INT. MAIN CABIN
A CRYO-LOCKER BLOWS OPEN, spitting out...
CAROLYN FRY. She hits deck main cabin: Four crew
lockers forward section, countless back. But
deck canted sick angle ALARMS SCREAM everywhere:
The world dying her.
Legs wobbly, shivering like flu victim, Fry stumbles
forward locker. It's riddled holes. One DEAD CREWIE
seen fractured plexi, body pocked bloodied. But
cryo-locked...
The CAPTAIN struggling awake. Fry's face floods relief.
Slapping intercom:
FRY
Hear me? Cap'n? Some kinda compromise
hull...holding now, but...Goddamn,
I'm glad you're alive. Gotta pull
E-release...no, red handle, red handle.
I'll warm-ups --
PHFUT-PHFUT-PHFUT-PHFUT: Particles bore cabin,
blasting open captain's chest, shattering plexi, DETONATING
INSTRUMENTS opposite wall leaving CONTRAILS
HISSING air.
Fry lands ass, horrified. Suddenly...
Another LOCKER BLOWS OPEN. A body falls right Fry --
one's alive. Disoriented, frantic:
OWENS
Why I fall you?
FRY
He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I
looking right --
OWENS
I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22
weeks out, gravity wasn't supposed
kick 19. I mean, I mean,
I mean, I fall all?
FRY
You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
OWENS
Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai',
wait. I'm Owens. Right?
They swap nightmare looks, momentarily unsure
identities.
FRY
Cryo-sleep. Swear God, sloughs
brain cells.
INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN
They stumble nav-bay. ALARMS CONTINUE. Fry grabs warm-up
suits storage, pitches Owens, checks screens.
FRY
1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB minute,
shit, we're hemorrhaging air. Somethin'
took swipe us.
OWENS
Just tell we're shipping
lane. Just stars,
bright, beautiful, deep-space....
Owens activates exterior view: A planet rushes us.
That's gravity.
FRY
Jesus God....
EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY
The SHIP PLOWS upper atmosphere, antennae pylons
disintegrating.
INT. PASSAGE TO FLIGHT DECK
Heart battering ribs, Fry runs forward, hand-holds
steady herself. Over headset:
OWENS (V.O.)
They trained this, right? Fry?
FRY?
She doesn't answer.
INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY
Fry harnesses in, starts running switches -- fumbles
times, making mental errors. Finally gets crash-shutters
open reveal...
CLOUD STRATA sweeping past windscreen like floor-lights
dropping elevator. We're shedding big altitude.
INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN
OWENS
... crisis program selected Number Two
shows
oxygen 1,500 --
SHUT THE FUCK UP!
(hammers button,
SILENCES ALARMS)
-- 1,500-millibars pressure
surface-level. Okay, maybe ship
right change....
INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY
As Fry runs switches.
INT. SHIP - DAY
As JETTISON DOORS CLOSE ship.
INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY
As Fry flips security-latch -- thumbs switch below.
EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY
MULTIPLE SHOTS: EXPLOSIVE BOLTS RAPID-FIRE ship's
skin, blowing away non-essentials hinder aerodynamics --
including big deep-space drives. But separation puts
ship dangerous roll.
INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY
Out windscreen, cloud strata roll vertiginously. Fry throws
actuators...
EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY
And airbrakes deploy. She manages kill roll. But
ship's coming nose-high.
INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN
OWENS
...showing major water bodies...maximum
terrain, 220 meters mean surface...
largely cinder gypsum
evaporite deposits....
JETTISON DOORS CLOSE Owens, segregating
passenger compartment. It scares new reason.
OWENS
Fry? What're doing?
INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY
Fry flips new security-latch. INTERCUTTING:
OWENS
Fry?
FRY
Can't nose down...too load
there....
OWENS
You mean "load" passengers?
FRY
So what, too?
Out sheer fucking nobility?
Tortured silence. Fry's thumb moves switch
jettison passenger cabin. Jettison 50 people.
INT. MAIN CABIN
SELECTED SHOTS faces inside cryo-lockers, JOHNS.
He's prime-of-life, badge display, kind cop. Shaken
awake, clears condensation check locker directly
his, finding...
RIDDICK. Small black goggles hide eyes. A metal bit wedged
mouth lends perpetual grimace. A read-out admonishes
"LOCK-OUT PROTOCOL IN EFFECT. ABSOLUTELY NO EARLY
RELEASE."
INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY
OWENS
Look, Fry. Company says we're responsible
--
FRY
Company's here, it?
OWENS
When captain went down, stepped --
like not. Now
train this, --
FRY
And wasn't simulated cockroach
alive 50 clicks simulated
crash site! That's train you!
On fucking simulator!
Owens unbuckles chair.
OWENS
Don't touch switch!
Overcome guilt, Fry retracts thumb mass destruction.
But HUGE JOLT puts thumb right back.
FRY
I'm dying them.
She pushes it. But time...
EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY
No bolts fire. Nothing separates SHIP THAT SCREAMS DOWN
clouds.
INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN
Now why: Owens reopened jettison doors locally --
blocked open.
FRY
Owens!
OWENS
70 seconds! You got 70 seconds
level beast out!
INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY
Seething anger guilt, Fry pops airbrakes, shedding
speed, heat. The ship level -- it's
pounded hellishly. She tries stable view out...
The windscreen. We're breaking cloud-bottoms. There's
glimpse landscape before...
EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY
An airbrake fails. It shears pinwheels into...
INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY
The windscreen. It cracks thousand spiderwebs --
impossibly holds. For now.
OWENS (V.O.)
What shit that?
Sunlight flares fractured edge: It's like looking
burning diamonds, Fry impression
outside world. Now rely on...
A ground-mapping display. 120 meters altitude. And dropping.
INT. CRYO-LOCKER - DAY
INTERCUT Johns. Realizing he's kind shit-storm,
claws safety restraints.
INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY
Ground-mapper: 60 meters. COLLISION ALARMS kick in.
Out fractured windscreen, huge dark mass rise
view. Land.
40 meters...30...20...10....
Fry braces.
IMPACT. The WINDSCREENS IMPLODE. AIR HURRICANES in.
INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN
IMPACT. Chairs rip moorings. Strapped one,
Owens slams ceiling.
INT. MAIN CABIN - DAY
IMPACT. Johns BLOWS OUT locker -- wishes God
would've stayed inside, him...
The hull cracking open.
NIGHTMARE SHOT: A huge section cabin tears free...
skitters CRASHES planetfloor us...and
disintegrates sight. 40 cryo-lockers vanished it.
40 lives.
INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY
Hammered WIND, Fry opens eyes experimentally.
FRY'S POV: A vortex motion, speed, blurring debris.
But ship burrowing in. Burrowing under.
Fry pivots chair 180 degrees nanosecond before...
Dirt avalanches cockpit. It buries CAMERA.
BLACKOUT
INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY
Choking yellow dust. Ghostly silhouettes COUGHING, MOANING,
CALLING OUT survivors English and, surreally,
Arabic. Soon find...
Johns. Ears running blood. Stumbling way to...
Riddick's cryo-locker. Empty. Johns reaches holster.
Gone, torn right belt. No prisoner weapon --
spooky combination. Nearby sees...
The light cutting torch. Someone's open
jammed cryo-locker. The plexi torched away reveal...
AUDREY, 12 years old. Unscathed.
AUDREY
Somethin' went wrong, huh?
Johns searches pistol. Behind him, chained feet
lower FRAME -- attack, swinging Johns' head...
getting chain neck...twisting hard, chain
choke-collar. Johns flicks open baton, swings at...
Riddick. Still body chains mouth-bit. Clinging
ceiling support. Riding baton blows.
Seconds blacking out, Johns strains forward...forward...and
finally breaks Riddick's grip support. He keeps hold
chained feet that...
Riddick SLAMS HEADFIRST deck. Johns lays baton
neck.
JOHNS
One chance blew it, Riddick.
Never cease disappoint me.
INT. FLIGHT DECK - CRASH SHIP - DAY
Darkness. A light beam sweeps dusty air cockpit.
It's packed dirt, signs life. About search
elsewhere, Johns turns at...
FRY (O.S.)
Hey.
JOHNS
Hey, who?
FRY (O.S.)
Hey, me. Over here.
His light finds headrest sticking dirt. Johns
crawls closer, checks headrest finds
her. Fry. Buried gills.
JOHNS
Amazing. I'm Johns.
FRY
Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...
He manages smile starts digging out. Almost dreading
ask:
FRY
Are others, Johns?
INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY
Johns helps Fry carnage. She's stunned --
especially blast sunlight hull be.
Realizing she's nav-bay, Fry starts digging like search dog
uncover...
Owens. Still strapped chair. Metal rod piercing
chest close heart. Dead. Fry reaches touch him.
OWENS
Out, out, out, GET IT OUTTA ME!
She recoils hard. He's alive. The survivors bungle
over. Ten seconds pure chaos:
VOICES
Pull him...No, it's close
heart...You gotta it,
fast....
Fry grabs rod.
OWENS
Don't touch it! Don't touch switch!
VOICES
You'll kill him, I'm tellin' you, shit,
leave alone...delirious...doncha
got drugs poor man....
OWENS
Don't touch switch!
FRY
Awright, awright, someone...there's
Anestaphine med-lock, end
cabin...next to....
But "that end." In exquisite pain, Owens
screams on. REACTION SHOTS Johns, Audrey. Seldom human
beings witness raw suffering.
FRY
Get away. Everybody.
The leave -- Audrey, staying watch
morbid fascination. Johns doubles collars her.
Leaving, pass...
Riddick, cuffed bulkhead. His eyes, hidden
goggles, track Johns Audrey daylight.
EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY
The survivors straggle outside. CAMERA SURVEYS new faces:
ZEKE SHAZZA. Male-female team bushwhackers, partners
life. Shazza tough sexiness. Zeke's face shows aboriginal
blood. (30s.)
PARIS. Overfed, overgroomed. A puff pastry man. (40s
50s.)
Four male "Chrislams": The pillar-steady IMAM (50ish),
THREE PILGRIMS, young excitable (late-teens). (NOTE: The
Chrislams represent union Christianity Islam. They
iconography Christians physical look Arab
Muslims.)
WIDE SHOT: All stark unforgiving terrain.
The valley floor relieved low hills side,
spiked earthen spires. Scorching
suns -- red, yellow.
PARIS
Well. Our little slice heaven.
The Chrislams fall knees. Confusion try
orient themselves.
IMAM
Please...which way New Mecca? We
know direction order pray.
North? South? East? West? Nobody knows. Johns snaps open
compass, finds needle swaying rudderlessly. The SCREAMING
inside ship finally ends.
INT. CRASH SHIP - DAY
As Fry holds Owens, dead.
EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY
The Chrislams devised way pray: Backs together,
faces different compass point.
EXT. TOP OF CRASH SHIP - DAY
Fry climbs ship. Johns Paris, Zeke, Shazza,
Audrey here.
JOHNS
Big talk scouting party...
Fry sees huge smoldering scar ground ship.
One glance confirms survivors.
JOHNS (CONT'D)

PARIS
Anyone having breathing problems?
Aside me?
AUDREY
Like I ran, something....
SHAZZA
Feel lung short. All us.
PARIS
Well, I tend asthmatic. And

Faces turn Fry: They're looking answers.
FRY
It's atmosphere. Too pressure,
oxygen. Might days
--
ZEKE
So bloody hell happened, anyways?
FRY
Somethin' knocked off-lane. Maybe
rogue comet. Maybe we'll know.
SHAZZA
Well, I one, thoroughly fucking
grateful. This beast wasn't land
like this. But cripes, rode down.
(to others)
C'mon, lousy ingrates, reason

Others CHIME AGREEMENT, laying thankful hands Fry's shoulders.
HOLD Fry, face betraying anoint
savior.
INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY
Breaking pressure suits:
FRY
Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start
ripping out. Quick hits -- try

AUDREY
Well, coming us? Or
gonna die exposure
dehydration sunstroke maybe

(off looks)
Hey, don't worry scaring

SHAZZA
We're worried you'll scare us.
(ushering away)
Name's "Audrey," right, love? And you're

AUDREY
Yeah, but...do food

ZEKE
(to Fry)

Fry blinks. "They actually think I'm captain." Zeke

problem. Riddick.
FRY
And him?
JOHNS
Big Evil?
FRY
We locked forever?
JOHNS
Be choice. Already escaped
max-slam facility --
FRY
I don't need life story. Is
dangerous?
JOHNS
Only humans.
Riddick mouth hull, virtually licking metal.
Fry moves closer -- sees sheeting hull.
FRY
Oh, Christ....
They're losing water. Suddenly Fry running, snatching
emergency light, climbing wall-rungs...
INT. MACHINE LEVEL - CRASH SHIP - DAY
And crawling dusty superstructure reach water

Well? Is pump?
FRY
Ask cargo!
Anything drink!
INT. CARGO HOLD - DAY
Oversize DOORS RUMBLE open. Fry, Johns, Paris climb

A toast said.
PARIS
I'll need receipt that.
(to Fry)
For these.
FRY
Top list.
She joins Johns drink. Entering, Chrislams watch
envy aversion.
FRY
I don't suppose....
IMAM
One Christian habits didn't
adopt -- unfortunately. We'll
wait.
JOHNS
For what? There water. You
understand that, don't you?
IMAM
All deserts water, somewhere. God
shall lead there.
INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY
START cutting torch, abandoned wreckage. Staring
is...
Riddick. With hands cuffed bulkhead,
can't near it. Or he? Near ceiling, bulkhead
fractured -- slim spot maybe chains pass through.
Riddick stands. With GRUESOME POPPING, dislocates
shoulders...carries arms overhead...passes chains
broken spot...and brings arms him. A
body-flex POPS HIS SHOULDERS joint.
Free, reaches cutting torch.
EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY
Pistol hand, Johns runs BIG CLOSEUP, eyes sweeping.
Nothing horizon. But lies ground nearby.
It's Riddick's mouth-bit.

PARIS
Well, what's need, anyway? If he's

JOHNS
First, live
long -- he's gonna come
got. Second, sheer
thrill kill.
A beat. They grab weapons.
EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY
Johns stands atop crash ship, scanning scope. He
fixates on...
A blue glow horizon. "What hell it?"
Zeke Shazza modify breather units, adding straps tubing
ball-floats. The prototype tested Audrey. She sucks
mouthpiece -- finds works, supplying oxygen
demand constant flow.
Chrislams convert traditional bedouin head-gear, readying
travel.
Fry finishes wrapping Owens' body. She looks yellow sun,
low horizon. The red sun inclined follow.
FRY
Imam. We leave soon. Before
nightfall it's cooler.
ZEKE
What, you're goin' off, too?
FRY
Johns leaving gun. Just

setting.
SHAZZA
My bloody oath....
AUDREY
Three suns?
ZEKE
(to Fry)
So nightfall.
PARIS
So cocktail hour.
IMAM
We good sign -- path,
direction God.
Johns swings ship.
JOHNS
A good sign.
(re: blue sun)
That's Riddick's direction. You
wanna caught dark guy.
FRY
Thought restraints
there. Toward sunset.
JOHNS
(nodding)
Which means went sunrise.
EXT. PLANET - DAY
Trekking, Chrislams waft incense pots CHANT FROM
THE KORAN head blue star. Johns provides
shotgun escort; Fry carries Paris' second war-pick shoulder.
Silhouetted alien sky, scouting party odd,
odd sight.
Already sun-battered, Johns crafts eye-visor plexi.
Fry tries wrap head like Chrislams. Imam helps.
FRY
So quiet. You sounds
ship, then....
IMAM
You know Muhammad was?
FRY
Some prophet guy?
IMAM
"Some prophet guy." And city man. But
travel desert --
quiet -- hear words
God.
FRY
You pilgrimage? To New Mecca?
IMAM
(nodding)
Chrislam teaches
lifetime great hajj --
great pilgrimage. To know God, better,
yes, know well.
FRY
Frightening thought.
IMAM
(finishes wrapping her)
We're hajj now.
Fry notices Johns scope-locked something.
FRY
What?
JOHNS
(hands scope)
Tell it's mirage.
SCOPE POV: Beyond distant rise, strange branches.
FRY
Trees?
EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY
Paris taken look-out atop ship. He deals
heat erecting "misting" umbrella: He fills reservoir
liquor, dials regulator. Umbrella spars shoot bursts
cooling alcohol vapor. Paris luxuriates it.
ZEKE (O.S.)
Comfy there?
Zeke appears below. He loads scrap-metal sled tarp,
cable, pick-ax.
PARIS
Amazing
essentials life -- long
luxuries.
ZEKE
Well, bloody-fuckin' eyes
open. Don't want ratbag sneakin'
bloody-fuckin' arse.
He drags sled spired hills. Keeping eye
Zeke, Paris eases chair, lays war-pick lap,
pours spot sherry. As sips, blade touches
throat.
AUDREY
He'd probably right here, right
jaw. And you'd hear
coming. That's good Riddick is.
Paris eases hunting boomerang away.
PARIS
Now run away parents?
Or run away you?
EXT. BONEYARD OVERLOOK - DAY
The scouting party approaches rise. The trees loom beyond.
PILGRIMS
Allahu Akbar...Allahu Akbar....
The young pilgrims break excited run, anticipating
oasis. But Fry hangs back, taking harder look trees.
They don't wind.
The pilgrims scramble rise -- motionless. Fry,
Johns Imam catch behold...
The "trees" actually dorsal bones titanic skeleton,
tinted green lichen. Beyond sea bleached animal
bones. Impossibly, bones MOAN IN PAIN. All told,
it's like Hell overflowed right here.
FRY
Is planet dead?
A pilgrim questions Imam IN ARABIC.
IMAM
He asks killed
great things...
EXT. BONEYARD - DAY
Moving boneyard:
IMAM
Some...communal graveyard, perhaps...
like elephants Earth....
Fry touches towering bones. It shows cut-marks --
bone hacked sword. "Graveyard? Or
killing field?"
JOHNS
Long time ago. Whatever happened.
EXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY
Pilgrim #1 reaches huge skull laced baleen-like combing.
Wind hitting comb makes LOW HARMONIC MOANING. By
moving hand comb, pilgrim "play" DIRGELIKE
MUSIC. Wanting trick:
PILGRIM #1
Ah....
He looks Pilgrim #3 can't spot him. And turns
skull -- face staring combing. But
it's only...
INT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY
Pilgrim #3, inside skull. Johns enters chases out.
About leave, Johns notices...
Bone-chippings piled ground. It nothing,
still...
Johns double-checks shadows, probing muzzle
shotgun. Satisfied, Johns exits. Now BOOM UP reveal...
Riddick. Hidden sinus cavity.
EXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY
Trailing others, Fry pauses change O2
breather.
INT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY
Riddick drops ground. His arms hands pierced
shards boneyard ivory -- fashionable little body talons.
Spotting shadow combing, draws closer. And sees Fry.
Alone.
EXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY
Johns doubles Fry. He takes hit scotch, offers
some.
FRY
Probably makes worse. Dehydrates
more.
JOHNS
Probably right.
They drink anyway. Moving sun, Fry leans
combing. It brings arm's length of...
INT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY
Riddick. He pulls bone-shiv, freshly chiseled.
JOHNS (O.S.)
You know, I woulda played road dog
guys. You could've stayed back.
Pro'bly should've -- because, know,
don't water....
"We back."
FRY (O.S.)
No, no, I wanted away.
JOHNS (O.S.)
So I noticed. Never seen "captain"
ready leave ship.
Just Riddick eases blade Fry's neck...
EXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY
She steps away.
FRY
Better moving....
JOHNS
What'd Owens mean? 'Bout touching
switch?
Fry searches eyes, wondering trust --
leans combing. We actually Riddick
now. They too, TURN THE FUCK AROUND!
JOHNS (CONT'D)
Hey. You tell me, Carolyn.
FRY
Promise me. Swear won't --
JOHNS
You anybody here? Just
me.
FRY
During landing...when things
worst...Owens best.
He's wouldn't let pilot
dump passenger cabin.
Johns blinks, stunned. "Are shittin' me?"
INT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY
Trying again, Riddick reaches shiv -- deftly
slices Fry's hair. A locket. A souvenir. That's
wanted.
FRY (O.S.)
So know.
JOHNS (O.S.)
Fuck. Guess I'm glad
I thought.
Riddick watches -- looks scotch bottle,
left behind. It's got good swallow.
EXT. START OF GAUNTLET - DAY
Leaving boneyard, scouting party reaches cleft
hills. Ahead canyon.
JOHNS
Hold up.
He jumps rock, puts scope eye.
JOHNS (CONT'D)
Didn't bite.
FRY
What?
JOHNS
Thought coolin'
boneyard -- double-back
ship slip us. So I left
bottle bait.
SCOPE POV: PANNING boneyard. FINDING bottle. It's
got swallow.
JOHNS (CONT'D)
But nah. Didn't bite.
EXT. BONEYARD - DAY
CLOSER bottle. Only scotch
emptied -- replaced sand.
EXT. GRAVE SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY
Working shade tarp, Zeke digs communal grave.
Three wrapped corpses wait nearby. He keeps sight-line on...
The crash ship. Shazza waves. Zeke waves back.
EXT. RIBCAGE - THE GAUNTLET - DAY
The scouting party transits narrowing canyon. Lined rib
bones, makes feel like we're belly beast.
Fry squints ridgetops. More spires visible
canyon rims, looming like silent sentinels. "What
they? Just mineral deposits?"
PILGRIM #1
Captain...captain....
The Chrislams appears small desert plant.
Leathery petals spread wide, revealing round stringy core.
ARABIC DISCUSSION. Desert fruit? Is edible?
FRY
Wait, wait, wait....
Fry takes "plant," pushes "petals"
core. They stare. It's baseball.
IMAM
We here, yes?
They look ahead, wondering awaits them. But Johns
looking back.
JOHNS
Never thought were.
EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY
HIGH ANGLE: An old WEATHER COCK CREAKS wind. Fry,
Johns, Chrislams enter FRAME far below.
PILGRIM #1
Assalamoo ahlaykum!
The GREETING ECHOES settlement, built stacked
shipping containers. Tattered sun-shades flap wind. A
rusty bike lies ground.
PILGRIM #2
Assalamoo ahlaykum!
JOHNS
Long gone. Whoever were.
They building -- pull short. Before
looms moisture-recovery unit, hulking machine disrepair.
Old jugs litter ground.
IMAM
Water...water here....
PILGRIMS
Allahu Akbar....
IMAM
(translating)
"God Great," yes?
JOHNS
I'm born-again.
Fry manages weary smile -- soon eyes revisit
abandoned buildings. "Who people? Why
leave behind?"
INT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY
Through window, Johns Chrislams crawling
moisture-recovery unit, assessing repairs. PULL BACK
include Fry inside settlement, inspecting...
Refectory table. Place settings out. Years dust.
Photos wall: Settlers working modest gardens. Playing
baseball. Posing children.
INT. LIVING QUARTERS - SETTLEMENT - DAY
Fry enters dark room.
FRY
Lights.
No response command. She pats old-style wall
switches. Nothing. Perceiving black-out blinds window,
throws open reveal...
A man standing right outside.
JOHNS
(through window)
Hey. Don't far, huh?
Fry nods. Johns smiles, leaves. Just heart settles,
SOMETHING CREAKS her.
It's orrery, mechanical device shows motion
planets suns. Solar powered, orrery starts
turning, CREAKING. One planet sunlight.
FRY
No darkness. No lights
darkness....
EXT. PORCH - SETTLEMENT - DAY
Fry reaches porch. It looks rear
settlement unforgiving terrain. She starts
inside -- glints edge vision. Fry
turns back...parts clothes laundry line...and sees
source glint.
Excited hits breather.
Fry vaults porch -- starts walking magnetic
bearing. Soon she's running.
EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY
FRY (V.O.)
Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar!
Johns Chrislams trade looks.
EXT. SKIFF - DAY
FRY
Allahu Akbar!
Fry stops groomed runway, breath. The catch
up. They marvel at...
The skiff, light-duty vehicle hybrid technology -- bush
plane, space craft. Its fabric wings wind-torn --
hull looks intact.
EXT. TOP OF CRASH SHIP - DAY
CLOSE caviar added toast-points.
A SCRABBLING SOUND stops Paris mid-bite. He eases
rocker, moves rear edge ship looks on...
A shadow ducking him. Small rocks trickle
dirt rampart climbed by...someone.
PARIS
This qualifies worst fun I've
had. Stop it.

feel it, sometimes, pressing
cord.
(giving hands back)
So maybe care feeding
nerve-endings business.
FRY
You coulda helped. And didn't.
O.S., hear Chrislams JABBERING ARABIC calling
"Captain, Captain...."
JOHNS
Yeah, well, look thine ass first.
Right, "captain"?
It cuts deep.
EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

They turn rim giant planet. It's cresting

EXT. RIBCAGE - THE GAUNTLET - DAY
The sand-cat storms canyon. As passes
massive ribcage...
The ROLL CAGE SMASHES OUT low-bridge bones.
EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY
The sand-cat reaches crash ship. Bodies leap off. Paris
steals look at...
The rising planet. It threatens blot suns, sky, universe.
INT. BATTERY BAY - CRASH SHIP - DAY
Johns yanks power cell starts dragging

The Chrislams lash scrap-metal sled sand-cat.
Riddick drops cell sled, Johns second.
They're racing eclipse other.
EXT. SKY - DAY TO DUSK
As rings planet eclipse yellow sun.
EXT. CRASH SHIP - DUSK

FRY
Don't stop, don't stop....
But Paris can't help himself. He squints see...
EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DUSK
The spires. THE SOUND come there.
EXT. SKY - DUSK
As rings eclipse red sun.
EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK
A second darkness sweeps survivors. Now stop,

EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DEEP DUSK
Something pouring spire-tops. Backlit coronal light,

nightfall.
EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK
JOHNS
Jesus, there....
They coming, filling sky waves. Mercifully,

FRY
Cargo hold, cargo hold.

They run. Reach cargo hold. Turn see...
Riddick Shazza coming. Hearing SQUEALING WAVE
descending them...
Riddick Shazza hit dirt. Hatchlings torrent
inches overhead.
CLOSE Shazza. Horrified. Hard breathe. Like
underwater.
CLOSE Riddick. He watches awe, frightened
kid lying looking stars. Experimenting,
eases bone-shiv hatchlings. Instantly it's whittled
nothing. It's like river razor blades.
The hatchling coming. Shazza whips panicky look
cargo hold. Can it? Should try?
AUDREY
Tell stay there. Stay down.
SHAZZA, JUST STAY DOWN!
Shazza starts worming cargo hold. Suddenly
hatchings vanish. A beat. Is safe? Shazza gets
feet...
FRY
No, no, NO, NO, NO....
...and wave back, enveloping Shazza.
INT./EXT. CARGO HOLD - DEEP DUSK
Standing mouth cargo container,
glimpse Shazza flies doors, caught
funnel-cloud hatchlings. Then she's simply gone.
EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK
Still ground, Riddick checks left right like

The spires crumbling, torn within.
EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK
Reaching cargo hold, Riddick turns look.
PUSH IN sheds goggles -- looks world

RIDDICK'S POV: In degraded image, predators -- adult
hatchlings -- emerge spires. They're large, mammalian,
hammer-headed. They CLICK echo-location, sounding
world haven't inhabited 60 years.
FRY
What it? What's happening?
RIDDICK'S POV: The predators launch hills, gliding,
SOUNDING, searching.
RIDDICK
Like I said. Ain't gotta worry
about.
EXT. SKY - DEEP DUSK TO NIGHT
The rim planet overtakes suns. The world goes dark.
INT. CARGO HOLD - NIGHT
Vault-like DOORS BOOM CLOSED.
The survivors locked inside secure ship.
Somehow they've reduced neanderthals huddling

JOHNS
Well, I don't want jump conclusions

FRY
(agreeing)
I saw cut-marks bones. Wasn't
natural die-off.
IMAM
Quiet, please. Everyone.
Imam listening cargo door. The pile
alongside, ears tuned like radar. CLICKING SWEEPS PAST outside.
AUDREY
(whispering)
Why that? Make sound?
IMAM
Perhaps way see. With sound,
reflecting back.
FRY
(realizing)
Echo-location. That's is....
Now MORE CLICKING -- them. Lights whip find...
Nothing. Only door open container halfway

A volley looks. "How fuck here?"
FRY
Breach hull. I dunno.
More CLICKING. Johns realizes expect check out.
JOHNS
I'd piss glass.
RIDDICK
Well, got big gauge.
JOHNS
Wanna rag fat mouth?
AUDREY
Maybe it's beads again. Imam,

IMAM
No, no, no, I believe --
JOHNS
C'mon, man, you're drivin' everybody

More CLICKING -- sound TOPPLING CARGO.
RIDDICK
Big beads.
Butching up, Johns sucks breather shimmies toward...
The open container. Leading shotgun, FIRES blindly

head light door spot...
Hatchlings ground, blasted dog food.
JOHNS
(to others)
Okay. We're okay. Just small ones
musta --
Something WHOOSHES head, swinging like scythe. It
catches shotgun, DISCHARGING IT, giving us...
A flash-image adult predator. Up close.
In second, Johns others.
JOHNS
Very big beads.
PARIS

INT. FIRST CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT
Imam shepherds container. The door slams closed.
At first, sound MOUTHS SUCKING BREATHERS. Then
SCRATCHING.
Johns fumbles cutting torch. Gets burning. Adjusts

The door. Scythe-like blades probing joints. Suddenly HEAVY
BLOWS drive back.
RIDDICK

Can sumpin' that?
'Sides holding fucking face?
Taking hint, Johns starts cutting common wall

INT. FIFTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT
Inside fifth container now, Johns torches away. Fry
Paris use cargo block entrance hole -- block

Riddick adds weight -- notices pepper-shot
cargo. Suspecting worst, leaves behind...
PARIS
Hello, hello?
...and moves container darkness
prevails. Something SQUISHES underfoot. He slips goggles.
RIDDICK'S POV: Of dead hatchlings floor. This
open container, Johns predators.
Sensing energy, Riddick lifts face.
RIDDICK'S POV: Of adolescent predator. It squats atop cargo,
eating hatchling. A heavy bone-blade crowns skull.
Sensing Riddick, sweeps area INQUISITIVE CLICKS.
PREDATOR POV: Of Riddick.
(NOTE: The PREDATOR POV crude image gives impression
detail. We're "seeing" predator hears
echo-location. Think sonagram strobes wraps
subject 3-D space.)
Oblivious, kick new escape hatch. Audrey,
Fry, Johns worm through. Imam Pilgrim #2 hang back.
"Where's Riddick?"
He's stare-down predator.
Searching, Pilgrim #2 rounds corner -- finds head
caught vice-like grip.
RIDDICK
Don't. Move.
RIDDICK'S POV: As second predator appears them. This
reaches scythe blade...
And gently probes men. It wants know they're

CLOSE pilgrim's shoes. Over-running piss.
More blades descend, moving like surgical instruments.
One test-slices Riddick's shirt.
INT. SIXTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT
In container, Fry waits anxiously. Hissing

FRY

FRY (O.S.)
Riddick?
TIGHT pilgrim -- scared clicking

RIDDICK
No....
The predators him, blurs dark. DEATH-SCREAM.
RIDDICK'S POV: A predator appears him.
Making move, Riddick darts cargo heads
escape hatch as...
Fry's light catches square face. Blinded, Riddick
HOWLS stumbles forward. Fry's light leaps deeper hit...
The predator right him. With similar reaction,
beast HOWLS flails back.
HOLD Fry time-stopped moment. What stopped it? Was
her? Suddenly SHOTGUN EXPLODES head. Jacked
up, Johns BLASTING shadows.
FRY
Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!
JOHNS
'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
They look. "Sure did." Suddenly CARCASS SLAMS
floor, sending jumping perfect splash-
pattern. "Christ, kill one."
Fry reclaims dropped light beams carcass.
Wherever light strikes it, flesh chars steams.
FRY
There....
PARIS
Like light scalding it.
FRY
It hurts them. Light actually hurts
them....
VULTURE SOUNDS O.S. adolescents, fighting
scraps pilgrim.
IMAM
Is that...Hasan?
Riddick nods.
JOHNS
We'll burn candle later. C'mon.
INT. SIXTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT
Cargo shoved door walls. The survivors
gather Fry's handlight. Audrey -- tough little Audrey --
reduced shivering lump mush.
FRY
...one cutting torch...one handlight here,

PARIS
Spirits. Anything 45 proof burns
well.
FRY
How bottles?
PARIS
Not sure. Ten?
FRY
Those umbrellas, ones mist.
Would burn?
(reading face)
If got receipt?
PARIS
Possibly.
FRY
Awright. So maybe we'll light.
JOHNS
Enough what?
Now challenges mind-reader.
JOHNS (CONT'D)
Oh, lady. If you're right mind,
I pray insane.
FRY
(to others)
We stick plan. If
cells skiff, we're
rock.
PARIS
I hate kill beautiful theory
ugly fact, sand-cat won't run
night.
FRY
We'll carry cells...drag
them...whatever takes.
Troubled faces. Is imagination? Or light
floor growing dimmer?
AUDREY
You mean...tonight? With things
there?
PARIS
Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like hoot.
JOHNS
Back up. How long last? Few
minutes? Couple hours?
No knows sure.
IMAM
I impression...from model...
planets moving one.
That be...a lasting darkness.
JOHNS
Those suns gotta come sometime. And
animals phobic
light, sit tight till then.
FRY
I'm sure that's said.
Locked inside coring room.
A persuasive thought. Eyes swing Audrey.
JOHNS
Look, gotta think --
kid especially. How scared
gonna there?
FRY
Oh, don't use like that, smoke
screen.
JOHNS
Smoke screen what?
FRY
For fear.
JOHNS
(eyes narrowing)
Hey. Why don't rag hole

plan doesn't involve MASS SUICIDE?
Two seconds pass.
FRY
How weigh, Johns?
JOHNS
What hell's matter?
FRY
How much?
JOHNS
79 kilos.
FRY
Because you're 79 kilos gutless white
meat, that's can't come
better plan.
He makes her. Riddick blocks. Johns' shotgun bumps
underside Riddick's chin.
RIDDICK
Think reward, Johns.
JOHNS
I'm willing cut pay.
RIDDICK
How 'bout cut gut?
Johns looks down. CAMERA DROPS reveal shiv Riddick holds,
poised evisceration.
JOHNS
Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.
IMAM
Please...this solves nothing...please....
Johns backs first. The light grows dimmer.
FRY
(to Audrey)
They're afraid light. That means
don't afraid them.
IMAM
And you're certain way
back? Even dark?
FRY
No, I'm not. But can.
She's pointing, course, Riddick.
EXT. PLANET - NIGHT
The eclipsing planet dominates half sky. In coronal
light remains, clouds forming.
EXT. CRASH SHIP - NIGHT
Cargo doors crack open. Mixed maximum flame, cutter
pushed outside swept around. Fry appears it.
Moving like hostages, survivors cross open ground, trying
heed PRIMAL SOUNDS light. Soon reach...
The main cabin. Blackness inside.
FRY
Riddick.
He lifts goggles.
RIDDICK'S POV: Checking cabin. Finding lot wreckage

RIDDICK
Looks clear.
Johns shoulders ahead crawls first. Just stands
inside...
A PREDATOR BUZZSAWS head, fleeing cabin, taking
night.
JOHNS
Fuck me. You said "clear."
RIDDICK
Said "looks clear."
JOHNS
Well, what's look like now?
RIDDICK
(rechecking)
Looks clear.
FRY
Just goddamn lights on....
They scramble aboard. Riddick TONGUE-CLICKS Johns.
He isn't amused.
INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - NIGHT
PREP MONTAGE: We survivors powering cabin lights...

cord Paris' misting umbrellas, filling reservoirs
high-octane liquor...swapping O2 canisters.
INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - NIGHT
Reloading shotgun, Johns finds shaking again. He
unpockets shell -- red morphine shell -- gives
lover's look. Behind him...
FRY
Ready, Johns.
He palms shell.
JOHNS
He'll lead cliff.
You know that, don't you?
FRY
We're burnin' light here.
JOHNS
You cells ship --
leave you. He leave

FRY
I don't it, Johns. What goddamn
valuable life you're worried
losing? Huh? Is
all? Besides hype?
(no response)
Got right scared. Neither

INT. BATTERY BAY - CRASH SHIP - NIGHT
As hands yank power cell.
INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - NIGHT
Cabin lights die. Still brooding, Johns finishes loading
shotgun dark.
EXT. CRASH SHIP - NIGHT
CLOSE burning wick. Alcohol mist shoots flame
create...
A FIREBALL. Two umbrella torches, fabric burned away,
BELCH FIREBALLS night. By light more, see...
Imam chained harness drag-sled. Beside

chains. The hands belong to...
Riddick. Both men recognize irony prisoner helping
captor chains.
FRY
(to all)
Keep light going. That's
live this. Just
light burning.
Riddick loops handlight neck, places shine light
back. A beacon.
RIDDICK
(to Fry)
Be runnin' 10 paces ahead. I want
light -- eyes.
And check cuts. These things know
blood now.
CLOSE Audrey. Overhearing, goes stone-faced.
FRY
Riddick...was thinkin'

RIDDICK
(shaking head)
Had deals.
FRY
But I wanted --
RIDDICK
Nobody's gonna turn murderer loose.
I fuckin' knew better.
It worries Fry. "If doesn't expect free...."
RIDDICK (CONT'D)
Been long time anyone's trusted
me. That's somethin' right there.
FRY
We can, can't we? Trust you?
RIDDICK
Actually...
(completely genuine)
That's I askin' myself.
He walks away. HOLD Fry -- wondering hasn't

CLOSE Fry. Looking down. Noting sand-cat tracks underfoot.
EXT. NIGHT
Below run survivors. CRANE UP AND AWAY
lights insignificant...so include, FOREGROUND,
silhouettes gliding predators. They're following
above, awaiting chance.
EXT. NIGHT
FRY'S POV: Of ground. The sand-cat tracks vanished.
JOHNS
So noticed too?
FRY

RIDDICK
Saw I didn't like.
JOHNS
Such as.
RIDDICK
Hard tell, sometimes...even me...

Paris looks shoulder. "We went what?" Nearby
CLICKING breaks confrontation.
FRY
Let's move.
(to Audrey)
Just detour. He'll there.
PARIS
Can switch?
FRY
What, switch what?
PARIS
I think I twisted ankle running
backwards like that. And I'm sure I

(off stares)
Okay, that's lie. I don't want

PARIS
Oh, I'm disposable?
FRY
I'll switch, I'll switch! Christ,

EXT. NIGHT
They trundle on, Fry new tail-gunner.
At guard, Paris relaxes bit -- CLICKING
far earshot. A weak FIREBALL SPEWS
torch. He checks reservoir. Almost empty.
PARIS
Light, please, need light here....
Still moving, Johns Imam train lights Paris
refuels. For brief moment, Audrey strays light.
PREDATOR'S POV: Dive-bombing girl.
A HIGH-VELOCITY CLICKING: It's like incoming missile. Imam
lunges nanosecond...
And flattens Audrey ground. Scythe blades swing...
CHINKING harness-chains Imam's back.
Johns whirls, BLASTS. Light-beams leap around. But predator
long gone.
IMAM
(trembling)
Please...have cut? Can
tell if....
He finds dropped light, thumbs switch again.
Broken.
In confusion, Paris left dark. Something
slashes behind. It's like night claws.
PARIS
Oh, sweet Jesus....
The bottle drops.
The blood flows.
The CLICKING STOPS.
PARIS
Oh, sweet Jesus, WILL YOU GET ME SOME
LIGHT OVER HERE!
Faces whip around. But lights rescue him...
Paris gone, snatched away swooping blur.
Light-beams jump fitfully, vainly.
RIDDICK'S POV: Of predators feasting Paris. Carrying
youngling back, female predator arrives late can't
place trough. With shocking apathy, whips
youngling begins devouring it. Other predators
start in-fighting, killing food. POV PANS

AUDREY
Four fulls, half. That mean we're

Good question. They've blindly following...
The light Riddick's back.

spotting...
A sled-track. In them.
Fry hears SHOTGUN RATCHET. She spins see...
Johns chains. Moving forward. Jamming shotgun

JOHNS
During crash, --
FRY
(a warning growl)
This help us, Johns.
JOHNS
-- tried blow fucking
passenger cabin, tried kill --
FRY
Just shut up, okay?
JOHNS
-- tried kill sleep. Paris

walking ghosts her.
FRY
Would RAG YOUR STUPID HOLE!
She rushes him, ready rip eyes out. He shunts aside.
JOHNS
We're alive -- we're

He swung belt -- connected. Fry's chin quakes,
knees fail. The undertow events finally pulls down.
FRY
We there....
JOHNS
(lording)
How weigh right now, Fry? Huh?
IMAM
(pushing back)
Fine, fine, you've point. We
scared you.
Johns snatches light away Imam.
JOHNS
(to all)
Verdict's in. The light moves forward.
EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT
They trudge on, slower now, building reserves canyon-run.
At rear-point, Fry follows like broken rudder. Pilgrim #1
draws sled Imam. And ahead...
EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT
Johns falls step Riddick.
JOHNS
Ain't gonna it.
RIDDICK
Just realized that, huh?

Riddick stares. "I'm listening."
EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT
AUDREY
What're doin' there?
IMAM
Talking canyon, I suppose.
How through.
Overhearing, Fry looks. It's odd Johns Riddick
walking side, like equals. Like partners.
EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT
JOHNS
Look, it's hellified stuff --
different battlefield doctors
decide lives
dies. It's called "triage," okay?
RIDDICK
Kept calling "murder" I it.
JOHNS
Either way, figure it's
grab onto.
RIDDICK
(doping out)
Sacrifice play. Hack body, leave

JOHNS
Trawl it. There's cable

RIDDICK
Nice embellishment.
JOHNS
Don't wanna feed land-sharks --

RIDDICK
(looking back)
So caught eye?
JOHNS
Don' look, don' look, don' look....
EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT
Fry spots Riddick's look -- Johns' non-look.
FRY

(shakes head)
Just wonderin' don't need bigger
piece chum.
JOHNS
Like who, Mr. Chrislam?
EXTREMELY TIGHT men: In eyes, new
partnership splintering apart: "Like Mr. Johns."
Riddick makes play shotgun. It BLASTS skyward.
EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT
As fight erupts:
FRY
Bring light!
AUDREY
What're doing? What're --
FRY
Leave sled, let's go, go, go!
EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT
FIGHT SCENE: Johns' light hits ground, creating arena
illumination. FAST CLICKING nearby. Still struggling, Riddick
Johns manage gang-aim shotgun BLAST THE
CLICKING AWAY.
The shotgun goes free. Johns lunges it, Riddick kicks

RIDDICK
Gotta stay light, Johns. That's
rule.
Johns circles inside light. Fucking him, Riddick starts
poking jabbing, backing wail dark.
Johns stumbles something. A bone. A club.
Riddick finds bone-club, like
cavemen. Riddick beats Johns' club-hand, breaking fingers,
forcing drop bone. Just trying away now, Johns
