WADE
Don't word. I didn't hit

Horner sits wheel. Lillian silently stares Wade
down, gets car Jill. The automatic locks
latch Audi drives away. Its taillights merge
vanishing traffic.
Wade looks down, picks Horner's dark green Tyrolean hat,
examines it, unsure function.

Straight statue, Wade holds traffic. Cars trucks

woman's voice yells, "Whitehouse, 'ain't got day!"
Wade, daydreaming, oblivious commotion. Oblivious --
plum contrary.
A shiny black BMW approaches, speeding, passing traffic
shoulder. A man woman fur coat sit front,
children back. Whitehouse waves stop.
The BMW accelerates intersection, ignoring Wade

Twombley. They're alone.
JACK
Safety on?
Twombley nods, slips, thumps ground. His rifle lands
silently.
Jack sprints over, helps up, safety latches
Winchester. Hands back.
TWOMBLEY

Want know I think happened?
Wade opens glove compartment, finds bottle Canadian
Club. He unscrews cap.
WADE
Find everywhere.
(swigs)
ROLFE
I think response
Twombley shooting correct
one.
WADE
Which is?
ROLFE
That wasn't accident.
WADE
Then shot him?
ROLFE
Well, friend, I think. Jack
Hewitt.
WADE
Motive. You gotta motive.
ROLFE
Money.
WADE
Who'd pay kind money?
Not mob. They got guys.
Specialists.
ROLFE
(agreeing)
They wouldn't deal guy like
Jack. Who benefits Twombley
suddenly dead?
WADE
(swigs)
I don't know. You tell me.
ROLFE
Okay. It's likely people
union don't want Twombley
testify. They probably include
son-in-law who's vice-president
probably
president. I read papers.
What's name, Mel Gordon?
WADE
Yeah, guy BMW I told
about. I did, didn't I?
ROLFE
Here's theory. Twombley, unaware
illegal union loans whatever,
starts nosing cause
investigation finds out. Finds
son-in-law involved.
WADE
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want
professional hit. That'd
feds dig deeper. He wants accident.
ROLFE
A hunting accident perfect.
WADE
Shit, here, shoot somebody
woods,
accident, fined bucks
hunting license lifted.
Jack's probably saying guy shot
cause ain't got deer
don't want license pulled.
The truck sputters, stops. Wade pulls keys.
WADE
It's neat. Things ain't
neat. It makes mad. That somebody
pay kill somebody,
father-in-law, punished
it. Don't piss off?
ROLFE
Not particularly.
WADE
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't
care what's right?
ROLFE
I care happened. The truth.
I'm student history, remember?
The sun down. Wade tucks keys knotted board.
ROLFE

WADE
Yeah.
ROLFE
I hate disappoint you, I don't
think happened.
WADE
Of course happened. Why I
lie it?
ROLFE
It happened,
way said.
WADE
You think I wouldn't remember thing
like that?
ROLFE
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, I
heard it. When I heard

WADE

ROLFE

POP
Bang!
WADE

Wade waves old man off, trudges barn.
POP

WADE
Crawl!
POP
Nothing fucking house drink.
Not fucking thing. My house,
money, truck -- stolen!
WADE
I don't know you. My goddamn father
I don't know you.
Wade walks glistening snow dark barn.
CUT TO:
INT. BARN - DAY
Wade unloads cardboard boxes filled office
belongings truck sets
ground. He gathers rifles.
Suddenly! A whiskey bottle SLAMS
head. He drops knees, guns scatter. He looks
child's fear guilt father.
Glen Whitehouse hovers him, huge ferocious:
colossus, lifting bottle like jawbone.
Wade cringes, scrambles dropped rifle. He grabs
barrel and, twisting around, swings slow motion
arc, smashing edge wood stock father's
head. A cold hard CRACK bone.
Glen Whitehouse -- shriveled again, longer mythic -- flies
like stuffed dummy. He collapses
C.C. bottle.
Wade, bleeding head, stands, staggers Pop's
inert body, aims rifle old man's face.
WADE
I know now. I love too.
Wade bolts rifle, flicks safety, fires -- loud
CLICK. The gun's empty.
WADE
(smiles)
Joke. You scared me.
He kneels down, lovingly touches old man's face, caresses
lips, cheeks, nose, brows, smoothes stiff gray
hair.
Pop's eyes clouded. Blood suddenly drips ear
ground.
Wade rests rifle truck. He bends over, slips
hands father's body, lifts up. He carries
Pop workbench, lays out.
Groping beneath bench, Wade finds kerosene lamp. He
unscrews it, pours kerosene length Pop's body.
Wade takes cigarette lighter, ignites it, holds
moment, places Glen Whitehouse.
Fire spreads length Pop's body, bursting like shroud
yellow flame. The oil-stained bench crackles; flames shoot
old weathered wall.
Burning flesh heat drive Wade backwards.
CUT TO:
EXT. WHITEHOUSE FARM - DAY
Wade stands snow sunlight. The entire barn engulfed
flames. Black smoke billows clear winter sky.
Inside Glen Whitehouse, pyre, burns.

Wade spots Jack poised spruce grove, watching deer.
Wade bolts rifle, releases safety, aims FIRES.
Jack, hit chest, falls bleeding trees. Blood
stains snow.

Even footprints,
