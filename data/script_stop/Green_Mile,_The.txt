haunting sepia-toned, defining era. The bread
lines...the soup kitchens...the dust bowl refugees heading
west possessions backs hope
eyes...the strutting gangster royalty flaunting
bootleg riches...an entire generation lost youth riding
rials...the U.S. army troops raining truncheon blows
half-starved forgotten veterans World War One
"Hooverville" set afire shadow nation's
capitol...
All faces, lives, world

Suddenly, MAN WITH A SHOTGUN comes crashing
cattails, wiping frame exiting...
...then ANOTHER MAN...and ANOTHER...armed rifles,
plowing brush, exiting frame...
...and comes KLAUS DETTERICK, farmer step
shirt-tail poor, double-barrel shotgun crook
arm. He pauses, horrified, seeing scrap cloth. He
pulls loose, turns back, screaming anguish...
...and men come crashing view, flooding

DOGS, trying untangle leads. DEPUTY ROB McGEE
shouting everybody stay together...
...and all, hear sibilant, frightening whisper:

Paul uncurls fingers, revealing crushed remnants
bit toast, palm slick greasy oleo smear.
ELAINE (O.S.)

Brad lets Paul loose, leans close:

FRED ASTAIRE

big man's cuffs, leading of:
PERCY

PERCY

PAUL

Percy flushes red, baton hovering near palm. He looks
like he's something, thinks better
stalks angrily Mile instead...
...and sees Del bars, smiling. Infuriated, Percy
swings baton smashes Del's fingers LOUD CRACK.
Del jerks back, howling pain:

lets go.
Paul steps cell. Brutal slides door shut, locks

Okay, now.
The boy races inside sister. Paul follows Burt's

PAUL

Burt acknowledges condolence gracious nod.
BURT
I'm enlightened

Percy pretends dip sponge soak it. It
touches water. He straightens places sponge

The cap lowered. Paul haven't realized

Paul's eyes widen. A stunned beat horror. He starts
open mouth scream "NO!", Percy beats
with:
PERCY

Van Hay flicks switch. WHAM. The electricity hits home
Del rocks forward, riding current.
Then things start horribly wrong.
The HUMMING loses steadiness starts waver
CRACKLING SOUND. Tendrils smoke begin curling
cap, mixture burning hair sponge. Brutal shoots
Paul horrified look. Paul responds harsh whisper:
PAUL
It's dry!
Delacroix begins twisting jittering chair,
masked face snapping violently side, legs
pistoning restraints.
There's MUFFLED POP cap, like pine knot
exploding hot fire. Smoke starts coming
fabric mask, puffing upward. Del cooked
alive. Paul spins partition, hollering--
PAUL
JACK!
--but Brutal grabs arm, whispers fiercely:
BRUTAL
Don't tell stop. Don't
it. It's late that.
Paul turns back, helpless. The guards trading wild
looks, unable believe what's happening. Even Percy looks
aghast--he expecting something, this.
Del begins SCREAMING--the wild, hysterical sound animal
shredded alive hay baler. The HUMMING goes uneven
ragged, lights rising falling...
ON THE MILE
...as Del's screams rise fall them, echoing
corridor. Coffey's shaking screaming too, feeling

Harry scoops bucket water throw it.
PAUL

Harry backs look dazed understanding--you don't
throw water man getting juiced. Right. He drops
bucket, races chemical extinguisher instead.
The flaming mask peels away, revealing Del's charring face.
His eyeballs misshapen globs burning white jelly blown
sockets. The ATTENDING DOCTOR faints dead away.
Pandemonium room. People shouting hurrying
exit, chairs falling over, women screaming:
FAT LADY

Hal grabs Paul shoulder, spins around.
HAL

Hal horrified thought. Del jittering

nostrils mouth, tongue sizzling purple-black.
The witnesses crowding shoving out,
door locked. All cluster there.
Paul sees Percy head turned away. He grabs him,
forces head around.
PAUL

Harry steps up, extinguisher hands. Waiting. Del
finally slumps over. He vibrating, it's
effect current flowing body.
PAUL

Van Hay kills current. The HUMMING DIES. Brutal grabs

The men pause. Even fireflies swirling them,
growing number. It's getting downright weird.
Coffey laughs softly, drawing attention. A childlike
smile utterly transformed face. He raises hand,
letting firefly weave playfully fingers.
COFFEY
Hey there, little firefly. Where's
Mrs. Firefly evening?
Another firefly joins first, dancing

COFFEY
Oh, is. You come

They begin orbiting shiny bald head like tiny glowing

HAL

Brutal--it's us!
The door swings wider, revealing Hal's face gaunt haggard
yellow porch light, stunned them:
HAL

PAUL
Hal, God's sakes, finger
trigger...
Hal doesn't, aiming past truck yard.
HAL
Are hostages? Who's there?
Who's truck?
Coffey steps glare headlights Harry tugging
arm, trying hold back. Hal cocks hammers.
HAL
John Coffey! Halt! Halt right
I shoot!
His aim wavers woman's voice comes upstairs:
MELINDA (O.S.)
Hal? Who talking to,
fucking cocksucker?
A frozen moment. Hal mortified. Paul gives look--is
Melinda?
Hal's shotgun shifts Coffey--but Paul steps
muzzle.
PAUL
No one's hurt. We're help.
HAL
Help what? I don't understand. Is
prison break?
PAUL
I can't explain is. You
trust me.
Coffey comes steps, brushes Paul aside, stops
warden. Hal blinks, thoughts suddenly fuzzy--it's
benign hypnotic effect Coffey has.
HAL
What you...want?
MELINDA
Hal! Make away! No
salesmen middle
night! No Fuller brushes! No
French knickers come
crotch! Tell flying
fuck rolling d...d...
We hear sound GLASS BREAKING, begins sob.
COFFEY
(a whisper)
Just help. Just help, boss,

HAL
You can't. No can.
Coffey pulls shotgun gently Hal's grasp, hands
Paul. Coffey moves past Hal house...
INT. HOUSE - NIGHT
...and comes hallway stairs.
HAL
Don't there! Don't

COFFEY
Boss, quiet

Coffey mounts stairs heels,
heading quavering voice:
MELINDA (O.S.)
Stay here! Whoever are,
stay out! I'm dressed
visitors, rat's asshole!
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
Coffey enters, trailed others. Paul pauses, horrified.
The woman propped bed barely resembles Melinda Moores
anymore--she looks like Halloween witch, livid
skin hanging loose trail wrinkles, corner
mouth twisted. Yellowish bile stains chin
nightgown. Her hair gone white straw-like,
eyes glowering Coffey lively, irrational interest:
MELINDA
Oh, big! Pull pants!
Let's look!
Hal groans despair. Coffey stands
moment, watching distance, approaches
bed...
MELINDA
Don't come near me, pigfucker.
...but draws closer, change occurs. Her features
soften, eyes sane aware.
MELINDA
Why scars? Who
hurt badly?
COFFEY
Don't hardly remember, ma'am.
Coffey sits edge bed. The lights flare
hotter brighter. Tears forming Melinda's eyes.
MELINDA
What's name?
COFFEY
John Coffey, ma'am. Like
drink, spelt same.
She lays back, staring shining fascination. The
world slowing down, growing indeed...
...and starts bending slowly her.
COFFEY
Ma'am?
MELINDA
Yes, John Coffey?
COFFEY
I it. I it.
He comes closer...closer still...
COFFEY
You now. You quiet
still.
He brushes forehead lips...the gentlest whisper
kiss...then moves mouth hers. For moment
eyes staring past him, filling
expression surprise...
...and face lost view Coffey puts lips
hers. We hear soft whistling sound begins inhaling
air deeply lungs. Something hot glowing
starts passing them, drawn breath...
The men watch. The house shudder moment,
entire world shifted inch right...
DOWNSTAIRS PARLOR
...and grandfather clock stops ticking, pendulum
stopping dead, glass face cracking neatly center...
BEDROOM
...and windowpane cracks. Then another. A picture falls
wall. A lightbulb bursts, showering glass.
Paul smells smoke, realizes fringed coverlet bed
caught fire. Moving like man dream, reaches
waterglass nightstand, douses flames.
Coffey keeps kissing Melinda deep mysterious way,
inhaling inhaling, hand held like tiny white
bird. For moment actually hear screaming,
willful imp extracted force...
...and it's over. Coffey raises head, revealing:
Melinda's beautiful face. Her mouth longer droops. Color
coming hair. Her skin shining life.
Coffey regards raptly moment two, starts
coughing violently.
He turns away drops knees, hacking like man
stages tuberculosis.
Paul men expecting Coffey spit "bugs",
doesn't--he keeps coughing, deep hard, barely
finding time snatch breath air.
Hal goes wife, stunned, sits side. She
looks amazement, face like dirty
mirror that's suddenly wiped clean.
John's coughing grows worse. Brutal drops
slaps broad, spasming back.
BRUTAL
John! Sick up! Cough 'em
like before!
