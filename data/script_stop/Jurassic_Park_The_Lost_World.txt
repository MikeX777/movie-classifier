EXT. TROPICAL LAGOON - DAY
A 135-foot-luxury yacht anchored offshore
tropical lagoon. The beach stunning crescent white
sand jungle fringe, utterly deserted.
ISLA SORNA
87 miles southeast Nublar
Two SHIP HANDS, dressed white uniforms, set
picnic table chairs sand carefully
laying luncheon service -- fine china, silver, crystal
decanters red white wine.
PAUL BOWMAN, fortyish, sits chair side,
reading. MRS. BOWMAN, painfully thin, perpetually
surprised look woman who's eyes
once, supervises settings table.
She looks sees little girl, CATHY, seven
years old, wandering beach.
MRS. BOWMAN
Cathy! Don't wander off!
Cathy keeps wandering.
MRS. BOWMAN (cont'd)

shells right here!
Cathy gestures, pretending can't hear.
BOWMAN
(eyes book)
Leave alone.
MRS. BOWMAN
What snakes?
BOWMAN
There's snakes beach. Let
fun, once.
FURTHER DOWN THE BEACH,
Cathy keeps wandering away, MUTTERING
parents' quarreling voices fade distance.
CATHY
Please quiet, quiet
quiet...
Rounding curve beach, parents disappear view
her. A RUSTLING sound draws attention,
turns, jungle foliage gives way
sand.
A large bush, maybe feet tall, moving, branches
swaying shaking. Curious, Cathy walks bush,
abruptly stops moving.
A small, lizard-like animal, dark green brown stripes
back, steps bush. Only foot
tall, stands hind legs, balancing tail.
It walks upright, bobbing head like chicken.
CATHY
Well, hello there!
The animal (a COMPSOGNATHUS) stares her. Cathy squats
haunches.
CATHY (cont'd)
What you? A little bird
something?
She opens hand. She's got handful goldfish crackers.
CATHY (cont'd)
Are hungry? You want goldfish?
The compy bobs forward steps, cautiously.
CATHY (cont'd)
Come on. I won't hurt you.
The compy draws closer. Cathy holds cracker palm
hand. The compy gets closer --
-- hops numbly Cathy's palm. Her arm dips bit
weight, it's heavy, holds
easily. It bobs head, scarfs goldfish, eats
it.
Enchanted, Cathy breaks enormous grin returns
hand, calling shoulder.
CATHY (cont'd)
Mom! Dad! You gotta come this!
I something!
She turns back.
Thirty compys come sand. They're
standing there, bobbing anxiously, staring
feet away. Cathy's smile fades.
She turns head slowly right. TWENTY MORE COMPYS
come side, forming semi-circle, bobbing
CHIPPING surround her.
CATHY (cont'd)
(terrified)
What guys want?
BACK ON THE BEACH,
table set. Mrs. Bowman calls out.
MRS. BOWMAN
Cathy, sweetheart! Lunch ready!
From curve beach, flock birds bolts
jungle trees Cathy's shrill SCREAMS suddenly
pierce air.
MRS. BOWMAN
PAUL!
She takes off, running beach, Mr. Bowman leaps
chair follows, available deck hands race
help, kicking geysers sand them.
DOWN THE BEACH,
Mrs. Bowman stops dead tracks rounds bend
beach. We don't sees, hear
frenzied SQUEAKING strange compys. Mr. Bowman
Hands race past help Cathy Mrs. Bowman lets loose
horrified, slack-jawed SCREAM, mouth perfect oval.

Malcolm shakes head, flipping file sadly.
HAMMOND

LUDLOW
Trespassing, sabotage --

SARAH
Don't start legal argument me,

DR. JUTTSON encountered DR. BURKE.
JUTTSON
What here, Burke?
There's TV cameras, what's

BURKE
Dr. Juttson, exist outside

Dieter continues Nick's face.
NICK
Are looking problem?
JUTTSON

Everyone, voices down!
ROLAND
Back off, Dieter.
JUTTSON
Listen me, moving baby

Oh, God.
JUTTSON
That's persisted

LUDLOW
(of Sarah Nick)
Thanks people.
SARAH
Hey, came observe,
came strip-mine place!
It's looter mentality, care
take.
ROLAND
None matters. Our
communications equipment's
destroyed. If radio
satellite phone
trailers went cliff,
I'm guessing look
face --
He points Malcolm, side, sitting
stunned silence. Malcolm looks nods, slowly. The
grimness situation sinks in.
ROLAND (cont'd)
We stuck here, ladies
gentlemen. And we're stuck together.
CUT TO:
EXT. HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT
Back hunters' now-demolished camp, members
groups combine diminished supplies. They half
dozen large plastic containers water, thirty-seven
containers food, ranging Ziploc bags aluminum tins,
variety weapons, mot borne hips
shoulders HUNTER team, charred scraggly
remnants pieces now-useless electrical
equipment, flare gun flares, somebody's tattered
paperback ("Crime Punishment"), box Hershey bars,
cartoon Marlboros.
ROLAND supervises assembling resources,
displayed him. LUDLOW, NICK, SARAH, JUTTSON,
MALCOLM, holding KELLY close him,
him. They hold discussion quiet tones.
ROLAND
If can't stay rex's
territory, tonight.
SARAH
Move where? Our boat's coming

LUDLOW
There's communication center, here,
old worker village. Hammond

work. If there,
send radio
airlift.
NICK
How far village?
LUDLOW
I said there.
NICK
Well, far it?
LUDLOW
A day's walk, maybe more. That's
problem.
ROLAND
What is?
LUDLOW
The velociraptors.
Malcolm looks sharply.
LUDLOW (cont'd)
Our infrareds nesting
sites concentrated island
interior. That's planned
keeping outer rim.
Malcolm shepherds Kelly away conversation mutters
quietly background.
DIETER
What velociraptors?
JUTTSON
Carnivores. Pack hunters. About
feet long,
pounds, very, fast.
Dieter brandishes weapon.
DIETER
I think handle
them.
Malcolm rejoins conversation, alone. He keeps voice
low.
MALCOLM
No. I'm certain can't.
ROLAND
Look, choices. We
hike lagoon,
sit days, open,
heavily water source
we're waiting boat
arrive, head
village,
shelter help.
MALCOLM
We'd past raptors.
Trust me, I experience
matter.
Roland looks him.
ROLAND
That be. But weren't

Malcolm shakes head, turns walks
Kelly. Roland turns others.
ROLAND (cont'd)
Load up. Let's moveable
feast underway.
CUT TO:
EXT. ISLAND - NIGHT
The SURVIVORS set forth, marching jungle
column. Two HUNTERS strap small shoulder-mounted
servo-flashlights. Wires run lights end
sensor pads stick skin necks. Thus
attached, hunters turn heads, servo-lights
turn them, illuminating direction look in.
MALCOLM screws barrel Lindstradt rifle slings
shoulder marches, limping heavily. He looks
KELLY, marching alongside him. His face shows
deepest regret. He shakes head, cursing himself.
MALCOLM
Damn it.
He looks away Kelly looks him, questioning. ROLAND
falls step Malcolm notices limp.
ROLAND
You right?
Malcolm looks him, looks away answering.
ROLAND (cont'd)
Wrong question?
MALCOLM
You heard Gambler's Ruin?
ROLAND
What's that?
MALCOLM
A statistical phenomenon. Says
world goes
streaks. It's real,
-- weather, river
flooding, baseball, blackjack,
stock markets. Once things
bad, tend stay bad. Bad
things cluster. They hell
together.
ROLAND
Feeling bit blue, we?
Malcolm glances Kelly, taken slightly faster pace
steps ahead now.
MALCOLM
Just -- flawed. Very deeply flawed.
ROLAND
Why come here?
MALCOLM
So know
place?
ROLAND
Why they?
MALCOLM
Because exists.
ROLAND
It'll exit
knowing, won't it?
MALCOLM
Yes. And people live
absence truth.
ROLAND
So truth important
life?
MALCOLM
(lowers voice)
I don't care life. But
I'd thought second
danger --
Roland follows gaze forward, Kelly, who's
yards ahead now.
ROLAND
She yours?
AHEAD OF THEM,
Kelly hear voices, faint, clear. They
far away think are.
MALCOLM (o.s.)
I'm afraid so. I don't know
hell I'm kids. I
her.
Kelly's face shows heard part.
BEHIND HER,
Malcolm, unaware, continues Roland.
MALCOLM (cont'd)
Why here?
ROLAND
Somewhere island,
exits greatest predator
lived. And second greatest
predator down.
MALCOLM
But why?
ROLAND
You remember guy,
years ago, I forget name,
climbed Everest oxygen,
came dead. And
asked him, "why
die?" And said "I didn't. I
went live."
MALCOLM
(nods)
It's called self-testing. But
case, sounds like
self-destruction. A uniquely human
characteristic. In fact, human
beings destroy things I
think that's function.
Maybe sons, animal
comes kills rest
world, clears decks,
lets evolution proceed
phase. Maybe death destruction
job, maybe we're supposed
destroy
living thing that-
Every person trail earshot stopped
staring Malcolm, shaken words. Roland grabs Malcolm
shirt collar pulls close, GROWLING ear.
ROLAND
Tell what. You
want to, me,
spew nihilist rants
group. I'm
fighting panic, push
wrong buttons. Understand?
Malcolm blinks. This guy's charge.
CUT TO:
EXT. JUNGLE - DAWN
As purple dawn dissolves night sky, SURVIVORS
stagger on, exhausted. Some starting tire,
spaces column. MALCOLM's limp getting
worse. NICK reaches out, Malcolm's pack, Malcolm
swats hand away.
KELLY, ahead him, falls step SARAH.
KELLY
I don't think -- dad doesn't
think we're going it.
Sarah looks her.
SARAH
Your dad wrong. About lot
knows.
She puts arm her. Kelly looks her, grateful.
The long march continues.
UP AT THE FRONT,
NICK catches ROLAND.
NICK
I think break.
ROLAND
Another half hour.
NICK
Some won't half
hour. We didn't come far
start dropping middle
jungle. If don't it, I
will.
Roland looks him, steely, SHOUTS group.
ROLAND
FIVE MINUTES BREAK!
Immediately, marchers drop stood, absolutely
drained.
AT THE REAR OF THE GROUP,
DRS. BURKE JUTTSON bickering.
JUTTSON
I can't believe you're angry
that.
BURKE
You know, it's easy criticize
person studies
something.
JUTTSON
No, it's easy criticize sloppy
research hasty conclusions.
NEARBY,
MALCOLM checks Nick's bag videotapes, making sure they're
dry undamaged. Sarah comes up, watching him.
SARAH
You know,
tapes back, people going
it's hoax. Ian
Malcolm's alien autopsy.
MALCOLM
Maybe. Maybe not.
SARAH
Ian, misplace evidence,
shoot holes testimony,
special effects genius created

believe dinosaurs

He doesn't look her. She sits her.
SARAH (cont'd)
There's important
thinking instead.
BEHIND THEM,
Dr. Burke, furious, stalked away Juttson sits
rock. H double take, noticing
rock. He leans picks up.
It's oval shape inches long, pebbled
exterior. A dinosaur egg.
Burke's face lights up, fascinated, carefully pieces
egg satchel wears shoulder.
AT THE REAR OF THE GROUP,
DIETER STARK pulls wad toilet paper pack, drops
pack ground, turns Hunter nearest --
CARTER, driver, turned.
DIETER
Wait me, ya Carter?
He steps path, jungle. But come
Carter, he's wearing Walkman,
headphone BLARING tinnily ears.
And didn't hear word.
EXT. THICK OF THE JUNGLE - DAY
Only feet path, it's primary forest, growth
sunlight obscured. DIETER claws
forward finds suitable spot relieve himself.
He clears away bunch leaves debris raises
hand belt buckle. He freezes, hearing
didn't. He glances around, head darting, alert danger.
Nothing there. Just distant ANIMAL CALLS--
-- s SCURRYING left.
Dieter snaps head direction. At first, sees
nothing, moves closer, gun extended him,
sees small dinosaur, COMPSOGRATHUS,
chicken-sized animal Cathy saw beach long ago.
DIETER
It's polite --
He pulls steel rod loop belt touches
compy's back. The blue bolt electricity CRACKS
dances compy's body convulses pain.
DIETER (cont'd)
-- sneak people.
The wounded compsognathus scurries jungle,
whimpering. Dieter clambers foliage
paces, pushes aside large palm fronds, steps
--
-- jungle. He stops, puzzled, sure went
forward.
He looks him. He pauses, recalculating path
took coming jungle, MUTTERING himself, gesturing
hands, retracing steps.
He adjusts angle slightly right heads
direction. But hard-fought steps,
stops again. Still jungle.
DIETER
HEY! CARTER! YELL OR SOMETHING, I
GOT TURNED AROUND IN HERE!
ON THE TRAIL,
Dieter's cries faint, audible. The Marchers hear
hear CARTER, Walkman blaring
ears.
DIETER (o.s.)
...Carter... me?...
IN THE JUNGLE,
Dieter hears SCURRYING sound again, time
right. He adjusts angle SCRAPES
foliage, moving faster faster.
Panicking, ties run, roots rise high
ground jungle, trips falls flat
face.
He looks up. The SCURRYING sound comes again, time
times louder before, like feet coming him.
Dieter GASPS rushes him.
He whirls right. Whatever rushes
well. And left. And him. Dieter
scrambles sitting position --
-- laughs. He surrounded compys now,
wounded.
For long moment, stare him. Slowly, brings
gun around, point them.
DIETER
Easy -- wait -- sec-
As one, compys SHRIEK hurl forward,
covering Dieter's body. Their teeth claws FLASH
try grab scrap flesh, tearing savagely.
Dieter SCREAMS flails, waving arms legs wildly.
Some tiny animals lose grip sail off,
SMASHING trees ground. But dozens hang
on, Dieter falls backwards, lying
ground.
Hysterical, fights like hell feet, SCREAMING,
shaking, swatting compys loose. He spins, tactic
work, compys begin panic
drop him. But loses grip weapon,
goes flying, landing foliage
feet him.
Losing attack, compys turn dart away en masse,
stopping yards away him.
But turn regroup, facing line, hopping
down, CHIRPING SHRIEKING.
Dieter bounds foliage, looking gun. But
compys follow he's forced flee, abandoning
lost weapon.
Ten feet on, stops, knowing he's screwed gun.
He turns face pursuing compys.
They stop.
Dieter charges them, SHOUTING, waving arms.
The compys turn run. Dieter stops.
The compys stop. They stare him. There moment
quiet, start hop again, CHIRPING
SQUEALING.
Dieter, tired game, turns runs away.
The compys follow.
EXT. JUNGLE - DAY
From convoy, ROLAND SHOUTS out.
ROLAND
Break's over, on!
The exhausted marchers drag feet
start march again. At rear group, taps
Carter, listening music. Carter gets up,
hoists backpack, marches away.
Behind him, Dieter's pack left, forgotten, jungle
trail.
EXT. DEEP IN THE JUNGLE - DAY
DIETER stumbles along, exhausted. He reaches edge
stream runs foliage, feet slip
stones. He falls, rocky stream.
Behind him, army compys pours little hill
crested. They disappear moment, incline --
-- And swarm body. In frenzy splashing,
Dieter shrugs crawls away, stream.
He gets feet falls again, time log. A
geyser water splashes air log
Dieter drops sight.
The compys leap log disappear view too,
throwing splashes water. SCREECHING,
CHIRPING, sound TEARING flesh mixes Dieter's
SCREAMS.
Now, compys leap log splash
water below, geysers shoot field view
pink.
And they're deep, deep red.
CUT TO:

The group stopped again. Near rear, SARAH, NICK,
MALCOLM, LUDLOW, ROLAND tense conversation
CARTER.
ROLAND
How long ago this?
CARTER
Seven, minutes.
Roland looks them, thinking. Finally:
ROLAND
Then he's dead. Nobody tells
little girl. Last thing need

He turns heads column.
SARAH
We send look

ROLAND
You like, we're
waiting you. MOVE IT OUT!!
They look other, appalled, column starts
move. Numbed, shocked, left choice, on,

CUT TO:
EXT. ISLAND RIDGE - DUSK
The column MARCHERS finally reached island ridge,
silhouetted setting sun. They're
taking break, sprawled rocks ground.
MALCOLM sits KELLY, who's sitting log.
MALCOLM
You okay?
She doesn't look him, gets walks away, going
sit SARAH.
Malcolm watches, pained, Sarah puts arm
makes "she's okay" gesture Malcolm.
AT THE RIDGE,
ROLAND steps edge peers island
interior. From vantage point, he's able

He refers satellite recon photos.
ROLAND
Looks like worker village

MALCOLM him.
MALCOLM

Roland looks exhausted MARCHERS.
ROLAND
They'll rest look

Then hit it.
CUT TO:
EXT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT
The group camp jungle. The mood somber,
MARCHERS asleep already. Three tents
up.
IN ONE TENT,
KELLY sits quietly corner, eyes wide, knees hugged
chest. SARAH comes in.
SARAH
There are. Your dad's looking
you.
KELLY
I doubt that.
Sarah takes outer shirt hangs bar dry
broad red smear front.
SARAH
Oh, come on. Go talk him.
KELLY
Why? He likes alone. I
stay you.
IN THE CAMPSITE,
still. The nocturnal jungle HOOTS BUZZES
sleeping marchers.
In tent, ROLAND abruptly sits up. As heard
something. He looks open flap. In middle
campsite, sees AJAY stop tracks, head cocked.
Roland gets goes outside, joining Ajay middle
camp.
ROLAND
You hear something?
AJAY
No. I feel something.
Roland looks him. This isn't good. He looks
shifting jungle. He notices plume smoke rising
trees barely outside edge camp.
ROLAND
Oh, no.
IN SARAH'S TENT,
Kelly Sarah laid sleeping bags, trying
minutes' rest. Sarah's shirt hangs them,
swaying gentle breeze coming open flap.
As shirt dangles there, swinging softly side,
notice broad red smear front. Oh, that's
right -- it's blood.
The baby T-rex's blood.
AT THE RIDGE OF CAMP,
plume smoke leads tiny cooking
that's lit DR. BURKE.
He's set small frying pan it, CRACKS
dinosaur egg picked earlier pan.
Roland Ajay run him.
ROLAND
(hisses)
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?!
Burke leaps way Roland kicks dirt fire.
BMBB!
Roland, Ajay, Burke freeze. What that?
IN SARAH'S TENT,
Sarah Kelly sit up. They felt too.
BMBB!
AT THE COCKING FIRE,
ROLAND
Get weapon.
Ajay turns trots away steps, stops cold,
staring ground.
BMBB!
A recent rain left puddles scattered camp,
impact tremors create ripples puddles -- concentric
circles spreading outer edges.
BMBB!
IN SARAH'S TENT,
Sarah Kelly frantically sealing opened food
Ziploc bags.
BMBB!
Now leap Sarah's sleeping bag, seal themselves,
draw zipper up, way around.
Outside, silhouette rex's head passes tent.
Sarah works faster, fingers struggling close
inches, --
-- rex head pokes flap tent. It
sniffs, SNORTING air out. It looks
tent.
It sniffs Sarah's hanging shirt, stained
blood baby tyrannosaur. The adult tyrannosaur
GURGLES again, COOING cocking head curiously.
In sleeping bag, Sarah Kelly's eyes barely
visible, wide panic. The rex sniffs nudges bag,
trying figure thing is.
It rolls bag once, decides it's uninteresting,
rises, straights --
-- taking tent it! The stakes pop
ground tent rises high air flutters
away, leaving sleeping bag fully exposed ground
beneath it.
IN THE CAMPSITE,
SECOND TYRANNOSAUR steps jungle, joining
first. Panic hits camp sleeping HUNTERS wake
up. Many start run.
Roland scrambles tent, weapon
lying near open flap. As draws close, enormous
T-rex foot stomps tent, driving rifle deep
mud.
Roland, weaponless, stands frozen, watching panicked
Hunters flee directions.
ROLAND
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, DON'T RUN!
But ignore him, sweeping wave flushed
prey pours campsite. Some toss random
ill-aimed GUNSHOTS rexes.
ACROSS THE CAMPSITE,
NICK bursts crowd, sees Kelly Sarah struggling

IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CROWD,
MALCOLM, blinking sleep, stands good head

MALCOLM

But can't her.
AT THE EDGE OF CAMP,
rexes join forces, herding fleeing Hunters

UP ON A ROCK RACE,
Roland scrambles steep rock face. No way hell he's
going ravine. He sees Malcolm, middle
camp, start head ravine.
ROLAND
MALCOLM! OVER HERE!
Malcolm runs hurls rock face,
scrambling climb smooth, steep boulders.
Behind him, rexes spots lunges

ROLAND (cont'd)

Malcolm gives he's got, clawing way

The rex falls short, he's close hear
teeth SNAP together, closing air. It

Malcolm lands rock ledge CRUNCH. Roland
unceremoniously dumps fistful hair lap.
IN THE RAVINE,

Roland rock ridge them, keeping pace.
MALCOLM
(shouting)
KELLY, UP HERE!
But Kelly continues flee, rexes ravine

Some Hunters try leap scale rocks,
ravine deepening, there's way out. One rex grabs hold
Hunter teeth hurls rock face.
The second rex picks Hunter snaps massive

UP ON TH ROCK FACE,
Malcolm frantic.
MALCOLM
I gotta there!
DOWN IN THE RAVINE,
it's obvious going outrun rexes, Nick
knows it. He bursts ahead Sarah Kelly spots

It's waterfall, apparently right sheer rock

falling tells something.
NICK

He grabs hauls forward, running straight

SARAH

Breathless, terrified, hear mayhem outside.
NICK
Shhhh... shhhh...
With enormous SPLASH, bursts
cascading water crashes them.
Dr. Burke.
BURKE
Get way!
He pulls way far wall, far away

FOOOOM! Now shape bursts watery curtain.
A Tyrannosaur head. Burke gave away hiding spot.
The SCREAM rex's jaws SNAP left right,

The rex can't head way

Burke, blind panic, forces
cave, pushes Kelly out.
SARAH
STOP IT YOU'RE PUSHED HER OUT STOP

But Burke doesn't listen, throwing elbows room
himself. His movements dislodge portion muddy earth,
flurry enormous cockroaches, inches long
each, pour wall swarm face neck.
Burke SCREAMS instinctively leaps away, flowing
water.
And that's leverage rex needs. It curls
tongue, wrapping Burke pulling
teeth. SCREAMING hideously, dragged out,
waterfall, disappears.
Sarah, Nick, Kelly stare horror white screen

UP ON THE ROCK FACE,
Malcolm Roland rex walk away waterfall
Burke, leaving hiding place unmolested. Malcolm
nearly hysterical.
ROLAND
She's okay! They'll stay there,

IN A JUNGLE CLEARING,
routed Hunters emerge gully edge

long "elephant" grass.
AJAY, running them, stops abruptly edge

One stops turns, looking jungle trees.
HUNTER

There CHEERS, SIGHS OF relief. In distance, AJAY'S

rock distance, Roland, waving
arms madly.
But giddiness escape, pay mind.
They continue plowing high grass,

ABOUT FIFTY YARDS AWAY,
tops animal heads rise slowly, backlit
moon. In distance, heads seethe Hunter
party. The heads descend, grass.
BACK WITH THE HUNTERS,
continue forward, oblivious. Now them,
heads rise grass. As descend.
On sides Hunters, grass ripples animals
forward them, undetected, inexorable torpedoes.
And torpedoes target. One Hunter suddenly
dragged down, yanked silently surface tall
grass.
In place, long, lizard-like tail rises animal
drops head kill.
Behind him, Hunters taken down,
animal tails rise place. A Hunter ahead hears
RUSTLING turns. His face turns white as, --
-- VELOCIRAPTOR springs grass.
Velociraptor runs upright powerfully muscled hind legs,
second tow foot bearing extra-large curved
claw, carried retracted position, slashes
attack.
Like now. This raptor SNARLS SLAMS body
Hunter, taking down. A feeding frenzy ensues. The
Hunters run directions, pulled vanish
twitching long grass.
Another raptor enters right, leaps high air,
past moon, SLAMS chest human prey,
takes down, grass.
Behind them, Ajay's face falls, defeated. He looks around,
realizing stranded middle long

Around him, torpedo trails head straight him.
Ajay simply closes eyes.

ROLAND
We're going path

AT THE EDGE OF CAMP,
Roland bends three-toed footprints left
rex. Behind him, rest group packing up,
slinging remnants equipment shoulders.
Roland bends SNIFFS footprint. It's filled

He takes canteen, dumps remaining water
ground, plunges canteen footprint, filling

CUT TO:
EXT. VALLEY OF DEATH - NIGHT
ROLAND LUDLOW (who, Sarah Malcolm,

SARAH KELLY come next, NICK, JUTTSON. One
one, stop stare.
SARAH
God help us.
They're standing flat, sandy area lined boulders
sides. The flat area stretches yards
far ahead. But that's
amazes so.
Everywhere, sand dotted dinosaur skeletons. Some
huge, apatosaurs, feet head tail tip.
Others smaller, herbivores different kinds. The
intact skeletons lie sides, ribcages arcs

NICK
I feel lucky.
ROLAND
Keep moving.
They march on, tiny figures moving mountainous

carcass particular, recent kill. It's enormous
HADROSAUR fresh bites taken it.
He bends down, studying soft earth
footprints.
FURTHER ON,
Malcolm looks up, noticing bony shapes them,
fall heavy shadows like cell bars, changing.
He turns, servo-light shines bones. But
they're bones all, they're pipes, animal

objects -- twisted, rotting machinery.
LUDLOW
We it!
They hurry small rise --
EXT. WORKER VILLAGE - NIGHT

far end large, blocky, four-story building.
But town mess. The hurricane hit
ferocious, things smashed, broken,
upended. And jungle stepped breath, growing
up, around, everything. Huge root systems snake
street, making impassable.
MALCOLM
The jungle. It's ready

Roland catches looks Ludlow.
ROLAND
Where's power radio setup?
LUDLOW
Operations building. Far end

A light rain falls start street, carefully,

Malcolm, curious, stops taps them. It's rock-hard.
Nick looks shoulder.

voice queasy HISS.
LUDLOW
It's... behind... us.
ROLAND
(the softest whisper)
It's fed. It won't attack
it's threatened. Don't move.
As rex silently cocks head, sizing danger
intruders, breathes again. A strands Ludlow's
hair flap exhalation. He closes eyes, near tears.
He can't it. His eyes dart, glancing weapon
holds hands. Unfortunately, it's extended
him, away rex.
He risks HISS.
LUDLOW
If I don't move, I can't shoot it.
ROLAND
Let go, Peter. The animal won.
Behind them, rex appears satisfied. It starts swing
