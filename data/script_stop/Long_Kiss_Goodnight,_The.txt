"THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT"

Shane Black
REVISED DRAFT
February 24, 1995
A WINDOWPANE
Assaulted SNOWFLAKES. Wind tossed.
INSIDE, bed, dappled moon shadow. A LITTLE GIRL, fast
asleep. The wind whistles sighs outside. She DREAMS...
Eyelids closed, eyes roving beneath... suddenly
SNAP open. A stifled cry. She thrashes STUFFED BEAR,
soft voice says:
VOICE
Shhhhh.
And there's MOM, kneeling her. Vague shape
dimness. The moon throws light sparkling
eye.
LITTLE GIRL
Mommy, men mountain...!
MOM
Shhhh. Gone, gone now.
(strokes hair)
I'm here. Mommy's
hurt you. Safe now...
safe warm... snug bug
rug.
(beat)
I'll sit you, think
sleep?
LITTLE GIRL
Turn nightlight.
The mother nods. Passes left hand gently girl's
forehead.
MOM
Close eyes now. I love you.
The child subsides, breathing steady. Eyes closed. The mother
rises. Regards dimness. Slowly turns, heads
door. Flicks Winnie Pooh NIGHTLIGHT --
Her entire right forearm slicked blood. More blood
Czech-made MP-5 machine gun.
She staggers little... barely noticeable. Passes
light. Into darkness. Sits daughter's bed.
The child sleeps peacefully. Outside snow slithers
glass.
FADE OUT. Pause. Blackness.
FADE IN:
It's snowing southwestern Ohio. Before us, nestled
rolling hills: postcard slice suburbia. SUPER legend:
UPPER SANDUSKY, OHIO.
Three Weeks Earlier.
Peaceful. Serene. It's town glass bubble,
God shakes watch snow...
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY
CHILDREN, dozens them, bursting houses. Slapping
screen doors. A HORSE-DRIVEN SLEIGH rattling Main
Street. Flanked kids. Christmas carols, droning
loudspeakers.
HAPPY, LAUGHING SANTA waves howdy, chortling "Ho's"
groups three, he's grizzled old
marshall named EARL, freezing nuts off.

Earl complies, grumbling. Some teenage burnouts howl
street corner:

Samantha squirms seat, scowling.
SAMANTHA

A voice interrupts reverie:
SAMANTHA
Excuse me.
The girls whirl around, startled -- Samantha leaning
desk them. Busted. She smiles amiably:
SAMANTHA

Which one's Dad? I forget.
The girls look like she's grown tail.
SAMANTHA

CUT TO:
A DOOR KICKED OPEN, WHAM-! Splintered. Lock shattered.
INT. MOTEL ROOM - AKRON, OHIO - NIGHT
A NUDE COUPLE bed. They look up, startled --

YOUNG MAN
Sir, listen me. I understand you're

Donleavy plops chair. Belches. Grins foolishly. The man

INT. BARREN GREY OFFICE - NIGHT
THERE'S THE GIRL. The bed moments ago. She Henessey

Hal steers away middle-aged teacher.
HAL

SAMANTHA

like cheap suit.
She notices EARL sitting bushes
building. He speaking intently gerbil.
HAL
Oh, boy. Someone's gotta
father home. I'm plowed.
Samantha takes keys him. Breathes deeply
chill night air. Smiling. Surveys scene... friends.
The neighborhood. Sighs:
SAMANTHA
This I wanted.
At point, young Caitlin says:
CAITLIN
How know?
ESTABLISHING SHOT - STATE PRISON - OHIO - NIGHTTIME
Switch gears: A grim, grey building. Guarded. Patrolled.
INT. PRISON - TELEVISION VIEWING ROOM - EVENING
A tired TV set drones audience one. Let's
ONE-EYED JACK. In fact, let's eye,
replaced PATCH. He smokes cigarettes, stubs
chair's armrest. Throws offhand glances TV screen.

KTVA news journeyed Upper Sandusky,
Santa's *Mrs*. Kringle

The happy news chatter continues. Jack isn't listening. Jack
isn't talking breathing either. He's simply STARING
TV screen, jaw slack...
ONE-EYED JACK
Gotta fuckin' kidding. No. No
way. SHIIIT!!
He SCREAMS CUT TO:
EXT. WOODLANDS - WITH SAMANTHA - DRIVING
If pick night die horribly, you'd hard
pressed nicer one. A country highway. Bathed
moonlight. Crusted snow. Pontiac Sunbird, wending
way wooded slopes.
INT. SUNBIRD - SAME TIME
SAMANTHA drives Earl (the SANTA saw earlier)
reclines, drunk.
EARL
You're married now,
years...?
He makes thumb circle. Jabs finger it:
EARL

SAMANTHA
Stick fingers hands

get. Shut piehole.
EARL
Don't snippy...
SAMANTHA
Earl, favor. Every words
"hic" bubbles come
mouth, okay?
EARL
Goddamnit, I'm drunk. Would
drunk man raw talent?
He starts playing Hawaiian nose harp. In Sam's ear,
can't help it, snorts laughter --
THE ADULT DEER appears perfectly framed Sunbird's
headlights. Dead ahead. Sam looks up, face etched sudden
TERROR. *No time think*. SWERVES, dice...! BROADSIDES
animal --
And comes THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD. All
pounds it. Fucks night altogether.
Actually, makes *halfway* --
But damn thing ALIVE. More alive. KICKING.
Thrashing. Squawling pain rage. A FLAILING HOOF
takes Earl. Kills second. Collapses
skull.
Sam rides wheel, screaming. An antler gouges chest.
Rips. Draws blood. She SWERVES, madly -- Hits tree
50.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Sam goes airborne. Explodes windshield, outward
bound. Shower glass, spritz blood... And she's
flying. Slow motion, end end... We lose SOUND.
Silence tumbles. Below her, Sunbird
noiselessly ERUPTS. Fireball, sky high --
Sam floating. Describes lazy arc mid-air... Whoomph-!
Disappears snow. Swallows her, leaves silhouette.
Around her, trees catch fire. Burn. She lies impromptu
sarcophagus. Out sight.
THE FLAMING DEER totters wreck, thrashing. Scene
nightmare. Nightmare two: snow,
human-shaped divot -- arises woman blood.
She stumbles drift. Toward wreck. And
it's clearly Sam Caine crimson, there's
wrong *eyes*.
En route car, kneels suffering deer,
flesh scorched torn -- KILLS it. Puts away
sharp CRACK-!ing blow head. Stands, eyes
squirming madness...
The car's inferno. Earl dead. She turns away, wiping
blood eyes -- Comes face face SNOWMAN.
A jolly white fellow. Charcoal briquettes eyes. She
watches, fascinated, MELTS blast furnace heat --
With warning, *screams*. Crumples ground.
The snowman's eyes fall out. He melts away away...
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - AKRON, OHIO - TWILIGHT
Elsewhere. Tract housing, late-model cars. MITCH HENESSEY
delivers Christmas gift year-old son TODD:
gift, *Midtown Saturn Orbiting Precinct*,
action figures. Henessey points box, engrossed:
HENESSEY
...and here's jail here, see...?
Escape chute Borian, he's
dinosaur guy, Moves quick, don't
shit neither. See,
shoot guard -- ah, hell,
look, I played little
myself, I'm sorry.
VOICE interrupts them:
VOICE (O.S.)
TODD, TIME FOR DINNER. NOW.
An awkward pause. Henessey scowls.
HENESSEY
Hey, ahead, um... hope
like present.
TODD
It's awesome, Dad. Mom, though, she...
(sighs)
She gets weird. On birthday,
gave Schwinn... called
bicycle stores there'd
robberies.
Henessey manages control face. Says tightly:
HENESSEY
Tell I don't steal locally.
He watches, forlorn, son vanishes inside house.
Christmas lights, blinking feebly. We HEAR, supered:
HENESSEY (V.O.)
Dear Ma: Filled child support
stuff week. Office got pissed,
ex-spouse I "Spawn Satan,
Dweller Eternal Dark." Just
honest, Ma, lady wants die.
As reaches car, BEEPER goes off.
EXT. PHONE BOOTH - MINUTES LATER
Henessey phone. Dials. Waits. We HEAR:
HENESSEY (V.O.)
I'd ripple, that's
truth. Ex-con. Ex-husband. Expired.
Thanks, Ma, hiding truth
long. Or maybe
believed me. I miss you. I hope
believed, day. No
did, Ma. No all. It's cold
here. I'm sorry you're dead. Your
son, Mitch.
The phone picks up. He says:
HENESSEY
Me. What's up?
TRIN (O.S.)
Mitch, got bite amnesia
chick's photo. Found guy remembers
seeing her, fall '87. He wants
cash, I grease him?
HENESSEY
Hell, no! Use head, girl. Let

TRIN

half. Plus night town
I back, *no cockfights
time*.
INT. SAMANTHA'S HOSPITAL ROOM - TWO DAYS LATER
Samantha, having survived. Laid austere hospital
room. Listening silence. Stares window sunlit
tree. Head bandaged. Frowns:
SAMANTHA
I want cigarette, I want
cigarette...?
Outside, snow slithers... Her eyelids, slowly closing. Slides
edge consciousness...
IN THE DREAM: She stands windswept cliff,
incongruous FULL-LENGTH MIRROR. Staring reflection --
it's bleeding scalp wound.
She probes head... frowns. Nothing. Nothing tiny
RIDGED SCAR she's long remember.
SAMANTHA
What... want...?
The reflection eyes grimly. Haggard. Tired.
REFLECTION
I want cigarette.
SAMANTHA
I don't smoke.
REFLECTION
(chuckles)
You to.
Samantha suddenly holding cigarette. She raises
lips. Her reflection MIRRORS precisely. Except
Samantha COUGHS, chokes smoke -- While bloody
reflection takes long, satisfying drag.
REFLECTION
Relax, drop act. Nice
smooth, hit. There
go. See easy comes back?
They perfect synchronicity. Sam inhales easily.
REFLECTION
*I'm* coming back. You know that,
don't you? Name's Charly,
way. You're gonna love me.
The reflection grins. There's blood TEETH.
INT. SAMANTHA'S HOME - DAY
Back home, business usual, pre-Christmas. A COMMOTION
arisen: Gingerly, bones aching, Samantha moves
KITCHEN. HAL CAITLIN trail behind.
HAL
Honey, can't cook, I'm wrong

SAMANTHA
I'm *remembering*, Hal. Things

CAITLIN
Daddy, stop!
SAMANTHA
Hush. Go garage
something, anything. A veggie, go,
man, go! I'm hot trot.
INT. KITCHEN/GARAGE - SAME
Hal worriedly exits garage. Plucks tomato
fridge, tosses Caitlin, stands door.
HAL
Tomato.
Caitlin turns, tosses Sam --
CAITLIN
Tomato.
Who catches it, plops cutting board proceeds
DICE SIMTHEREENS. Razor-thin slices. Knife blur.
Missing fingers millimeters, faltering, like
mad mumblety-pegger --
HAL
Onion, flying in.
Sam catches it. Knife flurries. Pieces, flying up.
SAMANTHA
More. Faster.
And bucket brigade. Hal heaves veggies Caitlin
spins relays Mom slices, dices, purees,
makes curly fries. Veggies, incoming. HAL starts
lose it, starts lobbing Caitlin, another,
giggles, starts throwing overhand --
CAITLIN
Tomato. Tomato. Tomato.
And it's food fight, PELTING Mom, floor
COVERED food Hal stumbles laughing, scoops
Caitlin --
Samantha shakes head, grinning, dices pieces last,
lovely radish. Ends flourish, TA-DAH-! Doesn't think:
Flips knife point ONE FINGER. Tips balance.
Lobs tomato. Slings knife looking, pins

Everyone goes silent. The knife, quivering. Caitlin Hal
turn one, gaping her. She shrugs numbly. Blinks.
SAMANTHA
Uh... chefs that.
INT. BOILER ROOM - DAY OR NIGHT, IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL
Underground. Water GURGLES overhead pipes. Furnaces
hum tick sweaty gloom.
A SHIRTLESS MAN tied chair. Weeping. Before him,
looks like young GQ model. Blonde. Gorgeous. Impeccably
attired. For record, TIMOTHY. He looks captive
eye guy blubbers:
MAN

Timothy stares face, eyes narrowed...
seeing brain. He nods, satisfied.
TIMOTHY
No. You don't.
(beat)
I tell, know... If
someone's lying me. A little skill
mine, trot
parties.
He slams home knife. We don't it, FEEL
impact. The FBI man's face contorts SHOCK. Twisted. Inches
away Timothy, eyes lock...
A CELLULAR PHONE BEEPS. Timothy reacts, annoyed. Plucks
belt flips open:
TIMOTHY

TIMOTHY
Tap phone, yes. And tell Daedalus

HAL
Beautiful language.
He turns Samantha -- Sam isn't there. Her arm shoots

SAMANTHA
Nonsense. You it. You don't

CAITLIN
My arm hurts, home...!
SAMANTHA

She hangs HAL ENTERS her... She doesn't turn

She rode way home. She didn't
fall, once. She didn't cry.
(beat)
You're good. You work

SAMANTHA
She said wrist hurt. I didn't

Now leave alone.
HAL
Go away. With detective. Jesus,

SAMANTHA

Go church. Drink blood. Drink

They stand tableau. An electric silence... Broken
suddenly sound SINGING. CHRISTMAS CAROLERS. Outside
door. The sweet strains "God Rest Ye Merry,
Gentlemen" wafts window.
Except sweet strains ain't sweet. These carolers
TERRIBLE. Missing country octave. Sam Hal look

Splinters banister. That's sees CAITLIN. Top

A GUN BLAST disintegrates it. Reveals Sam, cowering behind.
ONE-EYED JACK

Slams head.
ONE-EYED JACK

crashed car. Walking up, guns sides... TWO SHOTS.
They jitter twitch. Topple dead, slide
gulley.
INSIDE THE CAR, annoyed Timothy
conscious. Splayed driver's door.
Holding hand horn, HOOOOOOOONNK... He releases
it. Horn stops. On radio Conway Twitty singing. He
puts shot radio. Silences it.
Climbs car stares road. Of Nathan
companions, whisper breath...
EXT. ROADSIDE - LATE AFTERNOON
Nathan pulled grove pine trees. The car
covered branches. He watches gap police
cars distant highway.
NATHAN
Your father British SIS,
assigned Irish situation.
After murdered 1971,

NATHAN

(beat)
Any idea stash

IN SAMANTHA'S LAP
Her fingers unconsciously fiddle something. Damp,
crumpled. The ENVELOPE. One address left.
SAMANTHA
This address...? I... I recognize
now. I think belongs friend.
Henessey stares her. As Nathan reaches envelope,
coat falls open Samantha GASPS; left
soaked blood.
NATHAN
Perhaps you'd best drive.
EXT. HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY - DAY
The house actually old converted MILL. Beyond it, frozen
landscape stretches lakeshore. In BARNYARD,
scruffy looking COWBOY TYPE splitting logs tree stump.
Drops axe. Scoops armload firewood. Comes
corner --
Drops logs, startled. AN UNLIKELY TRIO approaches. NATHAN,
sweating. Pasty. Levels revolver. Samantha says:
SAMANTHA
Don't afraid, don't want
hurt you.
(beat)
I want know are.
Seeing her, eyes wide -- He locks whooping
BEAR HUG, shouts:
MAN

Picks up, SPINS HER around, laughing... Henessey
Nathan stare. Befuddled.
TIME CUT - MINUTES LATER
The strange man (let's LUKE) stands awkwardly
dooryard. Shifting foot foot. NATHAN watches
dispassionately tree stump. Gun knee.
LUKE
(sighs)
Look, America's Funniest
Practical Videos something?
The DOOR bangs open Samantha comes house.
Carrying bandages. Alcohol. Crosses tree stump, kneels
Nathan. His voice harsh rasp:
NATHAN
Let it.
He bats away, administers aid. LUKE pipes
up, exasperated:
LUKE
I can't believe don't remember
dating me. Charly, please, pursued
months.
SAMANTHA
Yeah, well. I caught forgot
you. Sorry.
LUKE
It's December, you'll remember.
Right...?
He chuckles. Looks face. Stops chuckling, takes
sudden ground. Sam crosses HENESSEY,
standing nearby. Takes aside, whispers:
SAMANTHA
(sotto)
This ridiculous. What
guy?
HENESSEY
Don't ask me, I work here. Did
bump pelvises not?
SAMANTHA
It's possible.
HENESSEY
And kid, Cathead --
SAMANTHA
Caitlin.
HENESSEY
Yeah, whatever. Um,
the...?
SAMANTHA
I don't know.
(beat)
It's coming back, though. All these...
little details him.
She studies Luke. Frowning. Concentrating.
SAMANTHA
I know he's got pin leg,
car accident. I know cuts
hair... thinks Rush Limbaugh's
ass. I know sits
pees. I know --
HENESSEY
Enough. You're giving stiffy.
Just NATHAN hit dreadful-sounding cough. It
wracks him. Doubles up. LUKE blurts out:
LUKE
Goddammit, he's *dying*. Let
poor bastard ambulance!
Nathan grits teeth:
NATHAN
*No ambulance*. The car I ordered
soon.
SAMANTHA
Mr. Windeman, let help
you. I know man, I... I'm pretty
sure I slept him.
Nathan presses bandage side.
NATHAN
I'm faint... And
ambulance, I fucking
kill you.
He pitches forward Henessey's arms.
EXT. SHADED PORCH - MID-AFTERNOON
Beside lakeshore LUKE AND SAMANTHA walk side.
RACK FOCUS porch: NATHAN laid chaise
lounge. Henessey him, applying cold compresses. The
older man stirs, coming awake... Tries sit up, Henessey
nudges flat again.
NATHAN
Where's Charly...?
HENESSEY
Relax. She's Luke. That's
name, Luke.
NATHAN
Goddammit, I told --
HENESSEY
Yeah, yeah, weren't real big

Nathan groans. Henessey presses cloth man's head.
HENESSEY
The guy's story checks out. Sam knows

NATHAN
Sod that... watch them.
HENESSEY
Don't worry it. Chick signs
checks, I'm gonna watch aced?
Lie down.
Nathan swallows. Grimaces. Lies down.
NATHAN
Checks. You're fooling anyone,
dear boy.
(bemused)
You'd wash feet drink
water... wouldn't you?
HENESSEY
Cut break, nimrod. She's married
kid.
Busted. Nathan coughs. Speaks, eyes faraway:
NATHAN
My star pupil...
(smiles thinly)
That man Pennsylvania yesterday...
The diner, hers,
wasn't it...?
HENESSEY
How'd know?
NATHAN
(nods)
I saw news report,
shell casing thousand yards away,
helluva shot.
HENESSEY
Tell Daedalus, what's
story?
NATHAN
Arms broker, man face.
Veteran Baader-Meinhoff
Red Brigades. He's rumored
based U.S. Doesn't travel
much, say. Too afraid metal
detectors, poor sod's got foot-
long piece steel leg.
At point, Henessey stops. Frowns.
HENESSEY
Come again?
NATHAN
A pin, Mr. Henessey. A surgical pin.
He scuffs shoe porch dust. Eyes narrowed:
HENESSEY
Where hell...? I know I
heard somewhere,
a...
His eyes widen:
HENESSEY
Oh, fuck.
Points lake:
HENESSEY
Nathan, son bitch
*his* leg.
Nathan freezes, thoughts racing... swears violently:
NATHAN
You blithering idiot, son
bitch wasn't lover,
target, he's Daedalus!
HENESSEY
Oh, Jesus...! That's knew
shit, *dating* --
*studied* fucker
out!
He takes lake dead run. Behind him,
bloodied Nathan DRAGS feet lurches
porch, stumbling. Weaving. Refusing down.
AT THE LAKESIDE -- Luke walks Samantha. Talking softly
ear, smiling... She hears something. A RATCHETING
noise, drawing closer, hmmm...? Looks up. Wishes hadn't --
A BELL RANGER HELICOPTER descending lake. Inside,
TIMOTHY shoulders bolt action rifle, coolly professional.
FIRES, kicks dirt Henessey's feet. Stops fucker
cold. On shore, LUKE smiles Samantha, says:
LUKE
Sure don't look like ambulance,
it?
SLUGS HER IN THE FACE. Drops ice like broken
doll.
CUT TO BLACK:
Black indeed. Deep. Empty. Out darkness, hear
NEWS COMMENTATOR. Voice scratchy. Indistinct. Far away
long ago...
A TELEVISION IMAGE fills screen. Black white. Grainy.
The legend: BELFAST, NORTHERN IRELAND, footage

looking BRIGADIER speaking off-camera reporter:
BRIGADIER

know, counterpart

groups.
An ANNOUNCER's face replaces him:
ANNOUNCER

President Nixon concurs that...
PULL BACK TO REVEAL
A battered TV, volume turned low. Snoozing chair,
rumpled older man -- It's BRIGADIER, saw
speaking TV. A CALENDAR table identifies date
June 23, 1971.
IN THE NEXT ROOM
Girlish decor. Pinups rock stars. A YOUNG GIRL awake,
dressed currently stuffing pillows blanket.
She inspects handiwork. Human-looking lump. Turns,
satisfied.
One look WOODEN JESUS wall -- Creeps
room. Past sleeping Brigadier. To door.
She checks shoulder, nervous. Taps digits.
Shuts alarm. Unlocks door slips out.
EXT. STREET - BELFAST - NIGHT
The boy's GREGORY. Sixteen, quick, easy grin.
Huddled beneath tree him, girl gelatin.
GREGORY
You've boy,

GIRL
There's odd it. I'm

GREGORY
Rubbish.
GIRL

GREGORY

GIRL
Look, I'm ignorant? It's
father, stay place,

GREGORY
Saw telly. Think he'd
kill me? I'm nasty one, I am.
He slides hand sweater. She stiffens, terrified
exhilarated, gently strokes nipple thumb.
GREGORY
You know what, I'll bet you've
kissed boy... now, you?
(beat)
Aye, want to...
He leans in. She leans forward. A jerky, tentative duckling
road swan-dom. Their lips touch.
Across road, THE WINDOWS BLOW OUT father's flat.
She spins, scream caught throat -- ARMED MEN rush
house. Through door, left unlocked.
Stutter SMALL ARMS FIRE. She whirls Gregory, realizes
guy LAUGHING.
GREGORY
Thanks shutting alarm,
bloody Papist bitch.
He slaps face.
GREGORY
Tell press Ulster Force claims
credit.
He spins flees.
INT. BRIGADIER'S FLAT - MOMENTS LATER
Girl, moving. Walls racing past, shot PIECES, run run run
bedroom LURCHES stop, screaming:
GIRL
*DA*!
Propped wall. By bed. He's alive.
Incredibly. The man DRAGGED here. He refused
die, simply couldn't, see... Not reached
daughter.
ANGLE ON BED
Two pillows, jammed beneath blanket. The Brigadier
stares them. His face slack. White gastly. Shifts
gaze daughter. Tears running dulled eyes.
BRIGADIER
How much...
He raises pistol head.
BRIGADIER
...did pay you...?
He fires. On young girl's dissolve insanity FADE
OUT... Sound, echoing away. Blackness, total.
FADE IN:
INT. BASEMENT OF OLD MILL - NIGHT
Waking slow.
Samantha opens eyes. Blinks. Hazy, focus. Tries
rub eyes, can't. Hands. Something's wrong,
hell'd hands...? Ah. They're stretched
head. BOUND WITH CORD. Suddenly she's awake.
ANOTHER ANGLE
The basement old converted mill. A drafty, windswept
place old, broken timbers. A river runs it.
A stream, rate. The waters frozen now.
Above stream -- A GREAT WOODEN WHEEL. Smaller corollary
wheel outside. Mounted axis.
SAMANTHA tied wheel. Lashed SIDE, affixed
like goddess Greek sailing ship. Now bad
news, ice chopped away wheel TURN...
And plunge Samantha UNDER THE FREEZING WATER. Beneath
ice. Bound hand foot. Strapped wheel, wearing
nightgown, utterly helpless.
THE MAN KNOWN AS DAEDALUS (AKA Luke) stands her, giving
instructions ubiquitous TIMOTHY. He looks
Samantha. Seeing eyelids flutter, tosses cherry
wave. Gone gee-whiz country boy schtick; place,
frightening arrogance. He tosses cheeriest wave:
DAEDALUS
Well, good afternoon. If isn't
forgetful spy. How feeling?
SAMANTHA
Not-so fresh.
Samantha struggles bonds. No dice. Subsides.
Takes look predicament. TIMOTHY stands
edge ice. Watching intently. Smiles thinly:
SAMANTHA
You... you're... man
bar...?
TIMOTHY
Look her. She's faking it,
doesn't know Adam.
Daedalus shakes head, frowning:
DAEDALUS
It's I don't trust
compatriot, Colonel Baltimore. In
fact, I confidence
amnesia genuine --
showed *here*. You follow?
(beat)
Meanwhile, I got
reading papers, there's small
matter incident upstate. Long
range rifle shot, blew man
socks.
(coldly)
You I'm coming from.
I'm trying pull biggest
job career. I know.
How remember...
you've told.
SAMANTHA
I didn't tell soul, I swear.
DAEDALUS
We'll soon know.
He crosses large RED BUTTON. Set wooden beam.
Samantha thrashes bindings. Looks water
intercepts mammoth wheel. Fighting panic:
SAMANTHA
Is... torture thing...?
DAEDALUS
Torture, yes. The torturing
beautiful women, albeit politically
incorrect, addiction me.
(beat)
A woman looks beautiful
face distended
pain. Witness beauty
childbirth.
SAMANTHA
Please, I'm getting misty. Look,
untie me, I'll face
want.
DAEDALUS
Let's not, did. Do
smoke?
SAMANTHA
Smoke...? Um, no. Not... really.
DAEDALUS
Good. You'll longer. Now hush
yourself, deep breath.
We're gonna torture thing.
He hits button. An electric WHINE -- THE BIG WHEEL TURNS.
Feet water. Struggling. Arms stretched
head. She plunges surface. A new dimension
PAIN. Frozen, mind-numbing.
She WRITHES wheel. It's like crushing VICE
ripping limb limb. She opens eyes, briefly.
Discovers she's -- A mere foot face, THE
BLOATED CORPSE drowned NATHAN. Staring away away.
Blue cyanosis.
Meanwhile, ON THE SURFACE: Daedalus turns right-
hand man, says:
TIMOTHY
We're running schedule, I
secured tanker. We're borrowing
Carbide South Carolina.
Cargo listed retardant.
DAEDALUS
(nods)
Juice bird, head soon
I'm here.
He turns. Hits red button again. THE WHEEL reverses
itself. Creaks moans, turning --
SAMANTHA BREAKS THE SURFACE. Gasping air. Wheezing.
Choking. The FREEZING WIND plasters nightgown her.
DAEDALUS
Take air can, that's
right. If need vomit,
now.
Samantha, face twisted. Coughs. Wheezes. TIMOTHY looks
eye... shakes head:
TIMOTHY
You don't remember *at all*...? The
greatest night life, shit,
drown ungrateful wench.
He exits. Daedalus, captive. On features,
unbridled HATRED. He chuckles:
DAEDALUS
Talk Colonel. Is identity
safe...? The truth, I'll shoot
head. Nice quick.
Otherwise, you're long night.
*Who talk to*?
SAMANTHA
...Nobody... fuck you...
He shakes head, makes "tsk tsk" gesture. Smiles grimly
turns attention red switch.
DAEDALUS
Hate like this, Charly. I
heard helluva spy once.
Without warning, head snaps upward -- Eyes cold. Voice,
own:
SAMANTHA
Watch back. I'm yet.
DAEDALUS
That's funny joke. You're
entertaining woman. Good night.
He hits button. She plunges beneath surface. Daedalus
walks corner. Sits down. Takes pipe. Lights
it. Picks book. Reads. And reads.
UNDERWATER -- Sam THRASHES jerks, fro. Dead Nathan,
mocking her. There, water, memories come... In
flood. Stark vivid.
MEMORY FLASH - THE YEAR
THE TRUNK OF A CAR opens, revealing patch night sky.
Mostly obscured familiar individuals --
There's ONE-EYED JACK, remember him? Few years younger. One
eyeball heavier. The man TIMOTHY. He looks
trunk. Nods.
TIMOTHY
Okay, I'll signal Daedalus. Your
money waiting, Jack...?
Do favor, dump
her, I'm serious. Don't cute,
try play doctor first. I
mistake.
The lid SLAMS SHUT.
BACK UNDER THE WATER
The world rushing MADNESS, memories unspooling now, faster
faster --
MEMORY FLASH: A CLIFF overlooking ocean. Darkness.
Sheeting rain. Our heroine (for unquestionably SAMANTHA)
lying unconscious atop rocky bluff. Drenched.
ONE-EYED JACK produces SYRINGE leather case. Rolls
sleeve. Starts administer injection. Stops. He
can't resist... Can't help LOOSENING buttons shirt.
Her eyes snap open. And registers, she's
grabbed hypodermic plunged deep INTO HIS EYE --
Then she's running. Along cliff, car...
Jack, HOWLING pain, stumbling... Draws gun shoots
her. In head.
She pitches backward. Tumbles cliff...! Rushes
headlong waters below, getting smaller --
INT. BASEMENT OF OLD MILL - THE PRESENT
Here. Now. She breaks surface. Gasping breath.
SHRIEKS, sound ripped PAIN, COLD --
By ruptured sanity. She hangs there. Drenched. Half
frozen.
DAEDALUS can't help it. A chill dances spine,
watching... She afraid. She whimpering. She
looking directly AT HIM. With sick smile.
CHARLY
Daedalus... Make deal... Let
now...? I'll leave use
legs... Bargain, trust me...
Daedalus struggles recover poise.
DAEDALUS
How me? Who knows
place, WHO HAVE YOU TOLD?
Charly's eyes bore his:
CHARLY
I let touch me, cowboy... I think
I need bath.
Daedalus stabs red button. THE BIG WHEEL TURNS... Into
water goes Charly. Going time.
UNDER THE WATER - HELL - SAME
Here again, world silence blinding PAIN.
Despair madness there's -- Now
there's RAGE.
It takes losing FLESH right wrist...
But frees hand. WRENCHES loose. The water turns
soupy red it. GROPES, blindly. Fingers NUMB, fucking
cold -- Breath, running out. No air. NO TIME.
She darts right hand forward. Toward obscenely bobbing
CORPSE Nathan. Does grotesque, jams hand
DOWN THE CORPSE'S PANTS --
Hideaway gun, it's right said, right Mr.
Wally. PSP-25. Semi-auto, steel jackets. She waits. Rage
inside her. Death hands.
MEANWHILE, BACK ON THE SURFACE
The wheel CREAKS. Groans. The terrorist western boots
watches emerge, face -- She comes firing.
The slug takes knee. Blows scraps. He
collapses, howling. She shifts aim. THE RED BUTTON. No
hesitation. BLAM-! Hits DEAD ON. Stops wheel.
Incredible.
Doesn't blink. Unties captive hand. BLOWS TO SPLINTERS
wood surrounding feet. Leaps solid ground,
ANOTHER ANGLE
Daedalus looks prone position. In agony. A vision
Hell approaches: A fiendish blue-skinned woman
sodden nightgown. Blood leaking wrist. She risen,
REBORN, icy waters.
DAEDALUS
Samantha... Please...!
CHARLY
Who's Samantha?
She shoots knee. He HOWLS. Gun, empty. She
tosses aside. In nearby crate: ASSAULT RIFLES. Snatches
Kalashnikov clip. Kneels says:
CHARLY
You movies, badguy says,
"Talk I'll let live."
We're gonna run variation, goes
like this: Talk me...? I'll let
die.
She fires again.
CHARLY
Where's Henessey...?
INT. ROOT CELLAR - WITH HENESSEY
The detective lies naked, bound hand foot. Beaten.
FREEZING. A single ray LIGHT tiny crack.
He hears SPLINTERING noise, door's ripped
hinges. Pause -- A FUSILLADE gunfire. Shouts,
cries. A heavy weight SLAMS floorboards him.
Through crack comes tiny stream BLOOD, dribbling
him, --
EXT. OLD MILL - SAME TIME
TIMOTHY bolts house, clutching bleeding hand.
Running hellbent leather. Reaches parked car. Leaps
kicks engine as, --
MORE MEN come piling house, shouting. Running
cars -- it. CUT DOWN IN THEIR TRACKS. Wracked
gunfire, bodies twitching...
And Timothy PEELS OUT, spraying mud, pull UP, UP, AND
AWAY... Into sky, moving higher, gunfire fading...
Until we're WAY UP, Timothy's car... OLD
MILL, tiny us...
It blows pieces. Sends flaming boards flying STRAIGHT UP
AT US.
INT. VICTORIAN BUILDING - CHAPTER HQ - NIGHTTIME
The door bursts open PERKINS stalks in, shedding coat.
His aide -- let's HARRY -- looks nervously.
PERKINS

HARRY

An agent SWITCHBOARD calls out:

ESTABLISHING SHOT - ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY - NIGHT
There. Thank you, New Jersey, that'll all. You

INT. HOTEL SUITE - ATLANTIC CITY - NIGHT
Waking slow Mitch Henessey. He swallows dryly. Eyes
creak open, struggle focus... Hears WATER running. A
shower. Squints watch. He's wearing watch,
knew that... In BED, naked. Chest swathed bandages,
hell...? He pokes them. Jerks head, hissing pain.
EXT. LIVING ROOM OF SUITE - WITH HENESSEY - NIGHT
Henessey lights smoke bar. Flicks match
trashcan. Starts go, stops... Reaches can. Plucks
tiny scrap: PHOTOGRAPH, ripped two.
A photo Hal Caitlin.
He pockets it, disturbed. Crosses bathroom door. The
shower stopped. Raises tentative hand, starts
knock... It OPENS. There, silk robe, WOMAN,
swabbing hair.
She breezes bathroom chipper, like nothing's
unusual. Notices Henessey cursorily. Raises finger: "one
sec." Lowers head shakes like terrier, spraying
him.
He stop staring. It's Samantha, *has* be...
Now she's BLONDE, though. Hair clipped short. Bobbed. Blood-
red fingernails. Red cotton shift, legs days.
Then, *smiles* -- it's her, Samantha.
Amnesia's over, folks, we're clearly looking
changed woman: This one's CHARLY BALTIMORE,
hasn't seen light day years.
CHARLY
Hey, Mitch. Glad you're awake. Uh-
oh, you're seeping.
She grabs washcloth. Frowns, says:
CHARLY
Here, look this.
With that, opens robe exposes breasts.
Henessey perks considerably -- SCREAMS RIPS

HENESSEY
Ah, hurt like shit!!
CHARLY
That's I distracted first.

CHARLY

INT. CASINO BAR - EVENING
Henessey watches, fascinated. All little mannerisms,
differences. Shaking match, running hand
hair... And missing thing, eyes constantly roving,
scanning. Guard down. She plucks drink nearby
table, steals outright.
CHARLY
See? Sit dance floor,
drink's free. People finish
dancing, think waiter lifted
'em.
Henessey grimaces. Clears throat, says:
HENESSEY
I'm confused. Gimme minute.
CHARLY
Take two, they're small.
She knocks drink. No hesitation. Henessey shifts
uncomfortably, lights smoke.
HENESSEY
Okay. Let's I buy it. You're

(frowns)
So then... Samantha, she...
CHARLY
Never existed. Like Nathan

CHARLY
Thank God. Look inordinately

Didn't need know that. A DANCING SANTA goes by:
SANTA CLAUS
(bad Caribbean accent)
Hey, lady, Santa want dance
lambada wit'choo. *Come way,

He shimmies away. Charly grins Henessey:
CHARLY
If I come way I wouldn't

She laughs swig beer. MEMORY FLASH: Charly's
bedroom DAD puts gun head fires, CRACK...
CHARLY
It's thought I killed.
Henessey huddles, watching closely.
HENESSEY
Your father murdered.
She nods, gazes icy waters. Speaks, voice
faraway gone:
CHARLY
When Da died, I went funeral.
12 years old, today I wouldn't. And
I overheard woman,
praying... She thanking God --
sounded happy -- thanking Him

mother. HUGS HER -- That puts Charly
seconds. PAIN, excruciating. Comes senses,
swaying like clothesline high wind...
CHARLY
Run... out...
CAITLIN
Don't away again, Please...!
Charly grabs Caitlin's head. Turns it. Facing TEMPERATURE
GAUGE. Red numerals: *301 degrees*.
CHARLY
The truck's bomb... gonna blow up,
RUN... I'm right you, go...
Caitlin hovers, torn. Charly summons gutteral CROAK:
CHARLY
...*Go don't look back*...
In end, Caitlin relents. RUNS, surrounding
woods... Charly watches go. Nods, satisfied -- Collapses.
Hits tarmac splays heap. Breath wheezing
out. Already pavement staining red.
WITH CAITLIN
As, seconds command, promptly DISOBEYS
mother, looks -- Stops dead.
There's corpse underneath truck.
It isn't moving. It isn't breathing. It isn't laughing
crying...
Or hurting, anymore.
CAITLIN
*Mommy, no...*!
Bomb forgotten. Danger forgotten. Her tiny arms pumping,
feet slapping pavement -- She returns mother. Grabs
knife-bloodied shoulder, oblivious wound. Jerks
forth. Frenzied.
CAITLIN
It's okay. I'm sorry I left,
wake up, come please...
CHARLY. Cheek pavement. One lifeless eye STARES.
Bloodshot sightless.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Government vehicles, pulling now. At edge
parking lot. 100 yards away, take. Numerous SEDANS.
The Little Debbie panel truck. AGENTS crouch cars.
Weapons trained wounded behemoth.
EXT. SEMINARY - SAME TIME
The door BURSTS OUTWARD limping figure emerges,
frantically signaling chopper: TIMOTHY'S got murder
eye. THE CHOPPER banks, coming low hauls
aboard.
PILOT
Sir, shoulder --
TIMOTHY
Fuck shoulder, knee's worse.
Just bring hold
steady. I'm leaving I know
bitch dead.
He grabs automatic rifle.
BACK WITH CAITLIN - UNDERNEATH THE TANKER
She adheres Charly's motionless form. Looking small
terrified. Whispers mother's ear. Soft low:
CAITLIN
Mommy, now. You stop it,
Mommy, stop little baby.
Stop it, you're dead, I know
you're dead now.
Face contorted, strikes out. Flails. HITS Charly.
CAITLIN
*Don't die*, now,
Goddammit...! Life pain,
it, stand *right
minute*, Mommy. Life pain,
it, bitch. *Do it*.
Tears coursing rivulets. Little fists clenched. Then --
It trick wind. Tiny aspiration,
breath fog mirror...
CHARLY
...mommy... here...
A solitary tear appears wide-open staring eye. One
fingernail, then. Scratches feebly. Toes, shifting. Seeking
purchase. A HAND, planting itself... TEETH BARED, rictus
pain... Rising up...
*Standing*. Full height now, flexing deadly arm. She
hugs daughter says:
CHARLY
...You're grounded...
Overhead, HOWLING rotor blades. Charly gasps
breath. Cracks open GUN... bullets. Swell. Scans
pavement... There. THE MP-5 machine gun lies feet
her. Twenty miles, difference. Across pavement,
farther away: Timothy's car.
*305 degrees*. Charly swallows hard:
CHARLY
I'm gonna gun, run
car. We three, okay? One...
Two... *Three*.
They break cover. Into open. A WITHERING FIRE ERUPTS.
Right feet...! Geysers asphalt, shot skyward --
TIMOTHY sprays blacktop above. Ruthless. Charly
goes insane. Lurches, crazed, cab truck. Thumbs
mike says:
CHARLY
Somebody motherfucker

year-old daughter, *Jesus Christ*...!
It's Christmas Eve,
*people*, fucking pull off! Do

CUT TO:
EYES SNAP OPEN IN DARKNESS. We don't know are. We
don't know are.
BACK WITH CHARLY - SAME TIME
The temperature gauge: *308 degrees*. She clutches Caitlin.
Shouting mic:
CHARLY
Distract him, God's sake
seconds, please, I'm begging
somebody, anybody, *she's

EXT. EDGE OF PARKING LOT
A sour-looking CHAPTER AGENT stands row cars
Little Debbie panel truck. Expressionless beaurocrat.
Lifts mic lips says:
CHAPTER BEAUROCRAT

Behind him, panel truck EXPLODES. A car
CATAPULTS outward space -- SMASHES DOWN atop sedans.
Blows windshields. Flings pavement

TIMOTHY CHANGES DIRECTION. Chopper again, SCREAMING low
fast --
CHARLY dives, rolls -- Comes MACHINE GUN
falls flat back, points skyward:
CHARLY
Suck it.
She fires. Blows chopper's TAIL ROTOR. The craft pitches
-- Dumps Timothy door. Flailing.
Head heels, FALLS -- Lands atop TANKER, right
silver tank *burns*. Actually SIZZLES 310 degrees
Celsius, steam pouring like vampire daylight,
SHRIEKING--!
CHARLY
Die screaming, motherfucker.
She watches slips sight... tanker. SIRENS
now, approaching. Wind, biting cold. Ground black bloody
moonlight...
HERE COMES HENESSEY, powers lot, pedal
metal. Followed distance yards half dozen
squawling GOVERNMENT VEHICLES, flashers turning.
Henessey stomps brake. SLEWS stop, tires cooking...!
KICKS open passenger door Charly collapses

CAITLIN
Hurry! The truck bomb!
HENESSEY
Yeah, yeah. What else, got

No, Caitlin, *don't check*.
He PEELS OUT.
CHARLY
Hey... you're bleeding...
HENESSEY

CHARLY
Right, sorry...
He inadvertently smacks light pole. SPARKS fly.
CAITLIN
*You're bad driver! Who said
drive*?
EXT. PARKING LOT - BESIDE THE TANKER - SAME TIME
They drag Timothy inside car. The engine ROARS
leaps forward, trailing FIVE -- Scarred
hideous, stares Charly, screaming:
TIMOTHY
*Somebody her, somebody kill
fucking whore, kill her*!
That's helicopter crashes. The pilot
flap arms -- Forget it. IT KEELS OVER. Rotor touches
pavement -- Blows pieces. They ALL go. Snapped off. Blown
like rockets direction.
TIMOTHY LOOKS UP rotor blade whistles right
windshield car. Shears HEAD. Blows
BACK shower glass hurtles onward, SPINNING

Strikes tanker. Boom.
Imagine God Monte Carlo. Tossing dice length
craps table. Now, imagine dice BURNING CARS.
EXT. EDGE OF PARKING LOT - SAME TIME
Henessey flies parking lot INTO WOODS
firestorm RAGES TO HEAVEN him. Cars, heading
way -- AIRBORNE. Fights wheel, swerving woods
him, FLAMING CARS crash down. BOUNCING
trees, peekaboo...
Some flying past OVERHEAD. Striking like meteors,
GOUGING earth. Caitlin screams:
CAITLIN
Don't hit cars!
Henessey favors foul look. CHARLY looks
sees ANGELS flying overhead, trailing concrete...
Then they're OUT OF THE WOODS. Car slingshots highway
races forward, SAFE. Behind it, sky aglow, SNOWING
fiery traces... Bits earth, trees, pavement.
OVERHEAD VIEW: As roar town, burning woods
CRATER approximately 150 yards diameter -- St.
Peter's Seminary longer exists... CUT TO:
EXT. ROADSIDE - OUTSIDE OF TOWN - NIGHTTIME
Henessey coasts road stops. He lays
head steering wheel, sucking air. Looks Charly:
HENESSEY
Sorry, can't drive... Are okay...?
CHARLY

...Are you... stupid...?
HENESSEY
...funny thing...? You aren't going
die... I am...
Charly offers soft, sad little smile.
CHARLY
I know.
Henessey starts fade... breathing labored... Reaches up...
strokes Caitlin's hair. Smiles her:
HENESSEY
Hey, gorgeous... know something...
got mother's eyes... don't

Slumps seat. Gazing Charly. A single tear
runs bloodshot eye. He whispers:
HENESSEY
Scared... nobody...
ripple... please... remember me...
(beat)
...Love you...
Dies.
Charly leans dash. Cries awhile. For herself...
Henessey... Godawful planet,
else. DISSOLVE TO:
INT. FARMHOUSE - SAME TIME
A MOTHER SITS glow Winnie Pooh nightlight.
Next sleeping daughter's bed --
beginning film, it's long kiss goodnight.
An elderly FARMER pokes head in. She doesn't look up.
DOCTOR
Um, Ma'am...? Ambulance here.
They'll right in.
The shadowy figure nods... Remains seated. Stays awhile
dark. Keeping vigil. Snow slithers glass.
SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. PALATIAL GEORGETOWN ESTATE - EARLY MORNING
MR. PERKINS emerges guest cottage, flanked

Harry's FOOT comes circular slab STONE --
voice grave says:

Stops tracks, stops dead --
As CHARLY BALTIMORE steps nearby trees. Stands,

Thumbs metal box, click-! A red ARMING LIGHT blinks on.
CHARLY

He swallows hard. Looks aide... her... DIALS.
Charly takes deep breath. Scans flowers, face placid.
It's lovely today. Maybe she'll start garden.
Perkins clicks off. Look Charly:
PERKINS
It's done. Now, promise...

CHARLY

She smiles. Shifts aim shoots guy.
Perkins' eyes WIDEN sudden realization. He LUNGES forward,

ways back.
CHARLY
He's greatest shape either.
INTERCUT - PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
He speaks oval office, face grave:
PRESIDENT

EXT. HOUSE - EDGE OF WHEATFIELD - TWILIGHT
Sun, passing mystery. Wheatfield, rippling. Caitlin
yard, chasing big floppy-eared Labrador.
On porch, CRICKET chirps. HAL comes out, sits
wife CHARLY finishes eating. Says softly:
HAL
Just talked Dr. Sullivan, she's
gonna need braces. Even
teaching, insurance won't
cover it... I don't know do.
Pause. Charly says nothing. The dog parades Caitlin
stick jaws. A farm truck goes by, faraway
speck.
Charly absent-mindedly rolls steak knife fingers.
Eyes far away.
It occurs she's chirping
stops.
Ten feet away, knife quivers.
FADE OUT. ROLL END CREDITS.
THE END
