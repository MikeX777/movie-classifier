The sound C-130 air cargo plane roaring
cut sharply to:
EXT.AIRSTRIP - BASE CAMP - VIETNAM - DAY
As C-130 coasts stop, hatch rotating hot,
dusty lifeless airstrip Vietnam. Nothing

An uncomfortable look them.
SERGENT
Okay, let's ...
As out, Chris' eyes moving body bags
loaded plane. Moving motley HALF DOZEN
VETERANS bypassing way plane. They look
happy. Very happy, chatting up.
They pass newboys - shake heads, eyes
mocking pity.
VETERANS

Nam, man, for-fucking-ever.
Chris looking them. They pass, man
walks slower rest, slight limp. His eyes fall
Chris.
They're frightening eyes, starved, hollow, sunken deep
face, black dangerous. The clammy pallor malaria clings
looks Chris decayed black teeth. Then
sun flares he's past. And Chris looks back.
Disturbed. It's man real. For moment there.
As ghost.
Chris walking, duffel bag shoulder, looks
lollipop sun burning hole sky. A rushing SOUND
now. Of frightening intensity, effect combining blast
airplane roar lion hardcut to:
EXT. JUNGLE - SOMEWHERE IN VIETNAM - DAY
The sun matches intensity previous shot

wait. They getting close.
The CREDITS continue run.
SUBTITLE reads: December 1967 - Bravo Company, 25th Infantry

A sweating white face comes view. CHRIS - cutting point.
Machete hand, whacking path platoon, M-16
other, looks like he's verge heat exhaustion.
Breathing hard, pacing wrong, bumping
things, tripping, falling, looks pathetic
naturalness jungle. An urban transplant, slightly
neurotic getting so.
His rucksack coming apart well, 70 badly packed
pounds banging noisily.
Behind BARNES comes, Platoon Sergeant. Then RTO,

snaking deep brush.
We cut FACES Platoon - seen later.
Young faces, hard dirty weeks field, exhausted
alert, fatigues filthy, slept-in, torn, personalized, hair
way past regulation length, medals, bandanas. A jungle army.
Boys.
Chris glancing raw bleeding blisters. Transfers
machete other, slightly blistered, hand. The kid
cuts - struggling trying, reserves
strength, smashing straight forward brush,
bothering look ahead. He smells something, looks around,
slows pace, eyes working ... base tree.
He moves past it.
And so, camera POV comes dead
decomposing 10-day-old GOOK - eyes starting sockets,
worms flies feasting.
Chris draws breath in, terrified. Barnes suddenly appears
alongside, hard humourless eyes looking annoyed gook
Chris.
BARNES

WOLFE (CONT'D)
(to Barnes)

Elias.
BARNES

ELIAS
I thought O'Neill's turn tonight.

Concluding debate, argument, Barnes rises. The
meeting's closed. Lt. Wolfe hasn't said word, looking Elias
departs, word.
O'NEILL

His resentment directed partly way Elias carries

GARDNER
(admiring)
Yeah she's right ... that's Lucy Jean.
She's a-waiting me.
CHRIS

Yeah she's real pretty, you're lucky ...
Gardner puts away. Elias appears alongside them, checking

He carries modified M-16 short barrel collapsible

leadership.
BARNES
Okay, let's out.
As follows King, point, perimeter. A single file.
EXT. THE AMBUSH NIGHT (RAIN)
Night coming down. The tone jungle sounds subtly
shifted - mellower, sinuous certainly scarier.
The file stops. King, experienced point man, listens.
Chris - carrying Tex's linked ammo - looks around, tense. Behind
Gardner, trying smile, starts whisper
('Hey Taylor ...') he's abruptly shushed.
The file moves on. Gardner's pack rattling little loud. A
weird rush cold wind rattles trees MONSOON
comes. A hard slanting rain, sudden, tropic.
EXT. RUINS - JUNGLE - NIGHT (RAIN)
A piece old Buddhist temple, sulky moonlight
state decay, jungle surging engulf it.
The Men setting quickly relatively quietly
ruins - alongside miniscule trail. The rain coming
harder ever.
Chris Tex setting claymore mines, raveling
detonating cords position, drenched. In far

CHRIS

Yeah.
(looking watch)
Hey Tex - you're minutes fast.
TEX

('tough luck', closes teeth)
Chris lets go, scans jungle trail scope. The
POV greasy blurred. He puts aside.
Suddenly series resonant SNORES crack jungle.
Chris starts, sees it's JUNIOR lying there,
spreadeagled rain. Chris prods him.
CHRIS
Junior!
JUNIOR
Unh? ... Unh.
CHRIS
Shaddup! You're snoring ... Shhh.
Bending low eardrum. Junior wakes, rolls
growl. Silence.
CUT TO:
EXT. CHRIS' POSITION - NIGHT (RAIN)
Later. A pool muddy water formed, pair
buttocks sit. Move Chris duty, looking

A large RIPPING SOUND wind blows big tree branch
jungle floor. He starts, peering out. Nothing. He
looks watch again.

He moves Junior, shakes him, Junior
world.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
Wake up!
Junior opens dead eye.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
It's shift, man ...
Junior scowls, swears, looks rifle mud.
Chris crawls position, curling
soaked poncho, teeth chattering cold, rain splattering
him. A long beat. He sighs, sigh kicking
image.
EXT. CHRIS' POSITION - NIGHT
Chris jerks awake - suddenly, frightened. THE RAIN HAS
STOPPED. The jungle sounds loud. Cicadas, night animals,
water dripping hypnotically leaf leaf. And whirr
million mosquitoes rains, chewing Chris' face.
He looks around, startled.
Tex asleep. Junior asleep. What happened? He looks
watch. The mosquitoes eating alive. He buries
head green towel wears neck,
can't see. A beat. He moves again, miserable bites.
Another beat. Then suddenly sounds jungle shift -
animals dropping out. A different tone. A piece
wood stepped on, rustle bush ...
Chris sees something, lifts edge towel peek out.
A shoadow figure frozen 15
yards. It looks like man. But doesn't move. At all. It
listens.
Chris, heart mouth, tries peer it. It's
bush. It be. No human stand still. His
heartbeats up. The moments forever. But deep -
psyche - knows is.
The figure shifts, slightly - moves. It IS
human being. Oh God!
Chris looks around. Tex like mile away. Why doesn't
fire! He casts desperate look rifle,
grenades encrusted mud, spite training,
frozen indecision fear sight enemy.
The figure whisper back, turns comes
trail. Now second figure appear
- helmets packs. All coming right past Chris'
position. Ten yards. Nine.
Chris rigid terror. Stark eyes. Pleading Tex
wake up, reach. He anxiety
attack, heartbeats far sure hear him.
The figure directly Chris trail,
looking left right. A rattle equipment, creak
leather. A smell. The man's face catches moonlight
eyes come Chris.
Oriental eyes. Looking right him. Startled. Chris staring
back, hypnotized. It happens fast. The figure murmurs
Vietnamese. A warning. He swivels.
A flash muzzle fire. A raking cough automatic fire. A
grenade explosion.
Chris hurled ground, helmet bouncing off, scattered,
confused, jarred. All hell breaks loose NOISE
SHOUTS.
Tex, kissing ground, yelling him.
TEX
THE CLAYMORE! GET THOSE FUCKERS!
Chris, knowing he's doing, fumbling claymore
handles, presses them. INSERT: They won't give. He tries
squeeze life them. Tex screaming

TEX (CONT'D)
THE SAFETY! TAKE THE SAFETY OFF YOU ...
Lunges grabs handle Chris. Clicks safeties
blows them.
Three EXPLOSIONS rip night - ENEMY

O'Neill throws grenade, wild.
EXT. CHRIS' POSITION - NIGHT
An explosion. Chris hits deck.
Tex M-60 machine gun, yelling Junior
cringing ground.
TEX

He lays red tracer bullets like laser beams, suddenly
reels back, whiplashed, screaming. A grenade explosion rocks

TEX (CONT'D)
AAAAAGHHH! MY ARM! MY ARM!
His hand wrist gone, face dirt. Junior
fumbling around, trying stay help
time.
JUNIOR
(grabbing Tex's gun)
DOC! GET UP HERE! TEX IS HIT!
Chris, looking front, clue what's going on.
Except slacking. Relayed shouts 'Medic! Medic!'
Other SHOUTS.
SHOUTS
HOLD IT UP! HOLD IT UP!
The firing ceased. A silence, punctuated occasional
shouts fast moments, enveloped cemetery.
Doc crashes bush, kneels Tex, continues
howl deep pain.
TEX

A moan comes lips. Junior looks him.
JUNIOR

Tex's moans maddening scary. Barnes suddenly clamps

throat, chokes words.
BARNES
Shut up! Shut - TAKE IT! TAKE THE PAIN!
Tex's eyes roll wildly, uncomprehending. Doc Big Harold
looking Barnes, wondering. Tex suddenly silent, shocked.
Barnes stands, icy glare, goes. Junior scrambles
Tex's side. Doc runs off.
Big Harold cradles Chris, big black hands like mother,
reassuring him.
BIG HAROLD

Most ambush assembled watching, Chris moving

DOC

But Gardner unconcerned. Things going head -

The expression Men watching slumps, hopes dashed.
Barnes springs Chris, straddles him, hand pushing
face back, hits hard. Once. Twice.
Chris grimaces, groans, helpless now. A flick sound.
A knife whipped Barnes' boot pressing Chris'
throat. Chris bleeding nose mouth.
Rhah suddenly spinning action, fast now, realizing
Barnes intends do.

We come Chris sees light flame.
A face smiles like death's head, large ugly

seen died, lives.
Chris feels unnatural fear passing him.
The Man stands, sucking cigarette, stretches. He
tall, towering Chris.
