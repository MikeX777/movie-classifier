The H.M.S. Dauntless slips silently all. The
scene calls hushed voices.
SWAN

NORRINGTON
An explosion powder magazine.
Merchant vessels run heavily armed.

dignitaries, merchants, plantation owners, families.
Another flourish, returns sword scabbard.
The silence broken loud APPLAUSE. Backslapping

But Jack's there. Murtogg Mullroy look around, spot

You look lovely. Elizabeth.
Elizabeth frowns, unable focus. Norrington mistakes
expression disapproval.
NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
I apologize I forward --
I speak mind.
NORRINGTON (CONT'D)

ELIZABETH
I can't breathe.
NORRINGTON

Elizabeth loses balance, stumbles away Norrington.
She reaches hand parapet steady herself,

EXT. PORT ROYAL - NAVY DOCKS - DAY
Jack reacts, pushes Murtogg aside -

Elizabeth hits water, narrowly missing sharp rocks.
A wave breaks, washed away
cliff, struggling feebly.
AT THE FORT, Norrington looks --
NORRINGTON ELIZABETH!
He leaps parapet, prepared dive --
lieutenant, GILLETTE catches arm.
GILLETTE
The rocks, sir! It's miracle

Norrington shakes arm, looks -- realizes
Gillette right. He jumps runs --

He pulls pistol sword belt, hands Murtogg;

JACK (CONT'D)
Don't lose these.
And dives water, swims Elizabeth.
Elizabeth struggles water, gasping air '-
swell rolls her, submerged -
UNDERWATER, Elizabeth drifts down, unconscious. The current
turns her, MEDALLION slips loose bodice.
The MEDALLION turns slowly, SKULL fully
visible. A shaft filtered sunlight hits it,
GLINTS -
EXT. PORT ROYAL - VARIOUS - DAY
FORT CHARLES: The British flag flies, blown
offshore breeze. Suddenly wind dies, flag goes
limp.
ON THE DOCKS: Wood metal fittings lines bang
masts. The wind dies, silence.
ON THE EDGE OF TOWN: A CARIBE WOMAN feeds clucking
chickens, frowns suddenly quiet ...
IN THE VILLAGE: A weather vane moves slightly wind.
The wind stops, still. And ...

Norrington rushes down, intent climb. Beyond him,

ON THE SURFACE, Jack swims dock, struggling. It

The dress falls like cloud darkness -
ON THE SURFACE: Jack swims Elizabeth,
quickly.
AT THE DOCK, Murtogg Mullroy help haul
Elizabeth water.
Jack climbs up, exhausted. Elizabeth back;
Murtogg holds arms head, pumping them.
Mullroy puts cheek nose mouth.
MULLROY
Not breathing.
Murtogg looks down; hopeless. Jack steps up,
drawing Murtogg's knife sheath.
JACK
Move.
He pushes past Mullroy, kneels Elizabeth, raises
knife -- Murtogg shocked -
Jack slits corset middle, yanks away.
Elizabeth remains still. And -- coughs water

Before Elizabeth answer, BLADE SWORD

He strips jacket, drapes her.

NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
JACK

Norrington looks bay.
NORRINGTON
I don't ship -- Captain.
MURTOGG
He said he'd come commandeer one.
MULLROY
(to Murtogg)
I told telling truth.
(currying favor)
These his, sir.
He holds Jack's pistol belt. Norrington takes
pistol, examines it, notes powder horn Jack's belt.
NORRINGTON
(to Jack)
Extra powder, additional shot.
Jack shrugs. Norrington unhooks compass belt,
opens it. He frowns reading. Moves compass
way that, keeping parallel ground.
NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
It doesn't bear true.
Jack looks away, bit embarrassed. Norrington returns
compass belt. Draws sword half
scabbard.
NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
I half-expected wood.
He slides scabbard, hands Mullroy.
NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
Taking stock: you've got pistol
shot, compass doesn't
point north ... ship. You
doubt worst pirate I
heard of.
JACK
Ah, heard me.
Gillette returns shackles, approaches Jack.
NORRINGTON
Carefully, lieutenant.
Elizabeth steps forward. Swann's jacket slips her. She
unconcerned, intent putting her.
ELIZABETH
Commodore, I protest. Pirate

NORRINGTON
One good deed redeem

Gillette snaps manacles closed Jack's wrists.
JACK
But condemn

Indeed.
Now Jack safely chained, Norrington nods

JACK
Finally.
Lightning-quick, snaps corset hand

Pistols drawn again, Elizabeth serves

JACK (CONT'D)

Norrington hesitates, balls fists frustration.
JACK (CONT'D)

Mullroy hands pistol belt Norrington. Norrington

Elizabeth angry frightened.
ELIZABETH Miss Swann.

Norrington's taken aback ire, wisely hurries
away. Swann drapes coat Elizabeth.
SWANN

Elizabeth shivers, finding suddenly cold.
Glances bay -
-- THICK FOG moves water. She
takes jacket.
ELIZABETH
Thank you, Father ... let
fashion
advice, please.
But accepts comforting embrace.
EXT. PORT ROYAL - TOWN - ALLEY - DAY
The fog creeps through, casting eerie twilight pall. An
armed search party moves street. They glance
alley-
On far search party. The men nod
other, continue on.
A moment, Jack drops hiding place beneath
eaves building. He wears manacles.
Across street shop barn doors, pass-thru
door set middle. Above sign black anvil.
INT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - DAY
Jack slips door, takes look around:
No windows. The forge dark, lit lanterns. Work-in-
progress scattered about: wagon wheels, wrought iron
gates, pipes -- cannon crack it. But
tool place; workbench tidy neat.
Jack startled noise: MISTER BROWN,
blacksmith's apron, snores corner, cradling
bottle. Jack gives hard poke. Another. Brown snorts,
turns away.
Satisfied, Jack sheathes sword, takes short-handled
sledge place wall. Moves glowing
coke furnace middle room.
Slowly... holds right hand furnace,
chain embers. The chain begins GLOW. Jack
sweats, grimaces pain -
Moving quickly, wraps chain nose
anvil, brings sledge fast, hard stroke
glowing links. One SHATTERS. Jack drops sledge,
plunges manacled hand bucket water. Steam
billows.
Jack pulls hand out, flexes it. Blisters form beneath
manacle -- hands free.
The SOUND latch door -- Jack dives cover.
Will enters forge, shuts door him. Spots
drunken Mister Brown corner.
WILL
Right I left you.
Something catches eye: peg wall. The
sledge lying anvil.
WILL (CONT'D)
(under breath)
Not I left you.
He moves casually sledge. Then grabs --
flat sword blade slaps hand. Will jumps
back.
Jack stands there, sword leveled Will. He backs Will up,
door. Will glares him.
WILL (CONT' D)

You're they're hunting.

Jack acknowledges tip head ...

JACK
You look familiar ... Have I

WILL

JACK
Ah. Then shame

So you'll excuse ...
Beside door grindstone, sword resting
honing guide. Before Jack react, Will

JACK (CONT'D)
Do think wise, boy?
Crossing blades pirate?
WILL
You threatened Miss Swann.
JACK
Only little.
In response, Will assumes en garde position. Jack
appraises him, unhappy Will knows he's doing.
Jack attacks. The men stand place, trading
feints, thrusts parries lightning speed,
impossible follow. Will trouble matching Jack.
JACK (CONT'D)
You know you're doing, I'll
... Excellent form
... But how's footwork? If I
step -
He takes step imaginary circle. Will steps
way, maintaining relationship Jack.
JACK (CONT'D)
Very good! And I step again,
step again. . .
(continuing step
circle)
And circle, circle, like
dogs circle. . .
They exactly opposite initial positions.
JACK (CONT'D)
Ta!
Jack turns heads door, directly him.
Will registers angry surprise -- vicious
overhand motion, throws sword -
-- sword buries door,
latch, barely missing Jack. Jack registers it, pulls
latch, won't -- sword
way.
Jack rattles latch. Tugs sword times --
stuck there. Jack mouths curse,
turns Will, he's smiling.
JACK (CONT' D)
That's good trick. Except,
again,
way out.
(points sword
door)
And weapon.
Eyes Jack, Will simply picks new sword
anvil. Jack slumps dismay -- leaps forward.

Elizabeth hesitates, choice. She holds
medallion. He grabs it, clutches fist like
hope.
ELIZABETH
Our bargain. . ?
Barbossa grins devilishly -- nods Bosun.
BOSUN
Still guns, stow 'em!
Signal men, set flags,

For time attack began, BOOMING

The pirates hustle follow orders. Barbossa turns away.

And that's there's sense

BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
You'd best start believing
