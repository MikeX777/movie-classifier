Dark hell inside. And tense. Arms training weapons. Moving
tight hallway, emerging into...
THE LIVING ROOM

clench increasing pain.
Nick surprised, uncertain. Betsy starts GROWLING SOFTLY *
Cantrell's side. Her head comes up, hackles rising. *
Nick glances dog...then Iger, sees stunned look
warden's face. Something definitely wrong.
The pumps whirring, plungers descending...
Rupert throws head back, mouth wide...
RUPERT
Ah...ah...AH!
The witnesses tense, confused -- hell?
RUPERT
Ah--ah--Jesus, don't HURT!
Rupert looks arms, expression turning sheer
horror, because: The veins turning angry red,
blackening, liquids course them...
RUPERT
OH FUCK, OH FUCK, THAT HUUUURTS!
Those coherent words speaks. From on, he's
shrieking bouncing straps, because:
His veins starting smoke. Noxious foul. The flesh
starts giving away, blood eating skin like acid.
Shock sweeps onlookers:

The techs dash chamber -- instantly gagging *
choking toxic fumes billowing Rupert. They *
retreat coughing, pulling door shut again. *
Rupert's screams spew forth toxic fumes...breath blows smoke

He takes hat off, peels moustache away. Darby pins
flashlight, finally fully revealing:

He displays prop gun rigged needles.
CLYDE
Tetrototoxin. Fascinating stuff. It
paralyzes you, leaves

That one's important. Feel.
You feel everything.

He tucks padded block Darby's head like pillow,
raising head better. Clyde moves
