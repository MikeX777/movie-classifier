Feeling pressure?
Rachel's eyes Jackie's face. Then, Ben,
distant swings.
RACHEL
Last time I pushed him? He said,
'Higher, Rache. It makes penis
sting.'
Thin smile. Now it's Jackie watching Rachel's profile.
RACHEL
I'm gonna buy white dove
Christmas. If I don't, you'll
fucking eagle!
Jackie keeps watching her. And quiet voice...
JACKIE
Ben born hours, went

Watches Rachel nodding, absorbing.
JACKIE
Somehow, blanket looked

RACHEL
(softly, turning)
And her...?
JACKIE
Took 28 hours. She wasn't
sure entering world.
Watches feeling Rachel's eyes.
JACKIE
The doctor wanted
her, I knew she'd come
time.
Rachel nods. It fits.
JACKIE
That's is. Don't let
anybody rush her.
Silence. A murmur...
RACHEL
I'll mind.
Rachel settles back. Her eyes locked away private.
JACKIE
(quietly)
What?
Rache smiles. That Jackie sensed something.
RACHEL
It's kids.
Looks over. Decides ask...
RACHEL
That thing said before. Pushing

An urgency that.
RACHEL
I got day.

RACHEL
You took fishing trip boys.

LUKE
(weary)
'...the kids camp. Their friends
here. Over there, I'll

crisis.' Did like that?
It did. People passing them. They notice.
LUKE
She called fight. The fight.
RACHEL
What it? You told
doubts.
He looks around. People moving on. Toward drinks,
dinners, lives.
LUKE
Can sit somewhere?
RACHEL
Let way. Hell, no.
And takes cigarettes. Her fingers fumble slightly. It
isn't cold.
LUKE
I told I loved her.
RACHEL
By way saying unhappy.
LUKE
Restless.
RACHEL
Excuse me. 'Things confusing

comfortable, safe, predict-
able. It's partnership, it's
juggling schedules. When I think

Dead eyes. And nods. Once.
LUKE

RACHEL
No, threw out. What
difficult woman.
Pulls box matches.
RACHEL
So I wait...
A single match...
RACHEL
For sign. The
fishing trip...
STRIKES it. Shields wind.
RACHEL
What figure, Luke? When

roommate?
Lights cigarette. As watches.
LUKE
(softly)
That's pretty ugly thing
said.
RACHEL
No, here's ugly. 'I love you, babe.
It's life I'm
sure about...'
Big draw. Never wavering eyes.
RACHEL
'But dancing, you're
lucky, I leave,
knows?'
LUKE
That's us.
RACHEL
Because you've changed much.
He puts hands her, gently. But flinches. So hands
come away.
LUKE
You want future.
Well, I can't darlin'.
I can't. She searches lovelight eyes. As
weigh it.
LUKE
We lives, step
time. We best can. The
truth future? A promise.
Is hope.
RACHEL
How promises
kids? About future. Do
shrug off, easily?
That slows down.
RACHEL
Maybe Annabelle deserves
broke family.
While mom around.
Stops him. Cold.
RACHEL
(quiet)
Hey. Just thought.
Flips cigarette gutter. Shrugs...
RACHEL
You got dinner.

Jackie's voice drops. The softness makes
menacing...
JACKIE
You've turned you. And
I chance. To
turn back.
RACHEL
(suddenly fierce)

The blast washes Rachel. And silence...
RACHEL
Now you're talking sense.
She looks beer.
RACHEL
All year long, I've watching

fices, signals them...
Thinks. Really thinks. Wants right.
RACHEL
And I admire you. More you'll
believe. And yet...this...
thing...has growing. Inside me.
Looks up. Straight eyes.
RACHEL
For better worse. I'm you.
And stands up. The swing shimmies wake.
RACHEL
I can't live life channeling
One True Mom you're gone. I
can't it. I can't it. I can't.
Do it.
Sets beer down. Stabs smoke.
RACHEL
We deal that.
And walks off, slowly. Across yard.
INT. INDOOR RIDING RING - TWILIGHT
Huge indoor space. Wood-sided walls, dirt floor. High corrugated
metal roof, birds flying, roosting rafters. A little GIRL,
keen eye TRAINER, puts mount
paces. In cold air, steam rises horse's body. It's
late, around. TRACK now...
...down walkway. Toward stables. A barn cat crouched,
stalking prey. We hear soft voice, speaking. One know...
LUKE (O.S.)
It like telling her...
See now. Standing awkwardly, stall.
LUKE
...that I didn't love anymore...
See horse, steaming. Standing patiently.
LUKE
...if I sure I'd
stay.
Circling horse now, Annabelle's back. She slowly
brushing sweat mark. Where saddle be. Her
movements stiff, mechanical. The soft voice continues...
LUKE (O.S.)
She said, 'This thing
partnership. The schedules,
chores, things
work out...'
Our ANGLE CIRCLING Annabelle's face...
LUKE (O.S.)
(softer)
'...for kids.'
The tears stand eyes. The set line small mouth.
LUKE (O.S.)
'...that's life I dreamed of.
And it's I wanted be.'
She swallows. Because cry.
LUKE (O.S.)
That's kind person mom is.
She's best.
Annabelle says nothing. She drops knees. Begins clean
horse's hooves metal pick. The sound
stillness.
And father watches. His heart pounding.
LUKE
I complained lot, baby. We couldn't
travel, we'd lost privacy,
chance things spur
moment. To live for...ourselves. The
way we'd started out.
He goes her. The sound feet straw.
LUKE
And said. Sounds like you'd
happier. If kids weren't around.
Crouches down. Very close child.
LUKE
I said. I love
anything. But sometimes... I
miss I've lost.
Annabelle stops working. Turns faces away.
LUKE
She said feel
way, single second.
So leans closer.
LUKE
She didn't want someone.
Who could.
Silence. He's staring head.
LUKE
You know, horse smells
bad.
ANNABELLE
There's worse things.
At talk. If whisper.
LUKE
Do know I told

A beat. She doesn't look him.
ANNABELLE

LUKE
(very softly)
That's right.
She hears honesty. And heartbreak. It makes turn...
ANNABELLE

He gets lost. Looking eyes.
LUKE
I don't want wrong anymore.
I don't.
LUKE
I want I'm sorry, I am.
And let hate me. If to.
She swallows hard. Her eyes moving face.
LUKE
See feeling? Where feel
different things once?
That's grown-up thing. It's
lot fun.
She shakes head slightly. And eyes water.
LUKE
Know mom told you?
She doesn't.
LUKE
She knew

But didn't want risk...
The hardest thing. He's say...
LUKE
...your hating me.
ANNABELLE
Cos loves you.
LUKE
Cos loves you. She wanted

He reaches. First time. Strokes hair.
LUKE

Winds fingers. Around hand.
LUKE
And you'll come through.
She stares eyes. And dead straight.
ANNABELLE
If I miss it, daddy? You clue
in.
Okay, nods. That's plan.
INT. BAR - NIGHT
The dimly chic bar. With soft upscale buzz. Where Jackie
told Luke cancer. Tonight, waits alone. Watching

...Rachel comes place. Spots Jackie room.
Weaves way tables.
And there. Slipping seat. Not knowing

JACKIE
Thanks coming out.
RACHEL
Neutral ground. What's up?
Jackie stares evenly. Her chin rests

Shakes head.
RACHEL
Maybe I don't want looking

Jackie waits. Thinks.
JACKIE
Trade smoke. For secret.
The way said that. Something weighty it. So Rachel
reaches purse.
JACKIE
