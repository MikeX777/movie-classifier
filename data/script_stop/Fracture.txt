Willy shakes head, grim. Pacing.
61
WILLY
This isn't accomplice sort guy.
He slows. Looking room big Rube Goldberg
device. As moves it:
WILLY
This a...guy likes off.
He examines intricate workings, eyes travelling
clutter metal wires motors.
Checks Marchand - shakes head.
WILLY
You sure?
MARCHAND
I'm sure.
Willy grimaces. Fuming, relentless:
WILLY
It's physical object. It can't
vanish. We're missing -
step story.
He begins walking crime, "the stations
cross" - re-enacting it, starting door,
methodical, reciting himself:
WILLY
The neighbor sees home. He's
inside. She lets in.
A minute later: blood-pattern
says she's standing - he's
here.
Willy stands Crawford was. Raises finger-gun.
WILLY
Boom.
As Willy goes Jennifer fell:
MARCHAND
But carries there.
Why?
Willy walks path defined drops blood:
62
WILLY
Because he's gonna need time. To
confess. When she's
cop.
Willy stops alcove, looking dried blood,
discarded paramedic-supply-wrappers.
MARCHAND
Neighbor comes door.
Willy nods, comes - crosses foyer:
WILLY
Crawford shouts, "Leave alone"
fires rounds: boom-boom-
boom.
MARCHAND

(Beat)
Now he's got minutes.
And that's it. He stands imaginary gun

He can't.
MARCHAND

Willy won't respond - accepting apology means
admitting he's got left.
INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LATER
It's night. The house empty. Except Willy, turning

WILLY (V.O.)
Do dare stay out?

INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - DRESSING ROOM - SOON AFTER
Willy wanders Jennifer's spacious dressing room.
WILLY (V.O.)

For people waiting.
Waiting train
Or bus come, plane
Notices storage box floor, left partly-open

WILLY (V.O.)

shut, plastic tubing throat held place tape.
Willy sits bed, reading Dr. Seuss:
WILLY
Or pot boil, Better Break
Or string pearls, pair
pants
Or wig curls...
Or Another Chance.
He stops reading moment. Watching her:
RESIDENT (O.S.)

Willy turns. A work-weary RESIDENT comes past check
I.V.'s monitors. He's Willy's age.
WILLY
I heard - help - somebody

NIKKI

Yellow Pages.
INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT
Empty. Dark. Willy lets in.
He looks light-switch - finds complex
computerized dimmer-panel. He tries it.
Accent lights come on, buried living room planters.
He can't pre-sets work.
The crime scene creepy, lit like that. The dried blood
black. Shadows stretch walls, strange.
Willy grimaces, moves - sees panel
French doors garden. Goes -
- jumps back, startled -
WILLY
Shit!

Catching breath, Willy stares. He unlocks French
doors Nunally steps in, uneasy, haggard.

Willy watches Nunally stalk big, strangely-

A little worried, Willy takes deep breath. Gets work.
He days break open.
Walking crime again.
Playing mind. Standing different places,
getting different perspectives.
Willy stands alcove. Looking around.
There's here. But can't it.
His eye falls Rube Goldberg device. Moves closer,
peering mechanism.
Turns away: gun. But he's facing big wooden bowl
ball-bearings, sitting middle room
coffee table.
Hide plain sight.
He walks - pushes fingers in, feels around.
Nope. He sighs. Takes ball-bearing, rolls hand.
Goes device - drops ball slot.
The machine amazing. The ball rolls leaps
clatters - lights flash, elevators rise fall,
point ball lifts jet compressed air -
spirals sight reappears unexpected -

Willy grimaces. This guy good.

clues, dead-ends.
MARCHAND

Marchand gets jacket, pulls on.
MARCHAND
