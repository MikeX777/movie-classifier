His face missing.
EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
More snow falling. A handful cars lot. A

The suit far big him. Not matters now.
EXT. SNOW-FILLED RAVINE - NIGHT

He opens eyes.

Blood spills Nick's mouth. His eyes vacant.
RUDY

And Rudy's suddenly hauled backwards. A trio GUARDS
descend, grabbing Nick's body life fades away. Dragging
figure melee. WHISTLES blowing.
GUARDS
GET HIM OUT OF HERE! LOCK DOWN!
RUDY
NICK!!!
Rudy struggles, enraged, gets blackjacked
skull trouble. He hits jello-covered floor.
And world goes dark.
INT. PRISON CELL - NIGHT
Darkness shadows. Rudy sits corner, holding
head. The cell block silent time.
Bootsteps row. A SHADOW falls Rudy's
somber figure. It's Mean Guard. He stares Rudy
distinct pleasure.
RUDY

The guard grins gold tooth. Rudy looks --
-- springs feet, charges room, grabbing
bars. The guard takes calm step back. Keeps
cruel smile.
MEAN GUARD
You need company tonight, Rudy...
holler.
He puckers kiss walks on. Starts whistling "Are You
Lonesome Tonight?" Several shadowed VOICES request
shut fuck up. The bootsteps melody drift
row.
RUDY
turns back, starts bunk. And stops. His eyes
Nick's bed. And wall behind.
THE PICTURES OF ASHLEY
Smiling, laughing, playing kissy-face. Hearts drawn
photos. All colors stationery taped wall.
RUDY
takes seat Nick's bed. There's shoebox foot

Rudy opens it. It's filled Ashley's letters.
He trails finger them, pages.
He selects nearest front. Surveys it.
NICK (V.O.)
Rudy, man, go, here,
wrote here: "The car's waiting.
The motel's waiting. And I'm waiting.
I've waited long. I'm burning

And puts letter away.

EX-CONVICTS, trudge fenced drive, covered
snow.
EXIT GUARD

Secondhand shoes. No possessions.
He clutches sides hands, hunched over. All
huddle herd gate end
fenceway.
BEYOND THE GATE
There dozen FRIENDS RELATIVES waiting. A MEN,
WOMEN, couple KIDS. Bundled winter coats, hats
hoods. A prison shuttle bus parked them.
The released cons reach gate, GATE GUARD unlocks
fence outside world. Fifteen men free.
The ex-cons relatives scan other's faces. Wives
rush embrace men. Pals nod ex-cons trade
slaps backs. Reunion time.
The snow batters them, wind whipping. Rudy keeps head
down, leaning forward, keeps walking. Toward bus. But
can't help -- glances --
TO SEE A YOUNG WOMAN
bundled silver ski jacket, pink wool hat poofball
top, scarf mittens. Scanning released prisoners.
RUDY
drops head, looks away. Climbs shuttle bus.
INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS
Rudy shakes arms, basking vehicle's warmth. Takes
seat back. A couple lone ex-cons climb aboard.
Then cons relatives start pile in.
Rudy's window steamed cold. He stares
lap, reaches coat pocket. Takes
picture Ashley, bikini lake. Stares it.
He rubs window sleeve.
Outside, woman silver coat turns way
that, troubled. She's watching ex-cons climbing
bus loved ones.
The woman looks prison. The guard closing
gate. The steel door shut. No coming.
Rudy watches sadly.
Aboard bus, seats up. Ex-cons feeling
wives, kids climbing absent daddies,
buddies jawing loudly 'bout neighborhood's
changed.
The woman outside alone. Silver coat, pink poofball.
Rudy looks bikini picture again.
Then shivering bundle.
RUDY

The bus ENGINE starts up. In seat Rudy, EX-CON
makes WIFE bratty KID punches
leg.
Out window, young woman scanning bus windows.
Then prison again. She turns worried circle. Rudy
looks swiftly away. Closes eyes.
RUDY

The bus door closes. It REVS starts forward. Rudy sighs
relief. The photo Ashley falls floor.
EXT. PRISON RELEASE GATE - CONTINUOUS
The young woman watches bus pull away, snowy
road. But doesn't feet suddenly stops.
The door opens. And Rudy steps out.
The bus REVS GROANS OFF winter.
The young woman pushes poofball hat eyes. We
look face time. Skin pale, lips
turning blue, it's girl pictures. It's

She watches Rudy's figure trudge her. Snow

And finally:
RUDY

Ashley nods. And Rudy sadly smiles.
RUDY
