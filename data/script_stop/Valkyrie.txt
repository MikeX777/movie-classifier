30 INT. SMOKY ROOM - NIGHT 30
Stauffenberg faces members Resistance.
OLBRICHT
We've considered Valkyrie.
It isn't suitable.
STAUFFENBERG
Not it's currently written.
GOERDELER
Excuse me. What Valkyrie?
TRESCKOW
Operation Valkyrie.
Tresckow explains studies Stauffenberg,
curious. What mind?
TRESCKOW (CONT'D)
The Reserve Army thousands
men city -
uniform. Valkyrie
secret plan mobilize
men national emergency.
26.
STAUFFENBERG
Hitler designed crush
internal unrest he's cut
killed.
GOERDELER
And use us?
STAUFFENBERG
The orders rewritten. A
subtle changes
reserve units completely
command.
OLBRICHT
Yes, course, but-
STAUFFENBERG
Now High Command
thought, say, SS
staging coup?
OLBRICHT
They declare military state
emergency.
TRESCKOW
And initiate Operation Valkyrie.
STAUFFENBERG
Hitler's Reserve Army,
Hitler's plan
command, automatically seize
power Berlin...
GOERDELER
(catching on)
While new government
place.
STAUFFENBERG
Precisely. It
we're fighting Hitler
Government, it.
GOERDELER
But Hitler's dead.
All eyes turn Goerdeler. Here go.
GOERDELER (CONT'D)
That you're saying, isn't
it? The central solution.
27.
GOERDELER (CONT'D)
How people
believe SS trying seize
power?
STAUFFENBERG
I'm afraid it's way.
GOERDELER
I'm disappointed you, Colonel. I
thought man background
appreciate more-
STAUFFENBERG
I'm soldier first, aristocrat
second.
GOERDELER
Yes, but-
STAUFFENBERG
And you're neither, Doctor. Now
want Chancellor, you'll
you're told.
A moment tension. Humiliated, Goerdeler nods. But
won't forget this...
BECK
(to Tresckow)
Can plan work?
TRESCKOW
Rewriting order thing -
distributing another. A bomb
disarmed, recovered
fails. In case we'd
willfully circulating written
evidence high treason.
(thinks)
It's best idea we've heard yet.
OLBRICHT
There one... small problem.
TRESCKOW
(realizing)
Fromm...
GOERDELER
Who Fromm?
28.
TRESCKOW
Commander Home Army.
Olbricht reserve troops

actually initiate Valkyrie.
BECK

OLBRICHT
He's careerist pig.
STAUFFENBERG
But who's gone high

TRESCKOW
Perhaps offered key

BECK

You too, must.
They sit. Fromm lights cigarette, leans

awkward things seem. Finally:
FROMM (CONT'D)
They tell you're critical

STAUFFENBERG
I critical losing war,

FROMM

Fromm casually stamps cigarette

TRESCKOW
Looking over, I'm
satisfied Reserve Army

STAUFFENBERG

Before Tresckow respond, papers:
STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)

More papers. Tresckow barely up.

A truck soldiers roars past. Stauffenberg,
Tresckow Fraulein Oven walk dimly lit

STAUFFENBERG
(to Fraulein)
If comes you, play
ignorant. Just tell them-
FRAULEIN OVEN
I'll tell I serving
German people. Then I'll tell
hell.
Both men smile, bit taken aback. Von Oven shakes
man's hand walks away, swallowed

TRESCKOW

Stauffenberg nods. Tresckow heaves typewriter

SPLASH.
They watch silence water settles, then:

STAUFFENBERG
(shocked)
Why didn't tell me?
TRESCKOW
Would stayed?
Obviously not. Then occurs Stauffenberg.
STAUFFENBERG
Do think Fromm reported us?
TRESCKOW
It's likely just...
unfortunate coincidence. Anyway
doesn't matter. You wrote
orders. You know better
anyone.
STAUFFENBERG
You don't mean say-
TRESCKOW
I'm appointing military leader
Resistance. Beck agrees.
STAUFFENBERG
But Olbricht-
TRESCKOW
We know Olbricht hasn't

A million thoughts running Stauffenberg's
mind. Fear. Anxiety. But knows do.
TRESCKOW (CONT'D)
One thing. You right

isolate chain command. The
slightest confusion crush us.
We need certain
conflicting orders

Stauffenberg considers moment.
36.
STAUFFENBERG
That greatly limits options
move,
it's way.
TRESCKOW
How it?
STAUFFENBERG
Perhaps it's better I don't say.
Pause. A sad smile nod Tresckow, moment

TRESCKOW

He puts hand Stauffenberg's shoulder.
TRESCKOW (CONT'D)

Stauffenberg unplugs phone.

Haeften clicks heels offers Nazi salute,

STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
Do know war end,
Haeften? The portrait un-

FROMM

Stauffenberg's good eye flickers. "Are insane?
Normandy catastrophe." Another glance
situation map shows Allied forces over-running.
But painted-on smiles Hitler's nodding cronies

STAUFFENBERG
Mein Führer, I may... The

STAUFFENBERG
But-
