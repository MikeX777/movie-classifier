"PET SEMATARY"

Stephen King
FADE IN ON
persistent summer SOUND: crickets high grass--
ree-ree-ree-ree... This dark slowly
DISSOLVES TO:
EXT. A GRAVE MARKER SUMMER DAY
It's plywood cross leaning aslant. Written crossarm
black paint faded: SMUCKY HE WAS OBEDIENT. The letters
faded. They straggling ill-formed--the work
child.
MAIN TITLES BEGIN.
EXT. ANOTHER GRAVE MARKER
A child's printing again, time chunk warped crating:
BIFFER BIFFER A HELLUVA SNIFFER UNTIL HE DIED HE MADE US RICHER
1971-1974.
MAIN TITLES CONTINUE
EXT. TWO MARKERS
I think shots LAP DISSOLVES. All silence
crickets wind stirring grass. Around markers
themselves, grass clipped short, markers
flowers cheap vases. Crisco cans, Skippy peanut
butter jars, etc.
These markers: IN MEMORY OF MARTA OUR PET RABIT DYED MARCH 1,
1965 (on wide flat board) GEN PATTON (OUR! GOOD! DOG!) APRIL
1958 (another board).
MAIN TITLES CONTINUE
EXT. FIVE OR SIX MARKERS
We can't read them; faded (or
"gravestones" degenerated),
woodland clearing's eerie -- well-populated --
animal graveyard.
We see: POLYNESIA, 1953 HANNAH THE BEST DOG THAT EVER
LIVED. HANNAH'S tombstone old Chevrolet hood,
painstakingly hammered flat.
MAIN TITLES CONTINUE.
EXT. ANGLE ON THE PET SEMATARY
From clearing, surrounded
forest pines. We graves--maybe 80 all--are
arranged rough concentric circles. On far
clearing end path spills graveyard
clearing. The end path flanked wooden poles
hold crude arch. We writing --
words arch face arriving path.
MAIN TITLES CONTINUE
EXT. THE ARCH, FROM THE PATH SIDE, CU
MAIN TITLES CONCLUDE. Written arch faded black paint
work long-gone child: PET SEMATARY.
THE CAMERA HOLDS ON THIS FOR A MOMENT OR TWO, THEN PANS SLOWLY
DOWN look arch. From angle looking
deadfall--a tangle weather-whitened old dead
branches graveyard. It's maybe twenty-five feet
feet high. At end
tangles underbrush look impassible.
AS MAIN TITLES CONCLUDE, THE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN
deadfall. And does, realize horrible
snarling face branches. Is accident? Coincidence?
Our imagination? Perhaps audience wonder. THE CAMERA
HOLDS ON IT
DISSOLVE TO:
BLACK. And white title card: MOVING DAY.
