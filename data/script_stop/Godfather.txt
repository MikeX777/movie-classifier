BONASERA
I went Police like good

DON CORLEONE
My friends, I didn't refuse

(rapping table)
I don't want near schools! I

customers, troublesome,
animals anyway. They
respect wives
families themselves. Let
lose souls drugs.
But done,
can't everybody running
please, like
bunch anarchists.
BARZINI
Then, agreed; traffic
drugs permitted,
controlled; Don Corleone agrees
protection East.
DON CORLEONE nods.
BARZINI
That's matter then,
peace, let pay

(noticing TATTAGLIA

But I superstitious man...and
