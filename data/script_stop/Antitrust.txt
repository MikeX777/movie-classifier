Looking (and ease) holds shiny,

But truth it?
They come stop windowed entryway. Milo watches

He walks right past Milo (who doesn't breath).
Delbert swipes open double doors, leans in: humming

Delbert turns around, heads hall... exits
building.
Milo waits beat heading end hall.
Using card, enters
A BIG SPACE
A studio-to-be, architectural touches like soffits framed
plaster-boarded. The portentous hum comes

Clearing wall sees:
A squat emergency generator sitting floor, powering

INT. DAY CARE CENTER - CONTINUOUS
He steps colorful carpeting, amid balls tricycles.
Kid's artwork hangs wall. He moves room,

COMPUTER ROOM
20 screens glow. They hang suspended wide, ringed
table, chair keyboard. Indeed, Gary spared
expense toddlers: they're flat, sleek, digital
screens. At moment, colorful, childish contour
drawings WHERE I WANNA WORK (e.g.: spaceship).
There dozen screens tables perimeter
room showing screensavers (eg: angelfish swimming).
Milo moves slowly table, studying screens.
Not surprisingly, WHERE I WANNA WORK drawings
desks tables computers.
Tracking ahead Milo, screen shows
workstation red pennant wall, rubber plant
end desk. Even contour form it's -- familiar.
Milo passes it. And comes it.
Staring it, sits. He begins typing. [The drawing
occupies screen, window he's brought
bottom, dense, DOS-looking code.] He types furiously --
numbers, symbols, backslashes. Whatever he's trying
challenge him. He deletes lines, begins anew,
frustration evident.
As works layers code, pixels
screen start in. The contour lines slowly dissolve

What's seeing? He wiggles jerry-rigged hardware
urgently, till narration crackles on:
MULTIMEDIA NARRATOR

dent facing Federal drug charges,

He hears voice Narration, answering unseen
Interrogator (sounds like Phil). It's job interview. Milo

Milo devastated, disbelieving. Now sees real-time ER
