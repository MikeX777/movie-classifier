STARLING LOOKS AT BRIGHAM WHO LOOK UNCOMPREHENDING. ANOTHER

SHINE ON AND REFLECT FROM A MIRROR INSIDE STARLING'S DOOR.
BRIGHAM LEADS STARLING INTO THE HOUSE.
HE CLOSES THE DOOR, AND TAKES HER TO THE SOFA.

ONTO THE PARK OF A COUNTRY ESTATE, THE CAR DISAPPEARS INTO A
SMALL DIP IN THE LANDSCAPE.

CONTOUR OF THE LAND. WE SEE A SMALL DECREPIT GATEHOUSE IN
STONE, AND, BEYOND IT, A FLIMSY AND ANCIENT BARRICADE, AN
OLD GAMEKEEPER TYPE IN TWEEDS COMES OUT OF THE GUARDHOUSE.
HE IS CARRYING A MUG OF COFFEE AND HAS A NAPKIN TUCKED INTO
HIS COLLAR. HE REMOVES THE NAPKIN AND APPROACHES THE CAR.
STARLING FLASHES HER CREDENTIALS TO THE OLD MAN, WHO HOLDS
A CLIPBOARD.

THE MAN AMBLES BACK INTO THE GATEHOUSE.
ANGLE INT THE GATEHOUSE, THE OLD MAN ENTERS, AND CAMERA
PULLS BACK TO SHOW, IN A ROOM OFF THE MAIN ROOM, THE FIT
BODYGUARD TYPES, WATCHING STARLING ON A TV MONITOR. THERE IS
A RAFT OF ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT IN THE ROOM, AND A RACK WITH
SEVERAL ASSAULT RIFLES ON IT. ONE OF THE GUARDS IS TYPING
ONTO A COMPUTER TERMINAL. HE LOOKS AT THE RESULT, AND
GLANCES UP AT STARLING, ON THE SCREEN, AND NODS "OKAY" TO THE
OLD MAN. THE OLD MAN AMBLES OUT TO THE BARRIER, HAVING
PICKED UP AN OLD CLIPBOARD AT WHICH HE SQUINTS.
THEN, SATISFIED, HE RAISES THE BARRIER, AND STARLING'S CAR
GOES THROUGH.
EXT A MAGNIFICENT COUNTRY ESTATE HOUSE.
A POTATOCHIP VAN IS PARKED TO ONE SIDE IN THE WIDE DRIVE.
AN OLD RETAINER HOLDS OPEN THE DOOR FOR STARLING, AS SHE
EXITS FROM HER SEDAN, AND HE SHOWS HER INTO A LARGE
OPEN MORNING ROOM, IN WHICH WE FIND TWENTY YOUNG CHILDREN
OF VARIOUS RACES, ROMPING ON A SELECTION OF NEW TOYS.

SITS IN A WOODEN CHAIR, KNITTING.
THEY HAVE STOPPED. WAITING FOR THE WOMAN TO LOOK UP.
STARLING'S GAZE IS DRAWN BY AN OLD, CREWEL-WORK "SAMPLER"
FRAMED ON THE WALL BY THE OLD WOMAN'S CHAIR. AND OBVIOUS
ANTIQUE. IT READS:
"DO NOT GIVE INTO ADVERSITY. DO NOT TRUST TO PROSPERITY."
ANGLE ON CORDELL AND STARLING, AS STARLING LOOKS AT THE
SAMPLER, AND THE OLD WOMAN LOOKS UP FROM HER KNITTING.
SHE SITS IN FRONT OF A HALF-OPENED DOOR, WHICH WE SEE IS

APPARATUS. CAMERA GOES WITH STARLING INTO THE ROOM, WHERE WE
SEE A HOSPITAL BED, WITH A SCREEN IN FRONT OF IT, AND
VARIOUS TELEVISION DISPLAYS ABOVE IT, ANGLED TO BE SEEN FROM
THE BED.
STARLING APPROACHES THE BED, AND LOOKS DOWN AT THE FIGURE
IN IT. WE SEE HER FACE, BUT THE FIGURE IS SCREENED. THE
FIGURE, VERGER, SPEAKS BREATH BY BREATH, WITH AN OBVIOUS
ELECTRONIC ENHANCEMENT.
VERGER

HE IS STANDING BESIDE THE STATUE OF JUDITH AND HOLOFERNES.
HE NODS AT THE NOTE, AS IF CONFIRMING SOMETHING. THEN HE
LOOKS UP.
DR. FELL
Cavalcanti replied publicly Dante's
sonnet. Do know it, Professor
Sogliato? I believe it's worth
time: Listen way makes

DELICATELY, HOLDS THE HAND UNDER HIS NOSE, AND NODS, AS IF
IN AGREEMENT WITH HIMSELF.
HE NODS, AND WALKS OFF INTO A PARK.
ANGLE ON PAZZI, WHO LOOKS AFTER FELL. HE WALKS BACK TOWARD

STANDING BY A LINE OF PEOPLE, A QUEUE, UNDER A BANNER WHICH
PROCLAIMS, "ATROCIOUS INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE."
PAZZI SHAKES HIS HEAD, AS IF TO CLEAR IT, AND STARTS TOWARD
