HAROLD
Tit tat--as simple that.
LOOSELEAF
You played violin.
HAROLD
You did?
LOOSELEAF
Yeah. I practically forgot. But

myself, "Jesus--who blame her?"
HAROLD

LOOSELEAF
If I hadn't it. If I'd said
myself, "Screw it. I'm going
let people

HAROLD
They enemies. We war.
LOOSELEAF
Yeah, Jesus--but wars

sometimes,
"Jesus--I'm going

(pause)
I sent 'em Heaven instead--and I
don't think one.
HAROLD
Goodbye, Looseleaf.
LOOSELEAF walks gathers things.
LOOSELEAF
So long, guys.
PENELOPE

LOOSELEAF

PENELOPE kisses LOOSELEAF. Everybody HAROLD acknowledges

He propels SHUTTLE door slams it. He faces
PENELOPE PAUL, speaks malicious calm.
HAROLD
Well--what here? A family.
PENELOPE
Almost Christmas scene.
HAROLD
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
PENELOPE

HAROLD
Money? There's plenty that.
Mildred got brewery. You'll

HAROLD dismiss request majestically,
PENELOPE cuts sharp, dangerous warning.
PENELOPE
I mean it! I that,
Paul. Tell
conceived love,
hate now. Tell
lives love.
HAROLD experiments inwardly responses kinds,
obviously saying himself, directing
hands. Nothing satisfies him.
HAROLD
Testimonials sort are--are
range. I don't
well.
(sincerely,
liking fail way)
That's failing, I know.
PENELOPE
(accepting ruefully)
I see.
PAUL
I don't care. I don't care
love not. That's
right. I'm going room
close door. I don't want

PAUL exits wretchedly room.
HAROLD
See you've upset him. He
merry hale came
home.
PENELOPE
How unhappy he's going be--alone
room.
HAROLD
He'll play rifle, I expect.
That cheer up.
PENELOPE

HAROLD

Hamburger Heaven. And

PENELOPE
He's East St. Louis
mother--visiting aunt.
HAROLD
Last I heard, mother going
alone.
PENELOPE
He's afraid you, Harold. He
knew you'd want fight him. He
doesn't know
fighting. He hates pain.
HAROLD
And you, supposedly healthy
woman, detest
cowardice?
PENELOPE
It highly intelligent me.
HAROLD
What kind country
become? The men wear beads
refuse fight--and woman
adore them. America's days
greatness over. It drunk
blue soup.
PENELOPE
Blue soup?
HAROLD
An Indian narcotic forced
drink. It haze--a
honey-colored haze
lavender edge. We
laughed, sang, snoozed. When
bird called, answered back.
Every living thing brother
sister, thought.
Looseleaf stepped cockroach
inches long, cried. We
funeral went
days--for cockroach! I sang
"Oh Promise Me." Can imagine?
Where hell I learn
words "Oh Promise Me"? Looseleaf

procedures hydraulic
B-36. All time

soup. Blue soup time.
We'd food
honey-colored haze,
edible penumbra
lavender.
PENELOPE
Sounds beautiful.
HAROLD
(angered)
Beautiful, say? It wasn't
life, wasn't death--it wasn't
anything!
(anger mounting)
Beautiful? Seven years gone--
(snapping fingers)
like that, like that! Seven years
silliness random dreams!
Seven years nothingness,
much!
PENELOPE
Like what?
HAROLD
(becoming dangerously
physical, seizing
battle-ax)
Action! Interaction! Give
take! Challenge response!
He splits coffee table ax.
PAUL
(rushing
.22 rifle high
port arms)
Mom?
HAROLD
What's this?
PAUL wilts instantly, attempts rifle
inconspicuous, harmless, meaningless.
HAROLD
What's this?
PAUL
Nothing.
HAROLD
That's rifle have?
PAUL
No.
HAROLD
Of course is. Is loaded?
PAUL
No.
HAROLD
Open bolt!
PAUL obeys. A cartridge pops out.
HAROLD
That's cartridge, I'm
mistaken. Gunpowder, bullet,
cartridge case, fulminate
mercury percussion cap--all set go.
PAUL
I cleaning it.
HAROLD
Pick cartridge slip
chamber--where
belongs.
PAUL
Gee whiz, Dad--
HAROLD
Welcome manhood, little
sparrowfart! Load gun!
PAUL
(bleatingly)

HAROLD
Too late! It's man man now.

HAROLD
With iron penis feet long.
Load it, boy.
PENELOPE
You're begging kill you?
HAROLD

HAROLD
I'm teaching son man.
PENELOPE
So kill you. You hate

HAROLD
I plan live years!
PENELOPE
No don't.
HAROLD
If that's case--what's
prevent killing myself?
PENELOPE
Honor, I suppose.
HAROLD
What handsome word.
PENELOPE
(wonderingly)
But it's balled head
death. The highest honor
death. When talk
animals, one, don't
talk killing them. You honored
death. Harold--it
honor killed.
HAROLD
If you've lived good life, fought
well--
PENELOPE
It's death, absence
life--no honor all. It's
worse blue soup far--
nothingness. To you, though,
it's honor crowns all.
HAROLD
May I continue rearing
son?
(to PAUL)
Load gun!
PAUL shakes head.
HAROLD
Load it!
PAUL refuses.
HAROLD
Then speak, God! Can fight
words?
PAUL
I don't want fight you.
HAROLD
Get mad! Tell don't like
way I treat mother! Tell
wish I'd come home!
PAUL
(weakly)
It's house, Dad.
HAROLD
(throwing hands)

(including
audience, inviting
share indignation)
There guest issues fought
here--or argued, least.
The enemy, champion
oppose me, East St. Louis
mother aunt! I

woman child violin.
PENELOPE
The old heroes going

heroes refuse fight.
They're trying save planet.
There's time battle,
point battle anymore.
HAROLD
I feel mocked, insulted,
sort satisfaction prospect.
We don't fight steel.
I fight words. I'm
inarticulate ape, know,
grabs rock want
vocabulary. Call East St.
Louis, Penelope. Tell come

PENELOPE

HAROLD
(emptily, turning away)
No.
Pause. He contemplates PAUL.
HAROLD
And son, son Harold
Ryan--he's going grow
vanisher, too?
PENELOPE
I don't know. I hope
hunts. I hope kills
human being.
HAROLD
(to PAUL, quietly)
You hope this, too?
PAUL
I don't know I hope. But I
don't think care I hope,
anyway. You don't know me.
(indicating PENELOPE)
You don't know her, either. I
don't think know anybody. You
talk everybody same.
HAROLD
I'm talking gently now.
PAUL
Yeah. But it's going loud
again.
PENELOPE
He's right, Harold. To you, we're
simply pieces game--this
labeled "woman," labeled
"son." There piece labeled
"enemy" confused.
Lion doorbell roars. PAUL goes answer it.
HAROLD
There won't anybody there.
That's new style: anywhere.
PAUL, aghast, admits NORBERT WOODLY. WOODLY high
kite adrenaline.
PENELOPE
(aghast, chokingly)
Get here.
WOODLY

He comes farther room, bravely.
PENELOPE
You fool, fool.
WOODLY

WOODLY closes door. PENELOPE backs away phone,

WOODLY

HAROLD

WOODLY

WOODLY
You're filthy, rotten bastard.
HAROLD

Just remember apologize

PENELOPE takes rifle PAUL.
WOODLY
You're son bitch.
HAROLD
Yes--well--uh--that's
statements
automatically requires
apology. Whenever feel like it.
It's sort like turning
alarm clock that's ringing loudly.
Your apology turns alarm.
PENELOPE

I'm turning alarm. I'm
turning everything.
HAROLD
Ah! The lady armed.
PENELOPE

HAROLD

explored famous jungle
years, armed
kindness, talent languages,
pocketknife.
HAROLD
(blankly)
I see.
WOODLY
You aren't going hurt me. You
aren't going hurt anybody

HAROLD
(quietly)
Don Quixote.
WOODLY

chief source agony mankind.
HAROLD picks rifle, considers it, offers WOODLY.
HAROLD
Here. Finish job.
WOODLY
I'm utterly satisfied.
HAROLD
You're making mistake. Obsolete

He aims rifle tentatively.
WOODLY

HAROLD
Get up.
WOODLY

HAROLD begins squeeze trigger, falters, lowers
rifle.
HAROLD
Can't it.
WOODLY
Thank God.
HAROLD
Crawl home.
He turns WOODLY, stands shakily.
WOODLY
Thank you--for life.
HAROLD
It's trash now, like mine.
WOODLY
New lives begin!
HAROLD
Somewhere city. Not here,

WOODLY
Leave rifle here.
HAROLD

WOODLY
Give word honor

HAROLD
For it's worth now, Harold
Ryan, clown, gives sacred
word.
HAROLD exits corridor. WOODLY looks
helplessly, apprehensively. Silence.
WOODLY
Harold?
VON KONIGSWALD, MILDRED, WANDA JUNE enter
stealthily. VON KONIGSWALD, pantomimes companions
quiet listen wonderful. All
ghosts cup hands ears.
WOODLY
Harold?
There shot offstage. VON KONIGSWALD delighted.
MILDRED sickened. WANDA JUNE dazed. WOODLY collapses
grief. HAROLD enters corridor, shaking head.
HAROLD
I missed.
VON KONIGSWALD expresses disappointment. MILDRED covers
face. WANDA JUNE sucks thumb.
HAROLD
The end.
Curtain.
