Screenplay Peter Briggs
EXT. DEEP SPACE
We OPEN TOTAL BLACKNESS, sea stars spread infinite
depths space. As TITLES ROLL, notice
specks moving; picking acceleration
racing us. Our perspective changes, catch quick
glimpse HURTLES past, gravitational pull large
brownish planet. Kicking SPARKS FRICTION hits atmosphere.
It manmade. Or artificial.
EXT. PLANET SURFACE - DAY
The planet dead, barren. Death Valley grand scale. We watch
object plummet wispy cloud-cover, emitting
burning embers falling ground way-off distance. A
BOOMING ECHO resonates dusty plains, settling
eerie silence.
EXT. FISSURE CANYON - DAY
We're looking deep gorge, dark sinister. A howling wind
whips dust sandstorm, reducing visibility zero. About
seventy feet there's hole rock-face
cave entrance, near peculiar SHIMMERING air. We hear
mechanical BEEPING SHIMMERING disappears, replaced FIVE
humanoid SHAPES clinging sheer rock - seven feet
tall. They PREDATORS, race intergalactic big-game hunters
permanent safari; clothing weaponry bizarre mix
aborigine ultra-hi-tech. In hands circular metal discs;
'smart weapons' cut stone purchase.
PREDATOR-VISION.
From P.O.V., fissure reduced THERMAL HEAT SOURCES.
The entrance registers black gaping void.
INT. FISSURE NEST TUNNEL
The hunters climb inside rim tunnel, wind's
banshee wailing. The lead PREDATOR reaches headgear, pulling
coupling pipes connecting hidden breathing-apparatus.
He removes helmet, clips rear utility pack, takes
deep breath air. A curious speckled pattern runs
wide forehead, marking
different others; addition, fangs mandibles
sheared away. We'll BROKEN TUSK, he's leader
hunting party. He reaches hand caress wall
tunnel.
Several feet rim, changes rock textured
biomechanical surface; swirling mass disturbing shapes. He
hurries forward response GURGLING-HISS team
something.
The PREDATOR holds telescopic spear scrutiny. Skewered
end shriveled FORM spindly legs segmented
tail; it's FACEHUGGER, stage deadly ALIEN lifeform.
BROKEN TUSK HISSES caution party; respond pulling
spears elaborately-shaped swords. Several shoulder-mounted plasma
cannons slide firing position, tracking owners'
helmets. Thus armed, cautiously ahead...taking chances.
One helmeted PREDATOR pauses, scanning area.
PREDATOR-VISION.
He switches variety different views; infra-red, ultra-
violet, enhanced motion-tracking. Nothing.
He's pre-occupied task, totally fails notice
skeletal ALIEN loom him, emerging biomechanical
growth floor. A barbed tail skewers PREDATOR straight
neck, splashing luminous blood chestplate. A
gargled DEATH-RATTLE issues throat, band PREDATORS
spinning time dragged ground. The
band extraterrestrial hunters time come aid;
set half-dozen ALIEN WARRIORS. The carnage
swift terrifying, blur motion.
Steel blades serrated biomechanical limbs scythe air, alive
CRIES HISSES adversaries. One PREDATOR pinned
tunnel wall, spear range. The ALIEN claws away
face mask, finds dodging ALIEN's toothed tongue,
extended pile-driver speed. He reaches down, grasping
'smart-weapon' hanging belt brings arc
terminates ALIEN's grinning face. Big mistake. The
close proximity ALIEN's acidic blood sprays
PREDATOR's head. While technology resistant
it, bodies aren't: viscous yellow liquid begins burning
PREDATOR's skin. He kicks skeletal corpse away HIDEOUS
PIERCING SCREAM, clawing seared face.
It quickly began;
question victors. The PREDATORS stand amidst sea
biomechanical limbs strewn like charnel house. As
companions begin carefully decapitate ALIEN skulls, BROKEN TUSK
steps corpses examine fallen comrades. The
PREDATOR attacked killed instantly; crosses other.
What finds causes react
pity disgust. His fallen comrade alive; mandibles
clicking frailly, half head burnt away. BROKEN TUSK watches
ailing PREDATOR slide steel blade it's sheath offer
him. He takes it, knowing done. Rolling knife
quickly hand - sort elaborate trick
seasoned Green Berets perform - plunges downward fallen
hunter. This unpleasant task accomplished,
BROKEN TUSK straightens activates wrist-computer. A dark
shape blots light coming entrance; small PREDATOR
shuttlecraft, sleek elegant. It hovers air little
loud HUM, extends ramp. The surviving PREDATORS leap
aboard, carrying trophies reserved silence men
returning combat.
One thing need done. BROKEN TUSK bends flips
sequence keys dead PREDATOR's wrist. A countdown
displayed unknown character-set, accompanied HIGH PITCHED
BEEPING. He turns swiftly boards craft takes
smoothly air, it's undergear retracting.
EXT. PLANET SURFACE - DAY
A white-hot fireball erupts fissure, result
PREDATOR's suicide-destruct mechanism. The shuttlecraft pulls quickly
away, disappearing clouds.
EXT. SPACE
A large spacecraft suspended orbit planet;
PREDATOR Mothership. The shuttle heads swiftly it.
INT. PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - DOCKING BAY
An airlock RUMBLES open PREDATORS file NOISILY
Mothership's docking bay. An OLD PREDATOR crouched strut
takes time carving block wood briefly
look them. Like PREDATORS themselves, ship curious
mixture old new. An elaborate frieze written alien script
runs wall, racks sophisticated equipment recessed
it. Hatches lead parts ship; BROKEN
TUSK carry ALIEN head them.
INT. PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - VIEWING GALLERY
The gallery mechanical rest ship.
BROKEN TUSK enters, pausing kind readout device:
cylindrical tube containing substance similar mercury
constantly changes it's mass shapes alien text. He peers
protective railing.
WHAT HE SEES magnificent: captive QUEEN ALIEN, nucleus
ALIEN society, fed giant intravenous pipes. Each it's limbs
tethered straining clamps preventing movement. To rear,
it's giant egg-sac glows throbs, suspended jury-rigged sling.
A SCANNING MECHANISM hangs EGGS QUEEN lays, seemingly
defying gravity. As EGG scanned blue triangular beam -
similar PREDATOR gun-sight - translucent, giving
view pulsing FACEHUGGER inside. This done, manipulator
carefully loads eggs pallet, sinks
hatchway floor. It's assembly-line frightening
mechanical efficiency.
EXT. SPACE
We pod ejected Mothership, rocketing away
planet deep space. The inference obvious; PREDATORS
seeding worlds ALIENS hunt.
INT. PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - VIEWING GALLERY
The blue beam slides eggs, suddenly changes
red, BEEPING rapidly. BROKEN TUSK sees flowing display-tank alter
rotating simulation ALIEN WARRIOR skull
representation QUEEN's head. The manipulator arm swiftly grasps
EGG question moves protrusion floor.
The causes QUEEN
berserk, straining bonds SHRIEKING ferociously. She's
obviously knows what's happen.
The protrusionsplits open, spilling intense white light:
energy-filled blast furnace. The manipulator claw opens, EGG drops
in, more.
INT. PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - LIVING QUARTERS
An orange light plays wall skulls, casting dark shadows
long-empty orbs. BROKEN TUSK sprawls lizard-like flat
slab rock center room, inspecting formidable
arsenal weaponry. Satisfied, reaches run finger
jaw ALIEN trophy almost-erotic gesture. He regards
long moment coming decision kind,
finally getting feet.
INT. PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - VIEWING GALLERY
The lights gallery dimmer BROKEN TUSK enters. He
watches cherry-red beam gliding SCANNING MECHANISM lock
EGGS, runs hand sequence control board.
The manipulator arm swings over, seizing egg loading
waiting pallet.
BROKEN TUSK points finger QUEEN makes guttural
CLICKING SOUND deep throat. The effect unlike
child firing imaginary gun. As reading BROKEN TOOTH's
thoughts, QUEEN lifts crested head upwards emits venomous
HISS contempt.
EXT. SPACE
In CENTER FRAME, planet sits green, awash nebulous
clouds. A hulking METAL FORM ROLLS RIGHT-TO-LEFT view,
sunlight glinting it's surface. It's rectangular satellite-
construction comprised hundreds communication dishes
latticework steel tubing. We hear FILTERED HUMAN VOICES O.S.
Subspace chatter.
EXT. RYUSHI STATION - MIDDAY
Imagine world square mile covered canopy
treetop foliage, you've drawn picture planet
Ryushi.
Nestled lush rainforest Yutani-Templin
Communications Relay Station. Several inverted-'U'-shaped suspension
cranes painted bright yellow look collection
preassembled buildings roadways raised swamp
platforms, like truncated oil-rig. A navigation beacon flashes
intermittently tall gantry tower above, dominating
view sloping face communications array storeyes
high. Off platform gigantic many-wheeled
haulage vehicle. A flock bird-like creatures fly past.
INT. RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
We're dark womb split-level command center alive
clusters video readouts, somewhat reminiscent futuristic air-
traffic control tower. On upper tier, large circular holo-
display currently projects image satellite saw. Thin
trailers paper flutter gently current coming air
conditioning ducks, beads sweat dot foreheads
people manning consoled here. We CASSIE DOLLANDER
ROB PARSONS, monitoring technicians occupying control bank.
CASSIE listens carefully headset.
CASSIE
Ah, negative request commercial freighter 'Nan-Shan'. I've
got inbound approach pending beacon-fix. Hold
mark I confirmation. Rimward Traffic
Control out.
She thumbs button leans PARSONS.
CASSIE (CONT'D)
How's looking?
PARSONS worriedly shakes head.
PARSONS
That's second time I ran it, reads same.
CASSIE
Better tell boss.
PARSONS pulls coin.
PARSONS
Toss it.
INT. RYUSHI STATION - EXECUTIVE OFFICE
HIROKO NOGUCHI sweating heavily, black forelock hair falling
Oriental features. Her eyes flicker warily side-to-
holds smooth length sword her, trying
assess attack come. She doesn't wait
long; NINJA SWORDSMEN drop floor her, striking
hesitation.
She expertly avoid blows, parrying relentlessly. A persistent TONE
begins intrude O.S., like telephone RINGING. She tries ignore
it, concentration clearly broken. A THIRD SWORDSMAN appears
nowhere, sword SWISHING chest. The blade
plunges deep stomach, emerging back. She glances
annoyed disbelief.
HIROKO
Fuck! Holo off.
The SWORDSMEN immediately flicker disappear. She sheathes
sword precise movement crosses wooden paneled floor
desk. Mopping face towel, thumbs stud. The
RINGING TONE stops, corporate logo flat-screen desk panel
replaced black girl's face.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
Noguchi.
CASSIE (O.S., onscreen)
Something came Deep Space Tracking.
HIROKO
What kind 'something'?
CASSIE (O.S., onscreen)
Easier come look.
HIROKO
I'm way.
EXT. RYUSHI STATION - MIDDAY
An eight-wheeled articulated crawler rolls noisily rain,
climbing access ramp leading swamp outpost's
main-street. A group rhinos - brown two-horned quadrupeds
indigenous Ryushi - restlessly stir corral it's
approach. The crawler's pneumatics HISS gently comes halt,
distance dog BARKS.
DON KAMEN, lean man forties. climbs cab mounted
feet ground squints main relay antenna. He
adjusts cowboy hat head drizzle crosses
street buildings, ignoring Pepsi sign CREAKING
gentle breeze. A glass-paneled door SWISHES automatically open
him.
INT. RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
KAMEN steps command center, nodding familiarly DUTY
PERSONNEL. A long-haired labrador rushes KAMEN, wagging it's
tail. Her BREWSTER. She's base mascot. KAMEN reaches
ruffles it's fur. He climbs stairs monitoring tier,
pulling French-plaited hair ANNIE URIOSTE, Italian systems-
mechanic hands buried disassembled console.
URIOSTE
You didn't wipe feet coming in.
KAMEN
Well, it's okay. You didn't tell monsoon season going out.
PARSONS looks KAMEN grins.
PARSONS
Hey, buenos dias, cowboy. When d'you blow in?
KAMEN places hat PARSONS' head THUMPS down.
KAMEN
Just got back. Missed anything?
URIOSTE (snorts)
Yeah. We're beer.
PARSONS
Ahh, don't pay attention Urioste. She's pissed
Noguchi wouldn't let hunting trip.
KAMEN pours cup coffee BUBBLING percolator.
KAMEN
Wasn't trip, I driving. 'Sides, freezing butt
wet taking pot-shots local wildlife isn't idea
good time, either.
He sips gingerly cup scalding liquid.
PARSONS
Where'd leave them?
KAMEN
Camped navi-beacon Linson's Range. They're making
way tomorrow.
CASSIE
MarsCo went belly-up Dow Jones.
KAMEN
Shit. When?
CASSIE
Yesterday. We got Network feed Gateway; story
'Sixty Seconds'. Biggest market crash twenty-four.
KAMEN looks ill.
KAMEN
Fucking great. I invested money them.
CASSIE
You win some, loose some.
KAMEN
I lose 'em all, that's I'm rock. Anything
wanna ruin day with?
CASSIE
No, I got you.
HIROKO enters, pulling leather jacket.
HIROKO
What've got?
KAMEN nods receives quick smile trouble. They
turn watch display clear, replaced simulation
neighboring solar system.
CASSIE
A pair incomings. They popped-up medium-range thirteen
twenty-four local time.
PARSONS
We figured magnetic anomaly, ran back-trace
sure.
CASSIE
Yeah. Turns dropped straight hyperspace.
The simulation ZOOMS IN, revealing unidentified objects heading
planet center display. Computer notations
accompany them.
CASSIE (CONT'D)
Curious thing is, mass detector says they're small carry
deep-space drive.
HIROKO
Sounds like couple escape shuttles.
PARSONS
That's thought.
HIROKO
Have got updated Lloyds' Almanac cross-reff through?
PARSONS
Done already. Nothing matches.
CASSIE
And thought interesting, watch this...
HIROKO watches course objects simultaneously change.
KAMEN
Jesus.
PARSONS
Yeah, exactly. Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're
looking at.
KAMEN
Tactical nukes, maybe?
Everybody gives quick look, says anything. It's
obviously appealing thought.
HIROKO
Where're headed?
CASSIE
We ran trajectory simulation. If carry path, it's
possible they'll intra-orbital insertion.
There's great exhalation breath, swaps significant
glances. HIROKO worried. She scratches forehead.
HIROKO
I don't know this. Get copy telemetry relayed
Antarctica Traffic Control. Better alert nearest RimCorp
Base, too.
PARSONS nods, suddenly serious.
PARSONS
Fort Powell. What tell 'em?
HIROKO
Just facts. They leap conclusions.
EXT. LINSON'S RANGE - SWAMP - AFTERNOON
Down swamp, trunks magnificent trees terminate
gnarled roots disappear watery murk, like Louisiana
bayou. A group attentive LEMUR-TYPE CREATURES suddenly bound
cover line bullets THUDS wood nearby. Seconds later,
loud HUMMING NOISE intrudes O.S. pair manta-ray-shaped
hover-bikes sleek lines garnish decals SLAMS FRAME
suspended feet mire, powerful turbines kicking-up
swirl spray. The BIKERS skid halt watch CREATURES
scatter. ACKLAND YORK - men Earth called "good 'ol
boys" - riding one-handed; powerful hi-tech rifles gripped
other.
YORK (yelling)
You missed 'em, Ackland!
ACKLAND
Little fuckers fast. Let's sweep catch 'em
side.
YORK nods head, pulling goggles eyes. The
bikes ROAR pursuit.
EXT. LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - AFTERNOON
Up mud-bank, base sturdy gantry tower
blinking blue lights atop it, stands camp. It looks little like
Bedouin bivouac, up-close techno-fitted details.
A hard-featured woman seated solid-fuel burner sips
mug, Vietnamese counterpart manually loading large-caliber
bullets belt-feed. They
watch ACKLAND YORK roar past WHOOPING. MINH scrambles
way beer lobbed YORK CLATTERS ground near him.
MINH
Crazy idiots.
BEAUVAIS cups drink hands, assessing him.
BEAUVAIS
Ahhh, they're letting steam; don't let 'em you.
Ackland York aren't bad guys know 'em. Just
couple weekend warriors...
She peers curiously clunky cartridges MINH's thumbing
belt feed. On ground widebore weapon over-
the-shoulder guidance mechanism.
BEAUVAIS (CONT'D)
Nice howitzer you've got there.
MINH
Thanks.
BEAUVAIS
Good argument gun-control. What going after, rhino?
MINH
Nah. I wanna squeeze rounds. 'Sides, tagged
rhinos migration project, they're protected. They'll dock
month's pay mentioning it.
He peers belt blows dirt.
MINH (CONT'D)
Sure wish planet bit fight it,
though.
EXT. DEEP SPACE
Against sea stars, small metal shape HURTLES us,
followed moments later it's identical twin.
EXT. RYUSHI STATION - BIG BERTHA - AFTERNOON
A strand HIROKO's hair falls forward face, slick rain.
She brushes miserable weather. She KAMEN standing
twelve-feet-in-diameter wheels gargantuan haulage
vehicle saw outside base earlier. Up cab
painted Nordic Valkyrie impressive bustline,
legend 'BIG BERTHA'. Two mechanics, JAN GUTTIEREZ KEVIN
DILLER, watch KAMEN point HIROKO vantage
point KAMEN's crawler parked swamp nearby.
KAMEN
See sheathing suspension? Eaten away. Same thing
pumps base air purifiers. The algae isn't good
new plastics.
HIROKO
We haven't Big Bertha relocated generator module.
That months ago. I can't ask bringing spares
shuttle, it's costing is.
KAMEN shrugs.
KAMEN
If want things kept working condition, that's
choice you've got.
DILLER leans murmur quietly GUTTIEREZ.
DILLER
Maybe wouldn't tetchy got laid once-in-a-while.
GUTTIEREZ
You offering?
A buzzer inside crawler goes OFF. DILLER gets answer.
DILLER
Nah. Freeze dick off.
HIROKO shakes head dubiously KAMEN's comment.
HIROKO
I don't know. I think we'll run rota; month down,
month operational.
DILLER leans crawler's cab calls across.
DILLER
Miss Noguchi! You're wanted admin.
HIROKO
Thanks.
She turns KAMEN.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
Let sort we'll logistics office.
INT. RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
HIROKO peers display undisguised concern. A sense
urgency buzzes room.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
When?
CASSIE
Seven minutes ago, course change hour. Those incomings
going skim past communications platform little
close comfort.
HIROKO
Can different orbit time?
PARSONS looks board harassment.
PARSONS
Already working it.
HIROKO
Get all-bands emergency distress, repeater.
She meets KAMEN's eyes.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
Looks like right. Someone's lobbed pair smart-missiles
us.
KAMEN shakes head.
KAMEN
Relay station like middle boonies; bother?
All you're gonna punch temporary hole traffic control
net. That'd small potatoes terrorists.
PARSONS CASSIE all-business control board.
PARSONS
Can patch temporary loop DCMGS?
CASSIE
Okay, numbers.
She flips switch. A nearby screen changes display orbital path
sketched rectangular neon blocks.
EXT. SPACE
A cluster thruster rockets corner relay frame ignites,
darkened bulk satellite begins move.
EXT. DEEP SPACE
The pods ROAR immense speed.
INT. RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
The blips holo-board representing pods marked
alteration course.
PARSONS
They've changed heading again.
HIROKO
Compensate!
PARSONS
Punch solution delta-vee.
CASSIE
What need?
PARSONS
A three-second burn port, mark.
CASSIE
It's board.
EXT. SPACE
Framed green backdrop Ryushi, PREDATOR pods rocket

HIROKO
Match it!
A bead sweat trickles PARSONS' temple.
PARSONS
Not gonna it...
EXT. DEEP SPACE
The pod speeds THUNDEROUSLY CAMERA, blotting view.
INT. RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
One blips holo-display vanishes, three-quarters
monitors abruptly turn static. PARSONS curses.
PARSONS
Goddammit!
He pulls headset weary resignation.
PARSONS (CONT'D)
We've lost downlink. It's gone.
EXT. SPACE
The mass satellite tumbles end-over-end. A gaping rent torn
it; sparks flashes within. The second pod
accelerates curving atmosphere.
EXT. LINSON'S RANGE - RIVERBANK - DUSK
A SONIC THUNDERCRACK BOOMS overhead; YORK looks time
object sear dusk sky. He pulls bike stationary
hover.
YORK
Shit! What's that?
ACKLAND dismounted watches fireball hurtle
ground. A BOOMING ECHO resonates forest, followed
plaintive SCREECHES planet's indigenous lifeforms,
settling eerie silence.
ACKLAND
Meteor, I guess.
He raises set compact field binoculars face. THROUGH THEM
sees haze smoke rising treetops.
ACKLAND
D'you feel impact shock?
YORK (uncertain)
Not really.
He lowers binoculars frowns.
ACKLAND
Me either. I tell you, I mining outfit Callisto,
like hits... believe me, know it.
YORK
Do wanna head in?
ACKLAND (hesitant)
I dunno... I dunno. Something feels funny.
He looks plume smoke snaking sky.
ACKLAND (CONT'D)
That damndest impact I've saw...
EXT. LINSON'S RANGE - IMPACT SIGHT - DUSK
The earth crater-rim charred cracked;
surrounding brush aflame. A SCORPION scuttles inquisitively
edge pit stops, it's stinger twitching hesitantly. We
HEAR LOW HUM, SOUND METAL-ON-METAL. Before SCORPION
decide do, it's fate sealed. A large METAL CLAW comes
down, crushing instant. A SECOND CLAW emerges, MACHINE
heaves hole, it's surface smoking heat. It
pauses BEAT like giant tarantula seeking prey, moves
purposely outwards yards halting. A hatch
underside opens, complex delivery mechanism extends. After
moment there's LOW CLUNK, mechanism retracts. In it's place
ALIEN EGG. The MACHINE crawls off, vanishing long
reeds.
EXT. RYUSHI STATION - NIGHT
HIROKO sits wheel KAMEN's crawler, knees pulled
chin, staring mist makes night
impenetrable. Behind above, lights cranes
communications array strobe on-and-off. Above bar main
street flicking neon sign erected after-the-fact, emblazoned
words "TORCHY'S". The MUFFLED SOUNDS MERRY-MAKING
momentarily louder, HIROKO glances it's
pressure-door CRASH back, disgorging drunken people. KAMEN
follows through. He spots HIROKO heads over.
KAMEN
Hey, boss. Wondered you'd gotten to.
HIROKO
I just... wanted while. Clear head.
KAMEN
Didn't feel like whoopin' rest blue collars, huh?
She shakes head, manages smile.
HIROKO
I've got lot thinking do. 'Sides, room getting
crowded me.
KAMEN
Not socializing type, then?
HIROKO
No, really. More sort 'claustrophobic' type.
KAMEN LAUGHS. HIROKO straight-faced.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
I'm serious. That's I switched orbiting planetary
installations.
KAMEN
Is fact.
HIROKO
Uh-huh. Used pretty bad. I'd wake cold sweat
want claw open vacuum hatch.
KAMEN
How long now, anyway? Three months?
HIROKO
Four.
KAMEN
And that?
HIROKO
Six month stint Datus.
KAMEN
Only six?
HIROKO
What this? 'Twenty Questions'?
KAMEN
Just curious. There's lot talk goes around.
HIROKO shrugs. Thinks it.
HIROKO
I don't know. I guess I've I felt
home.
She hugs knees again, suddenly looks lot ease.
KAMEN spots square glass balanced tire's wide treads.
KAMEN
What that?
HIROKO
Real man' drink.
She offers glass him. He takes sniff cautiously.
KAMEN
Seltzer?
HIROKO
Want some?
KAMEN hands glass raises bottle.
KAMEN
I'll stick own.
He sits stares darkness.
HIROKO
Any luck raising Ackland's party?
KAMEN
Nothing. With satellite down, can't transmit mountain
range. He's likely sitting wondering can't raise us.
HIROKO
First light, we'll chopper tell head back.
KAMEN
'We'? You wanna fly me?
HIROKO
Sure. Do good stretch legs.
HIROKO takes sip drink, brow furrowing.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
This thing's got spooked.
KAMEN hops wheel.
KAMEN
Don't worry it. If Network goes book, like
figures will, Marine gunboat Powell'll drop-by look-
four-or-five days. They poke
hit us. All we've gotta sit tight.
HIROKO
Do think Ackland'll sit tight?
KAMEN
There'd helluva good reason to.

YORK ACKLAND wade chin-high reeds, cursing.
ACKLAND
Found anything?
YORK looks data-stick, handheld torch multi-

YORK
Nada. No radiation... movement... nothing.
ACKLAND
Well, looking. It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!
ACKLAND falls something, YORK comes running.
YORK
What it?
ACKLAND steadies himself, men shine torches
rhythmically-breathing SHAPE ground.
ACKLAND
It's rhino.
YORK
Is dead?
ACKLAND
No, it's breathing. Kinda clammy though. Are sure
stick's broken.
YORK looks data-stick again.
YORK
Yeah, it's fine.
ACKLAND
God, I hope thing didn't bring virus.
YORK
I told we... what's that?

ACKLAND
Looks like spore. Fungus kind, maybe?
YORK
Bloody big is. Top's open.
ACKLAND steps cautiously forward shine torch inside.
YORK (CONT'D)
Careful...
There's inside. ACKLAND looks disappointed.
ACKLAND
It's hollow. Think rhino must've ate didn't agree
him.
A heavy gust air blows unexpectedly clearing
BANSHEE HOWL, ruffling hair.
YORK
Let's in.
ACKLAND
Wait minute.
YORK reluctantly follows ACKLAND thrashes thinn ing
foliage, coming rim impact crater. It's beginning
partially collapse, water seeping in. YORK runs beam
shallow pit.
YORK
What that... metal fragments?
ACKLAND's maybe getting little nervous now.
ACKLAND
This fucking weird.
He sees churned earth, muddy trail leading
broken foliage.
ACKLAND (CONT'D)
It's like came crater went way...
There's TINY CLICK, ACKLAND looks YORK taking
safety rifle. ACKLAND wordlessly unshoulders too. They
step crater warily follow ragged path to...
YORK
Another one?
ACKLAND prods SECOND EGG gun.
ACKLAND
Yeah. This's closed.
There's CRACKLING NOISE, EGG peels neatly open
sections. The men jump alarm, YORK LAUGHS
nervously. Something organic pulsing inside. ACKLAND cranes
neck forward better look...
There's EXPLOSION MOVEMENT. A spindly shape long
segmented tail launches jack-in-a-box-style ACKLAND. It's
FACEHUGGER. ACKLAND trips backwards, caught off-balance. His finger
involuntarily squeezes trigger rifle falls. A volley
shots arc light night PERCUSSIVE
BOOM, we...
CUT TO
...A SHORT DISTANCE ACROSS THE CLEARING. SOMETHING watching
trees; heat-vision P.O.V. A PREDATOR. We

feet away. He watches hapless Teamster rigid, stop moving
altogether.
YORK
Oh, God; oh, shit; oh, God.
The FACEHUGGER's tail slithers tighter ACKLAND's neck;
YORK quickly retrieves rifle, we...
CUT TO
A PREDATOR-VISION SHOT, watching color-bloom YORK dragging
ACKLAND's body away crater. It CLOSES IN FACEHUGGER,
giving muted X-ray-type VIEW circulatory fluid pumping
HUGGER ACKLAND.
YORK's limping badly, dark stain blossoming baggy fatigue
trousers. ACKLAND's small man, physical effort hauling
reeds makes sweat profusely. There's movement

FACEHUGGER, dwarfs it's small furry body. The HUGGER's
fingers ripple simultaneously strengthens it's hold;
movement akin somebody drumming
fingers table-top.
EXT. LINSON'S RANGE - RIVER BANK - NIGHT
