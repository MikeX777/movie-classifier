BOBBY

Grace twists flails Bobby's hands, spite
bleeding stump, holds like bear trap holds grizzly.
BOBBY

She looks him, trying protest, shaking head. Grace's
flailing goes overdrive. Somewhere semi-delirious
state, Bobby's eyes notice gun Jake's waist
longer there.
Grace manages word:
GRACE

BOBBY
He can't help now, honey!
Bobby agony kills her, beast, lover,
kills loves.
Suddenly, SHOT heard. Bobby buckles blast, hit
side. He kills wrenching thrust
hands, breaking neck.
Bobby looks Jake's gun, clutches hand,
sees hole river blood flows
it. He manages stand, looks Jake; bodies lying
side.
Bobby, great difficulty, claws way rocks
car, fast-flowing wound staining white rocks
blood.
He makes and, losing blood, climbs
driver's seat. He checks money bag. All there. All
his.
As pulls huge clot blood side, vultures
circle. Perhaps one, smarter others, lands close by. It
spooks Bobby he's okay. He looks mirror.
BOBBY
You're lucky.
He puts key ignition, engine comes life.
BOBBY (waves back)
Adios --
Suddenly, RADIATOR HOSE Darrell installed blows apart
loudly. Bobby knows exactly immediately
cloud steam rolls hood. He shakes
head, frustrated.
BOBBY (sighs)
Oh shit!...(then) Arizona.
He can't help laugh bad luck. As rise
desert floor flight vultures, eventually
leaving specks earth vast canyons
Arizona.
THE END
