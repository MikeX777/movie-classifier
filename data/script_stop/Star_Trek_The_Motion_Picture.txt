44 INT. TRAVEL POD - KIRK AND SCOTT 44
Scott nervously eying Kirk, finally deciding
effort:
SCOTT
The crew hasn't near

that, untried Captain...
KIRK

little stale, Mr. Scott
-- I wouldn't exactly consider
'untried.'
It takes Scott moment comprehend, Kirk smiles
now, nods:

Spock immediately reply, peers Kirk

points distance:
302 ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING INNER WALL (O) 302
We SEE appear SPARKLING GLOBULES OF
LIGHT darting inner wall distance,
disappearing there. (We'll SEE swarms
occasionally too, coming different directions --
later identified "sensor swarms"

SPOCK

KIRK

SPOCK

New crystals: contain

And Spock touches new crystals (it

KIRK
Klingons... Epsilon 9 station

SPOCK
(agreeing)
Exact patterns. The energy bolt
