LIGHT SLEEPER
Written
Paul Schrader
SHOOTING DRAFT
1992
JOHN LETOUR, forty, light sleeper. Never meant drug
dealer, came along. He's things: messenger
boy, cab driver, model, postal clerk, doorman, nightclub
shill -- meant either. Now he's D.D. Drug
dealer.
JOHN LETOUR, well-groomed, khaki slacks, leather jacket,
tippet-like scarf, belt pouch, "Beatle" boots, shadow
drifting shadows, New York, day, night:
watching, listening, rarely speaking -- nonexistent, seen
sees. His face affable blank. Make
will. The eyes flicker; hands shift discreetly.
A map calculation.
Once drug problem. Life turned page. Today
follows instructions: sleeps light -- eye open,
anticipating. JOHN LETOUR, D.D., loner, voyeur,
drifting unknown destination. At mid-life
destination draws near. The circle tightens. The dealer
anxious. The destination love.
NIGHT IN THE LIFE
CREDIT SEQUENCE: New York night. JOHN LETOUR nestles
blue car service sedan, face reflected
window. Neon mixes steam, street people tourists,
young dates: different agenda, hidden purpose.
His beeper goes off. He clicks it, checks digital message.
The DRIVER stops uptown corner. LETOUR opens
curbside door, motions DRIVER he'll "ten"
minutes. He enters video laundromat, twenty-four-hour
video rental/laundromat/tanning salon.
Inside, meets RETRO-YUPPIE (J. Crew Division)
"Classics" section. They exit.
On sidewalk, money exchanged packet. LETOUR
pockets uncounted cash. The YUPPIE mouths goodbye, eager
distance LETOUR. JOHN checks
beeper, stops pay phone, dials.
JOHN LETOUR re-enters sedan; DRIVER heads downtown.
High-rises way Tudor City. Uncollected trash lines
curbs. LETOUR eyes PEDESTRIAN; PEDESTRIAN looks back.
Later. Three a.m. The streets dark. LeTour's car passes
glowing Korean market.
LETOUR narrates diary:
LETOUR
(voice over)
Labor Day weekend. Some time
sanitation strike. Everybody crazy
stock up. They decide score
minute want now.
Never fails. The faces look alike.
You gotta use memory tricks:
peculiarity -- keeps
sharp. A D.D. told drug
dealer starts writing diary it's
time quit. I started writing
that. Not night --
then. Just burn night.
Fill book, throw out, start
another.
The sedan drives on. End credits.
CUT TO:
HOMEBASE
Four a.m.: streets empty. LeTour's sedan drops near
ten-story West 80s apartment building. JOHN gives DRIVER
forty-dollar tip (standard procedure), turns corner.
He presses intercom; buzzer unlocks door. He enters
lobby, walks past English reproduction furniture
elevators. Presses button.
Penthouse C door opens. ANN lets JOHN smile.
ANN, forty-four, striking tailored dress, greets
wet kiss. Her hair coiffured, face up.
She John's employer, mentor, confidante, Mother Hen:
keeps books. Her ingenuous demeanor belies sterner stuff:
she's drug business years.
Ann's apartment jumble sensibilities: dark green
walls, zebra-skin sofa, Haitian wall friezes, framed magazine
photos Paramahansa Yogananda, Liz Taylor, Duke
Windsor -- paintings stacked oversized urn. A bird
flits cage. One corner living area devoted
fledgling cosmetics business: Macintosh computer,
billboard trade paper clippings ads, herbal samples,
reference books, color charts.
ROBERT, fifty, slight, waves hello JOHN locks door.
Gay, hip, worn, he's John's "co-runner."
They work -- eat -- Ann's apartment. Take-out
tins Indian food stacked amid crystals, tarot cards,
glasses, vitamin bottles. No sign drugs, drug
paraphernalia, money.
ANN
Darling.
LETOUR
Ann.
ANN
Have New York safe
weekend?
LETOUR
(waves)
Robert.
ROBERT
Get job.
LETOUR

LETOUR turns leave.
ANN
Sleep tight.
ROBERT
Pick trash.
LETOUR
(laughs)
Yeah -- big kiss.
He throws kisses, exits.
CUT TO:
JOHN'S APARTMENT
First light reflects Hudson LETOUR walks west
22nd Street Chelsea apartment building. A
delivery truck passes uncollected garbage. He enters
nondescript doorway. Inside studio apartment, JOHN sits
second-hand table writing composition book. He
drinks eight-ounce glass white wine, continues.
The room little personality; Ann's apartment
two. Nails indicate pictures hung; boombox
sits linoleum floor amid cassettes, books
(Autobiography Yogi, The Secret Doctrine), fashion
magazines, stack unopened CDs. A futon unrolled
beneath room's sole decoration, poster human foot
advertising forgotten photo exhibit. Wine bottles -- Chenin
Blanc. Precious little years.
LeTour's narration resumes writes:
LETOUR
(voice over)
"Labor Day." "Union Movement" --
there's contradiction terms. I
know long hours. It's worse
I'm -- I walk walk.
Where I going? There's element
providence all. Like rolling

nothing. For bad luck.
CUT TO:
JEALOUS
Five p.m. A Clinton transient hotel.
Inside hotel room, LETOUR meets JEALOUS, twenty-five-
year-old drug intermediary leather jacket. JOHN counts
hundred-dollar bills, hands JEALOUS.
JEALOUS

LETOUR

LETOUR

(opens door)
Thanks warning.
CUT TO:
THE NIGHT BEGINS
Ann's apartment. Eight p.m. She opens door LETOUR,

JOHN locks door, heads bedroom. Inside bedroom, MTV
glows silently ROBERT, wearing black turtleneck, works

Deering grinder, block manite, pure cocaine, pills, felt
pen. ROBERT scissors glossy magazine paper (Elle) neat

JOHN grabs belt pouch, heads closet.
CUT TO:
CONFESSOR LETOUR
Rain falls LeTour's car near East Side luxury high-
rise. The door opens Eddie's apartment: severe decor,
chic, dated. EDDIE, thirty-two, mess: puffy
face, sweaty shirt, pinched lips -- drug jag.
EDDIE
Le Tour! -- finally. What took
long?
LETOUR
(steps inside)
Traffic. It's raining.
EDDIE
How's things?
LETOUR
Okay.
EDDIE

LETOUR
(nods)
Robert said sold quarter
yesterday.
EDDIE
(slurs)
Some friends came over. How

LETOUR nods EDDIE, employing diminished skills, counts
roll twenties. JOHN looks around: ashtrays,
porn tapes, vodka bottles --
"friends."
LETOUR
Eddie. Look yourself. Sit down.
I've known you, what, like
years?
EDDIE
(counting)
Yeah...
LETOUR
Knew job,

(turns leave)
Don't again. Catch

EDDIE
(contrite)

Okay.
EDDIE

(EDDIE nods)
One thing. I gotta use phone.
EDDIE pockets envelope JOHN, checking beeper,
walks phone.
Later. LETOUR sits Upper West Side apartment
earnest MID-TWENTIESH MAN, wearing undershorts, snorts
hefty line, offers rolled dollar talks. LETOUR
declines.
MID-TWENTIESH MAN
(continuing)
...but -- there's God,
man conceive him? The idea God
presupposes existence God.
That's Ontological Argument.
Anselm. Twelve hundred. Fourteen
-- I'm sure --
LETOUR
(checks watch)
I've got go.
MID-TWENTIESH MAN
(gesturing)
Let finish. Okay, idea
God implanted God -- sensus
divinitatus, sense divine --
role human thought?
Not faith, thought...
LETOUR's mind drifts. His diary voice overlaps:
LETOUR
(Voice over)
Everybody wants talk. It's like
compulsion. My philosophy is:
got say, don't it.
They figure tell D.D.
anything, things
tell else. He understands. Of
course they're stoned start. If I
tie hours
coke talk I've heard,
lot string. It Robert's
idea add twenty-five dollars
home deliveries cause it's
hassle. Fifty like it.
Later. Narration continues sedan drives rain.
Later. A Tribeca loft. LETOUR swaps drug jargon TWO
N.Y.U. STUDENTS impromptu party. Attractive ingenues
drift by. TRENDY TWOSOME, blasted, sways, techno-rap.
Business done, LETOUR turns leave. The FIRST STUDENT grabs
shoulder:
FIRST STUDENT
C'mon, Tour, stick around.
SECOND STUDENT
Yeah.
FIRST STUDENT
There's like
seven -- we're paying
dope. See her, there,
blonde, long hair, yellow skirt? --
she's gonna model Elite.
DOWNTOWN NYMPH, sixteen going seventeen.
LETOUR
(smiling)

like old horse.
SECOND STUDENT
Shit, dude --
LETOUR
Nah. Thanks anyway.
(checks watch)
I gotta go. Have fun.
(heads exit)
CUT TO:
FACE FROM THE PAST
LeTour's sedan heads Lexington Avenue. It rains unabated.
Puddles glisten; red taillights refract windshield.
JOHN rests back, bag Enhancements him.
Pedestrians, well-dressed casual, desperately wave
taxis amid sacks garbage. No use: blocks.
John's sedan stops midtown light. LETOUR looks
window, sees WOMAN vainly hailing cab. He looks again.
She turns head. He recognizes her.
LETOUR
(to DRIVER)
Carlos. Wait second.
He leans over, opens far door, calls:
LETOUR
Marianne! Marianne! Hop in! I'll
ride.
MARIANNE JOST, thirty-five, stylish short black hair
long black coat, steps closer, looks rain.
LETOUR
John. John LeTour.
MARIANNE
(recognizes him)
John?
LETOUR
Get in. You're getting soaked.
She ducks inside, slams door.
MARIANNE
(awkward)
Hi...
The car moves on.
LETOUR
Where going?
MARIANNE wipes rain cheeks; expression deepens:
cautious, suspicious. No reply.
LETOUR
I didn't know lived here.
MARIANNE
(second thoughts)
Maybe wasn't good idea.
I out.
LETOUR
Don't crazy. It's pouring.
MARIANNE

LETOUR
No. I stopped.
MARIANNE
What's bag?
LETOUR
Almond oil. You check.
(opens bag)
Look.
She does: Enhancements Almond Oil. John's beeper goes off! --
punches it.
LETOUR
Shit.
MARIANNE
What's for? In case
needs almond oil middle
night?
LETOUR
I deal little, I'm
straight -- part's true. Believe
me.
MARIANNE
(to DRIVER)
Stop here. Now. Stop!
LETOUR
I won't anything. I promise.
I'll sit here. I'll
ride.
The car pulls over. MARIANNE opens door, gets out.
MARIANNE
Goodbye, John.
LETOUR
Where live?
(door slams)
Mari...
She fades rain. JOHN watches, aching.
DRIVER
Sir?
LETOUR
Eighty-third Street.
The sedan continues uptown.
CUT TO:
MEMORIES
John's apartment. Pre-dawn. His diary lies open desk.

LETOUR
You need lawyer?
TIS

He's here. Thanks.
TIS folds John's hand.
LETOUR
Any time.
TIS turns, steps away. LETOUR walks long corridor.
Curious, reflective, slows past open doors. Friends,
family, patients sit blue light. Each room drama.
He heads duplicate corridor. A VOICE turns head:
RANDI

He turns RANDI JOST, thirty, Marianne's younger sister.
She wears running shoes, jeans, red sweater.

way table.
He joins FRENCH COUPLE, declines drink, exchanges
drugs/money amid air kisses.
Late night. Fog hangs 22nd Street: Chelsea's deserted.
Homeless men windbreaks trash.
John's apartment. He writes bareback desk. He completes
composition book diary mid-sentence, closes it, discards
it. He lifts new book floor, opens desk,
continues.
He fills glass wine:

ANN
What money?
The CHEF stops by, asks meal satisfactory. ANN

She smiles, clasps hand. Touching, touched.
CUT TO:
GENERAL HOSPITAL
Afternoon. St. Luke's. LETOUR, wearing tweed jacket, walks
corridor, checks room numbers. A NURSE passes. He
stops room, pushes door crack, peeks inside,
quietly enters.
Inside hospital room, MRS. JOST, sixty-five, lies sedated,
attached IV tubes respirator. Flowers wreathe
bed.
RANDI sleeps chair window.
LETOUR looks MRS. JOST RANDI again: vibrant
woman reduced shell. He soundlessly eases vacant
chair.
His mind goes back.
RANDI twists fitfully chair. A stuffed bear peeks
family photos window sill.
MARIANNE steps doorway, stops, frozen -- watching
tableau: JOHN, RANDI, mother. Her face ravaged:
death watch taken toll. LETOUR reaches arm,
touches hospital bed.
MARIANNE tiptoes JOHN. He turns, stands.
LETOUR
(soft)
I'm sorry. I...
She puts finger lips. He nods. She steps closer,
holds politely. His cheek nestles neck.
They turn door, step corridor, walk arm

LETOUR

MARIANNE

They kiss deeper, bodies grinding. The painful present fades.
A NURSE approaches WHEELCHAIR PATIENT. She tries
pass JOHN MARIANNE, tries side,
blocked again. The NURSE stops, stares soap opera.
Sensing glare, JOHN MARIANNE, hands

blissful.
LETOUR
Excuse us.
(to MARIANNE)
Let's go.
MARIANNE

They smack sweaty bodies, tumble yelping carpet,
kiss indiscriminately:
LETOUR
Kiss, kiss, kiss.
MARIANNE
Kiss, kiss, kiss.
LETOUR
Together.
Later: night. They lie nude scramble twisted sheets
mattresses. Street lights cast horizontal shadows. LETOUR
crawls over, falls Marianne's breast. She wakes up,
looks JOHN, looks window, returns slow sad
reality.
MARIANNE stands, pulls panties.

he's dealer. MARIANNE bolts bedroom, SLAMS
door!
TIS
Not talkative type. Haven't seen
years. You know her, don't
you?
(no answer. TIS counts
money, offers
it. LETOUR frozen)
Why me? What nightmare.
(extending money)
You want not?
LETOUR
(vacant)
Yeah.
LETOUR pockets cash. TIS, arm John's elbow, "walks"
door:
TIS
See later.
TIS nudges JOHN corridor, closes door him.
JOHN looks elevator; TIS, door, calls
"Marianne!"
Time cut: LETOUR stands elevator, red floor numbers
flashing past, blank eyes mirrored dark glass.
CUT TO:
FALL FROM GRACE
JOHN exits Grace Towers, walks past limo Lexington
Avenue. Rounding corner, sees blue sedan. He looks
cash, repockets it. He continues slowly, step
separate task.
LETOUR reaches door handle. A scream pierces traffic
noise. A car screeches, another. Voices out.
LETOUR steps back, listens. He retraces steps, turns
Lexington Avenue. The SECURITY GUARD, walkie-talkie
hand, clusters sidewalk limo driver,
pedestrians. A cabbie jumps taxi, joins confusion
("My God!"). A siren approaches. John's beeper goes off.
Drawing closer, LETOUR sees partial bloodied shape
broken body sidewalk: recognizes Marianne's skirt.
A squad car brakes screech. TWO COPS converge, climb
trash, clear crime scene:
FEMALE COP
Get back!
MALE COP
Who saw it? What happened?
(the FEMALE COP bends
Marianne's body)
EMS way.
FEMALE COP
Too late --
A second squad car pulls up. JOHN turns away, walks
corner.
LETOUR opens car door, closes it, sits inside. A wailing
ambulance flashes past, speeds Central Park West.
LETOUR doesn't react. Beeper re-beeps; disconnects
battery.
The driver, CARLOS, twenty-five, Hispanic, shirt starched,
turns, looks, thinks, says:
CARLOS
Where to?
LETOUR
What?
CARLOS
Where to, sir? Where going?
LETOUR
Nowhere now. Wait.
CARLOS
(after moment)
You want wait here?
LETOUR
Yes.
Pause. More police cars. The EMS siren starts up;
ambulance speeds downtown past LeTour's sedan. No reaction.
CARLOS turns engine.
LETOUR
Downtown.
CARLOS
Yes.
CARLOS starts car, pulls traffic.
CUT TO:

LETOUR

TERESA
Nothing. Forget it. Let sleep.
CUT TO:
SNITCH
Mid-morning. LETOUR, awake, walks past towering Chelsea

He presses intercom button. Robert's voice answers:
ROBERT

LETOUR

The door buzzes.

Thinking's fear living, negative

You're afraid. Let plan unfold.
Stop. Stop, live day -- day --
Words blur jargon. LETOUR cuts in:
LETOUR

ROBERT

CUT TO:

Six p.m. LETOUR, shaved bathed, rides cab uptown, past
Harlem, past 158th Street. He motions DRIVER;
taxi stops blue door retail stores begging
renovation. TEENAGE LATINOS hang out. LETOUR gives CABBIE
twenty. LETOUR walks blue door; YOUTHS stop,
watch. He knocks door. A PUERTO RICAN DOORMAN white
leather pants heart-shaped diamond ring opens door,
looks over. JOHN reaches pouch, removes gram
envelope, hands him. The DOORMAN takes taste, buzzes
door hand-lettered "Jump-Offs."
Inside Jump-Offs, cocaine "spot," eye turns JOHN:
Anglo Hispanic after-hours club. Tough young
faces, style inches attitude. Willie

LETOUR

MANUEL

LETOUR

The DOMINICAN laughs; LETOUR takes measure.
LETOUR
(businesslike)
What do?
MANUEL
Simple. You bullets --
(inserts cartridge)
point bad guys, pull

MANNY repeats DOMINICAN ["bang, bang!"];
laugh again. LETOUR eases .38 crotch. MANNY
turns, exchanges Latin hug:
MANUEL
Vaya Dios.
LETOUR

JOHN exits, works way club.

ANN
Oh. Okay.
The sedan continues south. It turns, stops John's

JOHN hops out, goes in.
Inside John's apartment -- man possessed -- pulls
black tweed closet, throws futon. He rolls
shirt, reaches futon, removes .38.
He straps gun back, wraps duct tape
chest, end end .38. He tucks shirt, puts
jacket, checks mirror gun shows:

LETOUR closes diary, throws window: trifle.
He slaps cologne cheeks -- annointing; heads

Bursting rage, turns THOMAS, YELLS:
ANN
I told greasy fucks I don't deal

She slaps THOMAS, pulls 9mm waistband, throws

THOMAS, TIS, CUBAN stare dumbfounded.
LETOUR reaches shirt confusion, yanks

Cuban's chest. BLAM! Shirt fabric flares, flies:
CUBAN falls blank expression.
THOMAS, guard, wheels fires wildly LETOUR.
JOHN fires back. Both hit. TIS ducks bedroom.
THOMAS LETOUR again, -- hitting, missing. A
bullet hits mark: THOMAS, frozen, grabs blood-spurting
throat, slumps floor.
LETOUR bleeds stomach shoulder. His shirt soaks

LETOUR checks .38: rounds fired -- left.
LETOUR staggers bedroom, finds TIS frantically

POLICE VOICES approach.
