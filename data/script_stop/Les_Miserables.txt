Valjean wakes, rears up, seizes Thenardier arm,
slams sewer wall.
VALJEAN
How I here?
THENARDIER
There! That way!
Valjean drops him, picks Marius more, sets off.
Thenardier stares them, grinning. He's sent
wrong way.
LATER - Valjean sewers, Marius back,
they're sinking deeper slimy water.
110.
As feels sink, Valjean holds Marius
arms forges on, chest deep, lifting younger man
head. Still sinks, face half-
submerged he's gagging filth. He stumbles,
suddenly he's sunk beneath surface, Marius
dropping -
Then bursts again, face black slime, eyes
burning refusal beaten.
LATER - Valjean staggers endless sewers, Marius

He starts past Javert.
Javert draws pistol holds Valjean's head.
JAVERT

Valjean meets eyes. That old battle
will.
VALJEAN
Then I die.
He starts walking past Javert. Javert's hand trembles
holds pistol.
Valjean keeps walking. Javert wills shoot,
can't it. Frustrated, enraged himself,
lowers gun.
JAVERT
Take him, Valjean,
Before I change mind!

He turns away, trembling body. He
stares river. Valjean gone now. He's alone.
JAVERT

He moves embankment bridge. Here
stands, looking dark water night river.
The Seine forms whirlpool here, violent currents
swirl round piles bridge.
JAVERT
And thoughts fly apart
Can man believed?
Shall sins forgiven?
Shall crimes reprieved?
And I begin doubt
Who doubted
years?
My heart stone
trembles...
The world I known lost
shadow
Is heaven hell?
And know
That granting life today

He climbs parapet, reaching arms
night sky.
JAVERT
I reaching I fall
And stars black cold
As I stare void
Of world hold...
I'll escape world
From world Jean Valjean
This I turn...
There way on...
113.
He reaches higher, turning body, twisting,
wants angel high save - so,
turning, falls river. The swirling eddies close
him. And he's lost.
