EXT. TRAIN - DARKNESS BEFORE DAWN
Suburban Connecticut, outside New York City, 1973. The
terrible storm. Trees dripping, branches
torn, air warming break new day. The
train lies dark motionless, flashing yellow
emergency lights front, work crew removes debris
track.
INT. TRAIN. PRE-DAWN
Various passengers, huddled uncomfortably, cold, asleep.
On Paul Hood, 15-and-a-half, stoner-preppie look, hunched
