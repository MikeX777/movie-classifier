1 A BLACK VOID 1
We hear movement. Strange skittering sounds, like
razor-claws metal... hiss pneumatic hoses...
whirr click servos... liquid gurgling...
eerie, alien cacophony.
2 EARTH 2
appears, hanging starry blackness. The
alien noises continue, far distance hear
muffled THUMP distant explosion.
Alien TEXT suddenly appears Earth,
REVEAL --
3 INT. BORG RECON CENTER 3
The image Earth actually monitor,
DOZENS MONITORS covering huge wall.
We don't rest room,
technology view distinctly alien bizarre --
mixture organic mechanical elements.
Circuitry optical cabling side-by-side
looks like arteries organs. We
hear creepy skittering gurgling noises.
Occasionally, SHADOWY FORM sweeps past camera,
vaguely humanoid can't tell is.
All monitors active, present myriad
IMAGES SOUND -- related EARTH HISTORY. The
screens written Chinese...
Renaissance paintings... black white newsreel
footage World War Two... look like clips
space battles 24th century. The entire range
human history dancing monitors. The
effect dizzying -- feeling
watching studying human race.
There THUMP wall monitors
SHUDDERS slightly. We hear VOICE
come know BORG COLLECTIVE -- thousands
voices speaking :
BORG
Restrict search parameters 1-9-
9-8 2-0-8-4.
The images monitors change images
21ST CENTURY Earth history.
Again, it's collection photography, video
footage, text, artwork, etc. We hear snippets sound-
bites, music, speeches period. A lot
enticing details. As images race
monitors, learn following.
-- The turn 21st century brought chaos.
Regional wars, collapse United Nations.
Societal break-down. Crime, starvation, desperation.
-- A Third World War. Nuclear explosions,
environmental disasters, tens millions dead. The
United States ceases exist. All political authority
vanishes. Humanity teetering edge Second
Dark Age.
-- The image single man -- ZEPHRAM COCHRANE. A
visionary scientist. He spacecraft created
nuclear missile. He flies warp
test, breaking light barrier. It changes history.
-- Grainy black white images VULCAN SCOUT SHIP
landing Earth. They saw Cochrane's flight, followed
Earth, First Contact
human race.
-- Humanity turns corner. First Contact
alien civilization brings planet
before. Humans Vulcans working together, beginning
solve long-standing problems new technology.
We early replicator producing food
starving millions. A new World Government formed.
-- People planet Earth people Vulcan form
Alliance. They United Federation
Planets. And commission fleet starships
protection exploration. They Starfleet.
-- These images recounting birth Star
Trek universe.
Another muffled EXPLOSION, stronger, SHAKES
entire wall. One monitors BLOWS OUT
shower sparks. And new voice, woman's
voice, low, threatening, slight metallic
inflection, speaks time:
WOMAN'S VOICE
Stop search. Calculate temporal
coordinates. J-Fourteen.
Another explosion ROCKS room takes to:
