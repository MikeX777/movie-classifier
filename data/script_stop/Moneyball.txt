They're asking wrong questions.
People run baseball teams think
terms buying players. Sorry
that.
BILLY
Peter, don't apologize
believe.
34.

PETER
The goal shouldn't buy players,
want buy wins. To buy
wins, buy runs. You're trying
replace Johnny Damon. The Red Sox look
Johnny Damon star worth
seven point million year. When I
look Johnny Damon, I imperfect
understanding runs come from.
SUDDEN CUT TO:
ARCHIVAL VIDEO: The Johnny Damon's A's jersey
walks plate adoring Oakland fans.
PETER V/O
His batting average ignorable. What
matters base percentage-
DAMON swings pitch knocks left
field single. He leads first--
PETER V/O
- 2001 .324. That's 10
points lower league average, 17
points lower Garcia's.
On pitch, DAMON takes second--
PETER V/O
True, stole bases. But attempted
steals general succeed 70%
time start
contribute run totals. In 2001 cost
runs.
DAMON's tagged second.
BACK TO THE GARAGE
PETER
He's got good glove. He's decent
leadoff hitter. He steals bases. But he's
worth seven point million
Boston paying him. You're lucky
payroll, opens
kinds interesting possibilities.
BILLY
You read Bill James, Pete?
PETER
Yes. These ideas approach
game aren't new. In fact,
decades.
