Jaeger Epps look windshield. A plume
sand rises desert meters
them. So engrossed discussion previously
hadn't noticed Wes pointed out.
Epps reaches kills tape player. A loud quiet
comes it. All men stare plume
drifts closer. Finally:
EPPS
Take binoculars.
JAEGER
Wh-what think--
EPPS

Jaeger scrambles binoculars, stares

JAEGER
They're going to--
EPPS
It's way. We drive!
Epps right. Jaeger Wes know it. They shut
ride. Dig tension: Wes sweating, Epps giving wheel
white knuckle grip. Jaeger reaches readies M-
16. When chambers it, sounds like thunder cracking.
The plume draws closer closer it's
plume, dots. Then it's jeep-like vehicles. Next
passengers.
That doesn't relax boys.
Us, Iraqis, we're now. The
vehicles going pass feet. Epps throws
thing:
EPPS
Wave them. Don't look, wave.
All throw weak, forced waves. THE VEHICLES
PASS. Look that: The Iraqis waving back. And that's
they're doing, waving.
Our boys break cheers.
JAEGER

WES
They stopped.
EPPS
Wha...
WES
Oh, Jesus, they've stopped.
Epps Jaeger look them.
WES(CONT)
They stopped, they've turned around.
The Iraqi vehicles stopped, they've turned,
they're racing boys. Epps momentarily freezes.
Jaeger helps right it.
JAEGER
Go, go, go!
Epps punches it, Hummer takes off. The Iraqis
right them.
The vehicles hard driving: They twist turn
like wild snakes loose sand; hit dunes,
flight... It's open desert, boys
hide.
Inside Hummer it's rough, rough ride. Our boys
thrown violently cabin. For Epps controlling
Hummer easy riding wild horse.
The Iraqis turn things notch start sending gunfire
way. Bullets kick Hummer like angry,
little bees hell sting. Epps yells Jaeger.
EPPS
Shoot them!
Now it's Jaeger who's freezes. Epps returns favor.
EPPS(CONT)
Shoot 'em!
Jaeger climbs Humvee's machine gun, works
action starts firing. Unlike playing,
real thing wilder. The Humvee bounces
like cork ocean. Taking aim nearly impossible.
The best Jaeger squeeze rounds Iraqis'
general direction.
All Wes cover head, stay like scared
little girl.
JAEGER
Steady out!
EPPS
I steady out, blow
sand!
It's like dog fight dirt. The vehicles weave,
cut... One Iraqis starts cut Jaeger's firing
line. Jaeger swings machine gun hard lets
loose. A hail bullets rips Iraqi vehicle
wheel level. It kicks vehicle back,

Wes brings Hummer halt. A spastic, scared, relieved
laugh escapes him. Jaeger, checking wounds,

Almost afterthought Epps realizes he's got Wes,

Nobody's got anytbing that, nothing.
Epps heads Hummer. A beat later Wes follows.

Epps reaches yanks Jaeger Wes.
EPPS

Jaeger watches go, smiles himself.
JAEGER

Epps storms Hummer leaving Jaeger
scared himself.
CUT TO:
EXT. DESERT - LATER
A long line footprints works way sand
Epps, Jaeger, Wes. Epps Wes trek side.

pants gasps:
JAEGER
Hey...hey! Slow up. You don't

Epps shrugs, like hitting Jaeger wasn't anything.
EPPS
Maybe crazy this. But

WES
Not chance that. Jaeger's
idiot.
EPPS
He's so--
WES
He's idiot, he's nearly
hard thinks.
EPPS
How tough

Again Epps looks Jaeger struggles feet

All talk starts creep Epps little.
EPPS
Okay, riding you. Get it.

As Jaeger steps hears audible clicking sound come
boot. He goes dead still. Panic races
spine. In whisper says:
JAEGER
Epps...
Again, louder:
JAEGER(CONT)
Epps!
Like couldn't annoyed Epps turns around.
EPPS
What!?
JAEGER

Epps isn't sure he's heard.
EPPS
What?
JAEGER
Mine. Land mine!
Epps doesn't anything, keeps staring. Scared,
angry don't it:
JAEGER(CONT)
I stepped land mine!
Epps Wes look other, Jaeger. Like
he's got time mess around:
EPPS
You didn't step mine.
JAEGER
I heard click.
EPPS
If stepped you'd dead
now. Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines
anymore.
JAEGER
I heard it.
WES
Maybe it's can, something.
Jaeger loses it.
JAEGER
JESUS CHRIST, I'M STANDING ON A MINE.
SHUT UP, AND GET OVER HERE!
Just plain sick this, Epps Wes trudge Jaeger.
EPPS
Paranoid, that's problem. You're
paranoid. Why'd paranoid
map?
Epps pulls knife belt. He sinks ground
probes sand Jaeger's foot. Nothing...nothing...
WE HEAR THE SOUND OF METAL AGAINST METAL. Epps goes white.
For second doesn't move. Tension falls like steel
curtain. Slow, careful, Epps withdraws blade stands.
Jaeger reads expression Epps' face.
JAEGER
Oh, God! Oh God!
EPPS
Just cool.
JAEGER
It's mine, isn't it?
EPPS
Just relax.
JAEGER

Epps goes Wes. The start away Jaeger.
JAEGER

JAEGER
You're moving away it's going

Epps Wes huddle.
WES

EPPS

WES

EPPS
Maybe that's Iraqis afford,
okay? Maybe got discount.
Maybe fuse messed up. Or maybe
it's going seconds,
won't worry getting
Jaeger there, we'll
worry finding pieces.
Behind them, pathetically, Jaeger cries:
JAEGER
Epps...
WES
Doesn't matter. We're going
able anyway.
EPPS
There's way.
JAEGER
Epps...
WES
Can't it. Can't it,

Epps' eyes narrow. He doesn't want hear kind

EPPS
I said dies. Nobody dies.
JAEGER
Epps, leg falling asleep.
Epps thinks, thinks hard.
EPPS
(To Wes)
We've got rope?
WES

EPPS

Ignoring him:

Epps takes couple deep breaths, holds one:
EPPS

Wes Epps races, churning sand
race away Jaeger. They scream like banshees
draw strength.
Jaeger little chant:
JAEGER
Oh, God. Oh, God!
The rope goes taught. Jaeger's body jerks violently backward
gets air punched him. As feet leave
ground detonates.

Quick like Jaeger grabs M-16 shoulder

CUT TO:
EXT. DESERT/MOUNTAINS - LATER
It's kind red rock mesas expect

They ready packs weapons, start mesa.
FADE TO:
Our boys trekking pass. They push onward

considerably man extremely careful
steps.
FADE TO:
Our boys stop. The pass seemingly came end. For
short ways face mesa sheer. The

EPPS
Looks like it.
Epps Wes edge way what's left pass.
Jaeger stands staring down. Way down.
FADE TO:
Epps, Wes Jaeger inch pass hugging face
mesa. Small rocks churn beneath feet tumble
ground below. No man says word, they're busy
trying alive, air filled sounds
labored breathing.
Each step careful: Testing pass purchase,
making sure footing solid. They inch foot
forward, slide next. Their hands probe
cliff face, fingers crawling like spider legs, looking
something, anything, hold of.
Sweat drips Epps eye. He blinks hard fast trying
clear vision. Right can't afford
distractions.
Slowly, carefully, inch inch little death dance goes
on.
Jaeger steps. He steps wrong. The pass gives way
foot begins slide down. Instinctively Wes rockets
arm grabbing Jaeger uniform. At Jaeger
smiles, glad save. But realizes something:
Wes literally holding life hands. All Wes
loosen grip, and...
The color drains Jaeger's face. Wes stares blank
bowl water.
Eternity goes second.
Finally Wes yanks Jaeger mesa's face,
slides on. Jaeger hangs beat
clutching rocks dear life.
FADE TO:
Epps makes far broken pass. He holds
hand Wes reels in. Together help
bring Jaeger. Wes looks path they've

Our boys step past grouping rocks. They stop dead.
Sitting them, looks like small camp, FIVE
IRAQI SOLDIERS. Time clicks real slow instant.
It's delayed reaction, like beat takes
pick hot pan realize that, yeah,
burning flesh hand.
EPPS(CONT)
Take cover!
Our soldiers turn bolt way came.
They run like wild rabbits bit, jumping rock
formation hitting deck rocks cover.
Like well-trained warriors peel weapons
shoulders, lock load, stand ready. They wait bit,
taking deep breaths like divers under.
Finally Epps gives order.
EPPS(CONT)
Let's hit 'em!
Simultaneously spring rocks bear
Iraqis M-16s ready blow

One problem: No Iraqis.
For beat don't move. They hold position, breath
coming hard like sprinters end race. They're

There's nothing.
EPPS(CONT)
Cover me.
M-16 ready, Epps raises taking tactical

JAEGER
Maybe they're scared

WES
Just weird didn't chase us.
EPPS
What's weird disappeared.
Doesn't sense. Doesn't...
There sound; steady swooshing starts faint
grows closer like rolling thunder. Our start looking
around, turning stand, trying source
sound rises near deafening pitch. There's
nothing. They nothing. Still sound races closer
closer. Epps, Jaeger Wes raise weapons
preparation defend unseen beast.
From edge mesa HELICOPTER GUNSHIP -
probably MIL MI-24 HIND-D ARMED ASSAULT HELICOPTER
want technical - raises dramatically

On board vanished Iraqis wearing nasty grins. The
PILOT brings gunship levels massive machine
cannons boys.
EPPS(CONT)
Scatter!
Wes Jaeger don't told twice. They bolt
spots, instant soon. The GUNNER lets
fly barrage shells literally tear ground
boys standing. We chopter's

Epps, Jaeger Wes cover rocks. The
gunship swings around, picks speed bears them.
More shells fired. They punch rocks

Our sliding embankment, crouching low.
Their heads whip looking gunship.
JAEGER
Where it? Where'd go?
EPPS

JAEGER
Where hell it!?
EPPS
Just stay down.
In answer Jaeger's question gunship comes swooping
like bird prey. Our

Dig it: Up ahead narrow passage rock face.
They race it, hurl gunship
sends special delivery white-hot metal way.
Once inside passage bit breathing space.
It's narrow gunship good shot through.
Our press rock walls suck

JAEGER
(Panicked)

EPPS
So wait.
JAEGER
If land--
EPPS
If land, them. If

Wes watches gunship seemingly settles air.
It floats steady if... Wes' eyes key
something: The gunship's missile pods rotating slightly,
coming line... Wes' eyes wide like jammed
electric cattle prod ass.
WES
Missile!
EPPS
Move!
Epps, Wes Jaeger sprint opening far end
passage missile rockets gunship's pod.
With wild whine rides wind like deadly arrow

Jaeger takes cover cowers. He puts panic
overdrive.
Wes pulls rifle. Grunting like animal sprays
bullets chopter, it's like throwing snowballs
elephant. The gunship turns Wes fires

Epps shit. He scrambles load

JAEGER(CONT)

Epps considers this.
EPPS

Epps takes deep breath ready yell shack.

Epps takes beat, sucks breath. He yells
shack:
EPPS
Hellooooo--
Before Epps finish getting word machine gun
erupts house burns Epps Jaeger.
They dive cover, hugging ground bullets whistle
ping space them. They forced
narrow stretch rock, offers
little protection chipped away hot lead. It's
matter moments stands
death. At lungs Jaeger starts yelling:
JAEGER
Ashra Ka mahari dahra sahib! Ashra Ka
mahari dahra sahib!
Just quickly began shooting stops. From
shack hear chatter Arabic, door opens. A
MEN appear doorway. They laugh beckon
Epps Jaeger join them.
EPPS

JAEGER
I don't know. Something Wes taught
me. I think means "Don't shoot.
We're friends."
EPPS
They Saudis. It's Saudi
checkpoint. Oh sweet, Jesus. Come on.
Come on!
Epps hurriedly stumbles dark shack. Jaeger
steps him.
They enter dimly lit shack good nature FOUR

JAGER
Oh, man, good. What think

As rub hands Epps looks up. He freezes.
Hanging wall handsome, nicely framed

EPPS
And shoot them.
JAEGER

Behind Epps Jaeger Iraqis asks question
Arabic.
JAEGER

Again Iraqi asks question. We tell tone
voice expects answer.
EPPS(CONT)
Don't bitch now! You going

JAEGER
I said I would. I don't think I--
EPPS
Shoot them!
The Iraqis sense wrong. They
menacingly weapons.
EPPS(CONT)
Shoot them, Jaeger! SHOOT THEM!
Jaeger whips time pulling M-16. He
jerks hard trigger spraying forth,
forth.
Dig it: The Iraqis death dance strobe light
muzzle flashes. They twist, jerk,
fall down.
The bullets miss nasty job redecorating
place; shredding walls, eating wood.
Jaeger keeps firing clip empty. He stands
huffing, eyes glazed like he's million miles away
did. Epps steps takes weapon Jaeger.
That's like alarm clock brings Jaeger
land living. Jaeger takes look
carnage, doubles gets puking.
Epps watches pathetic sight. When Jaeger
done:
EPPS(CONT)
Let's sleep.
FADE TO:
BLACK
FADE TO:
INT. SHACK - MORNING
The sun pushed horizon
Jaeger comes awake. The second sees MAN - Arab,
wearing white robes - peering window. Jaeger
gives start, man disappears. Jaeger quickly shakes
Epps awake.
JAEGER
Epp...Epps! There's
window!
This wakes Epps quick.
EPPS
An Iraqi?
JAEGER
I don't know. He didn't uniform
on. He...he white robes, like
guys killed Wes.
Epps quick figuring, staying low, scrambles
floor dead Iraqis grabs
weapon. He grabs tosses Jaeger.
Carefully, low, Epps creeps window. Slowly
raises looks out.
JAGER(CONT)
See anything?
EPPS
Nothing.
Epps lowers thinking.
JAEGER
What do?
EPPS
We can't stay here. Even wasn't
Iraqi soldier it's matter
time up. Get
water carry, we'll head
foot.
JAEGER
To where?
EPPS
Sun rises East. We
opposite direction. May
anything, we'll know we're
heading Saudi Arabia.
As Jaeger gathers water find, creeps
door. With muzzle gun pulls open
crack peers out. Still nothing. It's like man
vanished air.
Jaeger, stocked water, comes gold
Epps' pack Epps shoulders.
EPPS(CONT)
Ready?
Jaeger nods. Epps opens door, men carefully
snake way weapons ready. It seems, though,
ready for. There around.
Suddenly man appears shack. Epps
Jaeger turn targeting assault weapons,
fire. The man stands. He doesn't
anything, makes threatening moves. The stay
statues beats Epps jerks head
indicating Jaeger on. That do,
weapons man, range.
They walk little ways. Jaeger spots something,
thrusts finger direction.
JAEGER
Look!
Mounted horse, riding dune runs parallel
them, ANOTHER ARAB MAN. He makes effort draw nearer
Epps Jaeger, lose them.
JAEGER(CONT)
What do?
EPPS
We going, that's do. We
ignore them, maybe ignore us.
As contrary Epps' statement ANOTHER TWO ARABS ON
HORSE BACK appear dune them.
JAEGER
Jesus! How there?
Epps doesn't know, doesn't want out. They
change direction heading away Arabs. But MORE
ARABS ride dune. Epps gets feeling
Jaeger boxed in.
EPPS
I don't like this. Let's go.
Epps breaks run. Jaeger steps him.
Like old John Ford western dozens
mounted Arabs suddenly appear dune. They ride fast
hard Epps Jaeger like Apaches heading wagon
train. They easily overtake two, momentarily swallowing
thundering hoofs, ride bit
playing them.
Epps Jaeger stop, bolt direction. The
Arabs ride back, past Epps Jaeger swiping
ground; horses kicking spray lose sand
them. It looks like cattle round up,
cattle.
Epps Jaeger run it,
Arabs bear them. This time mean business.
They completely surround them, cutting means
escape. The Arabs start screaming forth
Arabic. We don't know what, sounds unpleasant.
Epps Jaeger come skidding halt. They turn
tracks digging scene. It goes like this: They
completely outnumbered gunned mounted force.
Doesn't simpler.
Epps Jaeger drop weapons. Their hands
air.
CUT TO:
EXT. SHI'ITE CAMP - LATER
The mounted Arabs lead Epps Jaeger, hands tied
literally towed horses,
camp. It similar Shi'ite camps we've seen
tent dwellings.
As party enters groups Shi'ites come stare
Epps Jaeger. They chatter themselves,
boys idea they're talking about,
makes things scarier.
From boy's point view like unending
nightmare: Being dragged desert, knowing
language, knowing what's going happen. Their
world skews slides tilt-a-whirl.
Finally reach tent. One Arabs tosses Epps
Jaeger's packs ground it. Another cuts
loose SHOVES THEM INSIDE THE TENT, yells
Arabic. He leaves,
alone.
JAEGER
What them?
EPPS
Shi'ites, I think.
JAEGER
Is good, bad?
EPPS
I don't know. They killed Wes.
JAEGER
Why haven't killed us!?
EPPS
I don't know!
JAEGER
...Maybe...maybe fight way
out.
EPPS
With what? Against many?
JAEGER
We can't sit waiting die.
EPPS
You come better plan, let
know.
JAEGER
Maybe...maybe traded gold.
If gave let
live; kill us.
From O.C. hear voice:
VOICE(O.C.)
I knew bitch.
Epps Jaeger's hearts seize stop. It's
they've heard voice ghost, have. IT'S WES!
He carries pack gold. Epps barely

EPPS

JAEGER
You shot. We standing right

WES

You left dead.
EPPS
We thought--
Like guy took steps edge:
WES
YOU LEFT ME FOR DEAD!
Ohhh, shit. Somebody's crazy. Epps gets feeling there's
going dialog going here. Wes gets real
calm again, scary acting nuts.
WES(CONT)
When Shi'ite friends saw
shot American
apologetic. Turns we've kicking
ass little war. They figure
we've finally gotten Saddam
backs. They brought camp,
cleaned up, fed me... I'm new
best buddy. America number one, Joe.
But there's Shi'ites can't
figure out: They can't figure
buddies, fellow Americans, left
desert. They can't
figure guys
Iraqi outpost. It's
Iraqi spies,
something. And I've got tell
hate that's got
Iraqis. See I mean?
JAEGER
We shelter checkpoint.
Jesus, Wes, I killed Iraqis there.
WES
You actually got killing
someone. I'm impressed. I guess you're

EPPS
Wes, thought dead,

WES
Sure, I guess convenient
person split
gold with.
EPPS
Wes--
WES
Look, I know guys telling
truth. It's Shi'ites don't know

Wes gets right Jaeger's face.
WES{CONT)

Of course Wes knows don't. He allows
sweet, shit eating grin.
WES{CONT)
They're going kill slow. I'll

He steps away starts open pack gold.
WES(CONT)
Thanks taking care me.
EPPS
Tell something, Wes. Are crazy,
greedy, stupid? Jaeger says
you're crazy.
JAEGER
I didn't that. I said--
EPPS
Me? I don't brains
stupid.
For second Wes taken surprise statement,
smiles Epps' boldness. He sets pack gold
gets right Epps' face.
WES
You disappoint me, Epps. Always figured
man; real bright guy. I
respect you.
EPPS
That tried bullet
head middle desert.
WES
That's things came to.
Sometimes can't help that. It
doesn't change respecting you. And
let down. I expected
you, know? I did. I
expected to--
A KNIFE SLIDES UP INTO FRAME UNTIL THE THE TIP RESTS JUST
UNDER WES' THROAT, CHOKING OFF HIS WORDS.
Now it's Epps' turn smug.
EPPS
You expect this?
Wes' got say. To Jaeger:
EPPS(CONT)
Get gold!
Jaeger grabs pack.
EPPS(CONT)
(To Wes)
Now let's try things way. Let's
try this: You Jaeger

walk smiling friendly
little Shi'ite buddies won't suspect
thing. Then we're going hop
horses, ride away, live happily
after. It's going happen
like that, doesn't
I'm going gut like fat pig.
You understand me...soldier?
Wes says nothing.
EPPS(CONT)
I'll yes.
Epps gruffly spins Wes presses knife

EPPS MARCHES WES OUTSIDE THE TENT, stopping momentarily
grab pack free hand. To Jaeger says:
EPPS(CONT)
Get water.
Jaeger he's told.
WES
They'll kill you. You won't

EPPS
You don't know John Epps well,

JAEGER
Can ride horse?
EPPS
No, I figure now's real good time
start.
They walk camp saddled horses.
They pass Shi'ite says Wes Arabic.
Epps gives Wes poke knife.
EPPS(CONT)
Don't anything.
The Shi'ite, obviously expecting answer, says
said again.
EPPS(CONT)
Just quiet.
WES
I answer him.
EPPS
So away?
WES
If I don't answer, he'll know something's
up.
Epps gives lot thought short time.
EPPS
You answer him, answer wrong
you're going staring
insides you're dying.
Wes calmly says Shi'ite. The Shi'ite
stands beat looking men,
suddenly explodes screams. No way knowing sure
he's saying, he's going like Westec
alarm it's pretty good bet he's tipped of.
Epps rears fist slams Wes' face.
EPPS(CONT)

Epps Jaeger running horses, practically
leaping saddles Shi'ites come pouring
tents. Forgetting himself, Wes screams English.
WES
Stop them!
Jaeger Epps spur horses riding hard.
It's amazing bunch angry Shi'ites

Wes grabs assault weapon near Shi'ite mounts
blood eyes. He leads charge armed,
mounted Shi'ites looks like posse going bad
men.
Out Epps Jaeger pull second.
JAEGER
They coming?
Epps takes look him. He can't hardly miss
sandstorm Wes Shi'ites kick ride them.
EPPS

Epps points foothills distance. It's

They reigns horses riding.
Behind Wes yells riders, signals
split up, try cut Epps Jaeger.
Epps Jaeger hit hills. They ride bit,
stop spot Wes. Wes crew better riders
closed gap. All try lose

Epps Jaeger ride best can, somewhat
erratically cover trail. They head ways,
cut parallel direction. Jaeger looks back,
sees sign Wes.
JAEGER
We lost them!
Just words leave Jaeger's mouth hail bullets
explodes ground them. Their horses rear up,
it's fight them. Just ahead
Shi'ites split Wes, having circled Epps
Jaeger.
The yank horses back, ride hard opposite
direction Shi'ites behind. They Epps

Epps Jaeger little passengers
horses run wild like stampeding mustangs. And good

As Epps Jaeger level trail

JAEGER(CONT)
Which way?
Epps looks side. Either way certain death.
Then looks embankment. It VERY steep.
VERY treacherous.
It expert rider embankment

Shi'ites direction.
JAEGER(CONT)
Which way go!?
EPPS

Wes men close hard now. The bullets fly fast
furious swarming boys.
Epps whips horse, trying she's got

Suddenly Epps pulls hard reins. The horse rears
up, goes wild. It takes Epps control

They've come edge very, sharp cliff. Epps

Finally calms horse down, doesn't matter. Wes

stands horse.
Epps Jaeger, go, same.
WES

Epps takes pack Jaeger, doesn't throw Wes.
WES(CONT)
Give me!
EPPS
If I you, let go?
Wes smiles lies badly doesn't bother trying
fake it.
WES
Sure. Whatever want. For old time
sake.
Epps got choice, really. He tosses pack Wes'
feet stoops pick up. Wes starts open pack.
WES(CONT)
Looks like end day
finally who's better who,

Epps grabs Jaeger yanks ground.
There horrific furry sound easily
destroys Wes Shi'ite standing him.

thicker thicker.
DRIVER(CONT)

This bit gets Epps.
EPPS

vehicles pulling out, good civilian cars
trucks. It clogs lanes, envelopes car.
Some people try way foot
faster.
JAEGER

EPPS

The driver tries work car free congestion,
he's wedged in, going anywhere.
From sky swoop flight AMERICAN F-15E
FIGHTER JETS. They swing far end highway,
engines roaring like angry lions. For second time stands
still. Everyone road stops looks jets.
Time starts again, deadly vengeance.
The fighter pilots begin strafe highway: Vehicles
people, civilian military alike. There
distinction, carnage.
This infamous Al Jahra highway Basrah Kuwait
City strafed deadly accuracy
day war American forces. It known
Highway Death.
The huge shells rip bloody path, shredding cars trucks,
igniting explosions, straight car Epps,
Jaeger driver. With barely seconds
shot pieces well. They dive car, Epps
dragging driver out, scramble cover
road.
The planes turn pass.
JAEGER
What hell doing? There're
civilians there.
Not thinking he's Jaeger jumps
screams jets.
JAEGER(CONT)
DON'T SHOOT! DON'T SHOOT! THEY'RE
CIVILIANS!
Epps jumps drags Jaeger cover
shells fram jets cut dangerously close them.
The jets bank swoop run.
Epps realizes wrong. He looks
desperately, doesn't see...THERE, BACK IN THE CAR!
EPPS
The gold!
Epps runs car, trying beat jets.
JAEGER
No!
Jaeger lunges Epps misses him. Epps snakes way
burning hulks car. He dodges,
jukes weaves shells, shrapnel explosions
him. He makes car, grabbing
gold, fighters swing low cut
loose.
A wicked hail shells reigns down. It sets series
violent explosions knocks Jaeger feet. It takes
beat recover. By fighters
job, fly off.
Jaeger stands. He walks road plaintive
wails barely living. The car, gold, Epps...
essentially disintegrated.
AS THE CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP WE SEE THAT IT ISN'T JUST
THEIR CAR AND EPPS THAT ARE GONE. There isn't
left road. Just death, destruction
bloodshed.
