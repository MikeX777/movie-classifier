KAFKA

Lem Dobbs
PRAGUE - MORNING
The Old Town quiet. It's early twisted
streets ancient ghetto. Dark corners casting
medieval spell modern century oblivious
romance mystery.
The River dividing line. Elegant gardens
opposite bank embracing monotonous solemnity New
Town, tower steeples silhouetted sombre sky.
An motor bus rattles deserted street.
A Gothic bridge links halves strange city.
Its half-moon arches circles meet
reflections water. Thin mist swirls
cobblestones above.
A boats water. Fishermen casting lines
silence. One lights burning buildings beyond.
In Old Town Square great clock cathedral
strikes six.
CUT:
A MAN'S FACE
His eyes filled terror, beads sweat crawling
brow.
He stands middle murky courtyard, perfectly
still. Waiting. Watching.
The balconies overlooking successive floors, looming
him, empty. All quiet.
The man's EDUARD. He dares fear
missing single sound. And hears it. A small noise
movement nearby. He runs.
TINY ALLEYWAY
He runs dim light deserted morning.
CROOKED PASSAGEWAY
Running life.
NARROW LANE
Running sheer pumping fear, long verge
collapse.
BLACK TUNNEL
Coming light, means danger,
allows brief pause, gasping air,
moment looking gloom, starting retreat
does, turning running ...
WINDING STREET
He runs on, past boarded-up houses shuttered inns,
strange relics Middle Ages casting frightening
shadows.
AROUND A CORNER
Eduard appears suddenly, quickly flattens
large notice board covers wall here,
layers expressionistic theatre film posters pasted
it.
He breathes painfully short bursts, silently
can. He watches corner he's come from, ornate
archway pursuer emerge.
Nothing there. But shadow moves.
Eduard's shoulders tense. His eyes widen. He holds
breath.
The shadow ... spreading ...
Eduard edges away slowly, keeping unblinking gaze
archway, backing off, arm brushing notice
board feels way it, macabre images
posters, torn incomplete, revealing fragments
behind, Eduard's eyes staring constant, noise
--
A HAND! clamps face behind. All sudden
absolutely thing
it.
But tries, hands coming grip arm grasps
him, arm iron.
The hand huge. It covers Eduard's face entirely,
eye gaping bloodshot fingers, ghastly
fingers that, second, inhuman,
fingers incompatible hand, hand
covered scar tissue, starting squeeze pulls
Eduard swiftly away.
CUT:
A ROW OF TYPEWRITERS - DAY
Clacketing incessantly slightly agile refined
fingers. Beyond these, row desks. And

And another, worker scribbles
furiously figures, rolls new sheet
typewriter, answers clanging telephone,
rifles pages massive record book,
sits erect chair playing machine like piano,

contemplatively taps end pencil desk. This
KAFKA.
A tall young man kind, sensitive face.
sensitive eyes, ears, nose
slightly bigger inquiring most, gaze

He's looking now.
A desk, far own. But empty. The chair
pushed squarely it. The typewriter covered.

Kafka walks Murnau Ekman. The Laughing Man
holds Kafka's arm.
KAFKA

MURNAU
Yes, -- we're looking

suspicious.
They pass grinding chains carrying memos
inter-office directives down.
MURNAU
But you're right
didn't die cave-in.
In fact, didn't die all.
He simply recalled --
himself. As Head
Medical Records
Director firm -- I'm
Dr. Murnau, course.
The Laughing Man giggles crazily.
LIBRARY
The Laughing Man, subdued moment, merely smiles
little, opening door let Kafka first, guarding
close. Dr. Murnau leads way
laboratory door.
MURNAU
May I ask
warders are?
KAFKA
Lying gutter

Murnau laughs, stop encourages
Laughing Man, bringing forth mad chuckle him.
MURNAU
Pity. They're amusing pair,

innocents.
He pushes tall door open lab.
LABORATORY
Murnau spreads hands proudly enter, displaying
amazing factory.
MURNAU
I rarely chance
showing work anybody --
anybody capable appreciating
it, is. You I'm
student human reaction.
Ekman, who's seen before, goes lean somewhere,
bored.
KAFKA
The fact it's live bodies
practice trade
doesn't matter you.
MURNAU
On contrary, matters
great deal. We're engaged
immensely important research
here. I'm revolutionary
too, know --
pragmatic one.
As response Laughing Man convulses anew.
Ekman immediately turns shelf vial goes
Laughing Man.
MURNAU
-- I can't administer
experimental treatments
corpses --
corpses, why,
uses -- that's speed
essential. Living tissue,
owner passed on,
valuable acquisition.
The Laughing Man gulps potion starts calm
little.
MURNAU
We've tried transfusions
... volunteers. Unfortunately,
far infusing superior
characteristics it's tended
insane -- murderous
-- condition we've
occasion use of.
THE HIDDEN BOMB-CASE
TICKING lightly away. The clock inside bomb-case,
visible X-Ray, SEEN matter
minutes away blast-off.
THE LAB
Murnau walks elaborate distillation processes
going on. The section Kafka hid bomb.
Kafka wipes brow, quickly, conscious Ekman staring
him. Murnau gazes obsessively contraptions,
piercing eyes following routes flowing chemicals.
MURNAU
-- And new patients
bring aren't usually
dexterous you've
evading us. Not perfect
specimens means,
type person who'll
missed either.
KAFKA
What
Gabriela Rossmann?
MURNAU
As matter fact you've
caught state
considerable excitement. Our
latest preparation believe
-- pray -- perfected.
It years her.
He's concocting potion now, pouring acidic-looking
liquid container another. Kafka looking
increasingly worried.
MURNAU
And -- well,
I caprices
vivisection.
He glances dangling animal parts. And now, finished
mixing cocktail, picks sort suturing tool,
pressing trigger start end burning
SIZZLING.
MURNAU
Actually, weren't
aberrant dilemma posed
like --
continually asking out-of-date
files -- I'd probably
revisionist policies altogether.
I'm sure
start instead
inception -- embryo --
single cell even.
(leers Kafka)
The lure Golem --
man-made man. You appreciate
that, I know.
Ekman takes Kafka arm lead operating
table. The Laughing Man moves closer too, emitting
psychotic chortle.
MURNAU
To corrupt image man
offer redemption ... This
dawn, Kafka. A new man
born here. A resilient
man ... A superman.
Kafka attempts escape operating table,
Laughing Man blocks way corrals
before. Dr. Murnau holds sinister aperitif
Kafka drink toast.
MURNAU
To new world -- Gods
monsters.
The glass comes closer closer Kafka's lips --
leans away he'll lying

turn.
The body Mr. Pick, bloody ragged, dragged

Kafka chance. The time looks he's
holding nozzle burning device Ekman's

-- And laboratory wide elevator

KAFKA
Throws Ekman aside runs away.
EKMAN
Falls floor, holding hands head
SCREAM ghastly creatures depths converge

The elevator horrible BEAST-MAN

MURNAU
Just stands operating table, waiting them. He
knows there's way he's far practical man

DOORWAYS
Kafka running Castle, door door
door door, leaving banging him,
forth.
CUT:
THE LABORATORY
Ekman stumbles feet, watching horror
prisoners Castle strap Murnau operating
table.
One one, prisoners file past intricate surgical
tools neatly laid white cloth. Each prisoner selects
implement choice.
Ekman, too, runs away laboratory.
The Laughing Man, snickering, isn't sure he's on.
But then, LAUGHTER BUILDING, goes join
line.
CUT:
DOORWAYS
Kafka running maze -- final door. And
finds right --
THE LIBRARY
With brightness laboratory facing
open door. Horrible SOUNDS coming there.
THE HIDDEN BOMB-CASE
Almost time.
KAFKA
Running again, maze corridors. He HEARS
running footsteps -- looks Ekman
running him. Ekman catches -- runs past Kafka
panic escape -- metal walkway
central area offices.
THE LABORATORY
Murnau can't seen, deranged men huddled closely
operating table.
THE HIDDEN BOMB-CASE
Abruptly stops ticking.
THE CENTRAL OFFICES
The floors SHUDDER BOOM laboratory heard
felt. The metal walkway breaks Ekman goes sliding
-- Kafka manages hang on. He ducks face
glass surrounding office windows SHATTERS
SHOWERS -- paper starts sailing around.
Literally hailstorm documents.
On floor fell, Ekman tries stand,
falling flurry paper keeps bay. He waves
hands wildly trying way all, it's
much. Now feet trapped it. It's starting
rise legs. Papers fluttering floors
floors surrounding offices above, filling air.
Ekman suffocates drowns disappears paper
piling -- lone arm hand
him.
THE LABORATORY
Totally wrecked -- jutting broken walls
burst pipes -- spurting red, blue, black INK everywhere.
THE CENTRAL OFFICES
Kafka managing climb unsafe metal walkway
-- ZING! -- bullet ricochets near him.
The Assistants! They've nearly fallen
doorway walkway broke, got
stuck door time. One wildly
FIRING revolver Kafka's direction. The tries
grab FIRE directions.
Kafka runs away, avoiding snake broken wire, flipping
about, SPARKING metal.
The Assistants, shoving other, extricate
doorway way chase Kafka.
THE LABORATORY
The burst ink pipes drip empty. The sound maniacal
LAUGHTER abruptly stops. The ink filled lab halfway
ceiling. It's covered ... body.
A bubble pops, leaving lake ink surface
smooth glass.
CUT:
UNDERGROUND FILE VAULT
Kafka way -- rushing in. But wait:
Which file cabinet come of? He's surrounded
file cabinet drawers alike. He starts running around,
pulling open drawers, trying secret doorway
them.
SPIRAL STONE STAIRCASE
Here come Assistants, running round round.
UNDERGROUND FILE VAULT
Kafka runs round round, opening drawer drawer. He
finds one! Jumps in! Pulling closed
--
-- Assistants stumble in. They look other,
immediately start rushing opening drawers. They run
forth around, bumping other,
making dizzy.
LUDWIG
(pulls open drawer)
Oskar!
OSKAR
(turning another)
Ludwig?
-- But Ludwig pulls file folder.
LUDWIG
This filed incorrectly!
OSKAR
Here too! They're
dreadful muddle!
They start trading files forth, trying
order. The attention span squirrels,
they've forgotten looking Kafka.

CASTLE GATES - DAWN
Opening. The police Inspector enters main courtyard.
Behind come secondary policemen. Behind them,
obscurely, more.
CASTLE COURTYARD
He men pause, reacting ...
... wretched survivors Castle prison
stagger shadows greet them.
CUT:
EMBANKMENT - MORNING
On Old Town River. Foggy.
KAFKA
Walks slowly, tiredly. He looks sky, sky

FURTHER ON
Kafka stops. Turns. Did hear
wind water?
FURTHER ON
He passes small park, approaching gate
it. Leaves RUSTLING. Mist swirling

GABRIELA
Standing there, half shadow, profile. Her glorious
profile.
KAFKA
Gabriela! -- away.
GABRIELA
I knew walked way

KAFKA

Castle. It's over.
GABRIELA
(her eye glancing
far away)

Kafka beginning sense wrong her.

Why I murderer?
Because murder ... bliss.

It's easier

Evil -- you've adopted

Kafka watches ... The breeze sings
air.
GABRIELA
Have watched person
deteriorate? Day day. I
don't mean spiritual sense.
Kafka doesn't answer. She turns fully him. The
beautiful face ... fungus. Alive. Seething.
Frothing. Bubbling. Kafka backs away couple steps.
GABRIELA
Only steps back? Even
man left guard
retreated that.
KAFKA

KAFKA

GABRIELA
Why I believe man

Kafka starts away more. Gabriela starts
follow him.
GABRIELA
I think you've escaped

Eduard did. As let do.
But moment.
KAFKA
No -- time.
GABRIELA

KAFKA
-- Listen --
GABRIELA

(pause)
I've held

And suddenly she's slashed knife Kafka's chest. He
shouts pain, staggering backwards. She comes him.
KAFKA
-- Gabriela!
She comes him, blade glistening. Kafka best
run.
THE BRIDGE
Kafka giddily staggers forward, arm wrapped
bleeding chest, Gabriela close him. Too close
away. He turns face reaches bridge
comes knife, raising
arm block thrust hold wrist back. She's
strong, though, madness. She forces
ground, straddling him, knife pushing
closer. Kafka gasps pain, finally succumbs, longer
able hold hand defense, simply shutting eyes
terrible sigh await fatal stab.
It doesn't come. Almost. But quite. Gabriela's arm
pauses, shaking cool, cloudy air, sleeve trembling
breeze River, sharp blade, inches
Kafka's throat, flashing new day's light.
Gabriela stares away River, destroyed half
face shadow again, strikingly beautiful
ever. As Kafka watches, passive, gets
slowly walks wall bridge, letting knife
drop hand way. Kafka manages lift
knees, clutching wound. He looks up.
Gabriela graceful movement climbs wall
throws River.
Kafka lowers head.

CONTINENTAL COFFEE SHOP - MORNING
Quiet here. Breakfast business crowded
