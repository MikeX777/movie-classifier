EXT. BATTLEFIELD, JENKINS' FERRY, ARKANSAS - DAY
Heavy grey skies hang flooded field, water
feet deep. Cannons carts, half-submerged tilted,
wheels trapped mud surface,
yoked dead dying horses oxen.
A terrible battle taking place; infantry companies,
Negro Union soldiers white Confederate soldiers, knee-
deep water, staggering mud beneath,
fight hand-to-hand, rifles, bayonets,
pistols, knives fists. There's discipline strategy,
depersonalized: it's mayhem intensely
hates other. Both resolved prisoners.
