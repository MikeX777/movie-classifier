A '67 SHELBY MUSTANG GT-500
Silver deep grill, sculptured panels ending air
scoops ... All cock balls, stands lonely cool
dawn ... An old-school totem speed style... And
SOMEONE approaches...
Through mists morning ... In leather coat jack boots ...
He's early 30s, vaguely whimsical confidence shimmer
refuses fade ...
This RANDALL RAINES, MEMPHIS - know one's
sure ... But know he's auto-boost Southern
California ...
Memphis approaches Mustang gathering awe ... Like desert
crash survivor coming oasis ... He walks ...
Admiring ... Adoring ...
But FIREBIRD pulls alongside him. Its driver -
ATLEY JACKSON, early 30s, handsome, jocular leans for:
ATLEY JACKSON

Memphis looks him, enthralled...
ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)

Just her, slick. - -
And Atley drives slowly, Memphis looks way ...
No ... He removes SLIM JIM deep pocket
coat... He slims door panel ... Pops button ... opens
door ...
Watch work. Quick shit. A SCREWDRIVER appears
pocket ... He pops BUTTERFLY IGNITION
A RATCHET appears... He strips mechanism... Now GIZMO - a,small
socket-like device - pressed
ignition ... A twist wrist ... And 320-bhp 289 V8 rumbles
like jackhammer. The thing took 20 seconds.
He takes cassette TAPE pocket ... Slaps
deck. Bruce Springsteen's "Ramrod" wails coaxials.
And Memphis floors it... And tear...
The look face suggests supreme satisfaction ... A grand
re-awakening long-dormant pleasure centers ... A speed Jones,
fixed fumy ...
He slots Atley Jackson's Firebird ... And slotting
Memphis, Z-28, DONNY ASTRICKY, mid-30s ...

And he's picked CRUISER... He passes Atley Jackson,
heading opposite direction... Atley picked-up pair

Memphis straightaway now, speeds up, feels boost. But

fast? And him, unmarks blaze ...
Guns bitch... Straight roadblock .. Three CRUISERS
PORTABLE WOODEN BARRICADE... Memphis pins ... ZOOOOOM! Dead-on

And, moment, COPS dive way, Memphis

And Mustang spins straight -- Screeching spin ... And
Memphis takes HARD LEFT ...
And he's managed outrun them... Finding Lower
Grand... Looking ...
He secondary pursuit ... Atley
chased... IN THE DISTANCE - Atley LAUNCHED FROM THE SHOULDER,
Firebird rolling drainage culvert ...
Landing sickening thud back. Memphis horrified.

EXT. LANDFILL - RHODE ISLAND - DAY
A vast expanse trash garbage layers earth. Deserted,
THE PANEL VAN parked dead center. Digger Butz slide
casket van, parked ALREADY DUG GRAVE.
As casket, KNOCKING inside. A POUNDING. And
