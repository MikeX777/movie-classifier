PSALM 34:11
THE MOJAVE DESERT - DUSK
Vast. Barren. No signs life.
A BLOOD RED SUN sinking distant mountains. The
unbearable heat soon unbearable cold.
A YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE. Solemn. Weary. Determined.

...TWO LARGE SHAPES UNFOLD FROM HIS BACK, STRETCHING UP INTO
WHAT ARE UNMISTAKABLY...THE SHADOW OF WINGS.
The RAIN POUNDS harder, punishment heavens.
The glint KNIFE coming fast.
A HORRENDOUS SOUND OF FLESH TEARING AWAY FROM BONE...
...THE BLOODY KNIFE CLATTERING TO THE PAVEMENT...
...FOLLOWED BY MICHAEL'S UNGODLY SCREAM RISING UP FROM THE
