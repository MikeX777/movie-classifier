EDWARDS struggling. He writes words answer,
decides erase it. The lack writing surface driving crazy;
pencil TEARS page.
He looks up. In middle tile floor, unused table.

FROM SPACE
Earth tiny ball solar system.
FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE MILKY WAY
Our solar blips light vast star field.
FROM OUTSIDE OUR GALAXY
The Milky Way creamy spiral amid innumerable creamy
spirals.
FROM THE OUTER REACHES OF THE UNIVERSE
There edge see, curved border
close things perimeters, exists
contained tiny ball --
-- actually marble resting strange-looking patch red
dirt.
An ALIEN HAND reaches flicks marble, sending skittering
bouncing dirt, CLICKS dozen big blue
balls like it.
FADE OUT.
