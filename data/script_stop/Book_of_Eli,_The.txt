A civilization destroyed gods destroyed.

Emil Cioran
EXT. FOREST - DAWN
Bare hell. The trees stripped bark white
like ghosts. Some torn violently roots felled.
STARK GRAY SUNLIGHT shafts trees, clouded
creeping fog obscures true color everything. A
LIGHT SNOW flutters. The world monochrome, lifeless cold.
A CAT prowls dead earth. Barely recognizable
domestic breed been. Its fur mangy
rank, body rib-thin starvation. Entirely feral.
It moves slowly, cautiously. Sniffing air, scanning
forest, alert. Trusting surroundings. It paces
leaf-strewn clearing, closing stealthily on:
A DEAD MAN, splayed face-down earth. His feet bare.
Face frozen grim death mask. A GAPING GUNSHOT WOUND
head, dried blood caked matting hair.
As cat moves closer, approaching warily:
P.O.V. FROM ACROSS THE CLEARING
About thirty yards away. Someone watching. Waiting. SLOW,
DEEP BREATHS, heard GASMASK RESPIRATOR.
CLOSE ON A PAIR OF INDUSTRIAL GOGGLES
The MIRRORED LENSES reflecting forest clearing, locked
cat. The slow, metered breathing continues.
THE CAT slows, continues pacing corpse. More
cautious ever. It inches forward, sniffing body.
ON THE WATCHER. Crouched mangled stump felled
tree. Concealed beneath camouflaging mesh leaves, twigs
bracken. A "ghillie suit" kind snipers.
THE CAT sniffs dead man's hand, frozen death
grotesquely contorted claw. The animal unsure. Looks
again, checking surroundings predators.
THE WATCHER moves imperceptibly. The leaves covering
rustle slightly hear - barely -
familiar creaking sound BOW STRING BEING DRAWN TAUT.
THE CAT hears it. Looks up, alert. Staring right
watcher, camouflaged seen. An
interminable, tense BEAT - prey going flee?
Finally, cat turns attention carcass,
nibbling gingerly flesh man's fingers.
2.
THE WATCHER looses arrow. It sails clearing
SKEWERS THE CAT clean through. It drops ground.
THE WATCHER STANDS, shaking ghillie suit, revealing
time.
He wears weather-beaten knee-length duster. Hooded sweater
layers beneath that. Torn pants scuffed work
boots. Everything filthy battered years wear.
Along goggles, face remains obscured
DISPOSABLE PAPER DUST MASK CRUDELY-FASHIONED FUR HAT
dangling ear flaps cat.
Around neck wears silver SAINT CHRISTOPHER PENDANT
hanging frayed twine cord.
His ELI.
He shoulders bow walks clearing. Crouches
dead cat pulls arrow. Wipes blood
shaft, reaches collect body.
Suddenly cat SCREECHES AND FLAILS WILDLY! Eli recoils,
falling backward, stunned, cat - MORTALLY WOUNDED BUT
FIGHTING TO THE DEATH - bites claws desperately him.
Eli struggles violently cat, wrestling
ground grabbing HUNK OF FALLEN BRANCH. He holds
writhing animal CLUBS IT lays still.
He sits back, breathing harder dustmask allow.
He yanks down, revealing dirty, unshaven face beneath.
Impossible tell age, certainly young man.
For moment sits there. Then bundles dead cat
returns mangled tree stump. Folds away ghillie
suit nearby RUCKSACK hauls back.
A canteen dangles backpack, SHOTGUN strapped
side. Eli reaches final possession - old
SAMURAI SWORD scabbard slings back.
He gazes sky. A snowflake drifts lands
cheek. He reaches brushes away, leaving BLACK
SMEAR face. Not snow all, kind ASH.
EXT. FOREST ROAD - DAY
Eli emerges treeline cracked ruptured
asphalt. Lined ghostly, stripped-bare trees.
3.
He sniffs air, breathing in. Checks road
directions. Deserted. A yards away rusted, burned-
chassis CAR. He heads it.
The car rests half road, half adjacent ditch.
Stripped tires engine. In driver's seat
MUMMIFIED BODY. A BULLET HOLE piercing forehead.
Eli regards body dispassionately. Tries door handle
it's jammed. He yanks harder eventually
wrenches open. He leans checks man's feet.
They're bare. No shoes socks. Eli curses breath.
He leaves car heads road. As
walks away, sole boots worn
loose, held place rubber band.
EXT. ROAD - DAY
Eli continues road. He ambles slowly, man
hurry. A man walking long time.
The road emerged forest. Passing
wasteland dead scrub brush urban junk.
The sun beats directly overhead. The sky
color it, paper-white. The unfiltered sun's stark light
leaves bleached-out, over-exposed.
CRANE UP Eli walks on. On horizon silhouette
CITY. Or city. Columns BLACK SMOKE rise
within, casting deathly pall skyline. BURNED
AND BROKEN SKYSCRAPERS jut like tombstones.
Eli reaches fork road stops. The road he's
appears wind direction ruined city
horizon. The fork continues wasteland.
After brief pause, Eli changes direction heads
fork, away city.
EXT. ABANDONED TOWN - DAY
Little main street lined storefronts. Eli
walks steadily along, side-stepping rubble debris.
Ignoring petrified corpses lying street.
He passes abandoned stores, picked clean. Empty
shelves, smashed windows. Looted burned. He doesn't
look inside, knowing nothing.
Until comes store cause stop. An old-
fashioned sign squeaks rusted hinges breeze.
4.
ED'S SHOES - GENTLEMEN'S AND LADIES' FOOTWEAR
He steps doorway pushes open door. It swings
open remaining hinge splintering away
frame crashing floor cloud dust.
INT. SHOE STORE - CONTINUOUS
Eli steps inside. Like others, store
cleaned out. Shoe racks boxes strewn
floor. The place reeking dead, musty air.
Eli looks around, sure. Drags sheathed sword
idly racks checks them. Nothing.
As turns door, foot nudges shoe
box. It's empty. He crouches down, flips lid
hopefully... pulls LADY'S HIGH-HEELED SHOE.
He strokes shoe leather hand. Shakes head
grimly, tosses shoe box leaves.
EXT. ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY
On outskirts town. In disrepair - peeling paint,
broken windows, damp-stained walls - habitable.
Eli stands yard, surrounded brownish,
overgrown weeds. Thinking over. Turns face setting
sun. It dark soon. He turns house.
INT. ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY
The door sent CRASHING OPEN hard kick,
revealing Eli silhouetted fading sunlight. The shotgun
unhitched pack held ready. He moves inside.
Another dead place. Flies buzzing still, dank air.
Everything covered layer dust
largely preserved. An eerie snapshot world long gone.
KITCHEN
Every cupboard empty. Eli checks one, poking
dark corners sword, finds dust.
He opens freezer, checks inside. Empty save small
ICEBOX. The lid stuck fast mildew gunk. Eli digs
grimy fingernails manages pry open.
Inside wizened, petrified remains HUMAN HAND.
Floating slimy, discolored water. The smell vile
Eli retch. He quickly jams lid on.
5.
BEDROOM
A wooden bedframe stripped clean. The dresser drawers
emptied lie strewn floor. Eli moves
large walk-in closet opens door.
No clothes inside - near-fossilized corpse MAN
HANGING BY A NOOSE. Twisting gently forth.
Unfazed, Eli crouches checks man's feet. An old
pair Converse All-Stars hang limp man's skeletal
ankles. Eli calmly sets unlacing them.
He checks size; they're fit. He upturns shoe
shakes old flakes mummified flesh them. Discards
ruined boots puts sneakers, laces up.
He walks around, pacing down, getting feel
new shoes. They feel good. For time, smiles.
LATER
Eli sits corner, roasting carcass dead cat

watches cook. Pokes meat pen-knife, checking
done-ness. It appears ready eat.
He clasps hands prayer.
ELI
Dear Lord, thank
generosity providing today
bountiful feast.
He speaks QUIETLY, voice barely whisper. Even so,
catch accent - RASPY, OLD-WORLD MIDWEST DRAWL, like
John Wayne long-forgotten western icon.
ELI

given me. Thank
protection guidance.
Thank bringing far.
I know long journey's end
near. I ask
strength courage

infinite wisdom saw fit bestow
men. I won't let

He signs cross himself, uses knife saw
chunk meat. Takes bite, savoring taste great
relish. To him, it's grade-A filet mignon.
6.
ELI
Hey. You hungry?
It appears talking himself... RAT
emerges coat pocket, whiskers twitching keenly. Eli
offers meat. The rat gnaws enthusiastically it.
SUNDOWN
The waning sunlight shafts bedroom's
broken window. Eli rummages backpack, pulls
SMALL PACKAGE wrapped cloth tied fast string.
He sits corner carefully unwraps it. It's
OLD LEATHER-BOUND BOOK. The binding cracked pages dog-
eared, thumbed thousand times more.
Eli gazes lovingly it. Lets fingers play
beat-up old leather cover. A cherished thing.
He begins read, half-hidden shadows fading
sunlight. Silently mouthing words reads them.
MANY PAGES LATER
Eli closes book parcels before.
Replaces pack, reaches else.
A CAR BATTERY. Old streaked acid stains. Attached
tangled bunch ELECTRICAL WIRING JUMPER CABLES. Eli
reaches pocket produces:
AN IPOD. Badly beat-up, case pretty held
duct tape. But functional. Eli attaches battery
cable iPod places headphones ears.
The music plays. Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 20 D Minor.
Eli rests wall pushes volume way up.
THE MUSIC SWELLS. Eli's fingers dance swoop air,
conducting orchestra, transported
music world, world far one.
MORNING
Sunlight shafts window. Eli sits slumped
exact position, headphones ears. Asleep.
The rat scurries Eli's chest licks face. Slowly,
wakes, realizing fell asleep music on.
Checks battery. It's dead, drained overnight. He frowns.
He gets feet, moves window checks outside.
All quiet. He loads backpack weapons.
7.
ELI
Come now.
The rat scurries leg, duster disappears
breast pocket. Eli turns moves out.
EXT. ABANDONED HOUSE - MORNING
The gate squeaks shut Eli exits yard.
He breathes air, turns feel warm morning sun
face. Then turns away walks road.
EXT. ROAD - DAY
The landscape barren featureless, road lined dead
trees. Eli walks warped broken asphalt.
The road strewn burned-out cars debris
world long dead. A warped metal sign road
reads: LITTER REMOVAL NEXT TWO MILES BY: "CIRCUIT CITY".
Up ahead HUNCHED FIGURE road. Eli
arrives it's YOUNG WOMAN. Bone-thin, dressed
filthy rags. Skin plagued unpleasant rash.
The SHOPPING CART pushing overturned
roadside ditch, spilling contents. Blankets, tins
food, old clothes. She's knees trying gather up.
She looks sees Eli approaching. Instantly cowers
him, raising hands protect herself. Terrified.
YOUNG WOMAN

She blinks. Unsure. Cautiously reaches takes it.
YOUNG WOMAN

I can't.
Eli looks cart. It come rest ditch
inches THICK BRACKEN HEDGEROW lines road.
He looks girl. Her faded blouse unbuttoned,
revealing little cleavage. Her skirt torn leg,
showing little thigh. Almost deliberate.
He sniffs air. Watches hedgerow warily. Just like
cat hunted, senses heightened alert.
Behind hedge, THREE ROADSIDE BANDITS crouched,
waiting pounce. Each armed crude blunt weapon. They
exchange anxious looks.
ELI sniffs air - backs away girl.
ELI
One good thing soap
more. You smell road agents
mile off.
The girl's face falls Eli backs up. The bandits
EMERGE FROM THE HEDGEROW, brandishing weapons. A couple
wear old sunglasses goggles similar Eli's.
The BANDIT LEADER grabs girl fistful hair
passes, yanking painfully feet.
BANDIT LEADER
Dumb bitch. What tell you?
He pushes away, crumples road heap.
Eli backs away, TWO MORE ARMED BANDITS drop hiding
trees behind, cutting escape, surrounding him.

The bandits exchange nervous looks. This

ROAD, blood pooling asphalt.
The bandit leader crawls severed hand, yards

He turns young woman slumped road, sobbing.
She cowers approaches, certain next.
He WALKS PAST HER. Sheathes sword, pulls

incredulously gathers supplies cart.
ELI

She looks him, puzzled.
YOUNG WOMAN

Eli says nothing. Walks slain bandits, crouches
begins searching bodies.
He takes scarf neck one. Finds Zippo
lighter another, checks works pockets it.
LATER

He walks on, horizon.
EXT. FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY
Straddling desert like giant, crumbling monument
long-dead civilization. Eli steadily climbs way up.
He comes abrupt stop realize suddenly
overpass COLLAPSED mid-point. RUSTED IRON RODS jut
roadway severed.
Eli stands edge moment, feeling
wind whip him, coat fluttering breeze.
13.
The overpass's collapsed section MOUNTAINOUS
PILE OF RUBBLE leads road below.
Eli steps rubble. About way
FREEZES. He hears something. The faintest sounds. He takes
cover, peering road beneath overpass see:
TWO PEOPLE walking road. We
ELI'S P.O.V. - far detail,
apparently MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE.
The man pushes OLD WHEELBARROW covered tarp
woman, seemingly wife, walks alongside. The barrow's
rusted wheel gives plaintive, rhythmic SQUEAK.
Eli ducks hears else. This time
louder. The menacing growl MOTORCYCLE ENGINES.
FOUR BIKES IN TOTAL. Riding horizon, closing
couple. They bikes coming panic. Try
desperately steer barrow road.
The bikes screech halt FOUR RIDERS dismount.
Brandishing variety weapons. The couple run

The road Eli leads west. The
fork heads SMALL TOWN visible horizon.
A HAND-PAINTED SIGN driven dirt nearby. No
words, series CRUDE PICTOGRAMS. A BED. A PLATE OF
FOOD. A WATER FAUCET. AN ARROW points town.
Eli pauses, thinking over. Retrieves iPod
pocket. Clicks button, response. He sighs.
He turns heads fork, town.
EXT. DESERT TOWN - OUTSKIRTS - DAY
A primitive, sprawling village tents barn-like
structures. Built corrugated iron, rotted wood, molded
plastic, tarpaulin - materials scavenged old world.

Eli stands edge town. Reluctant enter,
braces walks in. And rounds corner,
entering center town, astonishing sight:
EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS
The broad thoroughfare remains town
stood here. Many old storefronts largely
intact patched salvaged materials. The asphalt
street warped cracked, parking meters bent smashed.
It's lot like abandoned town Eli passed
earlier, VERY MUCH ALIVE - BUSTLING WITH TOWNSFOLK.
It's familiar disturbing sight - like
old Norman Rockwell painting classic small-town America,
filtered devastating eye apocalypse. An
unsettling juxtaposition old world new.
15.
The centerpiece town GRAND THEATER head

Eli walks street approaches BLACKSMITH,
hammering metal plate anvil outside store.
ELI

The blacksmith doesn't look work motions
storefront far end street.

Curious, Eli reaches runs hand statue's
face. Then hears SHUFFLING FEET turns
PARADE OF EMACIATED MEN AND WOMEN trudges past. Roped
waist, man leading behind.
Heads shaved, malnutrition. And BLIND.
They gaze ground pale, dead eyes. They carry
picks, shovels tools - sightless CHAIN GANG.
Eli watches pathetic parade shuffles past, herded like
cattle brutish CHAIN GANG BOSS swats
stick moving indicate direction.
CHAIN GANG BOSS

The gang boss glares Eli passes by. Eli doesn't
return look, continues crossing street
blind herded away. Headed wooden building
pictogram LIGHTNING BOLT suspended door.
INT. ENGINEER WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
Whatever place was, it's kind POST-
APOCALYPTIC RADIO SHACK. Shelves display variety goods.
Engine parts. Old electrical wiring. Small appliances.
An old ELECTRIC GENERATOR rumbles noisily, powering strings
multi-colored CHRISTMAS LIGHTS hang around.
16.
Behind main counter convoluted Rube Goldberg-esque

remnants motor oil still's funnel.
Attached old MOTORCYCLE MIRROR. In

ELI

The engineer raises shotgun nervously again.
ELI

The engineer watches like hawk Eli opens pack

Eli places counter. The engineer looks
awe, like it's priceless historical artifact.
ENGINEER
