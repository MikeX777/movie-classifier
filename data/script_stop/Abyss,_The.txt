In attack center, darkened womb-red, crew's faces shine sweat
glow instruments. The SKIPPER EXEC crowd
BARNES, sonarman.
CAPTAIN
Sixty knots? No way, Barnes... reds don't
fast.
BARNES
Checked twice, skipper. It's real unique
signature. No cavitation, reactor noise...
doesn't sound like screws.
He puts signal speaker attack room listens
intruder's acoustic signature, strange THRUMMING. The captain studies
electronic position board, graphic representation contours
steep-walled canyon, symbol Montana, converging it,
amorphous trace, representing bogey.
CAPTAIN
What hell it?

display... AS THE SHEER CLIFF WALL LOOM BEFORE THEM.
HELMSMAN
Hydraulics restored, sir.
EXT. U.S.S. MONTANA 7
The cliff wall materializes blue limbo port bow
nightmarish slow-motion. The sub slams horrific force, scraping
bouncing off. One tail stabilizer sheared big screw
prangs wall earsplitting K-K-KWANG!
INT. PORT TO TORPEDO ROOM 8
With outer tube-doors torn off, seawater slams in, busting inner
hatches. Two-foot columns water, like fire-hoses gods,

The Captain locks eyes Exec amid din...
CAPTAIN
We're losing her. Launch buoy!
The Exec opens door small box punches button. A red light
comes on. The Captains takes deep breath.

A tiny transmitter ejected sub's hell begins long ascent
surface. A second later sub slams like piledriver
ledge, tearing open pressure hull.
INT. MONTANA 13

Bud's scowl deepening DeMarco started talk.
BUD
Don't guys stuff type
thing?
DEMARCO
By time rescue submersible
storm right us. But
rig storm on-

option right now.
Hippy, born suspicious recently graduated paranoid, leans forward...
HIPPY
Why risk butts job like this?
KIRKHILL
I authorized offer special-

Flatbed towing like tug, aided Deepcore's mighty stern
thrusters.
INT. DEEPCORE/CONTROL MODULE 31
Bud, feet propped up, uses joystick controls 'fly' Deepcore,
maneuvering currents seafloor obstacles. He guided
side-scan sonar display, Hippy assisting sonar shack.
Through viewport, Flatbed seen ahead.
McBride appears bridge monitor, holding sheet weather-fax.
MCBRIDE (on screen)
Well, it's official, sportsfans. They're calling
Hurricane Frederick, it's going

Hi, Lins. I thought Houston.
LINDSEY
I was, I managed bum ride

can't believe let grab rig!
BUD
Your rig?
LINDSEY
My rig. I designed damn thing.
BUD
Yup, Benthic Petroleum paid it. So long
they're hold pink slip, I
tell me.

CLUNK mates up.
INT. DEEPCORE/COMPRESSION CHAMBER/GAS CONTROL STATION 45
Lindsey drops hatch small cylindrical pressure chamber.
The SEALs drop her, passing gear hand-over-hand.
The chamber spartan, steel benches, folding card table, breathing

LINDSEY
Couldn't stay away. You running mixture us?
Good. Couldn't ask better.
CATFISH
Okay, go. Start equalizing, y'all.
HISSSS inrushing compressed gas. The pressure chamber rises. The
breathing mixture composed helium, oxygen nitrogen. Catfish
monitors carefully station outside chamber, watching
gauges practiced eye. Lindsey SEALs grab noses
start making funny faces... popping ears familiar diver's
'equalization' technique. They continue as:
LINDSEY
Get comfortable. The bad news got

intentionally holding him. One Night starts cry,
quietly.
CATFISH

Bud, it's over, man. It's over.
There beat silence. Bud stares Lindsey's half-open,
motionless eyes.
TIGHT ON LINDSEY'S EYES, moving pupil FILLS FRAME, black void.
REVERSE, HER POV. SILENCE. A distant, distorted image, Bud, One

BUD'S POV... A glowing figure hovers him, like vision. It
angel. Seen closer, drifts him,
extraterrestrial being, bioluminescent like deep-sea fish. Its body
limbs transparent, resembles figure blown glass. A
delicate mantle veil billows like corona, pulsates
gently, propelling hypnotic grace Spanish dancer. The

It stunningly beautiful.
The creature settles him. Unafraid, Bud extends hand.
Its slender, blown-glass digits grasp bulky glove. It pulls

Weakly, uncouples helmet pulls free. Drops knees.
Doubles spasms wrack him. Breathing fluid explodes lungs.
He lies gasping coughing floor, dragging deep breaths

Bud slowly recovers, sitting up. His head clearing. This

NTI joined others, identical, group seven
gathered watching him.
BUD
Howdy, Uuuh... guys doin'?
His voice echoes metallically strange chamber. Soft laps water
'walls'.
In air pattern glowing lines appears, series appears

nearby, high dry... prop whining futility.
ON EXPLORER'S DECK, McBride, Bendix, DeMarco, rest Navy
contingent... they're standing open-mouthed, dream-like daze.
Touched hand God.
BENDIX
Look...
WHAT THEY SEE -- Fifty yards away, Albany, sits Deepcore
Two. It looks like particularly ugly unwanted toy, sitting
glistening plain NTI Ark's hull.
CLOSER, ON TRIMODULE C, hatch opens.
Catfish's feet appear, bicycling. He swings pearlescent 'deck'.
Stands blinking sunlight, mole-like. Jammer plonks
him. He turns, lifts Lindsey down. Hippy, Sonny, rest, emerge
light sun. A deliverance blackest night
know.
LINDSEY
We dead. We didn't decompress.
CATFISH
Out blood oughta fizzin' like warm, shook-
Coke.
HIPPY
They must've us.
Lindsey tears streaming cheeks... sun, life,
deliverance larger knows happened, epiphany
human race.
LINDSEY
Oh, yes. I think that.
She blinks. Seeing far away. She gives little laugh,
laughing crying.
REVERSE, Bud walks curving incline mouth-like
enterances NTI structure. His suit casually unzipped FBS
helmet dangles hand jauntily.
She starts him. Breaks run. Then stops feet him.
Watching come her.
His smile, eyes illuminating her.
He stops touches him, lightly. Is real?
The look other, wonderingly moment.
Then laugh. She sniffs loudly.
LINDSEY
Hello, Brigman.
BUD
Hello, Mrs. Brigman.
Their lips meet.
CUT TO BLACK
