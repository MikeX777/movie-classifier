1 EXT. CONSTELLATION OF ORION - NIGHT
Stars glitter like diamonds black velvet backdrop space.
The Belt Orion center screen, nearer larger
seen Earth-bound astronomer.
A speck light appears lower left corner screen.
No spaceship seen, glowworm, solitary sperma-
tosoan gliding womb universe. Over HEAR
voice astronaut. He concluding report.
ASTRONAUT'S VOICE
(o.s.)
So ends signal reach
destination. We automatic,
mere light years
base ... mercy com-
puters. I've tucked crew
long sleep. I'll join presently.
2 INT. CABIN OF SPACESHIP - ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT
The cabin cramped spacious, size
President's cabin Air Force One. In immediate f.g. console
dials switches flanked chairs. Only chairs
occupied. The astronaut's CAMERA. There ladder
amidships leads escape hatch. The Dart cabin
obscured darkness. We hear MUSIC Mozart sonata emanating
phonograph stereotape. The astronaut speaking
microphone.
ASTRONAUT
Within hour shall complete
sixth month flight
Cape Kennedy. By time, ...
He pauses, looking at:
3 TWO LARGE CLOCKS - ON CABIN WALL
One clock marked SELF TIME, instead numerals
twenty-four. One needles moving slowly.
The clock labeled EARTH TIME, units, like
tachometer, given hundreds thousands.
The largest needle clock makes revolution second.
Over hear:
ASTRONAUT'S VOICE
(o.s.)
But according Dr. Hasslein theory
time vehicle traveling close
speed light, old Mother Earth
aged thousand years de-
parture -- scarcely aged
all.
4 CLOSE ON ASTRONAUT
This TAYLOR. He wears simple dungarees (or Churchill suit)
comfortable boots. He calm pensive. Extracting butt
cigar breast pocket dungarees, lights it,
continues:
TAYLOR
It so. This probable:
men sent journey long
moldering forgotten graves;
those, any, read message
different breed. Hopefully,
better one.
He begins roll left sleeve.
TAYLOR
I leave twentieth century
regret. Who it? Marshall? ... said
'Modern man missin 'a link
ape human being.'
He removes cigar mouth, turns look
portholes astral night.
TAYLOR
One final thought -- scientific,
purely personal. Seen here,
looks different ... Time bends
space boundless. It squashes
man's ego. He begins feel like
mote eye eternity. And
nagged question: ahat any-
thing, greet end man's
journey star? Are believe
thousands galaxies,
millions stars, one,
speck solar dust Earth,
graced -- cursed -- human life?
(pause)
I doubt it.
He extracts hypodermic needle breast pocket injects
vein forearm. He continues speaking.
TAYLOR
(sardonically)
That's all. I wonder Man,
marvel universe, glorious
paradox sent unknown...
makes war brother.,
lets neighbor's children starve.
Taylor withdraws hypodermic needle vein secures
drawer console.
TAYLOR
Well then, Earthmen: A missing link
salutes you. Bless you, descendants.
Taylor snuffs cigar butt places drawer
hypodermic. Then, flicking switch Au cut Mozart, rises
looks at:
5 THE CLOCK MARKED EARTH TIME
The longest needle clock makes nearly revolutions
second. The shortest needle points numeral 2105.
6 INT. CABIN - TRACKING WITH TAYLOR
Space scientists presumably solved problem weightlessness,
Taylor walks short distance from; console
section particular effort. CAMERA FOLLOWS him,
glass capsules, "caskets", rear cabin. Taylor
looks them.
7- SEVERAL SHOTS - THE FOUR CASKETS - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.

One open. The occupied astronauts: DODGE,
LANDON STEWART. They, too, wear dungarees boots. Dodge
Landon thirtyish, clean-shaven, virile -- America's finest. Stewart
handsome young woman, hair bobbed short. Their eyes closed
appear breathing -- undertaker
alive.
11 ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING TAYLOR
He grasps handle casket slowly pulls
it. Continuing SILENCE. CAMERA MOVES IN Taylor Dulls glass lid
shut secures it. He adjusts dials inside capsule lies
back, buckling safety belt. CAMERA MOVES INTO A CLOSEUP Taylor.
His eyes open. He serene, enraptured.
(NOTE: Credits appear series shots designed

time.)
DISSOLVE TO:
12- A SERIES OF SHOTS - A DISTANT GLOBE (MINIATURE)

We strange distant planet. At globe occupies
small area screen; new VIEW comes closer
looms larger, if" observed spaceship spiraling orbit
descent.
The topography planet bears little resemblance own. Much
obscured cloud cover; of-it appears
cratered desert reddish hue. We can, however, narrow
"green belts" patch blue water.
In FINAL SHOTS SEQUENCE strange planet
observed spacecraft plummeting thousand
feet thousand feet. It appears ship fall
vast lake surrounded soaring sandstone pinnacles. The water
blue-black, pinnacles vermillion. (This Lake Powell
location, Lone Rock.)
17 INT. SPACESHIP - FULL SHOT - DAY
Four pilot seats seen f.g., glass caskets
b.g. We HEAR RHYTHMIC BLEAT WARNING SIGNAL, RUSH OF WIND
rapid descent, ROAR OF RETROJETS. Then,
great CRASH craft hits water. The ship shudders impact.
Loose equipment falls cabin floor. CAMERA MOVES DOWN cabin
aisle ship begins roll water HOLDS
glass caskets. There THREE LOUD METALLIC CLICKS glass
domes caskets swing open automatically.
18 CLOSE ON TAYLOR
He beard. His eyes come open. Instantly alert,
rises sitting position, gazing at:
19 DODGE AND LANDON - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.

TAYLOR
Landon! Send signal.
LANDON
(dazed)
What signal?
TAYLOR
To Earth! That we've landed!
As Landon lurches communications equipment f.g.

26 EXT. TIM STRANGE PLANET - LONG PANORAMIC SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON (LONE
ROCK, LAKE POWELL)
We looking lifeless desert sandstone buttes pinnacles.
There sign vegetation anywhere. CAMERA PANS DOWN body

red-hot skin ship vaporizes water it.
Suddenly snorkel-like tube sprouts escape hatch,
located amidships.
27 INT. CABIN - CLOSE ON CLOSED ESCAPE HATCH
Dodge, standing halfway ladder., fastened kit gauges
end snorkel tube. He reads dials, removes kit,
sniffs air tube then, taking deep breath, announces:
DODGE
It's breathable.
TAYLOR'S VOICE
(o.s.)
Okay! Blow hatch lose
auxilliary power.
Dodge reaches control mechanism near escape hatch.
28 CLOSE ON TAYLOR AND LANDON
The spray water coming ruptured seam increasing.
The LIGHTS DIM SOUND warning signal FADES. While
Landon fiddles radio, Taylor tries tape recorder
rolling, hear scrambled unintelligible noises.
LANDON
It's use ... goes.
TAYLOR
Forget it. Abandon ship.
29 WIDER ANGLE - TIM CABIN
The escape hatch open. Taylor darts ladder
passes folded life raft Dodge. When Landon reaches ladder,
Taylor hands neatly packed rucksacks, Landon climbs
escape hatch. Taylor follow
rucksack, turns crosses cabin look at:
30 THE TWO CLOCKS - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.
Both clocks stopped: red needle clock labeled SELF
TIME rests numeral 18; red needle clock marked
EARTH TIME rests numeral 3975.
31 EXT. TOP OF SPACECRAFT - MED. SHOT
Dodge inflates raft cartridge compressed air
tosses water. He Landon jump water

LANDON
Well? Where we? Have notion,
skipper?
TAYLOR

That Bellatrix.
36 THE SUN - FROM THEIR P.O.V.
Low horizon, seen dense envelope dust particles.
DODGE'S VOICE

Too red Bellatrix.
37 BACK TO ASTRONAUTS IN RAFT
Landon glances skeptically Taylor.
LANDON
You didn't time check
tapes, don't know,
you?
(as Taylor ignores
him)
What went wrong?
(sardonically)
We weren't programmed land

We've nice snooze. Let's start
earning pay.
38 WIDER ANGLE - THE BEACH
As astronauts step shallow water pull

TAYLOR
Take soil test, Dodge. I'll
check equipment.
Dodge moves inland yards, removes small hand drill
belt, extends rod drill feet begins
subsoil samplings. Taylor begins examine contents
rucksacks. Landon sits beach., hands
knees, gazing moodily sunken spaceship. During
succeeding scenes sense Dodge's obsession scientific
inquiry leaves immune fear: Landon possibly courageous
certainly "human," fears control:
Taylor -- detached, cool misanthropic -- enigma.
TAYLOR
(calls Dodge)
Got sensors?
DODGE
Yo!
TAYLOR
Geiger counter?
DODGE
Yo!
TAYLOR

Air leak. Died sleep.
LANDON
You don't cut
it.
TAYLOR
It's little late wake. She's
dead nearly year.
LANDON
Then we've away Earth
eighteen months.
TAYLOR
By time.
(smiling Landon)
You've turned gray.
Landon involuntarily touches gray hair temple Taylor
adds lightly:
TAYLOR
Apart that, look pretty chipper
man who's thousand thirty
years old.
(casually)
I read clocks. They bear Hasslein's
hypothesis. We've away Earth
thousand years, decade.
(pause)
Still can't accept it, huh?
LANDON
long pause)
You know it.
TAYLOR
Because time wiped
cared -- they're dust.
LANDON
Prove it. If can't back, it's
theory.
TAYLOR
It's fact, Landon. Buy it. You'll sleep
better.
Dodge enters scene. A handful reddish sand dribbles
