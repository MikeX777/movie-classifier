FADE IN
The screen microcosm leaf, crystal drops precipitation, stone,
emerald green moss. It's landscape miniature. We HEAR forest. Some
distant birds. Their sound reverberate cavern. A piece
sunlight refracts drops water, paints patch moss yellow. The
whisper wind joined sound mixes it. A distant
rustling. It gets closer louder. It's shallow breathing. It gets ominous.
We're interlopers floor forest coming.
SUDDENLY: A MOCCASINED FOOT

EXTREMELY CLOSE: PART OF AN INDIAN FACE
