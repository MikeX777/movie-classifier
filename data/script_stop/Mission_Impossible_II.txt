They scarcely bring lips together:
NYAH
Awfully short notice..
ETHAN

NYAH
Who wants decent?..
DISSOLVE:
CLOSE - ETHAN (INT-EXT. SAFEHOUSE - SEVILLE - DAY-EVE)
sleeping. His eyes open slowly. He comes consciousness,
head pillow. Something approaching
anxiety informs features. He lifts head looks
left, angle widening. Nyah lies facing him,
sleeping serenely. Anxiety order oh-God-this-isn't-
approved-recruiting-technique, confirmed. He lets head flop
pillow. Then turns Nyah profile to-

curiosity wonder. He lifts hand
brushes cheek. Her eyes open. She knows is.
ETHAN
So what've got spooks?
Nyah smiles.
NYAH
When they've got recruiting
technique? Not thing.
ETHAN
Oh. Well..this isn't exactly book.
NYAH
They've got book this?
ETHAN
They've got book everything.
NYAH
The spook I knew liar.
Charming absolutely incapable
telling truth. He'd lie

occupational hazard. All spies
conceal truth tell lies.
ETHAN
Not revealing information doesn't
necessarily liar.
NYAH
That's point. In end
spies rely thing think
know don't.
ETHAN
Which is?
NYAH
That they're lying.
Ethan laughs.
NYAH (cont'd)

Nyah shoulder moves Ethan.
ETHAN
So I got right?
NYAH
You're liar. Or you're awfully
good one..
(then)

ETHAN
I don't know 'pinched' it.
Don't know they're blokes.
Nyah stops think this.
NYAH
Well, then, I I here? I assume
I'm meant sort thief-to

ETHAN
So I. Sort of.
Nyah looks Ethan, little worried.
NYAH
Spoken like spook..you afraid?
ETHAN
Of what?
Nyah laughs.
NYAH
Ask question, answer!..
ETHAN
Damn, you're beautiful.
NYAH
