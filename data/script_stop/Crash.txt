Just outside fence auto-wrecker's yard, wreck,

road surface.
His face fixed rigid mask cuts
traffic lanes, surging ahead fast lane
abreast sliding them, allowing
cars cut taking watchful
position slow lane.
James Vaughan's car battered
before, scarred impact points, rear
window broken, cracked headlamps, body panel detached
off-side rear wheel housing, bumper hanging
chassis pinion, rusting lower curvature touching
ground Vaughan corners.
When slow line tankers, Vaughan makes

scraped crumpled -- mobile accident rolling badly
misaligned wheels.
INT. VAUGHAN'S LINCOLN -- SUNSET

Catherine cranks steering wheel right dives
lanes startled vehicles fishtail

Around decreasing-radius curve utility road,
nimble sports car stretches distance
Lincoln, road uncurls, booming V-8
allows American car gobble ground
nose tail Catherine's car.
James begins bump tail sports car, breaking
accelerator beat let white car --
looks especially fragile delicate comparison --
away bit, charging makes contact.
Now road ahead curves again, Catherine enters
curve, James gives seriously violent jolt. The
rear car slews grass verge, comes
back, loses traction completely.

unceremoniously, gently, small grade, shedding
bits pieces, finally flops halt
cement culvert.
