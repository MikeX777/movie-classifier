Immediately, bends pick but-
HIS REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR REMAINS STANDING IN SILENCE,
WATCHING HIM.
Looking up, man realizes reflection

Terrified, slowly stands staring stationary double.
The pointy sharp piece broken mirror hand reflects
neon lights like knife blade.
His eyes turn cold fear when-
HIS DOUBLE IN THE MIRROR STABS ITSELF DEEP IN ITS THROAT!
IN REALITY, THE MAN HAS NOT MOVED AN INCH, YET HIS THROAT RIPS
