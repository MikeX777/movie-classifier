Steven Soderbergh
October 4, 2001
First, BLACK, hear sound light rain.
Then:
A MAN'S VOICE
I'm poet. I've moved
words.
(beat)
Maybe that's chose me.
EXT. WOODS - DAY
A mural leafless trees beneath overcast sky. Rain
continues fall.
Maybe begin notice strange quality light
(or sky?). Something vaguely unsettling.
CUT TO:
INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
Still, sound rain heard.
A MAN
40s, lies bed, staring us.
He sleeping. In fact, judging distant
expression, slept ages.
CUT TO:
EXT. ROAD - DAY
Less like road like path maneuver
vehicle through.
The Man, dressed rain gear, walks middle. He
accompanied medium-sized LABRADOR,
particular hurry.
The sound tires appear grow intensity. The Man,
saying actual word, instructs dog heal.
The dog obeys Man moves road. The vehicle
hurtles past -- engine quiet, windows darkened --
spraying muddy debris wake.
Seconds later, car brakes abruptly skids stop.
THE MAN
Stops walking stares car, ominously
still.
The car reverses direction begins
Man, remains motionless.
When car alongside him, darkened window turns
transparent WELL-DRESSED BUREAUCRAT rear
seat. His demeanor pleasant professional.
WELL-DRESSED BUREAUCRAT
Dr. Kelvin?
The Man addressing, understand CHRIS
KELVIN, stares him.
CUT TO:
INT. CABIN - DAY
The contrast cabin's rustic aesthetic
aggressively high-tech equipment contained isn't
jarring imagine.
Kelvin seated desk, scrolling text
readout flat, transparent holographic screen. Behind
Well-Dressed Bureaucrat car,
others: A WOMAN 50s MAN 30s. They
well-groomed. Each suits embroidered
small distinctive LOGO sort composes
acronym DBA.
Kelvin scrolls menus, hits keys,
digitized VIDEO IMAGE appears screen: A MAN, unshaven,
looking camera.
The man, GIBARIAN, looks tired somewhat apologetic.
The lower screen time day date
display reads: 0221 HRS 11/14/31.
GIBARIAN
We cosmos, ready
anything: solitude, hardship,
exhaustion, death. We're proud
ourselves, way. But
enthusiasm sham. We don't
want conquer cosmos --
want extend boundaries
Earth cosmos. We
seeking Man. We don't want Other
Worlds. We want mirrors.
(beat)
Maybe don't need know
is, why. Maybe knowing
enough.
Gibarian stares camera long moment
switching ending transmission.
Kelvin sits back.
The visitors exchange glances.
CUT TO:
INT. SPACE CAPSULE
Close Kelvin. We hold long time, myriad
readouts scroll flash face. A slit
sunlight glides slowly frame.
DISSOLVE TO:
KELVIN
capsule, month later. He asleep.
DISSOLVE TO:
KELVIN
capsule, months later. He dictating
coordinates Earth. He absently scratches heavy growth
beard.
DISSOLVE TO:
KELVIN
months later still. He looking small,
rectangular window, fist time cut
approaching planet: SOLARIS.
Kelvin stares it, hypnotized. It translucent
quality, lit within, undulating,
ocean-like surface slowly changes colors.
Kelvin's attention diverted orbiting ship,
PROMETHEUS, edges frame.
KELVIN
Prometheus, Athena 7,
approach, read me?
(beat)
Prometheus, Athena 7,
approach, read me?
No response. He exhales types keyboard.
EXT. SPACE
The Athena 7, sporting DBA logo, advances
Prometheus.
CUT TO:
INT. PROMETHEUS
Kelvin, space suit, climbs difficulty
Athena 7, come rest DOCKING BAY
Prometheus. Several exploratory PODS remainder
area.
Kelvin gets bearings looks around, sees sign
life.
CUT TO:
INT. CORRIDOR
Empty.
(NOTE: Except ROBOTIC, NON-SPEAKING CHARACTERS:
AUTOMATED TASKMASTERS. These small, bug-like repair
units constantly roam ship, fixing things. Their
tiny hum virtually silent, time
Prometheus. They adhere surface
angle.)
Kelvin, space suit holding small
carrying case duffle bag, moves on.
CUT TO:
INT. GIBARIAN'S ROOM
Ransacked.
Kelvin registers it, moves corner room
terminal rests. Within moments
discovered Gibarian recorded video message
replay.
VIDEO
Gibarian addressing camera. He appears lucid,
extremely fatigued.
GIBARIAN
Hi, Chris.
(a light smile)
I'm glad came.
(beat, smile fades)
I little time, I
want tell something. To
warn you. By know

Sartorius tell you; doesn't
matter.
(beat)
I didn't lose mind. You
able tell video.
I'm mad.
(beat)
If happens you, remember
isn't madness.
(beat)
You know, I'm favor
destroying Solaris. I know
that's... illegal. And unethical.
And irresponsible. But it's
way stop.
A long moment silence broken noise video,
draws Gibarian's attention offscreen.
GIBARIAN
(addressing
noise)
Cut out. Do hear me?
Gibarian switches video.
The screen freezes recorded frame
overlays readout indicating file ended.
CUT TO:
INT. CORRIDOR
Empty. But door end it, slightly open.
Kelvin moves it.
INT. ROOM
A FIGURE, seated door, turns
Kelvin enter. This SNOW. He looks Kelvin down,
expression wary alert.
KELVIN
Snow. Didn't hear radio?
I'm Kelvin.
A long beat. Snow watches him.
SNOW
Yes. We heard.
Kelvin takes step forward, Snow recoils.
KELVIN
What's wrong? What happened
Gibarian?
SNOW
He's dead.
KELVIN
How?
A beat.
SNOW
Suicide.
Snow exhales, looks he's remembered
something.
SNOW
You didn't bring chocolate,
you?
KELVIN
What?
SNOW
(musing)
I love chocolate. I realized
yesterday I love it.
(beat, recovers)
I thought maybe, let
bring personal effects,
snuck through, because...
well, I've thinking it.
A long beat Kelvin stares Snow.
KELVIN
What happened here?
Snow lies bunk.
SNOW
I can't talk now. I'm
tired.
KELVIN
Where's Sartorius?
SNOW
In lab. He won't let in.
KELVIN
(leaving)
He'll let in.
SNOW
Kelvin,
unusual...
Kelvin stops, doesn't turn around.
SNOW
... try stay calm.
CUT TO:
INT. CORRIDOR
Kelvin stands outside door.
KELVIN
Let in.
A beat.
SARTORIUS
(inside, muffled)
You word
won't come in. Then I'll come out.
KELVIN
All right.
Sartorius cracks door open slithers slit
hallway. He obvious intelligence
messed with; contentious, intimidating wants
be, probably brilliant. Kelvin eyes suspiciously.
KELVIN
What happened Gibarian?
SARTORIUS
Didn't talk Snow?
KELVIN
I want hear version.
SARTORIUS
(incredulous)
Who, here, possibly care
want? At best, you're Employee
Month highest bidder
Solaris auction. They
idea what's going here.
They've space.
And I'm supposed listen you?
KELVIN
I recover mission,
report findings,
recommendation. Now: What happened
him?
SARTORIUS
The thing happen
us.
KELVIN
Where's body?
SARTORIUS
In lab. With her, probably.
KELVIN
Her? Who talking about?
Sartorius grabbed
door. He struggles composure.
SARTORIUS
His wish buried
Earth. In dirt, said. "I want
buried dirt." What clown.
Sartorius losing battle whomever
door.
KELVIN
They shouldn't let people like
space.
SARTORIUS
Just know: I'm going
I understand is.
I going figure
is, stop, I
home.
KELVIN
Listen --
SARTORIUS
We're done. Oh, I tell you,
I don't trust Snow. There's
wrong him.
Sartorius rotates zips room. As door
closes Kelvin sees flash ANOTHER FIGURE Sartorius'
room. The glimpse quick judge
figure been.
CUT TO:
INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
Kelvin walks, exploring ship. He sees
stops him:
A NUDE WOMAN

time gets there, gone.
CUT TO:
INT. SNOW'S ROOM

Why, see?
KELVIN
Gibarian warned me. He left
message.
SNOW

KELVIN
She real. Where come
from?
Snow looks doesn't respond.
KELVIN
Tell me. I won't think you're

SNOW
Oh, that's relief.
Snow lies down.
KELVIN
Where come from?
A beat.
SNOW
How sleep need?
KELVIN
How sleep?
SNOW
How long sleep?
KELVIN
That depends.
SNOW
Well, sleep:
barricade door.
Snow rolls over, away Kelvin.
CUT TO:
EXT. SPACE
Solaris. Quiet, active somehow.
KELVIN (V.O.)
The Prometheus, far I
tell, functionally intact. Crew
status: One dead, Gibarian. Cause
death appears suicide.
CUT TO:
INT. KELVIN'S ROOM
Kelvin speaks video communication device. As does,
images things people describes.
KELVIN
Interviews surviving
members perusal
deceased's personal effects
indicate suffering
severe depression psychotic
features, bouts
hypomania, dementia, delirium,
primary insomnia. All
symptoms, combined profound
sense isolation, commonly
studies low stimulation
environments, particularly long
range space travel. Snow
Sartorius indications
depression, including dysthymic
bipolar I; variety stress
disorders, including acute
posttraumatic; suggestions
agoraphobia, obsessive/compulsive
disorder, hypersomnia. I
emphasize preliminary
opinions part. I
attempt convince Snow
Sartorius return Earth,
currently view
intruder sorts,

ANOTHER ANGLE
On Kelvin, asleep. Then:
EXTREME CLOSE-UP:
A WOMAN'S LIPS, slightly parted.
BACK TO KELVIN
Asleep. Then:
INT. TRAIN - DAY
Continued silence, AND:
RHEYA, 30s, staring us, practically daring look
away. Her obvious intelligence confidence
extremely compelling, fact
parted lips looking moment ago. Her expression
indicates she's raw emotional state.
REVERSE ANGLE
Kelvin person locked eyes TRAIN.
He younger here; age, spirit. The
contrast older self striking.
BACK TO KELVIN
Asleep ship. After beat:
EXTREME CLOSE-UP:
Rheya's LIPS.
Except circumstance clearly different: it's darker
isn't side-to-side shimmy train car.
A WIDER VIEW
Reveals Rheya sitting train --
sitting Kelvin's room Prometheus, right now.
She staring Kelvin ethereal
stillness.
KELVIN
Awakens, blinks, slowly recognizes her.
If entirely surprised
obviously dreamed Rheya before. He looks her, simply.
RHEYA
Stands makes way Kelvin.
Without hesitation kisses begin explore
happen things
obvious: first, before, two:
haven't time.
CUT TO:
INT. KELVIN'S ROOM

Oh, God. I'm awake.
RHEYA
Yes.
He looks her.
KELVIN
Where come from?
She moves kisses that's wants
do, forever.
Between kisses.
KELVIN
How here?
She stops.
RHEYA
How mean?
(beat)
Chris, what's wrong?
Hearing spoken (and particular words,
perhaps) nearly causes Kelvin scream.
He stands moves chair. Rheya watches him.
RHEYA
I love you.
He looks long can. Then looks

RHEYA
Do love me?
He doesn't look up.
KELVIN
Yes.

KELVIN
I need Snow.
RHEYA

KELVIN
(rising)
I'll minute.
She bolts bed.
RHEYA
Don't.
KELVIN
Why?
RHEYA
I don't know. I can't alone.
KELVIN
I'll right back.
She trying accommodate fear left
palpable, excessive. He sees puts
arms shoulders comfort her.
KELVIN

He hands pills retrieves glass water.
RHEYA
What they?
KELVIN
To calm anxiety.
RHEYA
To calm anxiety.
She takes pills smiles.
CUT TO:
INT. DOCKING BAY

space suits.
RHEYA
We're taking flight?
KELVIN
Yes.
He opens door pod indicates enter.
She unsure.
KELVIN
Go ahead. I'll close door
me.
She stares pod. Kelvin watches
difficulty CLOSES THE DOOR Rheya.
He walks docking bay control room
begins preparations pod jettisoned.
KELVIN
In agony watches real-time, beat-by-beat brand
technological murder place: Rheya's pod pushed
space.
RHEYA
Her face contorted confusion, watches pod
window docking bay doors close
brutal finality.
KELVIN
collapses ground, shattered.
INSERT:
A woman's HAND, resting floor apartment. The
fingers licked LABRADOR PUPPY.

A voice calls intercom: Snow's.
SNOW
Was breakfast conversation
bad?
KELVIN
Shut up.
SNOW
I told you, try stay calm.
You're supposed
psychologist bunch.
KELVIN
What it?
Kelvin rises goes wash face.
SNOW
Personally, I think it's God. At
least, fits definition.
KELVIN
And professionally?
SNOW
I'm sure.
(beat)
It started Gibarian. He
locked room
refused talk
crack door. He covered
video lens. Obviously thought
having nervous breakdown.
I don't know didn't tell
somebody there. By
time, getting visitors,
too. He desperately trying
figure out. Day night.
(beat)
Who she?
KELVIN
My wife.
SNOW
Dead?
Kelvin nods.
SNOW
She materialized
memory her. What name?
KELVIN
Rheya.
SNOW
It started months ago.
Right government sold
expedition. We ready

KELVIN
Will come back?
SNOW
Probably.
KELVIN
I wish you'd told me.
SNOW
Told what?
A beat.
SNOW
What say?
KELVIN
To who?
SNOW
What going report
Earth?
KELVIN
I don't know.
SNOW
An enormous money changed
hands control
project. We little danger
left long.
(beat)
You'll need something.
Otherwise they'll sending
recover you.
KELVIN
Gibarian said thinks Solaris
destroyed.
SNOW
That's ludicrous. This contact.
We God. The issue
figuring prove
way sense
Earth. So
it, choose
all?
CUT TO:
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM
Before Kelvin's arrival.
Gibarian talking Snow Sartorius.
GIBARIAN
A pre-biological colloidal
envelope, possibly exceeding
terrestrial structures
complexity; plasmic mechanism.
Probably life
conceive it, capable
performing functional activities
astronomic scale. My view
Solaris reached,
single bound, "homeostatic
ocean" stage passing
stages terrestrial
evolution. I think bypassed
cellular development altogether.
It hasn't taken endless eons
adapt environment,
fact dominated
environment immediately. From
moment existed,
superior element Universe.
And passes time
extravagant theoretical thinking
Universe,
cast.
We scene played video monitor,
watched Kelvin.
GIBARIAN
It's engaged never-ending
process transformation;
ontological autometamorphosis,
begging question: Can thought
exist separately
consciousness?
SNOW
It's God.
SARTORIUS
I don't care is, need
figure stop.
GIBARIAN
Nelson, opportunity --
SARTORIUS
What thing follows
Earth? What what's happening
started happening Earth,
mass scale? Don't
problem? I think it's
mistake assume it's
benign. For know it's
driving crazy watch
kill other.
Gibarian considers this.
SNOW
We're sure let
leave.
CUT TO:
ANOTHER VIDEO
This time, Gibarian alone. Near end.
GIBARIAN
Maybe it's stuck. Maybe power
isn't God-like. I mean,
God-like power relative
insect, doesn't mean
Earth will.
Maybe it's like spider web,
waiting up.
(beat)
We intercepted brief fragments
everlasting
monologue itself. Of course
understanding.
(beat)
I've come hate here. There's
way reach,
us. Humans.
CUT TO:
INT. LAB
Kelvin stares Gibarian's body, lying
sheet ship's operating room. Also sheet,
Gibarian: The Young Girl.
GIBARIAN
(from video)
I thought I'd behaving
normally, rationally. But sign
insanity inability
think thing.
So I consumed idea
I insane can't think
else, I insane.
(beat, smiles)
You ask questions end
life, sort questions
people content don't ask.
(beat)
Maybe life can't solved.

KELVIN
What remember?
RHEYA
What mean?
KELVIN
Do remember Beethoven? The
Beatles? Movies, books,
restaurants, friends?
RHEYA
(thinking)
Yes. But mentioned
them. As soon said
things, I remembered them. And
associations
think things I remember.
It's like filling up.
She looks portal Solaris.
RHEYA
Is planet?
KELVIN
Not exactly. It exists
continuum wasn't proven
years ago, higher
mathematical dimension superimposed
Universe. An
infinite number them, fact.
It violation
laws
Universe, Space, Space-Time. It
completely counter-intuitive.
We unlearn everything.
RHEYA
Is intelligent?
KELVIN
Intelligent
comprehension.
RHEYA
Then it's God, right?
KELVIN
It's something.
RHEYA
You don't believe God?
KELVIN
The idea God dreamed
silly animal small
brain called Man. Even limits
human limits. It
this, that! It
designs, creates!
RHEYA
Even God wasn't active,
created stood
watched?
KELVIN
You're talking man
white beard again. You're
ascribing human characteristics
isn't human. Human
beings look causes
patterns. How know
Solaris to, anything?
A beat.
RHEYA
But Solaris
The Big Bang?
KELVIN
As I said,
comprehension.
RHEYA
As I said, it's God, right?
She looks can't smiling, eventually.
RHEYA
Why talking shit
fucking?
Kelvin smiles.
The intercom comes life.
SNOW
Kelvin, awake?
KELVIN
What it?
SNOW
Can meet Sartorius B
deck hour?
KELVIN
Why?
SNOW
Just little strategy session.
But person time.
CUT TO:
INT. KELVIN'S ROOM
Kelvin getting ready leave. Rheya sits edge
bed, nervous.
KELVIN
All right?
She nods Kelvin exits, locking door him.
We sit moment tries remain calm.
IN THE CORRIDOR
Kelvin listens. A long time.
Satisfied, begins walk away stopped
sounding CRASHING GLASS within. He hears footsteps
approach door, fierce POUNDING.
He takes step back. An INHUMAN AMOUNT OF NOISE begins
emanating door,
threatening break apart. It sounds like plane
crashing Kelvin's room -- human create kind
cacophony.
Finally, steps forward presses button open
door.
RHEYA
Is revealed, covered blood. She completely torn
inside cabin door apart badly injured
process.
KELVIN
Rheya...
Confused, looks takes arms
carries bed.
RHEYA
What happened?
KELVIN
You trying break

RHEYA
When I saw gone I got
scared.
He puts bed runs bathroom,

Returning, blanches.
Rheya's wounds HEALED; fact, HEALING

She looks doesn't like look face.
RHEYA
Chris, what's wrong me?
CUT TO:
INT. LAB
Kelvin runs Rheya battery tests studies

RHEYA
Am I right?
A beat.
KELVIN
Yes.
CUT TO:
INT. B DECK CONFERENCE ROOM
Snow Sartorius wait Kelvin.
SNOW
He won't it.
SARTORIUS
Why that?
SNOW
He won't.
Kelvin enters, Rheya. Snow Sartorius exchange
glances.
KELVIN
This wife, Rheya.
She looks Snow nods. Sartorius hates instantly,
feeling mutual.
SARTORIUS
We thought you'd alone. We want
talk about...
SNOW
We want talk freely.
KELVIN
Go ahead.
Sartorius begins.
SARTORIUS
I suggest pool knowledge
the... visitors. We
express questions
conclusions have... share
information various...
experiments. Agreed?
Kelvin Snow nod.
SARTORIUS
I like start
motivation. Why here?
Sartorius looks Rheya. She looks away.
SARTORIUS
They autonomous individuals
they're actual persons.
They projections materializing
minds, based given
individual.
SNOW
It's experiment.
KELVIN
No. There's behavior
modification.
SARTORIUS
She reappeared exactly
before?
Kelvin looks Rheya nods. She struck word
"before".
SNOW
The vulnerabilities?
He nods again.
SARTORIUS
A recoil, compensating
mechanism.
SNOW
And given situation
longer corresponds normal
faculties the... original,
visitor suffers sort
disconnected consciousness.
SARTORIUS
Followed non-human
manifestations.
SNOW
Are actions Solaris
premeditated?
KELVIN
Is deliberately cruel,
mean? I don't think so.
SNOW
I'm trying
explanation continual
reappearances.
KELVIN
(to Rheya)
When cut pounding
door, hurt?
RHEYA
Yes.
(looks around)
Of course.
SARTORIUS
If they're learning
they're modifying
behavior, come back?
SNOW
It's like they're plugged
game, goes around,
endlessly repeating itself.
CUT TO:

This years ago. Rheya enters, alone.
She crosses kitchen makes drink. Almost
immediately, labrador puppy enters bedroom

continues mixing drink.
Halfway activity, bedroom light comes on. A

KELVIN
How old you?
RHEYA

continues story beat.
RHEYA
Scared. No, scared. Wary.
Like I be...
guard went up. I threat.
Now I know why. She afraid
she'd seen. That I

was. I think thought
years
pedestal. But that's
cycle, right? I knew little
did, knew little
mother,

(beat)
I guess that's reason
--
KELVIN
I know. I know. We don't
talk that.
Another beat.
RHEYA
I remember days thinking
you.
INT. OFFICES - DAY
Intercut Kelvin Rheya respective jobs, going
normal day. There sound. As
images, it's clear Kelvin Rheya slightly
present respective encounters people;

KELVIN
I watch undress.
As does:
KELVIN
I tired watching

exciting. Right until...
end.
A beat. Then shot Kelvin we've seen before: Him
leaving apartment, angry.
ON THE PROMETHEUS
A beat.
RHEYA
What happened us, exactly?
KELVIN
You don't know?
Rheya shakes head.
Kelvin watches her.
RHEYA
I remember... burning.
Coffee burning.

Kelvin bed speaking videophone Snow.
Rheya asleep background. The room dark
glow screen.
SNOW
You're unnerved you've
spent life thinking
looking you,
suddenly subconscious
open book. We are,
time, experiencing changes
natural reality force
own. That proves --
KELVIN
-- sure that. We
sure aren't
hallucinating.
SNOW
If God comprehension,
--
(meaning Rheya)
-- reasons can't
understood, isn't God here?
KELVIN
Not necessarily.
SNOW
Stop equivocating! Unbelievable,
equivocate! You,
atheist, you're dogmatic
holy person I've seen!
This happening, Kevin. Wake up.
KELVIN
Consciousness enough, that's
I've saying. Consciousness
anybody.
SNOW
Who trying convince?
Kelvin looks Rheya.
SNOW
It end badly. As inevitably
rising bubble.
Kelvin doesn't respond.
SNOW
Let's meet tomorrow. Sartorius

You know, I've decided: I'm

Solaris thing,
it'll life easier;
little wife agreeing big,
strong husband. You
headache thinking
Great Big Problems day.
He stares -- likes this. It's
familiar, type teasing, reminds
things good.
KELVIN (V.O.)
Like I said, it's possible.
A beat.
RHEYA
So, Chris, seriously, aren't
afraid you're going fired?
They laugh.
CUT TO:

RHEYA
You sure "God" lot we're

KELVIN
I know. I'm putting

She smiles.
RHEYA
Right. The report. Report
recommend.
They consider that.
RHEYA
What Snow think do?
KELVIN
Snow thinks shouldn't leave
figure way
document it, prove existence
planet Earth. This
hilarious: He thinks it's God,
wants sit
photograph folks
home.
They smile this. Rheya's smile fades Kelvin's.
RHEYA
Sartorius wants destroy it.
KELVIN
Well. He doesn't think it's God,
different reasons me.
He's thinking: If I figure
stop, I
smarter is,
God.
RHEYA
He point.
KELVIN
He point. That's
way I'd like
proven.
RHEYA
You feel sorry Solaris,

EXT. SOLARIS
Turning, slowly.
CUT TO:
INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
Then years ago. Kelvin, naked, sitting chair,
dark. Rheya, naked, smoking cigarette bed.
KELVIN
Everything pursue, end
disinterested in. The
fact you're good
try makes worse. You
degree animal science,
terrific vet.
You drifted writing turned
perceptive journalist.
Then politics,
best all, actual gift
understanding best pattern
group people
arranged achieve
goal. And didn't know
arranged. But
got bored it, like
everything.
She smokes, looking him. Maybe it's
common observation she's past defensive it.
KELVIN
I don't know it's like,
know want do.
To love
else.
A beat. He looks her. She interested
cigarette moment.
RHEYA
(sarcastic)
Imagine frustration.
CUT TO:
INT. KELVIN'S ROOM
On Prometheus. Rheya awake, Kelvin asleep.
She rises goes sit chair; anxious,
haven't seen before.
Kelvin wakes up, looks her. Noting expression:
KELVIN
What's wrong.
RHEYA
You don't love me.
KELVIN
Stop.
A beat. She looks down.
RHEYA
I talk you... I... I
don't know I came from.
(up him)
Do know?
He doesn't respond.
RHEYA
If know can't tell
now... able to?
Calmly:
KELVIN
What talking about?
RHEYA
That I Rheya. That Rheya
died. Killed herself. I'm
different.
He's looking her, knows dangerous territory.
KELVIN
Who talking to?
RHEYA
(no reason lie)
Sartorius.
KELVIN
When? When I'm asleep?
She nods. He imagine form Sartorius' anecdotes
taken.
KELVIN
I'm sure worse people
talk to, I don't know

RHEYA
I'm trying understand
what's going on.
A beat.
RHEYA
How lived
years? Did love anyone?
A long beat. Kelvin shakes head.
RHEYA
Did think me?
Another beat. He nods. Then:
RHEYA
But fought.
KELVIN
Yes. Especially end.
RHEYA
Why it?
KELVIN
You... said I didn't love her.
RHEYA
Was right?
KELVIN
No. I love you.
RHEYA
(reflexive, genuine)
I love you, too.
If satisfied moment, Kelvin knows
feeling won't last.
KELVIN
Can sleep?
RHEYA
I don't think do. It's sleep;
it's else. It's
me.
KELVIN
Those dreams.
She falls asleep.
FADE OUT.
FADE IN:
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM
Kelvin, Rheya, Sartorius, Snow. They middle
heated discussion.
SNOW
Gibarian enormous --
SARTORIUS
Gibarian helpless. It's
simple: Man created science
resulted discovery
Solaris, ship brought
here.
KELVIN
Meaning Man
fuck wants?
SARTORIUS
Yes.
KELVIN
That's fantastic.
SARTORIUS
Why agree come here?
A beat.
SARTORIUS
Too tired answer?
Looks Rheya, Kelvin.
SARTORIUS
I'll bet. Is sent
do? You've lost it,
you've gone native.
Kelvin moves him. Sartorius lets come.
RHEYA
(to Sartorius)
You're coward.
KELVIN
Don't debate him; he'll

RHEYA
(still, Sartorius)
I'm human you. I see, I
hear, I touch, I feel like
do.
SARTORIUS
Prove it.
RHEYA
These "guests" you,
subconscious. Chris loves
me.
SARTORIUS
YOU ARE NOT HUMAN! Try
understand
understand anything!
Kelvin inch face.
KELVIN
Get here.
Slowly, carefully, Sartorius grasps Kelvin shoulders.
Then leans whispers Kelvin's ear:
SARTORIUS
Rheya dead. She's copy. A
facsimile. And she's seducing
again. You're sick. You
think fucking research
humanity. It's fucking.
Kelvin backs away.
SARTORIUS
There's grandiose it.
You've jumped plane
you're trying sew parachute
fall.
Sartorius turns...
SARTORIUS
It'd hilarious weren't
damn sad.
And leaves.
A beat.
SNOW
We didn't hear new
ideas.
Snow wanders door.
SNOW
I'm feeling well.
He passes Kelvin leaves.
Kelvin watches him, looks Rheya. She dazed.
CUT TO:
EXT. SOLARIS
The fog-shrouded surface, shifting turning like ocean.
CUT TO:
INT. KELVIN'S ROOM
Rheya asleep. Kelvin talking Snow
videophone.
SNOW
We liquidate station. Take
Athena back.
KELVIN
No.
SNOW
Of course, return, we'll
regarded lunatics tell
truth.
(shrugs)
We'll chalk isolation,
collective derangement.
KELVIN
I've heard express
desire leave now. Why
now?
SNOW
Well, I think we're reaching
point diminishing returns here,
right? Certainly it's learning
we'll learn
it.
KELVIN
But it's
doing? Given it's resources,
anything.
Presented double,
mine.
SNOW
Perhaps did.
KELVIN
Human beings die.
SNOW
But human. They certainly
human incredible speed.
First they're like
memory,
own. DNA doesn't determine
hundreds trillions
connections occur
brain, it's dense enough. They
build experience.
INT. KELVIN'S ROOM - EARLIER
Quick glimpses Rheya. In
repose, thinking, illustrate Snow's point.
INT. KELVIN'S ROOM
Back Kelvin, thinking.
KELVIN
They come sleep.
SNOW
That's right. And
sleep, eventually.
CUT TO:
INT. KELVIN'S ROOM
Kelvin bed Rheya. Their eyes closed.
We think asleep until:
RHEYA
You don't want me.
KELVIN
Rheya.
RHEYA
That's saying. I
heard saying.
KELVIN
For reason
understand, forced stay
near me. That's I know right
now.
She realizes doesn't want argue. Not right now,
anyway.
RHEYA
I strange thoughts, I
don't know come from.
(beat)
I can't explain it.
KELVIN
Neither I. Not it.
There's reference point
what's going on; it's
happened before. It's clean
break fabric
Universe; gap. There
experience it, moment-to-
moment, let destroy us.
RHEYA
But that's happened before.
KELVIN
Not time.
He kisses her. She wants believe him, says
nothing. Then:
RHEYA
Do want stay here?
KELVIN
Do you?
RHEYA
If you're here.
They kiss again...
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. KELVIN'S ROOM
Kelvin asleep. Rheya him.
Offscreen, hear door open.
Someone walks quietly (though surreptitiously)
frame sits.
After long beat, Kelvin bolts upright, mind struggling
clear. When does:
KELVIN
Gibarian.
GIBARIAN
Leave light off.
A beat. Kelvin tries bearings.
GIBARIAN
I wish you'd come little sooner.
I kill
myself.
He smiles, looking Kelvin.
GIBARIAN
You think you're dreaming me, like
dream her. Understand
something: I real Gibarian.
Just new incarnation.
KELVIN
What want?
GIBARIAN
You're tricked. Sartorius
picked fight avoid
telling idea
getting rid visitors. He's
figured they're
subatomic particles called
neutrinos, he's going create
negative neutrino field. Twenty
hours day, they're
Earth.
KELVIN
Can work?
GIBARIAN
It can. Ordinary matter, like
ours? Not affected. Everything
else, disintegrates.
Kelvin registers this.
GIBARIAN
What I'm saying is: Don't trust
anyone. Find weapon
sort.
KELVIN
I trust Rheya.
GIBARIAN
You'll end like me.
KELVIN
You're Gibarian...
GIBARIAN
No? Who I, then?
KELVIN
A puppet.
GIBARIAN
And you're not? Maybe you're
puppet. But like puppets,
think you're actually human. It's
The Puppet's Dream. Wondering
they're human!
Gibarian smiles.
KELVIN
wakes up, gulping air. Rheya, startled:
RHEYA
What's wrong?
KELVIN
Gibarian. He here.
RHEYA
You said dead.
KELVIN
He is. But here...
He moves chair, looking residue Gibarian,
proof. Finding none:
KELVIN
He spoke me.
Kelvin leaves room. After beats, Rheya follows.
INT. LAB
Rheya lingers Kelvin, looking Gibarian's
body.
It there, slab; Young Girl

CUT TO:
INT. KELVIN'S ROOM
Kelvin, thinking. He gives Rheya pills take. She
looks them.
KELVIN
Are going them?
She nods takes them.
RHEYA
What's happening us?
KELVIN
It's right.
RHEYA
Please don't lie. I told

KELVIN
I love you.
RHEYA
Don't. I'm risk here.
If we're playing happened
before, I won't survive.
He goes her.
KELVIN
That won't happen again. We're
different.
RHEYA
How I tell? You've seen
me. I know you're
like here. You're I know.
There "You" before.
She sits, frustrated. Sad.
RHEYA
How cruel? How
torture like this?
KELVIN
I don't think knows it's
torturing us. It's watching.
CUT TO:

Kelvin Rheya, bed. She looks despondent.
CUT TO:

Kelvin asleep. Alone.
After long period silence, hear faint sound

beat, Kelvin awakens. He notices alone,
tells that's good sign.
CUT TO:
INT. LAB
Rheya ground, convulsing. Beside SMALL
STEEL DRUM, spilling strange-looking LIQUID

SNOW
What happened?
KELVIN
She drank liquid oxygen.
INT. KELVIN'S ROOM
Kelvin puts Rheya bed. Her face throat
returned normal, breathing. Kelvin goes

detached.
An uncomfortably long moment realize actually
going wake up.
KELVIN
She's dead.
Snow says nothing.
Then:
Her finger twitches.
Barely noticeable first, growing intensity. Kelvin
sees it, goes her. She starting shake little,
cold.
SNOW
She'll come back, don't worry. But
what? My theory
live here, die
leaves ship.
Kelvin looking Rheya, shaking little
harder; it's feeling like seizure now.
SNOW
Why think hasn't
suggested that? It's
obvious solution: Escape. She
knows can't leave --
KELVIN
Get --
SNOW
Oh, love? What
one, fucked
rocket
blasted space? You didn't
love her?
Rheya shaking harder now, Kelvin tries hold
still, she's strong. He stands, reluctantly,
watches her.
SNOW
What happens comes back? Is
polygamy? And
home,
through? You think they're
going notice her?
Rheya shaking violently now, rippling rhythmic
force coursing her. Snow, looks
dispassionately them:
SNOW
I them, these...
"Resurrections".
He leaves.
Rheya continues process "waking up" -- it's violent,
sexual. She spasms peak sort,
slowly returns normal.
Kelvin puts hand forehead.
She gradually begins open eyes. She looks Kelvin.
It takes moment realize shouldn't seeing him;
shouldn't seeing anything. She dead.
She begins cry.

Slowly, inexorably, black spot begins expand.
Within minute Solaris disappeared.

As fog drifts in, RISE, soon mist nearly
obscured house. The fog turns clouds

We stay translucent white stage moments,

These dark, rounded edges penetrate
forming shape circle.
The misty consistency begins gain color body.
And realize looking surface Solaris.
FADE OUT.
