"O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU"
By
Ethan Coen Joel Coen
BLACK
In black, hear chain-gang chant, voices together,
spaced unison strike picks rock. A
title burns in:
O muse!
Sing me, tell story
Of man skilled ways contending...
A wanderer, harried years end...
On sound impact cut to:
A PICK
splitting rock.
As chant continues, wider angles chain-gang
work. They black men bleached faded stripes,
chained together, working brutal midday sun.
It flat delta countryside; straight-ruled road
stretches infinity. Mounted guards shotguns lazily
patrol line.
The chain-gang chant regular and, seems, timeless.
We slowly fade out, returning
BLACK
The voices fades.
After long beat hear guitar introduction Harry
McClintock's 'The Big Rock Candy Mountain.'
A WHEAT FIELD
A road cuts middle background. Noonday sun beats
down.
We hear distant picks shovels men work
see, rising ground level, occasional upraised pick
spade heaving dirt. Men digging ditch alongside
road.
After long beat, men pop wheat field
middle foreground. They wear faded stripes grey duck-
billed caps. They scurry abreast camera, throwing
occasional glance ditch-diggers. A clanking
sound accompanies run. Oddly, wheat
sweeps run. After brief sprint drop
wheat.
In background man enters frame left, strolling
road, wearing khaki uniform sunglasses, shotgun
resting shoulder. He glances idly
ditch strolls frame right.
The men rise wheat and, clanking,
resume sprint.
THREE PAIRS OF EYES
They topped cap bills, peer
blind greenery. We hear distant whistling.
The men looking weathered barn. A young boy,
whistling, heading road leads away
barn, jiggling traces old plough horse leads
him. He turns corner gone.
BARNYARD
The clanking men (we leg irons)
awkwardly chasing chicken yard. The squawking
yardbird doesn't need elude bunched
men.
COUNTRY LANE
It curves gentle S background. It sun-
dappled, pretty.
We hear clanking footsteps approaching trot.
The men enter foreground trot
lane. The leftmost flapping chicken tucked
arm.
AFTERNOON CAMPFIRE
The men sit side-by-side arc dying fire,
contentedly picking teeth small chicken
bone, wiping grease chin sleeve,
idly poking spit.
Each them, bound chains, clinks moves.
One abruptly cocks head, listening.
The notice attitude freeze, listening.
We hear distant baying hounds.
ROLLING HILLS
From high ridge chained men running
us.
In addition clanks hear distant chugging sound.
TRACKING
Laterally clanking, running feet.
The chugging sound loud.
RUNNING
Next freight train. A boxcar door open.
INSIDE THE BOXCAR
The lead convict hooks elbow starts hauling
up, clanking friends keeping pace outside.
Six hobos sit boxcar, lounging sacks
O'Daniel's Flour. They impassively watch convict clamber
confederates run up.
The convict hauls feet. In spite stubble
carefully tended hair pencil mustache. He
Everett.
As dusts off:
EVERETT
Say, uh, boys smithies?
The hobos stare.
Everett gives ingratiating smile as, him, second
convict starts haul boxcar,
convict keeping pace outside.
EVERETT
Or, smithies se,
trained metallurgic
arts straitened circumstances
forced life aimless
wanderin'?
The convict running outside boxcar door stumbles
disappears middle convict yanked immediately
after. Everett, finishing speech, flips forward
turn, smashes chin floor sucked
open doorway, clawing fingernails leaving parallel grooves
boxcar floorboards.
The hobos impassively watch.
OUTSIDE
The men tumble, clanking, track embankment.
Squush - come rest swampland bottom.
They shake heads clear, rise feet
muck watch train recede.
Its fading clatter leaves baying hounds.
EVERETT
Jesus - can't I count people?
The second Delmar.
DELMAR
Sorry, Everett.
Everett looks desperately about.
EVERETT
All right -
bayou-
The con, Pete, bald beard stubble, angrily
cuts in.
PETE
Wait minute! Who elected leader
outfit?
EVERETT
Well, Pete, I figured
capacity abstract
thought. But ain't
consensus view, hell, let's
vote!
PETE
Suits me! I'm votin' truly!
EVERETT
Well I'm votin' truly too!
Both men look interrogatively Delmar.
He looks Pete Everett, nods agreeably.
DELMAR
Okay - I'm fellas.
Everett makes sudden hushing gesture listen.
The baying hounds louder now, hear
distant scrape metal metal, like workings
rusty pump. The men turn unison look track.
A small, distant form moving slowly track
them.
As draws closer resolves human-propelled flatcar.
An ancient black man rhythmically pumps long seesaw
handle.
The convicts look swampland begins
movement, bowing grass trampled men dogs.
The flatcar draws slows.
EVERETT
Mind join you, ol' timer?
OLD MAN
Join me, sons.
The men clamber aboard old man resumes pumping.
The men exchange glances; Delmar waves clanking hand
old man's milky eyes. No reaction.
DELMAR
You work railroad, grandpa?
OLD MAN
I work man.
PETE
Got name, ya?
OLD MAN

EVERETT
Well, right

employment. Ya see, mart

OLD MAN

The men fall silent.
OLD MAN
And fortune -

The convicts, faces upturned, listen raptly
blind prophet.
OLD MAN
...But first, travel
long difficult road - road
fraught peril, uh-huh,
pregnant adventure. You shall

The cloudy eyes old man stare sightlessly
track seesaw handle rises falls frame.
OLD MAN
...I long road

path, Fate vouchsafed
reward. And road
wind, yea, hearts grow
weary, shall ye foller
way, unto salvation.
The old man pumps - reek-a reek-a reek-a - contemplate
words.
Loud sudden:
OLD MAN
IZZAT CLEAR?
The men start, mumble polite acknowledgement.
The railroad tracks wind setting sun. Reek-a reek-a
reek-a - flatcar rolls, wide shot, golden
horizon.
FADE OUT
DAY
A hot dusty road leading lone farmhouse.
The men walk, clanking abreast.
DELMAR
How'd know treasure?
EVERETT

THE BACK OF THE HOUSE
Wash Hogwallop, sour-looking bald man, sits near rusted
bathtub yard littered ancient car parts farm

escorted policemen trotting alongside,

In black hear snuffling, growing louder, closer,
slobberier.
A crack light. We inside cupboard. Its door
nosed open eagerly sniffing snout.
As door swings wide inside cupboard washed
light. It contains, tangled bunch hairnets,
neatly stacked tins Dapper Dan pomade.
PINEY WOODS
Everett, Pete, Delmar Tommy walking woods.
EVERETT

They emerge clearing. The cabin stands them.
It peaceful-looking haven mighty oak tree

nooses hang stout limb.
DELMAR
Where's happy little tire swing?
Two shotgun-wielding goons fall men
push forward.
Moving forward reveals, oak tree, fresh-
dug graves. Standing far lip grave rough
pine coffin.
The sheriff mirrored sunglasses, Cooley, steps
porch, drooling hound heels.
COOLEY
End road, boys. It's
twists turns -
EVERETT
Waitaminute -
COOLEY

The goons shoving tree. Three
gravediggers, having finished work, emerge

DELMAR

COOLEY

The leering goons, lashing men's wrists
backs, pause, sadism stymied. They look
Cooley guidance.
So drooling hound.
Silence.
Finally:
COOLEY
...Too bad don't radio.
The goons recover leering grins resume happy
task.
The gravediggers stand graves, leaning
shovels. They begin sing slow dirgelike 'You've Got
Walk That Lonesome Valley'. Sweat glistens
trickles faces like tears.
PETE
God Mercy!
TOMMY
It ain't fittin'!
EVERETT

COOLEY
The law. Well law human
institution.
Cooley gives faintest smile.
COOLEY

PETE

DELMAR
I'm sorry got this, Tommy.
PETE
Good Lord, do?
Pete tears. Tommy terrified. Delmar bows head
silently pray.
Everett bows head well. He murmurs:
EVERETT
Oh Lord, look
recognize poor sinners...
Lord...
The singing gravediggers begins mournful swell.
EVERETT
...I want daughters
again. Oh Lord, I've separated
family long...
The mournfully building song supported bass
palpable audible - song, seems, rising
earth itself.
EVERETT
...I know I've guilty pride
sharp dealing. I'm sorry I
turned you, Lord. Please
forgive me, help us, Lord, I
swear I'll mend ways... For
sake family... For Tommy's
sake, Delmar's, Pete's...
The rumble building.
EVERETT
...Let daughters again.
Please, Lord, help us... Please help
us...
The rumble erupts deafening roar.
A wall water crashing hollow.
It engulfs everybody. The cabin
ripped away; Soggy Bottom Boys knocked
feet noise confusion.
UNDERWATER
A silent world. Everett tumbles current natural
slow motion.
Suspended scores tins Dapper Dan pomade.
Other objects spin slowly by; framed sepia-tinted family
portraits, tree limbs, fishing pole, outhouse door,
frying pan, noose, old banjo, wild-eyed frantically
paddling bloodhound, tire rope tied it.
FURTHER DOWNHILL
The churning torrent opens lowland newly
created river, fast-moving longer violent.
After beat hold rippling waters, surface
broken up-bob pine coffin.
The coffin floats downstream beat Everett
pops water it, gasping air, shaking
head clear water, moving shoulders finish
freeing rope round wrists.
Pete Delmar emerge nearby, gasping air.
The men hang coffin, bears downstream.
Dazed, look around.
The inundated valley shows occasional roof-
treetop poking newly formed river. All quiet
gurgle water.
DELMAR
A miracle! It miracle!
EVERETT
Aw, don't ignorant, Delmar. I
told gonna flood
valley.
DELMAR
That ain't it!
PETE
We prayed God pitied us!
EVERETT
It fails;

perfectly scientific explanation

PETE

gallows!
EVERETT
Well human cast
moment stress. No, fact

hydro-electric
durned state...
Everett waxes smug:
EVERETT

Out old spiritual mumbo-
jumbo, superstitions
backward ways. We're gonna
brave new world run
wire hook
grid. Yessir, veritable age
reason - like
France - moment soon...
His voice trails notices something.
A cottonhouse middle river submerged
eaves. A cow taken refuge roof. It stands staring
Everett, returns stare.
He shakes vision clears throat.
EVERETT
Not moment soon. Say, there's
Tommy!
Tommy surfaced downstream, clinging
half-submerged piece furniture.
EVERETT
What ridin' there, Tommy?
The furniture beneath begins rotate current
and, head water, Tommy climbs place
like hamster wheel. As chest exposes ribbed
upper half:
TOMMY
Rolltop desk...
STREET
Everett Penny walk arm arm, seven Wharvey gals
behind. The girls sing 'Angel Band' grown-ups talk.
EVERETT
All's ends well,
poet says.

He fumbles pocket.

EVERETT

Uh-huh.
EVERETT
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
PENNY

EVERETT
Yes, honey -
PENNY
That wasn't doing...
Indignation quickens pace. Everett keeps up,
pulling forward frame.
EVERETT
Course not, honey, but...
We Wharvey gals follow ragged bunch,
singing. From distant, song,
hear rhythmic clack metal metal.
The second-to-last girl oldest; holds piece
string travel, listening Penny
Everett, off:
PENNY
I counted three, honey.
EVERETT
Well sure, honey, but...
We reach end piece string; wrapped
waist toddler, lingers frame. She gazes
quiet street edge town ends open
field.
EVERETT
...finding little ring
middle water...
His voice, singing girls, recedes.
EVERETT
...that hell heroic
task...
The string given tug little girl waddles
frame.
A train track revealed distance. The rhythmic
clack hand-pumped flatcar.
The blind seer pumps car distant track, singing
harmony Wharvey gals' receding voices.
