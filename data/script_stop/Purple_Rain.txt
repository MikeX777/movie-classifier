sofa, mother's knickknacks
table, pen ink drawings
wall. After moment, picks
father's slippers, studies
long time.
(118) INT. BEDROOM -- NIGHT
The DOOR opens -- LIGHT snaps ON. He
walks room, places father's
slippers CLOSET. His Mother's
dress lying heap floor.
He picks up, puts away.
(119) INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT
descends steps hesitantly.
The FLOOR covered rubble. He
sits steps, stares
father's MUSIC floor.
"I Would Die For You" continues we...
CUT TO:
(120) INT. CLUB -- NIGHT
Prince on-stage SINGING "I Would Die For
You." The AUDIENCE captivated,
locked grip again. His eyes
focused far
away. He closes tightly, presses
lips mike.
The MUSIC continues we...
CUT TO:
(121) INT. BASEMENT, PRINCE'S HOME -- TWILIGHT
He's final stages cleaning
basement floor. The debris
swept up, shelves righted, smashed items
thrown away...
He stacks Father's music neatly,
tears welling eyes. He places
new boxes, stands wearily,
fulfilled look face. Suddenly
stops -- stares awful chalk marks
floor: Father lying down,
gun gripped hand...
"I Would Die For You" continues we...
CUT TO:
(122) INT. CLUB -- NIGHT
Prince on-stage SINGING "I Would Die
For You." He's lost now,
locked personal horror
see. The CROWD pressed
stage, mesmerized
performance. Billy Sparks drawn
in, amazed power generated
stage. Prince sweeps
audience eyes, fastens
Vanity earnestly, SINGS directly her.
The MUSIC continues we...
CUT TO:
(123) INT. BASEMENT, PRINCE'S HOME -- DAWN
He pulls HOSE washer,
draws floor. He hesitates
moment, gazes time
Father's outline, tears welling
eyes. He turns water on, watches
dusty yellow chalk gives way
reluctantly, mixing water,
swirling drain. Calmness
sweeps face like passing cloud.
Just SUNLIGHT blazes
casement windows. Water droplets
glisten brilliantly morning
light. He turns water off, goes
hose -- stops suddenly,
surprised...
...his Mother's earring lies
floor.
He's entranced, picks up, stares
moment. Everything he's
comes rushing like loco
motive. The confusion, shouting
violence, darkness eclipsed
parents' life -- it's there, lying
surface, settled
heart. But there's difference --
knows it's discovered
happen takes control
life.
So stands basement,
clean cellar floor, realizes
that...he'll thing
time, right. Better
anybody else. He smiles, realizes
weeks, he's felt
better feels right now. He
turns quickly, flips earring
stairwell...
...Vanity plucks air. Their
eyes lock share smiles pure
joy. He picks father's music,
head stairs.
"I Would Die For You" continues we--
CUT TO:
(124) INT. CLUB -- NIGHT
CELEBRATION! Everyone JUMPING
down. Prince radiant, strutting
stage, hands upraised.
The CROWD goes WILD! He flashes wide
grin Vanity, twists, eyeballs
CROWD wickedly, wonderfully. It's
much!
Everyone joining now. Even Morris
Jerome, standing wings, start
DANCING like crazy. Then suddenly
catch themselves, stop, act dignified.
But Vanity sees busts up. They
catch look, laugh heartily join
again.
The MUSIC segues fierce BEAT.
The CROWD lets ROAR! Prince
strips guitar, streaks center-
stage. The Band launches "Baby,
I'm A Star."
...And CROWD laughing, dancing,
shouting loving. The CLUB ALIVE!
And MUSIC continues...forever...
