IN BLACK --
We hear feral, primeval sounds jungle night. A
timpani bangs ominous beat.
FADE IN ON:
A JUNGLE - NIGHT
A BUNNY nervously walks dark, foreboding forest,
frightened shadow moving leaf.
YOUNG JUDY (V.O.)
Fear. Treachery. Bloodlust!
Thousands years ago,
forces ruled world. A
world prey scared
predators. And predators
uncontrollable biological urge
maim maul and...
The timpani crescendos. A JAGUAR leaps shadows,
attacks bunny, screams--
CUT TO:
INSIDE A BARN - A JUNGLE (SET) - NIGHT
The action continues-- imagined amateur stage

BOBBY CATMULL, bobcat, bangs drum.
YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)
