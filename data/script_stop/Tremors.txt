But, suddenly, hear donkey restlessly stomping
hooves braying. Edgar turns, concerned. Now hear
odd sound. Distant thunder? The wind? The donkey gets
frantic.
The barn shudders violently. Frightened birds explode
eaves. Dust puffs old seam. Roof shingles
rain down. Edgar stares amazement.
EDGAR (cont'd)
...some kind earthquake!?
Then sound -- donkey starts screeching wild
panic.
EDGAR (cont'd)
Justine, hang on! I'm coming!
Edgar races barn flings open doors.
3 INT. EDGAR'S BARN - DAY 3
Dust swirls air. But -- barn empty. No
donkey. Now Edgar hit ghastly stench. He staggers
back, covers nose handkerchief. Then sees,
splattered walls -- blood!
EDGAR

shoot, there's -- far eye see.
4 EXT. CLIFFS - DAWN 4

managed underachieve brilliantly. He
coasts life, following path resistance

As sleepy cows gaze him, sleepy Val shuffles

door reads: "V E -- All Type's Job's." Indeed,
pick-up bed jumbled tools supplies
conceivable odd job -- noisily snoring form
partner huddled dirty sleeping bag. Val raps
truck.
VAL
(softly)
Good morning, Mr. Bassett,

gently steps truck's running board, suddenly
starts jumping hard can, rocking
truck violently.
VAL (cont'd)

plished anything, tries impart hard-won

Earl reaches coffee-pot battered Coleman stove
tailgate. But it's cold.
EARL

rock, paper." Earl raises fist response. The game
played swiftly silently -- one, two, three. On three,
Val mimes "paper" (open hand. Earl mimes "scissors" (two
extended fingers). Scissors cuts paper. Val lost. He

Val slams truck low-range four-wheel-drive revs

truck lurches free. We hear eerie shriek mingled

VAL (cont'd)

Then -- A HUGE MOUND OF EARTH RISES UP UNDER VAL AND EARL!!
The cowboys tumble side, Val losing rifle. They
roll stare dumbfounded mound.

The mound earth turns them. The ground splits open
rises -- huge head!
EARL
(awestruck)
Nope...just one.
The monster horrendous thirty-foot long eating machine!
Its head eyeless, utterly alien, covered tough boney
plates close form cork-screw point.
The cowboys stumble fence speechless
terror. The creature slides them, pushing
earth like whale water. Now opens mouth --
it's like grotesque flower, boney plates spreading open
like petals, revealing huge, slimy, fleshy, oozing orifice!
And inside mouth, ghastly multi-tentacled tongue!
These "snake things," snakes actually
horrid hook-tentacles shoot feet snag
prey!
The monster snorts snuffs, throwing plumes dust,
sounding like horrendous pig. It sinks earth
charges! We hump earth faster
faster disappears creature goes deeper.
Val Earl leap sideways run fence. The
creature goes straight slams fencepost below.
All fencepost knocked crazy angle.
The cowboys running. The creature regroups charges
them, hitting fencepost turn, sending weird
sinuous shock waves barbed wire, making
musical twanging sounds. Val looks back.
VAL
It's gaining us!!
And weren't enough, Earl points trouble
ahead.
52 EXT. CONCRETE DITCH - DAY 52
The fence runs straight edge ditch,
foot wide gap yawning dead ahead. The creature churns like
locomotive behind. They'll try jump! They
strain desperately fraction speed.
EARL
We it, it!
They leap -- don't it!! They smack
opposite ditch, clawing frantically lip,
tumble sloping bottom. A split second later
charging creature slams like wrecking ball
foot-thick concrete wall! The wall CRACKS AND BULGES OUT! A
hook-tentacle flops cracks! Terrified
Val Earl scramble away. But wall holds together.
And the, strangely, quiet. The tentacle lays dead
still. Eventually, cowering cowboys dare creep
little closer, panting, exhausted, jumpy.
EARL
Stupid son bitch...knocked
cold.
And orange slime begins ooze cracks
concrete.
VAL
Cold, ass! It's dead! We

He suddenly shakes fist dead beast.
VAL (cont'd)

They allow small wheeze nervous laughter,

She's lugging bunch equipment, including small
folding shovel.
RHONDA
Hi, guys, how're doing? Look,

Val Earl look other, burst laughing.
Rhonda spots cracked wall.
RHONDA (cont'd)
What's that?
53 EXT. CONCRETE DITCH - DAY 53
The shattered concrete pulled away fully reveal
creature's horrendous head. Start CLOSE it: oozing
blood, slavering mouth plates hanging open, hook-tentacles

We hear shovel digging above, Val shouts:
VAL (V.O.)

Just look caught here!
Earl Rhonda climb up. CRANE UP REVEAL
animal! Val, digging excitedly Rhonda's shovel,
scraping away loose dirt creature's
tail. The length immense thirty foot beast
partially uncovered, king-sized bas-relief.
EARL
(hushed)
This big mother!
VAL
So guy
seismos working overtime?
She nods, stepping study creature. The body
stream-lined, cigar-shaped, maybe feet diameter
thickest. It's covered hundreds short, rear-
pointing, retractable spikes. Rhonda gingerly jiggles one.
It pushed socket like plunger.
RHONDA (cont'd)
It push
these. Hundreds pushing
once. That's
fast. I mean thing
tripping sensors
valley. No wonder I couldn't...
A chilling thought stops mid-sentence. She springs
drainage ditch backpack, pulling
seismograph printouts. She studies frantically
during:
EARL
Hey, Rhonda, heard
like before?
VAL
(elbows Earl)
Sure, Earl, everybody knows
them. We didn't tell you.
Come on, nobody's seen
these! We're

The guys looks other. One thought immediately springs
minds.
EARL
Pham Van don't mitts
measly bucks!
VAL
You got right!
While bask fame-to-be, Rhonda continues
study print-outs, coming terrifying conclusion.
EARL
Here's plan: we'll a...a
flatbed, I guess, big winch,
figure ton anyway.
VAL
Naw, don't want winch it. That'd
tear up. Want lift it.
Some kind crane lifting
straps.
But Rhonda interrupts -- scared.
RHONDA
Hey, hey, shut up! The way I
figure it. There
things!
Val Earl shut right up. Earl edges fencepost. Val
sidles rock during:
EARL
Five more?
Rhonda paws unwieldy printouts, pointing
jagged ink lines graphs, comparing different ones.
RHONDA
Yeah, darn it, look. I've got
seismographs valley.
If compare different
readings, five.
Here's o'clock

So that's two. Now, here...
The men leap perches hustle

VAL

EARL

She doesn't explain. All dash dash for:
57 EXT. BOULDER FIELD - DAY 57
The remains old rail fence lay
boulders. Val, Earl, Rhonda scramble wood,
rock stand tensely.
In moment, creature gently rustles earth
base rock. The monster's slimy hook-tentacles slither
out, searching rock base. Shuddering, humans
high can, reach. The tentacles slip
beneath earth. Everyone breathes sigh relief.
EARL
Well, bastard can't
climb. Pardon French.
RHONDA
Probably couldn't easily
surface.
VAL
God, live ones smell worse tan
dead ones.
EARL
Okay, now, far's truck?
Rhonda points. They roof truck, maybe
yards away boulders. Val Earl think

VAL
I don't know. If one's

EARL
(nods)
I think wait right here.
DISSOLVE TO:
58 EXT. BOULDER FIELD - SUNSET 58
It's hours later. Stiff uncomfortable,

That'd couple
billion years old...and we've

There's long pause. Earl stares dirt rock.
EARL
Well...haven't seen sign

VAL
Maybe is. Why don't

EARL
Fuck you, too. Pardon French.
RHONDA
Well, we've got something.
Val gets idea. He grabs post dilapidated fence
cautiously slips near boulder's edge.
EARL
Watch yourself! It's got good
foot reach.
Val nods. Dead silence reaches way post
scrapes ground. Almost instantly creature
roars up, grabbing post flurry flying dirt
lashing tentacles, nearly hooking Val's hand. Val
practically falls scrambling safety.
VAL

Rhonda stares Val, impressed.
RHONDA
Of course! It sense

They settle back, having idea next. Rhonda
gazes desert surrounds like ocean.

RHONDA

The silhouettes shift, Val Earl moving

They watch surprise hefts pole, checks
