INT. RECORDING SESSION (LAST SESSION) - L.A. - DEC.
The bearded POET hunches chair, exhausted, clutching
paper, finished. Pause. He downs final shot, grunts
Indian Ghostman sitting stool watching

feathered ponytail, nods... pleased.
MORRISON
Well, didja that?
GHOSTMAN

The ENGINEER, exhausted, doesn't feel funny.
ENGINEER

The poets face brightens. A small ever-so-sweet smile
triumph hikes corners mouth.
