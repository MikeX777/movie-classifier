HAMMOND
The extraction room speaks itself.
CLOSE ON - drillbit boring amber. Orange fleck fly.
GRANT
It does?
The technician shuts drill. Placing hands mounted pair

LEX
That's million year old mosquito?
A conveyor belt starts, carrying tray NEXT TECHNICIAN.
The group follows. This technician puts slide

ELLIE
Put piece amber, mosquito,
drill out. Right?
HAMMOND
Right. You witnessing extraction

So see, Ellie, I'm creating dino-
saurs. Fossils left information,
map bring back. I'm
helping escape confined

GRANT
But thousands mosquitos wouldn't

HAMMOND
Right are, Dr. Grant! More like
hundreds thousands mosquitos
necessary provide partial
strand DNA. And complete

INT GENETICS ROOM
A LOUD HUMMING SOUND. Along walls rows waist-high stainless
steel boxes. In room's center six-foot-high round towers.
At single console, man studies monitor.
DR. WU, 35, looks study beams guests. He jumps

HAMMOND
Ah, I knew hit off! Dr.
Grant, Dr. Wu, chief geneticist.
WU
Finally, here! I've working
encouragement peers

He kisses Ellie, takes
stride. Gennaro, We knows.
WU
Mr. Hammond lets publish
he's interested results,

HAMMOND
Don't forget thank pick

Hammond Wu resume tour.
HAMMOND
You standing middle

WU
These Hamachi-Hood automated gene

HAMMOND
It's like finding missing pieces

INT INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY
A vast room bathed infrared light, filled long tables. The
tables rows rows centrifuges, bearing dozens

GRANT
Okay, "complete" DNA

WU
We use unfertilized crocodile ova
breeding medium.
HAMMOND
Our primordial soup.
GRANT
And know you're
growing?
Wu shrugs.
WU
Well, techniques try

Grant Ellie share concerned look.
GENNARO
And you're interested?
Wu indicates cabinet chemicals skull-and-crossbone warnings.
Timmy regards poison excitement.
Lex calls deeper room.
LEX
Come look!
Here, plastic eggs lay long tables, pale outlines obscured

Lex feigns faint, Timmy cracks small smile. They forward,

LEX
I'm ... melting!
Ellie laughs pulls Lex close.
WU
Reptile eggs contain large amounts
yolk water all. The embryos
extract water surrounding

GRANT
That's create mist.
Wu nods. Hammond enjoys scene Grant Ellie watch

Grant close egg. He sniffs it.
GRANT
What kind eggs these? Are
shells plastic?
WU
Yes, are, The embryos

sufficiently mimic actual biological
process - creatures rupture
plastic membrane they're contained
they're born. Like real births.
They reach endless row incubators, lined wall,

WU
Eggs determined viable spend
couple days specially-
designed incubators, help
accelerate pre-natal developmental

Hammond claps hand Wu's mouth laughs.
HAMMOND
There's problem Dr. Wu can't handle.
Now wants real thing?

CLOSE ON - Grant eyes slowly roll ... faints.
The dinosaur casually moves away Ellie comes Grant's aid.
ELLIE

Muldoon stands pit, carefully loading assault rifle.
Hammond comes hurry. Muldoon sees Hammond puts rifle.
He walks Hammond, talking gets there.
MULDOON
These raptors damn dangerous. One

bullet him.
HAMMOND
A bullet? Muldoon - no! Now what? I
left?
MULDOON
John, they're mean scorpions smart
chimps. Their little fingers
natural cage-breakers. We
terminate raptor program. They're
smart. Too damn smart.
HAMMOND
Oh balls. I terminate raptors
they're behaving normally.
They're hunters. Why can't contain
properly?
Hammond starts walk away. Muldoon follows, he's finished all.
MULDOON
John, remember '88,
started build containment devices?
We ordered cattle prods, tasers, guns
blow electric nets. They're
slow guys. If we're going
raptors, I want TOW missiles
laser-guided devices.
Hammond laughs warmly. He pats Muldoon back.
HAMMOND
It's zoo, Muldoon. A zoo. Figure
way contain them. And we'll sit
nice long discussion
raptors - guests leave, okay?
Hammond walks away. Muldoon stares him, jingling keys

MULDOON
Okay! Get 'dozer, start digging round

Trike's sick again.
HAMMOND
How matter-of-factly?
The trike's. You casually accept it,
I can. You know means
"by trikes"? "By

Hammond reacts quiet dismay. Nedry quietly gets up.
NEDRY

He's ignored. Arnold defers Hammond leans microphone.
HAMMOND
Hello skipper, John Hammond,

ELLIE
Microvesicles. Interesting.
Grant scratches blisters ball-point pen. It oozes.
The kids share grossed-out look.

ELLIE
West Indian Lilacs!
GRANT
These'd anybody stomachache.
HARDING
I'm telling you, animals don't eat
don't eat stuff.
Regis keeps babysitter's eye kids. Timmy comes
handful smooth stones. He approaches Grant shyly.
TIMMY
Dr. Grant, sir? How 'bout these?
There'

Grant fingers distractedly, suddenly comes attention.
GRANT
Hey, Ellie look his. Good
work, Timmy.
Ellie gets up, brushes off, comes examines stone.
ELLIE
Extremely smooth. Purple stains,
lilac berries.
She Grant smile nod. Gennaro curious.
HARDING
I don't it.
GRANT
Looks like trike swallows stones
help digest food. Walking
around, crushes berries
stones. And little crushed
berry eventually enough,
ELLIE
So, poisons periodically.
HARDING
Bet tested saliva trace -
GRANT
But th

test excrement.
LEX
Yo, yuk!
A light RAIN begins. Automatically, soft hiss, glass roofs

GENNARO
Hey Regis, rain gods?
It's gonna pour. Let's finish tour.
Grant agrees, heads cruisers. He turns looks Ellie.
Ellie stands Trike. She gives Grant meaningful look.
ELLIE
I'm staying.
Grant smiles decision.
GRANT
Soil samples?
ELLIE
You read mind.
(confidentially)
I think she's sicker they're saying.
Her skin dry flaky. And gums

Grant senses something. He sits straight up. Looks intently.
GRANT
He's here.
The goat tethered middle fi
