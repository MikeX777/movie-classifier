FADE IN:
INT. PROFESSOR OCK"S PRIVATE PHYSICS LABORATORY, THE
CYCLOTRON ROOM (CREDIT SEQUENCE) - DAY
A mighty WARNING KLAXON assaults ears. A FLASHING RED
WARNING LIGHT stabs eyes.
Several DIALS RED. A hand pushes aside
YELLOW THERMOS pushes forward RED POWER THROTTLE.
We hear WHINING UP cyclotron. A DIGITAL DIAL
climbs "5% POWER." A SPIDER crawls DIAL.
Begin OPENING CREDITS.
THE CYCLOTRON ROOM old basement peeling
paint plumbing wrapped TAPE. Leaks
there. COBWEBS around.
DOCTOR OTTO OCTAVIUS (OCK) strong strange
featured man mid-fifties.
His assistant, WEINER, hovers nearby looking on. He's
open mouthed mindless kind curiosity. WEINER
local, small-time hood hired OCK circumvent
school administration "procure" OCK needs
experiments. He shades eyes searing
BLUE-WHITE BEAM erupts WINDOW. THE ROOM IS
DIVIDED INTO A CONTROL ROOM AND THE EXPERIMENT CHAMBERS.
WEINER
Whoa, whoa, whoa... what's that?
With WHOOSH, WINDOW EXPLODES, showering TWO
shards GLASS, throwing floor.
OCK
(rising)
We begin again... let's kick new
transducer. See double
power output.
WEINER
(rising slowly)
Whoa, Doc... wait minute...
But OCK THROTTLE. The cyclotron whirls
up. The lights on. Louder, brighter before. OCK
looks broken WINDOW EXPERIMENTAL
CHAMBER. The POWER DIAL inches upward, "eight, nine..."
BLUE-WHITE LIGHT blinding now. The WHINE pitch
shattering.
END OPENING CREDITS.
OCK
Okey... dokey!
The POWER DIAL hits ten.
EXT. EMPIRE STATE UNIVERSITY - DAY
As STUDENTS class, sound cyclotron spills
SCIENCE CENTER grounds Empire State
University.
We PETER PARKER, pleasant faced senior who's
class. Sincere serious,
develop way women.
LIZ
(falling step)
Hiya Peter...
LIZ ALLEN senior. She's beautiful
intelligent.

uncomfortable)
Hiya Liz... how're doing...?
LIZ
(teasing softly)
How'm I what?
HARRY
Peter! Peter! Wait up!
HARRY school nerd. A quirky kid who, like PETER,
little backward girls, especially pretty
ones like Liz.
HARRY
(to Liz)
Would you, uh... excuse minute?
Despite PETER'S protesting body language, HARRY pulls
away like conspirator.
PETER
What it? what...
HARRY
Did Astro-Physics Journal
accept paper?
PETER
(laughs, embarrassed)
Yeah... well... I got's data
they've agreed publish it's
finished. You know... it's
calculation Planetary Conjunction.
HARRY
And influence anti-force.
Isn't it?
PETER
Yes. Look, Harry, I busy with...
(indicates Liz standing
there)
HARRY
Yeah, rest class.
Every busy Liz.
LIZ
(growing impatient)
Peter?

(disappointed)
Come on, Harry... we'll late
Octavius.
HARRY makes gesture dismissing OCK crazy.
HARRY
Ock nuts, don't agree?
PETER
Ock genius, Harry. Crazy, Yes! But,
genius misunderstood, unappreciated.
INT. CYCLOTRON AREA HALLWAY - DAY
It basement hallway LOCKERS STUDENTS
banging open shut stuff
stuff out. In midst, MAN banging door
marked "Cyclotron Room - Authorized Personnel Only!"
Professor ROSOMORF, SIXTISH, respectable, good old
fashioned professor, he's head Physics Dept.
With ALEXANDER THORKEL, 40-ish, Waspish school
administrator. For scientist crazily focused OCK,
THORKEL natural enemy.
ROZ
(knocking furiously)
Doctor Octavius! You late
lecture. The students waiting.
Doctor Octavius!
THORKEL
Your friend impossible Professor
Rosomorf, I told board let
go.
The LIGHT THORKEL's head EXPLODES. Then
LIGHTS EXPLODE succession. THORKEL ROZ
look amazed...
THORKEL
What's there, crazy
experiment again.
ROZ
You mean anti-force theory... day
they'll Nobel Prize it.
THORKEL
Meanwhile demolishing
university. Octavius!!
(knocks)
Open door.
INT. OCK'S LAB
OCK
The anti-force experiment reached
limit electronic overload safety.
Therefore, Weiner, disconnect
overload safety device...
FOUR WALDOS (three-fingered, snake-like mechanical arms)
suddenly thrust CHAMBER begin
working, different task. OCK acknowledged
master manipulating WALDOS.
He flicks switch searing BLUE-WHITE BEAM lances

LIZ. When looks looks GEAR.
LIZ
(softly)
What it, Peter?
PETER
(embarrassed)
It's nothing.
INT. OCK'S LAB
WEINER opens door sees ROZ THORKEL waiting
impatient.
WEINER
Yes, gentleman I help you?
THORKEL
Tell boss, class waiting.
WEINER
(looks)
You better tell yourself.
THORKEL looks ROZ waves shoulder,
call.
ROZ THORKEL
Professor Octavius!!
Professor OCK turns looks bewildered men.
OCK
Gentlemen, come, this.
ROZ
But, students...
OCK
The imbeciles wait... I better
things teach introductory
Physics Rosomorf. Undergrads
kindless adolescence.
THORKEL
You impossible.
OCK
Thorkel dummiest
administrator university had.
(Thorkel turns go)
Don't Thorkel!! Come! Look!
He starts play machines handles buttons.
THORKEL
The university pays teach
students.
INT. COLLEGE PHYSICS LAB - DAY
LIZ
Well, mean nothing...
mean won't tell
is?
PETER
(regaining)
I mean plain nothing.
LIZ
Well, I guess that's
get... plain nothing.
A beat.
PETER
Liz...!
LIZ
Ahh, something.
PETER
No... look.
The equipment TABLE starting vibrate. They
look it, curiously. We hear cyclotron's WHINE
begin build...
INT. CYCLOTRON ROOM - DAY
Everything shaking like earthquake... Roz
Thorkel dance place going crazy
anger surprise. The WHINE deafening! The light
blinding! WEINER eyes closed hands
ears.
OCK
I going 20 percent power!
THORKEL
NO!! Don't that...
ROZ
Ock! Its dangerous...
THORKEL
Ock I warn you...
WEINER crosses himself. The CONSOLE erupts sparks.
INT. ELECTRICAL CONDUIT MONTAGE - DAY
We follow electrical overcharge crackles
WIRES CABLES inside WALLS FLOORS. It
making way LAB!
INT. LAB - DAY
All kids trying hold vibrating
equipment.
The CHARGE crackles WIRE erupts LIZ'S TABLE.
A BREAKER explodes flames. There outburst AD
LIBS: "Fire!" "Everybody out!"
THORKEL (comes running shabby bewildered) seeing
LIZ trapped growing second
second.
THORKEL
Keep calm, everybody calm. Use
door. Everybody front.
PETER
Liz! Come on...!
LIZ
I can't. Help me!
PETER
I'm coming!
He wades fire, beaten FLAMES.
His sleeve fire. He pats out.
LIZ
Peter!
Flash appears tries help Thorkel stops him.
THORKEL
Get back, idiots. You can't
there!
LIZ smashes WINDOW, inner city
school WINDOWS covered STEEL GATES. Liz
wraps fingers GATE.
LIZ
(out street)
Help! Help me!
Outside WINDOW air clear people come
go. Some stopping look girl
second floor screams (but can't hear, course)
FLAMES close her.
PETER comes flying FIRE EXTINGUISHER. He
fumbles it. FLASH pushes Thorkel, grabs
extinguisher away scowl disdain.
LIZ turns face FLAMES. Suddenly
eruption CO2 CLOUDS roar FIRE
EXTINGUISHER.
The FLAMES beaten leap out.
FLASH there, holding EXTINGUISHER. People CHEER.
PETER
Thanks help Flash.
FLASH
No problem wimp.
PETER
Our hero real way words.
LIZ
Oh, don't grow up.
PETER stung, insulted, turns away.
ROSOMORF peeps in, worried -- faces Thorkel.
THORKEL
This man bring disaster
university.
OCK comes in, starts lecture calmly
happened.
OCK
The universe forces...
counter-forces. Science study
forces!
FLASH hands EXTINGUISHER PETER. LIZ embraces
FLASH, throwing glimpse PETER tried bravely.
He looks away turns EXTINGUISHER
FIRE.
OCK
(continues
hitch)
But I... Professor Otto Octavius...
devoted life study
counter-forces! Good job, Peter.
PETER
(taking place lab
table)
Thanks, Professor.
THORKEL walked slowly uncomprehendingly
huge LAB. He simply believe OCK'S
behavior.
THORKEL
I don't believe it, I simply don't...
OCK
Can carry Mr. Thorkel.
THORKEL
I don't believe... oh, right carry
Professor.
OCK
Well! This week dear students I
stunning breakthrough...
THORKEL
Wait minute, wait minute... you've
got forms out, Dr. Octavius.
OCK
I time forms,
administrators persist
interrupting me, Mr. Thorkel.
THORKEL steams bangs shut DOOR.
OCK
I believe possible
counter forces be... collected...
way magnifying glass collects
sunlight... focused hard beam
I call... Weiner!
WEINER backs away BLACKBOARD reveal word
OCK scrawled large letters. It says "Anti-
Force."
OCK
I it, Anti-Force!
OCK plugging HUGE CABLE small LUCITE BOX
SILVER BALL inside it.
OCK
(continues works)
This anti-force, harnessed,
capable undoing natural force
aimed... instance...
(looks maniacally)
Gravity!
LIZ scribbles note mouths word "gravity."
Then turns PETER.
LIZ
(whispers)
I'm sorry...
PETER
It's alright.
OCK "playing" COMPUTER like Phantom
Opera organ.
OCK
We patch cyclotron...
The lights flicker dim.
OCK
Pay attention lights... I
course steal energy, looses
power. We patch cyclotron...
gradually apply power. The power
I stealing...
As WHINE builds LAB...
OCK peers LUCITE BOX us, distorted it.
The BOX miniature version cyclotron's
experimental chamber, BLUE-WHITE glow begins.
It crackles round SILVER BALL.
OCK
And stand, square
fundamental force orders
maintains universe... gravity...
holding goddamn ball.
Rise!
The LIGHTS totally dark. The kids react WHOOPS
CATCALLS.
HARRY
What crock...
PETER
Shut Harry... interesting.
OCK
Mr. Parker! Have some... interesting
observation you'd like share
class?
PETER
No sir...
OCK
Then shut up! And pay attention
experiment.
OCK peers LUCITE BOX SILVER BALL
begins rise. OCK'S face ecstatic.
OCK
Rise! Rise!!!
The SILVER BALL suddenly shoots up, shattering
box. It flies ceiling shatters
LIGHT FIXTURE.
The shards rain OCK reaches catches
falling BALL scales raised fist.
OCK
Now that's I experiment!
The CYCLOTRON WHINE cuts OCK wheels
COMPUTER. He hits KEY COLORED PROJECTION
BEAMS lance room. They pierce
smoke light PROJECTION DISPLAY front.
TWO COLORED SPHERES one, YELLOW, BLUE touch
circumferences meet. Behind BLACK
depiction "space".
OCK
You looking representation
universes. Our Blue one. Our real
universe... touch
feel draw calculations about.
This us. The Yellow universe...
else. Some dimension...
something... side!
OCK hits COMPUTER KEY hole appears
TWO SPHERES touch. The BLUE AND THE YELLOW MARBLEIZE
other. The colors swirl SPHERES
BRIGHT GREEN.
OCK
If possible generate
power it, anti-force
wipe gravity...
universal forces time. In
effect... blast hole
universe next. Each...
(indicates green spheres)
flow other. No blue
universe. No yellow. End, finished,
over.
LIZ
(with student's ear)
That sounds like scenario end
world.
OCK
My girl, is! It is. It mean
wiping that's known...
letting that's unknown.
FLASH
Isn't little dangerous?
OCK
Don't worry yourself, true inter-
dimensional penetration purely
theoretical, day... Maybe
near... maybe 21st century...
INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - DAY
PETER, LIZ, FLASH HARRY BOOKS
LOCKERS.
LIZ
(whispers Peter)
Look, it's just... I don't know...
Flash like
that...
PETER
(whispers)
He's type.
LIZ
He doesn't be.
PETER
Check.
LIZ
And besides, he's bad.
PETER looks FLASH who's LOCKERS down. FLASH
taken FOOTBALL LOCKER spinning
finger great joy concentration.
PETER
You don't nicknamed Flash
you're rocket scientist, Liz.
LIZ
Give up, Parker. You'd die
nickname like Flash.
PETER
Yeah, embarrassment.
KIM comes leans seductively LOCKER. KIM
ripe hot-hot-hot!
KIM

The Slammies??? I'd kill that!!!
KIM
Would pay $125?
FLASH
Well, uh, I... gee... if... I tell
tomorrow?
KIM
(moving on)
You snooze, lose. Hiya Liz...
LIZ
Kim, know Peter Harry? This
new roommate... Kim Nickson.
KIM pulling pet, foot long SALAMANDER,
LOCKER. She wraps neck turns

Hi...
LIZ
We're going Student Reunion
Meeting. You coming?
Peter looks KIM. Wow. Then looks LIZ who's
adjusting small MIRROR. HARRY jabs
ribs. Yeah, yeah!
PETER
(frustrated)
I can't... I gotta Daily
Bugle. I'm trying sell photos.
KIM
Soooh, photographer...?

It's said, it's
it, ShooShoo!
Everybody leaves Harry left alone, throws
bag down.
HARRY
Damn!
PETER turns comes face face hulking
WEINER.
WEINER
Peter, Doc Ock wants you.
PETER
About data I bet.
WEINER
I don't know.
PETER
He knows work Planetary
Conjunction, doesn't he?
WEINER
(lies)
I don't know.
INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY
PETER enters wide-eyed WEINER. This place far
experiment LAB ROOM. It's fantastic
netherworld undergrad gains entrance. No
PETER.
OCK sitting swivel CHAIR PETER.
He look Captain Nemo Nautilus. This
OCK'S domain.
PETER
Hello, Professor Octavius.
(no response)
I admired experiment.
OCK
(back Peter)
We lot interests common,
Peter. Perhaps heads
together, know I mean...
PETER
(flattered)
That be... great.
OCK
(turns smile)
Now Planetary Conjunction.
This Saturday night witness
Saturn, Jupiter, Moon, Earth,
Sun... row. Never seen
memory man, measured
effect. The total gravitational force
exceptional. Isn't
subject paper...?
PETER
Yes sir, I've worked new way
calculate combined gravitational
effect.
OCK
I'm busy man, Mr. Parker. But I think
I time
you. Make sure all... checks out.
PETER
Well... I'm sort working
Professor Rosomorf suggested
kind us. He thinks
theory is... well, I don't know...
OCK
(to himself)
The scoundrel...
(turns angry)
I want data, Peter!
PETER
But Professor Octavius... I knew
interested... sorry, I've
given to... Professor Rosomorf,
head Physics
Department... I couldn't...
OCK turns sweet again. He smiles broadly.
OCK
Well, I'm certain worked
out. Run along, young man.
PETER begins leave.
OCK
Just minute... I
discoveries... I
showed student...
matter fact anybody all.
PETER
Well I flattered, I mean I'd
love to... I...
OCK
Very shall come
tonight...
PETER
But Professor I don't I should...
OCK
Make sharp... I'll waiting
you... Right here...
Peter looks worried leaves.
OCK turns WEINER slouches wall smiling.
OCK
The academic world that's keen
embrace boy's undergraduate work,
ridicules anti-force theory
quackery. I ask you, Weiner...
society coming to? Ha!
WEINER
They bunch brainless
assholes, that's I say...
OCK
Weiner! Go boy's data!
WEINER
Cost bucks.
OCK
(Weiner hissing)
Just it. We'll negotiate fee
data, alright Weiner?

(to Peter)
Do want Parker?
PETER
No thank you, I dinner
aunt's...
OCK
Piss off, Weiner!
WEINER leaves. PETER wanders around.
He goes experimental chamber, overlooks
SPIDER scuttling away crawls inside open
WINDOW... chamber.
OCK
Okey, dokey, Parker... like
Weiner's place... I mean,
assistant?
PETER
Well, Professor, great
honor, I'm working with...
OCK
Rosomorf... imbecile. Don't
understand, kid, I
uncover greatest discovery
Einstein came theory
relativity... The "Anti-Force."
PETER
Wow! The theory Anti-force! You
Noble Prize Professor...
OCK
Noble Shmoble, I going
bigger prize kid. Okey, dokey. Let
you, kid, I got here.
OCK begins experiment. We past shattered
WINDOW. We SPIDER crawling chamber's GEAR.
OCK
Present maximum anti-force power date
38 percent theoretical limit. I
patched variable
particle-wave accelerator...
(shrugs)
I try reach 50% power...
(big breath)
And paper value... I
use power I'm missing
create anti-force, break
beat form power
universe, capish!
PETER
Sorry, Professor, I can't it. I gave
word Professor Rosomorf.
OCK angry... Ock sees SPIDER. He shoots
WALDO try crush SPIDER fast. The
WALDO slams wall chamber. He starts
push button switch sight. A deafening whining
starts.
An URGENT WARNING TONE causes OCK look "Relative
Gravity" DIAL. It "4.999999KG" suddenly
numbers start tumble rapidly.
INSERT: The glowing 5KG WEIGHT.
INSERT: The POWER DIAL inches 50% POWER!
OCK
(screaming)
50 percent... anti-force... 50 percent...
that's I'm missing! Parker,
rich together!
PETER
Sorry... I'd better now.
OCK
(really angry now)
You'll sorry, Parker.
PETER leaves.
Another URGENT WARNING TONE causes OCK look
