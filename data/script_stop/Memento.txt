Your wife you'd late funeral.
Remember that? Her little joke slob-always
late, forgetting stuff, incident.
Right you're probably wondering late hers.
You there, sure that. That's picture's
for-the tacked wall door. It's customary
pictures funeral, somebody, doctors, I guess, knew

The guy picture, flowers? That's you. And

who's funeral you're at, you're reading now, trying
figure stuck picture door. But

But minutes, maybe ten. Maybe
half hour forget.
But forget-I guarantee it. A minutes you'll
heading door, looking again, breaking
picture. How times hear news
body, busted brain
yours, starts remember?
Never-ending grief, never-ending anger. Useless direction.
Maybe can't understand what's happened. Can't I
understand, either. Backwards amnesia. That's sign says. CRS
disease. Your guess good mine.
Maybe can't understand happened you. But remember
happened HER, don't you? The doctors don't want talk
it. They won't answer questions. They don't think it's right
man condition hear things. But remember

Sooner later you'll want it. And do,

EARL OPENS ONE EYE stretch white ceiling tiles
interrupted hand-printed sign taped right head, large
read bed. An alarm clock ringing
somewhere. He reads sign, blinks,reads again, takes look
room.
It's white room, overwhelmingly white, walls
curtains institutional furniture bedspread. The alarm
clock ringing white desk window white
curtains. At point Earl probably notices lying
white comforter. He wearing dressing gown
slippers.
He lies reads sign taped ceiling again. It says,
crude block capitals, THIS IS YOUR ROOM. THIS IS A ROOM IN A
HOSPITAL. THIS IS WHERE YOU LIVE NOW.
Earl rises takes look around. The room large
hospital-empty linoleum stretches bed
directions. Two doors window. The view isn't helpful,
either-a close trees center carefully manicured piece
turf terminates sliver two-lane blacktop. The trees,
evergreens, bare-early spring late fall,
other.
Every inch desk covered Post-it notes, legal pads,
neatly printed lists, psychological textbooks, framed pictures. On
mess half-completed crossword puzzle. The alarm clock
riding pile folded newspapers. Earl slaps snooze button
takes cigarette pack taped sleeve dressing
gown. He pats pockets pajamas light. He rifles
papers desk, looks quickly drawers. Eventually
finds box kitchen matches taped wall
window. Another sign taped box. It says loud
yellow letters, CIGARETTE? CHECK FOR LIT ONES FIRST, STUPID.
Earl laughs sign, lights cigarette, takes long draw.
Taped window piece looseleaf
paper headed YOUR SCHEDULE.
It charts hours, hour, blocks: 10:00 p.m. 8:00
a.m. labeled BACK TO SLEEP. Earl consults alarm clock: 8:15.
Given light outside, morning. He checks watch:
10:30. He presses watch ear listens. He gives watch
wind sets match alarm clock.
According schedule, entire block 8:00 8:30
labeled BRUSH YOUR TEETH. Earl laughs walks
bathroom.
The bathroom window open. As flaps arms warm,
notices ashtray windowsill. A cigarette perched
ashtray, burning steadily long finger ash. He frowns,
extinguishes old butt, replaces new one.
The toothbrush treated smudge white paste.
The tap push-button variety-a dose water nudge.
Earl pushes brush cheek fiddles forth
opens medicine cabinet. The shelves stocked
single-serving packages vitamins, aspirin, antidiuretics. The
mouthwash single-serving, shot-glass-worth blue
liquid sealed plastic bottle. Only toothpaste
regular-sized. Earl spits paste mouth replaces
mouthwash. As lays toothbrush toothpaste,
notices tiny wedge paper pinched glass shelf
steel backing medicine cabinet. He spits frothy blue
fluid sink nudges water rinse down.
He closes medicine cabinet smiles reflection
mirror.
"Who needs half hour brush teeth?"
The paper folded minuscule size
precision sixth-grader's love note. Earl unfolds smooths
mirror. It reads-
IF YOU CAN STILL READ THIS, THEN YOU'RE A FUCKING COWARD.
Earl stares blankly paper, reads again. He turns
over. On reads-
P.S.: AFTER YOU'VE READ THIS, HIDE IT AGAIN.
Earl reads sides again, folds note
original size tucks underneath toothpaste.
Maybe notices scar. It begins beneath ear, jagged
thick, disappears abruptly hairline. Earl turns
head stares corner eye follow scar's
progress. He traces fingertip, looks
cigarette burning ashtray. A thought seizes spins
bathroom.
He caught door room, hand knob. Two
pictures taped wall door. Earl's attention caught
MRI, shiny black frame windows someone's
skull. In marker, picture labeled YOUR BRAIN. Earl stares
it. Concentric circles different colors. He big
orbs eyes and, these, twin lobes brain.
Smooth wrinkles, circles, semicircles. But right middle
head, circled marker, tunneled neck
like maggot apricot, different. Deformed,
broken, unmistakable. A dark smudge, shape flower, right
middle brain.
He bends look picture. It photograph man
holding flowers, standing fresh grave. The man bent over,
reading headstone. For moment looks like hall mirrors
beginnings sketch infinity: man bent over,
looking smaller man, bent over, reading headstone. Earl
looks picture long time. Maybe begins cry. Maybe
stares silently picture. Eventually, makes way
bed, flops down, seals eyes shut, tries sleep.
The cigarette burns steadily away bathroom. A circuit
alarm clock counts ten, starts ringing again.
Earl opens eye stretch white ceiling tiles,
interrupted hand-printed sign taped right head, large
read bed.

You can't normal life anymore. You know that. How
girlfriend can't remember name? Can't kids,
want grow dad doesn't recognize them.
Sure hell can't hold job. Not professions
value forgetfulness. Prostitution, maybe. Politics, course.
No. Your life over. You're dead man.The thing doctors
hoping teach burden orderlies.
And they'll probably let home, be.
So question "to be," aren't. The
question want it. Whether revenge
matters you.
It people. For weeks, plot, scheme,
measures even. But passage time takes
erode initial impulse. Time theft, isn't say?
And time eventually convinces forgiveness virtue.
Conveniently, cowardice forgiveness look identical certain
distance. Time steals nerve.
If time fear aren't dissuade people revenge,
there's authority, softly shaking head saying, We
understand, you're better man letting go. For rising
it. For sinking level. And besides, says authority,
try stupid, we'll lock little room.
But little room, didn't they? Only
don't lock guard carefully you're
cripple. A corpse. A vegetable probably wouldn't remember eat
shit wasn't remind you.
And passage time, well, doesn't apply
anymore, it? Just minutes, again. So
forgive can't remember forget?
You probably type let go, weren't you? Before. But
you're man be. Not half. You're fraction;
you're ten-minute man.
Of course, weakness strong. It's primary impulse. You'd
probably prefer sit little room cry. Live
finite collection memories, carefully polishing one. Half
life set glass pinned cardboard like collection
exotic insects. You'd like live glass, wouldn't you?
Preserved aspic.
You'd like can't, you? You can't
addition collection. The thing remember. His face.
His face wife, looking help.
And maybe retire it's over. Your little
collection. They lock little room
live rest life past. But you've got
little piece paper hand says got him.
You know I'm right. You know there's lot work do. It
impossible, I'm sure part, we'll figure
out. But don't time. You've got minutes,
fact. Then starts again. So time
you've got.

EARL OPENS HIS EYES blinks darkness. The alarm clock
ringing. It says 3:20, moonlight streaming window
means early morning. Earl fumbles lamp,
knocking process. Incandescent light fills room,
painting metal furniture yellow, walls yellow, bedspread,
too. He lies looks stretch yellow ceiling tiles
him, interrupted handwritten sign taped ceiling. He
reads sign two, maybe times, blinks room
him.
It bare room. Institutional, maybe. There desk
window. The desk bare blaring alarm clock. Earl
probably notices, point, fully clothed. He
shoes sheets. He extracts bed
crosses desk. Nothing room suggest
lived there, had, odd scrap tape stuck
wall. No pictures, books, nothing. Through
window, moon shining carefully manicured grass.
Earl slaps snooze button alarm clock stares moment
keys taped hand. He picks tape
searches drawers. In left pocket
jacket, finds roll hundred-dollar bills letter sealed
envelope. He checks rest main room bathroom.
Bits tape, cigarette butts. Nothing else.
Earl absentmindedly plays lump scar tissue neck
moves bed. He lies stares
ceiling sign taped it. The sign reads, GET UP, GET OUT
RIGHT NOW. THESE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO KILL YOU.
Earl closes eyes.

They tried teach lists grade school, remember? Back
day planner hand. And
assignments came shower, well, didn't done.
No direction, said. No discipline. So tried
write permanent.
Of course, grade-school teachers laughing pants
wet now. Because you've exact product
organizational lessons. Because can't piss
consulting lists.
They right. Lists way mess.
Here's truth: People, regular people,
person set attributes. It's simple. We're
mercy limbic system, clouds electricity drifting
brain. Every man broken twenty-four-hour fractions,
twenty-four hours. It's daily pantomime,
man yielding control next: backstage crowded old hacks
clamoring turn spotlight. Every week, day. The
angry man hands baton sulking man, turn
sex addict, introvert, conversationalist. Every man mob,
chain gang idiots.
This tragedy life. Because minutes day,
man genius. Moments clarity, insight,
want them. The clouds part, planets neat little
line, obvious. I quit smoking, maybe,
here's I fast million, key
eternal happiness. That's miserable truth. For moments,
secrets universe opened us. Life cheap parlor
trick.
But genius, savant, hand controls
guy pike, likely guy wants eat
potato chips, insight brilliance salvation
entrusted moron hedonist narcoleptic.
The way mess, course, steps ensure
control idiots become. To chain gang,
hand hand, lead them. The best way list.
It's like letter write yourself. A master plan, drafted
guy light, steps simple
rest idiots understand. Follow steps
hundred. Repeat necessary.
Your problem little acute, maybe, fundamentally
thing.
It's like thing, Chinese room. You remember that?
One guy sits little room, laying cards letters written
language doesn't understand, laying
letter time sequence according else's
instructions. The cards supposed spell joke Chinese.
The guy doesn't speak Chinese, course. He follows
instructions.
There obvious differences situation, course: You
broke room in, enterprise
portable. And guy giving instructions-that's you, too,
earlier version you. And joke you're telling, well, it's got
punch line. I don't think anyone's going funny.
So that's idea. All follow instructions.
Like climbing ladder descending staircase. One step time.
Right list. Simple.
And secret, course, list place
you're bound it.
***
HE CAN HEAR THE BUZZING eyelids. Insistent. He reaches
alarm clock, can't arm.
Earl opens eyes large man bent double him. The man
looks him, annoyed, resumes work. Earl looks
him. Too dark doctor's office.
Then pain floods brain, blocking questions. He
squirms gain, trying yank forearm away, feels
like it's burning. The arm doesn't move, man shoots
scowl. Earl adjusts chair
man's head.
The noise pain coming gun man's hand-a
gun needle barrel be. The needle digging
fleshy underside Earl's forearm, leaving trail puffy
letters it.
Earl tries rearrange better view, read
letters arm, can't. He lies stares
ceiling.
Eventually tattoo artist turns noise, wipes Earl's forearm
piece gauze, wanders dig
pamphlet describing deal possible infection. Maybe later
he'll tell wife guy little note. Maybe wife
convince police.
Earl looks arm. The letters rising skin,
weeping little. They run strap Earl's watch
way inside elbow. Earl blinks message
reads again. It says, careful little capitals, I RAPED AND
KILLED YOUR WIFE.

It's birthday today, I got little present. I
bought beer, knows ended?
So instead, I got bell. I think I pawn
watch buy it, hell need watch for, anyway?
You're probably asking yourself, Why bell? In fact, I'm guessing
you're going asking question time
pocket. Too letters now. Too
dig time want know answer little
question.
It's joke, actually. A practical joke. But think way: I'm
laughing you.
I'd like think time pocket
wonder, Why I bell? little you, little piece
broken brain, remember laugh, like I'm laughing now.
Besides, know answer. It learned before.
So think it, you'll know.
Back old days, people obsessed fear
buried alive. You remember now? Medical science
today, wasn't uncommon people suddenly wake
casket. So rich folks coffins outfitted breathing
tubes. Little tubes running mud
woke weren't supposed to, wouldn't run
oxygen. Now, tested realized
shout hoarse tube, narrow
carry noise. Not attract attention, least. So
string run tube little bell attached headstone.
If dead person came life, ring
little bell till came dug again.
I'm laughing now, picturing bus maybe fast-food
restaurant, reaching pocket finding little bell
wondering came from, it. Maybe
you'll ring it.
Happy birthday, buddy.
I don't know figured solution mutual problem, I
don't know congratulate me. A bit lifestyle
change, admittedly, elegant solution, nonetheless.
Look answer.
That sounds like Hallmark card. I don't know
thought up, hat's you. Not know
hell I'm talking about. But, honestly, real brainstorm. After all,
everybody needs mirrors remind are. You're
different.

THE LITTLE MECHANICAL VOICE PAUSES, repeats itself. It says, "The
time 8:00 a.m. This courtesy call." Earl opens eyes
replaces receiver. The phone perched cheap veneer
headboard stretches bed, curves meet corner,
ends minibar. The TV on, blobs flesh color
nattering away other. Earl lies surprised
himself, older now, tanned, hair pulling away head
like solar flares. The mirror ceiling cracked, silver
fading increases. Earl continues stare himself, astonished
sees. He fully dressed, clothes old, threadbare
places.
Earl feels familiar spot left wrist watch, it's
gone. He looks mirror arm. It bare
skin changed tan, owned watch
place. The skin color solid black
arrow inside Earl's wrist, pointing shirtsleeve. He
stares arrow moment. Perhaps doesn't try rub
anymore. He rolls sleeve.
The arrow points sentence tattooed Earl's inner arm. Earl
reads sentence once, maybe twice. Another arrow picks
beginning sentence, points farther Earl's arm, disappearing
rolled-up shirtsleeve. He unbuttons shirt.
Looking chest, shapes bring
focus, looks mirror him.
The arrow leads Earl's arm, crosses shoulder, descends
upper torso, terminating picture man's face
occupies chest. The face large man, balding,
mustache goatee. It particular face, like
police sketch certain unreal quality.
The rest upper torso covered words, phrases, bits
information, instructions, written backward Earl,
forward mirror.
EventuallyEarl sits up, buttons shirt, crosses desk. He takes
pen piece notepaper desk drawer, sits, begins
write.
***
I don't know you'll read this. I'm sure
you'll bother read this. I guess don't need to.
It's shame, really, I meet. But, like
song says, "By time read note, I'll gone."
We're close now. That's way feels. So pieces
together, spelled out. I guess it's matter time
him.
Who knows we've here? Must hell story,
remember it. I guess it's better can't.
I thought now. Maybe you'll useful.
Everybody waiting end come,
passed by? What final joke Judgment Day
come gone wiser? Apocalypse arrives
quietly; chosen herded heaven, rest us,
ones failed test, going, oblivious. Dead
already, wandering long gods stopped keeping
score, optimistic future.
I guess that's true, doesn't matter do. No
expectations. If can't him, doesn't matter,
matters. And him, kill
worrying consequences. Because consequences.
That's I'm thinking right now, scrappy little room.
Framed pictures ships wall. I don't know, obviously,
I guess, I'd we're coast. If you're
wondering left arm shades browner right, I
don't know tell you. I guess driving
while. And, no, I don't know happened watch.
And keys: I idea. Not I recognize. Car
keys house keys little fiddly keys padlocks. What
to?
I wonder he'll feel stupid him. Tracked
ten-minute man. Assassinated vegetable.
I'll gone moment. I'll pen, close eyes,
read want.
I wanted know I'm proud you. No matters
left it. No left going want to.
EARL'S EYES ARE WIDE OPEN, staring window car.
Smiling eyes. Smiling window crowd gathering
street. The crowd gathering body doorway. The
body emptying slowly sidewalk storm drain.
***
A stocky guy, facedown, eyes open. Balding head, goatee. In death,
police sketches, faces tend look same. This definitely
somebody particular. But really, anybody.
Earl smiling body car pulls away curb.
The car? Who's say? Maybe it's police cruiser. Maybe it's
taxi.
As car swallowed traffic, Earl's eyes continue shine
night, watching body disappears
circle concerned pedestrians. He chuckles car
continues distance growing crowd.
Earl's smile fades little. Something occurred him. He begins
pat pockets; leisurely first, like man looking
keys, little desperately. Maybe progress
impeded set handcuffs. He begins contents
pockets seat him. Some money. A bunch keys.
Scraps paper.
A round metal lump rolls pocket slides vinyl
seat. Earl frantic now. He hammers plastic divider
driver, begging man pen. Perhaps cabbie
doesn't speak English. Perhaps cop isn't habit
talking suspects. Either way, divider man
man remains closed. A pen forthcoming.
The car hits pothole, Earl blinks reflection
rearview mirror. He calm now. The driver makes corner,
metal lump slides rest Earl's leg
little jingle. He picks looks it, curious now. It
little bell. A little metal bell. Inscribed
set dates. He recognizes one: year
born. But second date means him. Nothing all.
As turns bell hands, notices space
wrist watch sit. There little arrow there,
pointing arm. Earl looks arrow, begins roll
sleeve.

"You'd late funeral," she'd say. Remember? The I
think it, trite seems. What kind idiot,
all, kind rush end story?
And I know I late, anyway? I don't watch
anymore. I don't know it.
What hell need watch for, anyway? It antique.
Deadweight tugging wrist. Symbol old you. The
believed time.
No. Scratch that. It's you've lost faith time
time lost faith you. And needs it, anyway? Who
wants saps living safety future,
safety moment moment felt
powerful? Living moment, feel nothing.
Crawling hands clock, away people
unspeakable things them. Believing lie time heal
wounds-which nice way saying time deadens us.
But you're different. You're perfect. Time things
people, you, us, one. A singularity. One moment.
This moment. Like you're center clock, axis
hands turn. Time moves moves you. It lost
ability affect you. What say? That time theft?
But you. Close eyes start again.
Conjure necessary emotion, fresh roses.
Time absurdity. An abstraction. The thing matters
moment. This moment million times over. You trust me.
If moment repeated enough, trying-and
trying-eventually come item
list.
End.
