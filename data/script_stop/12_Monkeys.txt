But don't buy lot stuff,
know what? You're mentally ill! That's
fact! If don't buy things...toilet
paper, new cars, computerized blenders,
electrically operated sexual devices...
(getting hysterical)
SCREWDRIVERS WITH MINIATURE BUILT-IN
RADAR DEVICES, STEREO SYSTEMS WITH
BRAIN IMPLANTED HEADPHONES, VOICE-
ACTIVATED COMPUTERS, AND...
A woman orderly, TERRY, turns feeble PATIENT she's helping.
TERRY
Take easy, Jeffrey. Be calm.
Abruptly, JEFFREY stifles hysteria, takes deep breath
continues, completely calm now. But COLE isn't listening. He's
mesmerized TV.
JEFFREY
So want watch particular
program, "All My Children"
something, Charge Nurse
tell day time
want on. But
tell scheduled

This thought actually penetrates COLE'S focus TV
turns JEFFREY who's picking speed again.
JEFFREY
Seriously, people
defined mentally ill. Why?
Because they're consuming
own. But patients, becone
consumers mental health care. And
gives so-called sane people work!
(hysteria again)
WHOOO! SHOCK THERAPY! GROUP THERAPY!
HALLUCINATIONS! THERAPEUTIC DRUGS!
IGGIDY DIGGIDY DIG! PERFECT! THE
SYSTEM IN HARMONY LIKE A BIG MACHINE...
TERRY
Okay, that's it, Jeffrey, you're gonna
shot. I warned you...
JEFFREY
(calming himself, smiling)
Right! Right! Carried away, heh heh.
I got "carried away". Explaining
workings of...the institution.
Just then, TJ WASHINGTON, somber-looking African American
bathrobe, taps COLE shoulder.
TJ WASHINGTON
I don't come outer space.
JEFFREY
This TJ Washington, Jim --
doesn't come outer space.
TJ WASHINGTON
Don't mock me, friend.
(to Cole)
It's condition "mental divergence".
I planet, Ogo,
intellectual elite, preparing
subjugate barbarian hordes Pluto.
But it's totally convincing
reality way...I feel, breathe,
hear...nevertheless, Ogo actually
construct psyche. I mentally
divergent I escaping certain
unnamed realities plague life
here. When I stop going there, I
well. Are divergent, friend?
The P.A. SYSTEM interrupts, startling COLE.
P.A. SYSTEM (v.o.)
James Cole. Report Staff. James Cole!
JEFFREY
Staff! Whoo! Time Staff. Now
geniuses cure you. Hallelujah!
INT. PSYCH WARD CONFERENCE ROOM - MINUTES LATER (DAY)
COLE agitated, speaking forcefully.
COLE
This place crazy people! I'm
crazy!
RAILLY, PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENTS, including RAILLY'S best
friend, MARILOU MARTIN, chief, DR. OWEN FLETCHER, sit
beat-up conference table, watching COLE, sits facing
doctors, BILLINGS looming him. (Some DOCTORS
bear strong resemblance SCIENTISTS OF THE FUTURE.)
RESIDENT #1
We don't use term..."crazy", Mr. Cole.
COLE
Well, you've got real nuts here!
Listen me, -- I
tell that's going
difficult understand, but...
DR. RAILLY
James...please. These doctors
want help you.
DR. FLETCHER
Mr. Cole -- night told Dr.
Railly thought was...
(checking file)
1995. ... How right now? Do
know year right now?
COLE
1989. Look, I'm confused. There's
mistake, I've sent wrong place.
Suddenly, COLE reaches BILLINGS lunges forward, COLE
grabbing pad pencil.
COLE
Hey, I'm going hurt anybody.
FLETCHER restrains BILLINGS hand signal.
COLE
(drawing)
Do know
Army Twelve Monkeys? They paint
this, stencil it, buildings,
place.
COLE waves sketch dancing monkey logo saw earlier.
DR. CASEY
Mr. Cole...
COLE
Right. I guess wouldn't,
1989, they're probably active yet.
That makes sense! Okay. Listen me,
billion people died 1995.
Three billion, got that? Almost
population. Of world!
Only percent survived.
DOCTORS exchange knowing looks. This old story, apparently.
RESIDENT #2
Are going save us, Mr. Cole?
COLE
Save you? How I save you? It
happened! I can't save you. I'm
simply trying information
people present someday...
(sees eyes)
You don't believe me. You think I'm
crazy. But I'm crazy. I'm convict,
sure, I quick temper, I'm
sane room. I...
COLE stops, sees DR. FLETCHER tapping pencil. COLE'S seen
tapping -- future! It disorients him.
DR. RAILLY
Can tell prison
you've come from?
COLE doesn't answer. He's staring tapping pencil.
DR. FLETCHER
Does bother you, Mr. Cole?
COLE
(recovering, new tack)
No! Look, I don't belong here! What I
need telephone
straighten out.
DR. FLETCHER
Who call, Mr. Cole,
straighten out?
COLE
Scientists. I'm supposed report
them. They'll want know
sent wrong time.
DR. FLETCHER
So talk scientists
what? Send future?
COLE
No, no. I can't talk them. It's called,
"voice mail". I'm supposed leave messages.
They monitor present.
RESIDENT #2
"From present." We're
present now, Mr. Cole?
COLE
No, no. This past. This
happened. Listen...
RESIDENT #3
Mr. Cole, belong 1995 -- that's
present, it?
COLE
No, 1995 past, too. Look...
DR. FLETCHER
These scientists, Mr. Cole? Are
doctors like ourselves?
Two residents exchange quick knowing looks.
COLE
No! I mean yes, but... Look, I've given
lot drugs I'm perfectly lucid.
You let use phone. One call!
COLE looks desperately RAILLY, pleading eyes meeting hers.

joke? I don't know scientists.
James who? Never heard you!
The MOTHER slams phone.
INT. RAILLY'S OFFICE/COUNTY HOSPITAL - DAY
A dismayed COLE receiver hand. Sympathetically,
RAILLY takes him.
RAILLY
It wasn't expected?
COLE clearly agitated, starts pace, upset. Nuts?
COLE
It lady. She didn't know anything.
RAILLY
Perhaps wrong number...
COLE
No. That's reason chose --
I remember things.
RAILLY frowns, studying distracted man intense interest.
It's clear COLE special patient RAILLY'S cool,
detached demeanor giving way slightly.
RAILLY
James, grow up? Was

COLE
(lost thought)
What?
RAILLY

Were ever...?
COLE
Wait! This 1989! I'm supposed

problem. Damn! How I contact them?
RAILLY recovers distance, poise, takes bottle,

sell disinfectants soap!"
Now, he's crazy, right? Hey,
believe germs, don't you?
COLE
I'm crazy.
JEFFREY
Of course not, I thought were.
You want escape, right? That's

don't you? Get out?
COLE
If know escape, don't you...?
JEFFREY
Why don't I escape, that's
going ask me, right? 'Cause
I'd crazy escape! I'm taken
