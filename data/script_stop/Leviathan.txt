FACE IN ON
THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN
sunny placid slowly WE BEGIN DESCENDING UNDERWATER
Moving bright surface waters, layers
fish marine life...
A school vibrantly colored fish current,
numbers enormous, movements unison.
Suddenly darkness barracuda cuts
school, taking disappearing
shadows. The school moves happened,
quickly closing ranks missing ones swam
seconds before.
WE MOVE DEEPER AND DEEPER
Fish disappear, darkness envelopes us. Cold lifeless
light penetrated...Five thousand feet,
thousand. Deeper, strange, self-illuminating
echoniderms eerily currents. Then suddenly
WE HEAR STATIC RADIO TRANSMISSION. THEN VOICES...
