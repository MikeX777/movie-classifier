The woman stops CLEARING. She POINTING ahead. The villagers
SURROUND her. They STARE ahead, direction woman
points. Nearly mile distance, WE SEE
AN ANCIENT SCOTTISH CASTLE.
An enormous, 16th CENTURY stone structure. Tall, forboding towers,
lined menacing GARGOYLES, pierce night sky. The castle
appears DESERTED. Its interior completely DARK, save small,
flickering CANDLELIGHT. It burns castle's UPSTAIRS WINDOW.
