Alien Resurrection
EXT. DEEP SPACE SILENT BLACK.
We sweep slowly endless tapestry stars. Finally comes
view:
U.S.S. AURIGA. A massive research vessel sits majestically
Pluto's orbit.
We TRACK ALONG ship,
INT. AURIGA
silent, corridors, coming door
guards standing rigid it. Full armour, powerful
shockrifles, expressions cold.
INT. MEDLAB
Along row screens, signs life readouts,
lights, data -- shifting collating blinking screens.
As ALONG them, figure-in labcoat passes frame,
another,leading lab settle looks like
Cryogenic tube, big human.
Still TRACKING it, glimpse inside vague, fetal mass
encased clear, aspic-like gel.
Tubes cables attached mass, running machine.
As CIRCLE, shape begins coherent, till

Eyes, shut tight. Sleeping. Dreaming.
ANGLE: WHEAT.
A birds eyes view field, soft golden waves filling screen.
Sharp contrast seen before.
There woman wandering field. Beside girl, seven

The girl stops, looks her. The wheat comes

She looks woman woman
yards away.
The girl's expression perplexed.
She slaps bug neck. Pulls HUGE,
wriggling fleshily hand. Her expression
distraught, muster forth shout.
The sound insects-fills air. Another bug lands her, another.
She looks growing horror sees:
Blood. At feet, rising, filling field, rising wheat,
sea blood now, dark, thick.
The girl tries scream, raises arms. She completely
covered insects, skittering black shroud them,
finally SCREAM flood mouth.
CUT TO:

Pulls apart chest.

He deposits test beaker, studies eyes.
Wren enters, looking chart.
WREN
How's number Eight today?
GEDIMAN:

WREN
(noticing tone)
How good?
GEDIMAN
Extraordinary. As in, completely projected charts.

GEDIMAN:
But thing is, can't terminate her. It.
PEREZ
You haven't told think caused this.
Cloned genes don't contain memory cells, they're brought
adult term. I'm right?
GEDIMAN
There's cases..
PEREZ
Not like this.
WREN
Well, don't nearly data... cases
collective memory passed generationally. At genetic level. Like
instinct, complex structurally.
PEREZ
In cases. You're talking alien.
WREN
Yes.
PEREZ
You promised wasn't going crossing.
WREN
It's like ones..
Perez punches code, puts hand scanner second

PEREZ
But genetic mix.
WREN
Yes.
PEREZ

GEDIMAN
Mutation isn't exactly... I don't think so.
WREN
That's things need study.
PEREZ
All right. You it. But secure, obsorvation,
God's sake away here. I don't want surprises.
And speaks ALIEN RISES RIGHT BEHIND HIM -- it's big,
ridges head indicating young queen -- hisses LUNGES
