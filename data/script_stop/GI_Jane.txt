Jordan picks pace. Where hell room?
On levels building, men shadow

INT. MESS HALL - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
Dead-ass tired, Jordan slides tray line,
piling food means raw calories.
She heads for...
A table trainees, spot open. Seeing coming,
guys shift position. Suddenly table full.
ENGLAND
Better look elsewhere, O'Neil.
Jordan glares. None meet eyes. She wheels
-- eyes her, watching ass
walk away. FEATURE Slutnik, walking sperm bank.
SLUTNIK
Half night, Lord, gimme half
night set straight...
Jordan tries table. This one, too,
abruptly full. As Jordan leaves, HOLD Miller. He's
human eclipse -- six-three, 220, perfect commando
physique. Instructors wish clone him.
MILLER
Average woman 25 percent body
fat. That's one-quarter fat, man.
Think that.
MCCOOL
Nice distribution, though.
MILLER
No way makes program.
No way.
After wandering mess hall like homeless person,
Jordan finds refuge table female mess stewards.
They look blank faces. No understanding. No
compassion.
EXT. B.O.Q. - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
Jordan walks bathrobe, toweling hair dry. She
fishes keys door.
VOICE
It's hate

Jordan looks. Someone sitting outdoor table,
smoking. He leans light face.
It's Wickwire, mid-30s lieutenant doubles class
officer. He's dangerously handsome.
WICKWIRE
They're afraid you.
JORDAN
Well, I feel better.
WICKWIRE
It clear came --
harassment equals career suicide.
Can't good,
don't all. To
face, anyway.
JORDAN
Whose orders those?
WICKWIRE
It clear.
(getting up)
Anyway, stay ballsy. First week's
hell, levels out. Until

JORDAN
And know that?
WICKWIRE
Made Week 10 time.
JORDAN

Back no-man's land.
INT. JORDAN'S B.O.Q. - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
Two beds. Matching lockers. A desk, chair, mirror.

His balls took brunt.
Jordan WHUMPS legs astraddle --
shoots Cortez "Hey, problem" look. She rolls
poles...
And drops pit below. Cortez lands right behind.
Now it's flat-out sprint for...
The finish line. He takes tape.

Remembering time tried this, Jordan gets
death-grip Chief's vest.
THE CHIEF

O'Neil...
JORDAN
Shut up, sir. I'm concentrating.
The recovery loop comes like big brass ring.
SEAFOX THUNDERS past. Jordan plunges free arm
