DUKE records like A WAR CORRESPONDENT. The CAMERA slowly
rises -- DUKE room TV SPEWING OUT
IMAGES OF WARS AND CIVIL UNREST OF THE 90'S.
DUKE

helped create...
RISING HIGHER -- THE WALLS OF THE ROOM APPEAR TO BY 20 TO 30
FEET HIGH. DUKE SEEMS TO BE AT THE BOTTOM OF A WELL... THE
CAMERA RISES UP THROUGH BROKEN TIMBERS...
DUKE

HIGHER STILL -- DUKE ALONE IN THE ROOM -- AN ISOLATED BOX
SURROUNDED BY THE TWISTED METAL AND RUBBLE AND SMASHED NEON
SIGNS OF THE DEAD CITY -- A BLASTED LANDSCAPE WITHOUT
LIGHT -- SHARDS OF A CIVILIZATION.

DUKE

DUKE PULLS OFF THE ROAD parks. Gets walks in.
INT. HARDWARE BARN - BAKER, CALIFORNIA - DAY
DUKE enters DARK, CLUTTERED INTERIOR. Scattered
store BITS OF AMERICANA... OLD BARRELS, WAGON
WHEELS, WOODEN YOKES. A STUFFED HORSE HANGS FROM THE
RAFTERS. The sunlight shafts high windows. AN OLD
MAN repairing iron pot-bellied stove near wooden
bar. A NORMAN ROCKWELL PAINTING... ONLY REAL.
PROPRIETOR
What'll have?
DUKE can't believe place -- good true.
DUKE
(doubtfully)
Ballantine Ale...?
THE PROPRIETOR serves ale ice cold. DUKE SMILES AND
RELAXES.
DUKE
Hard served like

As drinks, DUKE toys rack key chains -- LITTLE
AMERICAN ICONS... A REMINGTON COWBOY, A BUGS BUNNY, A TWEETY

reads: AMERICAN DREAM KEY RINGS.

PROPRIETOR

PROPRIETOR
A great town, Vegas. I bet

DUKE

PROPRIETOR
(trustingly)
That's fine combination. You
can't lose.
A LOVELY GIRL appears. Seeing DUKE, smiles. CAN THIS
REALLY BE HIS LUCKY DAY? She approaches him... and...
KISSES THE PROPRIETOR.
DUKE
(caught guard... muttering)
Oh, God!...
PROPRIETOR
(not understanding)
This granddaughter...
DUKE
(recovering)
Don't worry...
(leans forward confidence)
... I'm actually District
Attorney Ignoto County.
(winks)
Just good American like
yourself.
A MOMENT. THE PROPRIETOR'S SMILE DISAPPEARS.
Wordlessly PROPRIETOR GRANDDAUGHTER
store -- GET ON WITH THEIR WORK -- IGNORING DUKE.
WHO FEELS ASHAMED.
DUKE puts money bar SLOWLY LEAVES.
EXT. HARDWARE BARN - DAY
A CHASTENED DUKE approaches vomit streaked WHITE WHALE.
Gets -- sits -- deflated -- miserable...
110.
A state bus draws Hardware Barn.
Somberly, DUKE watches TWO YOUNG MARINES duffel bags
step -- chatting like TRUE BROTHERS...
DUKE switches ignition. Something rolls
trembling dash... DUKE catches it...
ONE SINGLE BEAUTIFUL AMYL CAPSULE...
DUKE CRACKS THE AMYL -- INHALES. THE RUSH MAKES HIM GASP --
TEETH BARED LIKE A MADMAN.
DUKE
HOLY SHIT!!!
DUKE GUNS THE ENGINE laugh -- leans -- YELLS AT
THE MARINES.
DUKE
GOD'S MERCY ON YOU SWINE!
DUKE ROARS AWAY. AN AMERICAN FLAG FLIES UP FROM THE DEBRIS
IN THE BACK SEAT, MADLY UNFURLING ITSELF AS IT SNAGS ON THE
CONVERTIBLE-TOP FRAME OF THE TRASHED WHITE WHALE!
AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
The TWO MARINES look CONFUSED.
EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY
DUKE drives fast -- TEETH GRITTED IN FROZEN ECSTASY!!
DUKE CRANKS UP THE TAPE RECORDER.
DUKE (V/O)
My heart filled joy. I
felt like monster reincarnation
Horatio Alger... man
