Mohican SPIDER pushes aside branches giant oleander
peers through.
77 EXT. ENTRANCE TWO - EVENING
There's A HATCHWAY sight built A CONCRETE, BUNKER LIKE
STRUCTURE. FOUR OR FIVE SOLDIERS coming ground.
They're armed PRODS AND RIFLES.
Behind men, lurching unsteady feet, come A HALF-DOZEN OF THE

SAMSON nibbling ANOTHER HEAD. Much flesh

JULIE backs away, fighting nausea. A spasm rises MARY'S stomach
reels away hideous sight.
RHODES
Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen

MARY
God....damn you, Rhodes!
RHODES
God damned all. Are atrocities
worse yours?
MARY
You ruined weeks work here! We've

RHODES
No wonder they're so....hungry.
Suddenly JULIE SCREAMS, hands flying mouth.
THE PLASTIC BAG dangling RHODES' GLOVED HAND. Inside,
pressed plastic, rough outline THE
FINAL HEAD. THE THING IS SQUIRMING causing bag wiggle.
RHODES drops bag instantly floor. Taking care, grabs
loose corner pulls hard. THE HEAD ROLLS OUT
AND SETTLES AGAINST A WALL. IT'S EYES ARE OPEN AND DARTING CRAZILY,
ITS MOUTH IS CHEWING, GROTESQUELY, ON THE AIR.
MARY stares shock. JULIE runs exit, trying scream

RHODES
Any dead brains intact

JULIE
But...we bury heads. Oh. God! It

RHODES
They brutes feeling. Though I

RHODES

Not I'm it!
JULIE calmed down. Now feels angry, betrayed. She
looks MARY accusingly.
JULIE
Did know? About de-caps?
MARY
I'd seen before.
JULIE
But knew.
MARY nods affirmative. Tears form JULIE'S eyes.
JULIE
