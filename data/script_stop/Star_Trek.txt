water runs face body.
TIGHT ON MIDWIFE (female, 60's) holds cleans
baby CRIES. Another, younger, Midwife seen

baby, says OFF-CAMERA:
MIDWIFE
He strong.
The baby, calm, gets SWADDLED. He gently held
new MOTHER:
AMANDA GRAYSON, late 20's. An original beauty. She lies
divan, spent eager hold child. She tenderly
takes infant arms, tears eyes, mesmerized.
She holds wrapped baby tight whispers sweetly:
AMANDA

CLOSE ON YOUNGER MIDWIFE, standing rear room.
She raises eyebrow quietly speaks:
YOUNGER MIDWIFE

Your tone suggests disappointment. The
Science Council required presence

AMANDA
Don't that. You knew I wanted

And free hand, pulls Sarek closer -- kisses
him. And look baby.

society-builders. His "Spock".
She looks baby, immediately taken name.
SAREK (CONT'D)
Your silence suggest enormous
enthusiasm.
AMANDA
No... Spock.
(smiles, touches
face)
... Spock.
She looks Sarek: Spock is.
SAREK
The child eyes.
She pulls baby's swaddling, revealing ears. She
gently rubs right ear -- AND IT UNFURLS,
revealing small, soft pointed VULCAN EAR.
AMANDA

And image TINY BABY, half-human, half-Vulcan,
